Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, Vice President of Planning and Investor Relations. 
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our website. 
If you turn to Slide 2, we begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described on this page, and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. 
Next slide. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation on our website. 
For the fourth quarter the difference between our GAAP and adjusted results consists of 3 items: First, we completed the divestiture of ABEL Pumps during the fourth quarter, resulting in a pretax gain of $70.9 million. This was partially offset by an impairment charge of $9.5 million relating to an imaging investment we made in 2007; second, a $4 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue relating to software acquisitions made in 2015. This represents revenue that those companies would have recognized if not for our acquisition. Finally, we have a $2.6 million inventory step up expense relating to the acquisition of RF IDeas. 
Now if you please turn to Slide 4, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. And after his remarks, we will take questions from our telephone systems. Brian?"

So we'll start off here with our Q4 results. They were flat to last year, we'll talk a little bit about that, at $948 million. It's exactly the same number as last year but with lots of activity to get you there.",3991,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. So we'll start off here with our Q4 results. They were flat to last year, we'll talk a little bit about that, at $948 million. It's exactly the same number as last year but with lots of activity to get you there. We had another 2 points of FX headwind in the quarter and then the acquisitions net of the ABEL divestiture offset the organic shortfall in energy primarily. 
The Industrial and Energy markets declined in the fourth quarter and really had less seasonal adjustment favorable in the fourth quarter than normally, and we'll talk about that when we get to that segment. But we have very strong growth in Medical and the RF segments. Our gross margins continue to escalate. They were up 190 basis points in the quarter to 61.8%. 
Our EBITDA margin also hit 35.9%, that's the EBITDA margin, not the gross margin. And EBITDA was up another 2% to $341 million, which is sort of an annualized run rate of $1.364 billion. 
Our free cash flow was up to $261 million, and it's 140% cash conversion. And we also issued 5- and 10-year bond, which totaled $900 million in the month of December, and deployed over $700 million in a quarter in some very attractive acquisitions, so we enjoyed good acquisition in the quarter and terrific discipline capital deployment. 
Next slide. If we look at the income statement in the quarter, you can see that, while the orders and the revenue were exactly the same as the year ago, no 2 businesses would have been the same. So this was a case of watching the ducks on the pond with a whole lot of paddling going on underneath it. 
The book-to-bill at 0.98 is actually pretty good for the fourth quarter. Just to give you some sense of history in 2011, our book-to-bill in the fourth quarter was 0.94. In '12, it was 0.95 and in '13, it was flat 1 or by 1. In '14, it was 0.98; and this year, it's 0.98. So from a historical perspective, it's about what we would expect to see. 
Our gross profit as we said was up from 59.9% to 61.8% and operating income, the margin was 30.1 and that absorbed 70 basis points of higher noncash amortization as acquisitions came in. 
The interest expense was up $5 million due the bond issuance, so a little bit more drawn at the revolver during the quarter. 
Net earnings were down 1% from $187 to $186, which you can see from the interest. 
Next slide. Here, we shift into the full year enterprise results. 
So next slide. On the enterprise results, the whole point of the year really was our ability to demonstrate nimble execution in the field and then deploy capital in really a tough acquisition market with great transactions. 
So if you look at records, everything, once again, was a record. We had the most orders, the highest revenue, the best margins, the highest net earnings, and best EBITDA and cash flow of any year in our history. The growth was led by Medical and RF. We had continued margin improvement throughout the year. The gross margin was up 140 basis points on a year to 60.7% and the operating margin was up 80 basis points to 29% offering profit margin and of course, EBITDA was higher. 
A very strong cash flow. We were up 11% in cash flow for the year, and that was 26% of the revenue. Our free cash flow was also up 11% and our cash conversion on a free cash flow basis was 132%. 
We deployed $1.8 billion in acquisitions in 2015, with almost entirely a focus on software and medical technologies. 
All of our acquisitions are really very high-margin businesses. They're all asset light, they're very specific leaders in niche markets, and they have high recurring revenue and strong management teams at each one of these companies that we acquire. 
And our recent acquisitions have been growing in excess of 10% a year, which gives us, as they become organic acquisitions, have benefit to our organic growth. 
Next slide. If we look at this bridge, we put together, I think, really help people understand about the performance and the forward nature of what we'll do in 2016. If you look at the base revenue in 2015, it was $3.552 billion, and it ended the year at $3.593 billion, but that's not the story being up 1%. The story is that we had organic growth in our RF segment, we had organic growth in Medical, we had substantial acquisitions even though we divested ABEL, which is $20-plus million revenue business. 
So those 3 components added 7% to our trailing revenue number last year. But we had a 3% currency headwind almost all of which was in the energy and industrial segments. 
That 3% brought the number down and then we had $35 million of negative organic growth in industrial almost all of which was in Roper and FTI, which re upstream fluid handling businesses. 
And then we had $72 million negative organic in Energy, the vast majority of which was again upstream. 
Although in the fourth quarter, we didn't get the seasonal push that we normally would get, so we had a little bit of a fall off in the fourth quarter in the mid-and downstream business. So about 2.5% of the 3% negative organic in Industrial and Energy was related directly to oil and gas. Also something that gets skewed a bit by the numbers is our organic growth in the first quarter of '15 was 6%, excluding oil and gas. And we actually grew 2% in the second, third and fourth quarter, excluding oil and gas, so those headwinds that we've had to contend with in 2015 around oil and gas markets will be dramatically smaller in '16 than they were this year, although they're still some real challenges. And the currency isn't going to be $104 million, it will be probably 80% less than that negative number. 
Next slide. If we look at the outstanding margin, you can see on the left-hand side the gross margins in 2013, we were 58.6%, and those raised 70 basis points in '14 and then raised twice that 140 basis points this year to 60.7%.  
And our EBITDA margins in 2013 were 32.8%, they were raised 100 basis points in '14 to 33.8% and another 80 basis points this year to 34.6%. 
So the continued margin expansion just comes really from a focus on our asset-light businesses being able to reinvest for growth in themselves, and we had to reach leverage throughout the enterprise as a result. 
Next slide. We get to really what's the core of our entire business model is compounding our cash flow. And this compounding, you can see continues to be outstanding in a year where we really only have 1% revenue growth. Our free cash flow was up 11%. Our free cash flow at 9/29 is up $89 million from the $840 million. So we had a great quarter in the fourth quarter with $269 million of cash what we had a terrific year with $893 million and cash in our view is still the best measure performance. 
If you look at our cash guidance, you'll see our cash guidance tells a different story than the EPS guidance. 
Next slide. If you look at the financial position of the company, here, you can see cash at the end of this past year closed out at $779 million, up from $610 million the year before and up from $460 million in 2013. 
Now we've deployed almost 1/3 of that here in January to close the CliniSys acquisition, which is a little bit over $250 million, and that happened in the month of January. 
We also upsized our revolver. Our revolver used to be $1.5 billion. Our revolver is now $1.850 billion, and you can see on our undrawn revolver, we have $1.670 billion. So between cash and undrawn revolver, there's about $2.5 billion of powder there. 
Our trailing 12 months EBITDA at 1 50, of course, will be -- that's not a performing number, it will continue to get bigger as the year goes on. But even at $1.245 billion, our net debt-to-EBITDA is only 2. At the end of '13, it was $1.9 billion, so we've done over a couple of billion of acquisitions. Only have net debt for about $500 million, so we still have a great deal of ample liquidity to do anything we want to do in the acquisition front in 2016. 
Next slide. Here, we'll start to look at the specific segment detail and outlook. 
Next slide. If we look at the 4 segments, the Energy segment, the Industrial, the RF and the Medical segment, you'll see that they all our performing phenomenally from an EBITDA and gross margin basis. So even though you have a year where energy and industrial together came in at $1.333 billion, which was down 12% from the prior year's $1.519 billion, they still delivered 31% EBITDA margins in both years and both were over 50% of gross margins. 
In our RF and Medical space, those guys were up 11% from $2 billion, roughly to $2.260 billion. And of course, they have even stronger margins with 36% EBITDA for RF and 45% EBITDA for Medical. 
In the Medical and RF businesses they're now already 70% of our total EBITDA and even though all the segments have extraordinary margins. 
Next slide. So we'll start first with medical, which is our largest segment. And here you can see in the quarter, we have organic revenue of plus 3, acquisitions of plus 12% and foreign exchange, a negative 3%. Both SHP and IPA, acquisitions from '14, finally went to organic, and they delivered double-digit growth for us in this quarter. 
We had very strong sales out of Verathon nearly double digits with new product launches that we have talked about earlier in the year continuing to gain traction. 
And our Northern Digital business had an outstanding year, we're up more than 10% with very strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter. 
Atlas Medical, which is a small acquisition that we bolted into Sunquest again in the fourth quarter, its integration activity is doing well, and we expect that to contribute in 2016. 
MHA, we should comment on we completed all-time record year. It's compounding their growth and everything going well in that arena. 
In 2016, the way we see the year unfolding is that we'll continue to be nimble and I would say our operating leverage for the full year in Medical was 50%. So as this grow, they contribute outsized incremental gains for us. 
We think we'll have mid-single digit organic growth in Medical throughout '16, and we think that will get stronger as the year goes on. Sunquest has a number of version changes and software release updates that are rolling out in the second half that will be quite beneficial. And then Strata, Data Innovations and SoftWriters, which are growing rapidly will become organic in the second half. 
Verathon and Northern Digital continue to grow at a relatively higher rate in '16 and then we closed on January 7, the CliniSys acquisition in the U.K, which is a European hospital laboratory software provider. It will add to our acquisition sales growth in 2016. 
Next slide. Here we look at RF Technology. And RF Technology was up in the fourth quarter 4% organically. It had a negative FX of 1 point and acquisitions and divestitures added 15%. So their was up 18%, operating profit that 30% and operating profit margin, 31.1%. 
Software throughout the segment performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter as we returned to pretty good growth at iTrade and double-digit growth at Trade Matching. 
Aderant was acquired in October and is off to a great start with the Aderant team and in fact, some of us are working with them in terms of coordinating some large clients being more secure going in with Aderant in the future as opposed to the fact that they were in private equity in the past. 
Toll and traffic projects are progressing really quite well. Riyadh is doing all right, although the start-ups in traffic in Riyadh tend to be more civil engineering at the beginning before we get all the software revenue but they're still fine. 
In our infinity lanes that we've been rolling out in Florida and Texas are on schedule and contributing substantially. 
We think we'll have mid-single digit organic growth for the year with stronger growth in the second half for RF primarily because TransCore is finally out of at arrangement where we were providing tolling administration in Puerto Rico, and that's been quite a challenge and last half of this past year and we'll be completely out of our business model this year.  So it's a little bit dilutive to our revenue, but it's very much accretive to our sanity as trying to get money out of Puerto Rico. As you know, it's not an easy task. But that will put a drag on revenue in the first 2 quarters, about $10 million each quarter, but that's revenue we're happy to avoid. 
Our operating leverage for this segment by the way, in 2015 was 56%. So here again as we get incremental revenue and again, we expect to have that in 2016, you'll see continued margin enhancement. 
The software businesses we think will grow at kind of mid-single digits, but they do have exceptional margins. It allows to use cash to reinvest in other transactions. 
And then the recent acquisitions that we've had, Aderant, RF IDeas and On Center, are all growing at a pretty strong rate, and they have excellent cash flow performance and eventually, they, too, will become organic. 
Next slide. If we look at Industrial Technology, here, in the fourth quarter, organic revenue was down 8%. It's all pretty much all oil and gas, upstream with our businesses that are related to that. Again, some context about this. In 2014, the oil and gas portion of Industrial Technology was about 12% of revenue. And unlike RF where it's 0 and in Medical, where it's at 0, in Industrial Tech, it was 12%. 14% this year. That dropped to 9% of revenue. And then our forecast for '16 we think it will be down 6%, the revenue in the segment. Almost exclusively upstream activity for surface and water pumping projects. 
We also have the divestiture which came from a circle with ABEL with about in the low of 20 to revenue about contributed nothing in the fourth quarter this year. Of course, it will be out over the next year. 
Neptune grew really quite well, double-digit growth in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. The Toronto project was still there, it's a headwind as we pulled you last year it's, close to $10 million a quarter, but it finally sense that in the first quarter of next year. So Neptune's growth in 2016 will be outsized compared to the way it has looked with the Toronto headwind in the past. 
We're forecasting continuing declines really in the upstream oil and gas. It was off about 30% for 2015. We think it will be off another 30% in 2016. But of course, it gets to be down to the smaller number, so it's about a $20 million headwind for the segment going into 2016. 
And the rest of the business will grow at kind of low single digit numbers, maybe a little bit better than t. 
So if we go to the next slide. Oh I should to say that energy leverage in industrial for the year, it delevered at 40%. So with gross margins above 50 and delevering at 40%, we think that's a pretty good performance. 
Next slide. On Energy Systems & Controls, they had continued falloff as one would expect particularly in the upstream arena. Their operating leverage for 2015 though was really quite good at negative 39% and their gross margins are 58%. So I think everybody performed quite nimbly, although in the fourth quarter, Compressor Controls started to see really deep dive on their project work and haven't really structured around that yet, and that activity will happen here in the first quarter. So they contributed terrifically over the last several years, but are to have to pay a major a decline in project work that's not going to reoccur for some long period of time. 
Now in the quarter, organic growth then was off you could see 17%, FX by 4%. Our seasonal improvement actually did occur sort of as we forecasted just not quite as much. We were up 9% seasonally in the fourth quarter in energy, but normally, we're up kind of 17% to 20% and occasionally, 25% in the fourth quarter. So we had thought will be up maybe 15% in the fourth quarter and by only coming up 9% at that kind of pullback of revenue to add in the fourth quarter, which was direct result of seeing a little less revenue that we expected out of them. 
Certainly backlogs are reduced in this segment in the oil and gas project business kind of rapidly deteriorate, although that's not a surprise. 
Unbelievable growth in Zetec as both South Korea, Japan and Middle East are roaring back and in fact, we were up quite dramatically in Zetec, and we think that will lead likely to very strong performance for Zetec in 2016. 
The operating margin, which really speaks to the nimbleness of the operating people we have in these businesses, was still 32.7% even though the segment was down substantially in revenue. 
If we look at the -- what we're talking about here for 2016, you can see sort of high single digit organic decline for the segment. Oil and gas, we think, will be down about 15%, which will be about a $50 million drag on the settlement, so about $20 million out of Industrial, about $50 million out of Energy. The project activity is going to force Compressor Controls to do some aggressive restructuring, and I know that it's a challenge for everybody but there's no question the market requires us to do that. 
And then we think we'll have modest growth in the rest of the areas in the industrial arena. 
Next slide. So here as we get into the 2016 guidance. Next slide. We created another bridge for you here for 2016, see you get a sense of what's really going on in the health of the overall business. 
You can see we finished this past year, at '15, at $3,593 million. We expect revenue to be up between 8% to 10% in 2016, and we think organic revenue will be between 2% and 4% in the coming year or so we'll get mid-single digits organic growth out of RF and mid single digits organic growth out of Medical. We think we'll have low single digit organic growth out of Industrial whereas last year, as you remember, it was a negative number. And then already completed acquisitions net of the ABEL investiture are going to contribute sizable portion of revenue in 2016. We think we'll still have the high single digit organic drop in energy but that's a big improvement over last year's organic drop. And then foreign exchange, which was $104 million last year is probably going to be about an 80% less headwind for us in 2016, so maybe something in the $20 million to $25 million arena and that makes just as we showed you we grew last year at 7% until you hit the oil and gas number. Just easier comps throughout the year for us once we get past the first quarter. 
Next slide. So if we look at the 2016 guidance, you can see for the full year, we're saying operating cash flow we would hope would meet or exceed $1 billion and operating cash flow is going to have just very limited CapEx drag for it to convert of free cash flow this past year. I think our CapEx was $36 million. We wouldn't expected to be at a higher than that this year so certainly less than 1% of revenue, probably quite a bit less than 1% of revenue. 
Free cash flow -- I'm sorry, full year adjusted DEPS, we're saying or $6.85 to $7.15 and the key assumptions around that is we got, for the full year, revenue growth of 8% to 10%; organic growth of 2% to 4%. Comps eased after the first quarter. In the first quarter, we've got a lot of headwinds, we've got revenue drag out of Puerto Rico, we got oil and gas that not really hit us in the first quarter last year, and we had some unique revenue coming out of Roper Pump that will continue. 
We had a little higher gross cost because of bigger draw with the acquisitions, but we also get benefit in earnings. 
But Q1 last year at 6% organic and the last 3 quarters had 2% organic, so we certainly don't expect 6% organic net of oil and gas in the first quarter. 
Our noncash amortization increases by $30 million, so our noncash amortization will be $195 million in 2016. And if you want to use cash earnings, you can add that back to the net earnings number. 
Interest expense is about $25 million higher than last year to $109 million. Our tax rate is going to be somewhat somewhere in this past year in the 30% to 30.5% arena and of course, none of these include any new acquisitions, and we do expect to be pretty active in 2016 and adding additional high-quality businesses. 
In the first quarter, we're going to establish guidance at $1.42 to $1.47 because of those things that we have to face in the first quarter that were not there last year, but we'll get improvement throughout the year on those things, quite dramatic improvement in the second half, which is not based on hope but just a reality of what we know to be the case. 
Next slide. As we look at the 2015 summary and then the outlook for the year, we delivered record annual results orders in revenue, margin and net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow in '15, and that was despite quite the biggest headwind period we have with so must coming from currency and oil and gas. 
Our operating cash flow was up 11%, free cash flow also up 11%. We had terrific margin improvement with gross margins up 140 basis points to 60.7%, EBITDA margins up 80 basis points to 34.6% and free cash flow at $893 million, represented 25% of every dollar of our revenue and 132% cash conversion versus the DEPS number. 
We deployed $1.8 billion in really attractive acquisitions, so we increased our dividend by 20%. 
As we go into this year, we expect to deliver record performance in '16 with that revenue growth we mentioned just the slide before at 8% to 10%, operating cash flow around $1 billion. We think we'll deploy well over $1 billion in acquisitions. It could be easily be higher than that, and we've already closed our first one with CliniSys for about $250 million in January. 
We got a very attractive pipeline, we're looking at transactional and another one on Monday so there's just a great yield activity going on probably, and those that we've ever seen in terms of pipeline. 
We continue to compound cash, increase shareholder value last year, you have a lot of [indiscernible] in 2015 and there's no reason to think we can continue to increase our cash as we look at 2016. 
So with that, John, I think we're ready for questions."

So it's not a huge business, but it has a big, big, big drawback when you have that change. In fact, it's primarily U.S. business. So it's oil and gas component was down 30% in '15 from '14, and we expect it will down another 30% in '16 for '15, but it's still a fairly small number. So it's about a $20 million revenue drag that we're modeling into '16. None of the other businesses in Industrial Technology have anything to do with oil and gas. There instrument companies or -- over half is the Neptune, water pump business, which is going to grow next year. So it's just that one isolated and there's no midstream and downstream activity really in industrial. When you get into energy, much, much bigger total dollars of what you're talking about, about 60% of the segment is oil and gas, but only some of it is upstream, primarily the upstream portion, there are a couple of very small businesses and a little bit of [indiscernible] and then quite a lot of Compressor Controls. So Compressor Controls has been living off of a great project backlog. Their service work, we expect to be a record as you in 2016, but we think there project will drop really dramatically, to drop $30 million, $40 million. And the midstream and downstream activity for the year has been really decent, all the way along. The only drag has been the currency. But been in the fourth quarter, we didn't get as much of a seasonal uptick in those downstream businesses as we normally do, so mostly testing businesses. So that bodes for slight deterioration probably in '16. The rest of the Energy business, the 40%, are really mostly test and measurement kind of businesses and then dropped, really, sharply at Zetec so that's helped offset that's what we're d saying 15% for Energy, but it's 30% for the upstream portion of Industrial."

It's the project work of Compressor Controls this year has really easy to detail that out. So those numbers are pretty good. Last year, we actually said, when we initiated guidance, we thought upstream would be down about 20%. You correctly challenged us about. CapEx was down 30%, it might not be down 30% and we said it could be down more than 20% but we thought we had a particular arrangement around surface drilling, which is new technology, which is rapidly gaining share that was doing that at the time that we thought that would continue in the second quarter. But in the second quarter, they basically stopped all ordering and consumed all inventory it could. That hurt us a little bit. And then in the fourth quarter, we didn't get any seasonal balance, any -- well we did, but not as much as you normally would. So we're very comfortable around guiding down $20 million in oil and gas, and Industrial and around $50 million in Energy, I think that's quite, quite correct. And then there is still be a little bit more drag on a nominal number basis with currency, but it's definitely not pricing.

I noticed on some of the large things that we've looked at, if it's private equity, it is up 1 turn, it's 3 guys going together. But that stables are still out there I mean we're looking at the deal Friday that has a 6.5x debt stable it. So as long as debt stables are that high, we would use it the private equity is going to use that, right? They can put in 4 terms of EBITDA, and you're still 10.5x EBITDA. So that kind of businesses that we acquire, they were public. They tend to trade at 25x at a private EBITDA or more. I know it's hard for people to follow that because they're looking at traditional multi-industry, but multiples that are dramatically less. So we're going to continue to look at these things or great yield from an arbitrage perspective in the public markets versus what we have to pay for them. And those tend to crowd out the lesser quality businesses, where people pay 8, 9, 10x for something that worth a step. And we tend to pay 11 and 12x for something that's worth 25, and that's really how we get all this out for performance consistently over a long pier to time, and that's going to continue. Now last year, we did something that I wouldn't have forecast, which is we did 6 or 7 deals to get to $2 billion. We would have rather down $1.5 billion deal and $500 million, but the small deals were unbelievably compelling and they're all growing double digits. So I mean it was a good thing to do. We are still seeing a lot of those kind of opportunities. So as the year unfolds, it will be battle between sort of saving our powder for really large transactions that were going ahead and investing early on things that are somewhat modest. At the end of the day, for our shareholders, the result is about the same. It's just easier for us to to do a large deal than do small deals.

But I think the most important coming out of it is basically the strategy and the metrics were kind of completely aligned. In other words, you don't stretch for what is perceived as a strategic deal because a strategic deal is 1 which meets the metrics, right? So I guess, only question I have is where do you think there are risks to the CI discipline or maybe businesses you're looking at? Do you think it's maybe an assessment of the code? I know you used a third-party consultancy to kind of look at kind of the related and actual property and software in association with deals and there can be obviously risk there, technological substitution.

And are all kinds of things that are going to happen. They definitely need absorption is a revenue falls off, there's nothing they can do without big restructuring charges. When we get to our space, it's really around whether or not the people in the niche that we acquire have domain expertise, which is very hard for somebody to break into.

We tend to discount their forward growth projections because we don't pay for synergies, for forward growth, we only pay for what we think the business is going to deliver at the time of the acquisition. And that really puts a huge dampening effect on the risk that we might otherwise have. And we've been kind up blessed to be fortunate in that arena. But I think our disciplines are such because we actually start with somebody's balance sheet and then we start with what it takes to run the business. We don't do -- like what a private equity, people do they'll buy a software company and their mandate an immediate 10% reduction. One of the private equity firms out there actually goes and a does a listing of the highest paid people and they lack off the highest paid people and put new college guy in, big salary reductions. And then that kind of tedious activity doesn't manifest itself in a business for 4 or 5 years. So you have to understand what each private equity group's business model is when you're looking at the assets they hold in your acquiring it and I think we can do that better than anybody."

The reason I said sometime ago that the Sunquest, MHA acquisitions were more transformational than Neptune and TransCore transformation. Because at Neptune, we paid 4x EBITDA at the enterprise in December of 2003 to acquire Neptune at what some you probably thought was a high price for $500 million. Next year in 2004, we paid about 4x, again, the trailing revenue of the firm, 3.5% or something for TransCore at $600 million. Well neither one of those businesses have blended themselves to adding exciting bolt-on activities to them or giving you the main experience as an area that was easily widened, all right? So when you acquire a leading laboratory software provider in a world that's going to have more and more laboratory instrument usage and will move to genomics in the immediate future, you have big upside ramp. We have MHA with senior living in nursing homes, all the things around non-acute hospitalization shifts and demography. These things just give you all kinds of opportunity. Well, good heavens, we've acquired now SoftWriters for MHA, which is growing at double digits. That's a terrific acquisition. We've been able to acquire CliniSys, which we can act really with Sunquest, we acquired Data Innovations, which is a phenomenal company, that guides all the instrumentation in a hospital into various systems and yet it's part of Sunquest. So that's why we can look at these things, which are somewhat synergistic at least in the marketplace or in the information technology side of them that we couldn't do with the Industrial and Energy businesses."

Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, Vice President of Planning and Investor Relations. 
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our website. 
If you turn to Slide 2, we begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described on this page, and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.
Next slide. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation on our website.
For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP and adjusted results consists of 3 items: first, we completed the divestiture of ABEL Pumps during the fourth quarter, resulting in a pretax book gain of $70.9 million. This was partially offset by an impairment charge of $9.5 million relating to an imaging investment we made in 2007; second, a $4 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue relating to software acquisitions made in 2015. This represents revenue that those companies would have recognized if not for our acquisition; finally, we have a $2.6 million inventory step-up expense relating to the acquisition of RF IDeas.
Now if you please turn to Slide 4, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. And after his remarks, we will take questions from our telephone systems. Brian?"
22751,321861042,924124,"Roper Technologies, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2016",2016-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Roper Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. So we'll start off here with our Q4 results. They were flat to last year, we'll talk a little bit about that, at $948 million. It's exactly the same number as last year but with lot of activity to get you there. W",4008,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. So we'll start off here with our Q4 results. They were flat to last year, we'll talk a little bit about that, at $948 million. It's exactly the same number as last year but with lot of activity to get you there. We had another 2 points of FX headwind in the quarter and then the acquisitions net of the ABEL divestiture offset the organic shortfall in energy primarily.
The Industrial and Energy markets declined in the fourth quarter and really had less seasonal adjustment favorable in the fourth quarter than normally, and we'll talk about that when we get to that segment. But we have very strong growth in Medical and the RF segments. Our gross margins continued to escalate. They were up 190 basis points in the quarter to 61.8%.
Our EBITDA margin also hit 35.9%, that's the EBITDA margin, not the gross margin. And EBITDA was up another 2% to $341 million, which is sort of an annualized run rate of $1.364 billion.
Our free cash flow was up to $261 million, and it's 140% cash conversion. And we also issued 5- and 10-year bond, which totaled $900 million in the month of December, and deployed over $700 million in a quarter in some very attractive acquisitions, so we enjoyed both good execution in the quarter and terrific disciplined capital deployment.
Next slide. If we look at the income statement in the quarter, you can see that, while the orders and the revenue were exactly the same as the year ago, no 2 businesses would have been the same. So this was a case of watching the ducks on the pond with a whole lot of paddling going on underneath it.
The book-to-bill at 0.98 is actually pretty good for a fourth quarter. Just to give you some sense of history: in 2011, our book-to-bill in the fourth quarter was 0.94; in '12, it was 0.95; and in '13, it was flat 1 or 1; '14, it was 0.98; and this year, it's 0.98. So from a historical perspective, it's about what we would expect to see.
Our gross profit as we said was up from 59.9% to 61.8% and operating income, the margin was 30.1% and that absorbed 70 basis points of higher noncash amortization as acquisitions came in.
The interest expense was up $5 million due the bond issuance, so a little bit more drawn at the revolver during the quarter.
Net earnings were down 1% from $187 to $186, which you could see just from the interest.
Next slide. Here, we shift into the full year enterprise results.
So next slide. On the enterprise results, the whole point of the year, really, was our ability to demonstrate nimble execution in the field and then deploy capital in a -- in really a tough acquisition market with great transactions.
So if you look at the records, everything, once again, was a record. We had the most orders, the highest revenue, the best margins, the highest net earnings, and best EBITDA and cash flow of any year in our history. The growth was led by Medical and RF. We had continued margin improvement throughout the year. The gross margin was up 140 basis points on a year to 60.7% and the operating margin was up 80 basis points to 29% offering profit margin and, of course, EBITDA was higher. 
A very strong cash flow. We were up 11% in cash flow for the year, and that was 26% of the revenue. Our free cash flow was also up 11% and our cash conversion on a free cash flow basis was 132%.
We deployed $1.8 billion in acquisitions in 2015, with almost entirely a focus on software and medical technologies.
All of our acquisitions are really very high-margin businesses. They're all asset light, they're very specific leaders in niche markets, and they have high recurring revenue and strong management teams at each one of these companies that we acquired.
And our recent acquisitions have been growing in excess of 10% a year, which gives us, as they become organic growth acquisitions, a benefit to organic growth.[ph] 
Next slide. If we look at this briefly, we put together, I think, really help people understand about the performance and the forward nature of what we'll do in 2016. If you look at the base revenue in 2015, it was $3.552 billion, and it ended the year at $3.593 billion. But that's not the story, being up 1%. The story is that we had organic growth in our RF segment, we had organic growth in Medical, we had substantial acquisitions even though we divested ABEL, which was $20-plus million revenue business.
So those 3 components added 7% to our trailing revenue number of last year. But we had a 3% currency headwind almost all of which was in the energy and industrial segments.
And that 3% brought the number down and then we had $35 million of negative organic growth in industrial, almost all of which was in Roper and FTI, which are our upstream fluid handling businesses.
And then we had $72 million negative organic in Energy, the vast majority of which was again upstream.
Although in the fourth quarter, we didn't get the seasonal push that we normally would get, so we had a little bit of a fall off in the fourth quarter in the mid and downstream business. So about 2.5% of the 3% negative organic in Industrial and Energy was related directly to oil and gas. Also something that gets skewed a bit by the numbers is our organic growth in the first quarter of '15 was 6%, excluding oil and gas. And we actually grew 2% in the second, third and fourth quarter, excluding oil and gas, so those headwinds that we've had to contend with in 2015 around oil and gas markets will be dramatically smaller in '16 than they were this year, although they're still some real challenges. And the currency isn't going to be $104 million, it will be probably 80% less than that negative number.
Next slide. If we look at the outstanding margin, you can see on the left-hand side the gross margins in 2013, we were 58.6%, and those were raised 70 basis points in '14 and then raised twice that of 140 basis points this year to 60.7%.
And our EBITDA margins in 2013 were 32.8%, they were raised 100 basis points in '14 to 33.8% and another 80 basis points this year to 34.6%.
So the continued margin expansion just comes, really, from a focus on our asset-light businesses being able to reinvest for growth in themselves. And we had great leverage throughout the enterprise as a result.
Next slide. We get to, really, what's the core of our entire business model is compounding our cash flow. And this compounding, you can see continues to be outstanding in a year where we really only have 1% revenue growth. Our free cash flow was up 11%. Our free cash flow at 9/29 is up $89 million from $840 million. So we had a great quarter in the fourth quarter with $269 million of cash. But we had a terrific year, with $893 million and cash in our view is still the best measured performance.
If you look at our cash guidance, you'll see our cash guidance tells a different story than the EPS guidance.
Next slide. If you look at the financial position of the company, here, you can see cash at the end of this past year closed out at $779 million, up from $610 million the year before and up from $460 million in 2013.
Now we've deployed almost 1/3 of that here in January to close the CliniSys acquisition, which is a little bit over $250 million, and that happened in the month of January.
We also upsized our revolver. Our revolver used to be $1.5 billion. Our revolver is now $1.850 billion, and you can see on our undrawn revolver, we have $1.670 billion. So between cash and undrawn revolver, there's about $2.5 billion of powder there. 
Our trailing 12 months EBITDA at $1,250 million, of course, will be -- that's not a performing number, it will continue to get bigger as the year goes on. But even at $1.245 billion, our net debt-to-EBITDA is only 2. At the end of '13, it was $1.9 billion, so we've done over a couple of billion of acquisitions. Only have net debt of about $500 million, so we still have a great deal of ample liquidity to do anything we want to do in the acquisition front in 2016.
Next slide. Here, we'll start to look at the specific segment detail and outlook. 
Next slide. If we look at the 4 segments, the Energy segment, the Industrial, the RF and the Medical segment, you'll see that they all are performing phenomenally from an EBITDA and gross margin basis. So even though you have a year where Energy and Industrial together came in at $1.333 billion, which was down 12% from the prior year's $1.519 billion, they still delivered 31% EBITDA margins in both years and both were over 50% in gross margins.
In our RF and Medical space, those guys were up 11% from $2 billion, roughly to $2.260 billion. And of course, they have even stronger margins with 36% EBITDA for RF and 45% EBITDA for Medical.
In the Medical and RF businesses are now already 70% of our total EBITDA and even though all the segments have extraordinary margins.
Next slide. So we'll start first with medical, which is our largest segment. And here you can see in the quarter, we had organic revenue of plus 3, acquisitions of plus 12% and foreign exchange, a negative 3%. SHP and IPA, acquisitions from '14, finally went to organic, and they delivered double-digit growth for us in this quarter. 
We had very strong sales out of Verathon, nearly double digits, with new product launches that we have talked about earlier in the year continuing to gain traction.
And our Northern Digital business had an outstanding year, we're up more than 10% with very strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter.
Atlas Medical, which is a small acquisition that we bolted into Sunquest in the fourth quarter, its integration activity is doing well, and we expect that to contribute in 2016.
MHA, we should comment on, completed all-time record year. It's compounding their growth and everything going well in that arena.
In 2016, the way we see the year unfolding is that we'll continue to be nimble and I would say our operating leverage for the full year in Medical was 50%. So as this grow, they contribute outsized incremental gains for us.
We think we'll have mid-single-digit organic growth in Medical throughout '16. And we think that will get stronger as the year goes on. Sunquest has a number of version changes and software release updates that are rolling out in the second half that will be quite beneficial. And then Strata, Data Innovations and SoftWriters, which are growing rapidly will become organic in the second half.
Verathon and Northern Digital continue to grow at a relatively higher rate in '16. And then we closed on January 7, the CliniSys acquisition in the U.K, which is a European hospital laboratory software provider. It will add to our acquisition sales growth in 2016.
Next slide. Here we look at RF Technology. And RF Technology was up in the fourth quarter 4% organically. It had a negative FX of 1 point and acquisitions and divestitures added 15%. So the revenue was up 18%, operating profit at 30% and the operating profit margin, 31.1%.
Software throughout the segment performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter as we returned to pretty good growth at iTrade and double-digit growth at Trade Matching.[ph] 
Aderant was acquired in October and is off to a great start with the Aderant team and in fact, some of us are working with them in terms of coordinating some large clients being more secure going in with Aderant in the future as opposed to the fact that they were in private equity in the past.
Toll and traffic projects are progressing really quite well. Riyadh is doing all right, although the start-ups in traffic in Riyadh tend to be more civil engineering at the beginning before we get all the software revenue but they're still fine. 
In our Infinity lanes that we've been rolling out in Florida and Texas are on schedule and contributing substantially.
We think we'll have mid-single digit organic growth for the year, with stronger growth in the second half for RF. Primarily, because TransCore is finally out of a arrangement where we were providing tolling administration in Puerto Rico, and that's been quite a challenge in the last half of this past year and we'll be completely out of our business model this year.  So it's a little bit dilutive to our revenue, but it's very much accretive to our sanity as trying to get money out of Puerto Rico. As you know, it's not an easy task. But that will put a drag on revenue in the first 2 quarters, about $10 million each quarter, but that's revenue we're happy to avoid.
Our operating leverage for this segment by the way, in 2015 was 56%. So here, again, as we get incremental revenue and we expect to have that in 2016, you'll see continued margin enhancement.
The software businesses we think will grow at kind of mid-single digits, but they do have exceptional margins that allow us to use cash to reinvest in other transactions.
And then the recent acquisitions that we've had, Aderant, RF IDeas and On Center, are all growing at a pretty strong rate, and they have excellent cash flow performance and eventually, they, too, will become organic.
Next slide. If we look at Industrial Technology, here, in the fourth quarter, organic revenue was down 8%. It's all pretty much all oil and gas, upstream with our businesses that are related to that. Again, some context about this.
In 2014, the oil and gas portion of Industrial Technology was about 12% of revenue. And unlike RF where it's 0; and in Medical, where it's 0. In Industrial Tech, it was 12%. 14% this year. That dropped to 9% of revenue. And then our forecast for '16, we think it will be down about 6% of revenue in the segment. It's almost exclusively upstream activity for surface and water pumping projects.
We also have the divestiture in -- which came from a circle with ABEL with about -- in the low 20 to revenue that contributed nothing in the fourth quarter this year. Of course, it will be out over the [ph] next year.
Neptune grew really quite well, double-digit growth in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. The Toronto project was still there, it's a headwind as we pulled you last year it's, close to $10 million a quarter. But it finally sense that's in the first quarter of next year. So Neptune's growth in 2016 will be outsized compared to the way it has looked with the Toronto headwind in [ph] the past.
We're forecasting continuing declines really in the upstream oil and gas. It was off about 30% for 2015. And we think it will be off another 30% in 2016. But of course, it gets to be down to a smaller number. So it's about a $20 million headwind for the segment going into 2016. 
Looking at the rest of the businesses [ph] will grow at kind of low single-digit numbers, maybe a little bit better than. 
So we'll go to the next slide. Oh, I want -- should say that OP, [ph] Industrial for the year, it delevered at 40%. So with gross margins about 50% and delevering at 40%, we think that was pretty good performance.
Next slide. On Energy Systems & Controls, they had -- that's continued to falloff as one would expect particularly in the upstream arena. Their operating leverage for 2015 though was really quite good at negative 39% and their gross margins are 58%. So I think everybody performed quite nimbly, although in the fourth quarter, Compressor Controls started to see really deep dive on their project work and haven't really structured around that yet, and that activity will happen here in the first quarter. So they contributed terrifically over the last several years, but have [indiscernible] of a major decline in project work that's not going to reoccur for some long period of time.
Now in the quarter, organic growth then was off you could see 17%, FX by 4%. Our seasonal improvement actually did occur sort of as we forecasted just not quite as much. We were up 9% seasonally in the fourth quarter in Energy, but normally, we're up kind of 17% to 20% and occasionally, 25% in the fourth quarter. So we had thought will be up maybe 15% in the fourth quarter and by only coming up 9% at that kind of pullback of revenue to add in the fourth quarter, which was direct result of seeing a little less revenue that we expected out of them. 
Certainly backlogs are reduced in this segment, and oil and gas project businesses -- kind of rapidly deteriorate, although that's not a surprise.
But unbelievable growth in Zetec as both South Korea, Japan and Middle East are roaring back and in fact, we were up quite dramatically in Zetec, and we think that will accrete to a very strong performance for Zetec in 2016.
The operating margin, which really speaks to the nimbleness of the operating people we have in these businesses, was still 32.7% even though the segment was down substantially in revenue.
If we look at the -- what we're talking about here for 2016, you can see sort of high single digit organic decline for the segment. Oil and gas, we think, will be down about 15%, which will be about a $50 million drag on the settlement. So about $20 million out of Industrial, about $50 million out of Energy. The project activity is going to force Compressor Controls to do some aggressive restructuring, and I know that it's a challenge for everybody but there's no question the market requires us to do that.
And then we think we'll have modest growth in the rest of the areas in the industrial and nuclear arena.
Next slide. So here as we get into the 2016 guidance. Next slide. We created another bridge for you here for 2016, so you get a sense of what's really going on in the health of the overall business.
You can see we finished this past year '15, at $3,593 million. We expect revenue to be up between 8% to 10% in 2016, and we think organic revenue will be between 2% and 4% in the coming year. So we'll get mid-single digits organic growth out of RF and mid-single digits organic growth out of Medical. I think we'll have low single-digit organic growth out of Industrial whereas last year, you might remember, was a negative number. And then already completed acquisitions net of the ABEL divestiture is going to contribute sizable portion of revenue in 2016. We think we'll still have the high single-digit organic drop in energy but that's a big improvement over last year's organic drop. And then foreign exchange, which was $104 million last year is probably going to be up about an 80% less headwind for us in 2016. So maybe something in the $20 million to $25 million arena and that makes just as we showed you, we grew last year at 7% until you hit the oil and gas number. Just easier comps throughout the year for us once we get past the first quarter.
Next slide. So if we look at the 2016 guidance, you can see for the full year, we're saying operating cash flow we would hope would meet or exceed $1 billion. Net operating cash flow is going to have just a very limited CapEx drag for it to convert to free cash flow this past year. I think our CapEx was $36 million. We wouldn't expect it to be any higher than that this year. So certainly less than 1% of revenue, probably quite a bit less than 1% of revenue.
Free cash flow -- I'm sorry, full year adjusted DEPS, we're saying or $6.85 to $7.15 and the key assumptions around that is we got, for the full year, revenue growth of 8% to 10%; organic growth of 2% to 4%. Comps eased after the first quarter. In the first quarter, we got a lot of headwinds, we got revenue drag out of Puerto Rico, we got oil and gas that not really hit us in the first quarter last year, and we had some unique revenue coming out of Roper Pump that will continue.
We had a little higher gross cost because of bigger draw with acquisitions, but we also get benefit in earnings.
But Q1 last year at 6% organic and the last 3 quarters had 2% organic, so we certainly don't expect 6% organic net of oil and gas in the first quarter.
Our noncash amortization increases by $30 million, so our noncash amortization will be $195 million in 2016. And if you want to use cash earnings, you can add that back to the net earnings number.
Interest expense is about $25 million higher than last year to $109 million. Our tax rate is going to be somewhat somewhere in this past year in the 30% to 30.5% arena and of course, none of these include any new acquisitions, and we do expect to be pretty active in 2016 in adding additional high-quality businesses.
In the first quarter, we're going to establish guidance at $1.42 to $1.47 because of those things that we have to face in the first quarter that were not there last year, but we'll get improvement throughout the year on those things, with quite dramatic improvement in the second half, which is not based on hope but just a reality of what we know to be the case.
Next slide. As we look at the 2015 summary and then the outlook for the year, we delivered record annual results for orders, revenue, margin and net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow in '15. And that was despite quite the biggest headwind period we had with so much coming from currency and oil and gas. 
Our operating cash flow was up 11%, free cash flow also up 11%. We had terrific margin improvement with gross margins up 140 basis points to 60.7%, EBITDA margins up 80 basis points to 34.6% and free cash flow at $893 million, represented 25% of every dollar of our revenue and 132% cash conversion versus the DEPS number.
We deployed $1.8 billion in really attractive acquisitions, so we increased our dividend by 20%. 
As we go into this year, we expect to deliver record performance in '16 with that revenue growth we mentioned just the slide before at 8% to 10%, operating cash flow around $1 billion. We think we'll deploy well over $1 billion in acquisitions. It could be easily be higher than that. And we've already closed our first one with CliniSys for about $250 million in January.
We got a very attractive pipeline, we're looking at transactional on priority [ph] and another one on Monday. And so there's just a great deal of activity going on probably, the most that we've ever seen in terms of the pipeline.
We continue to compound cash, increase shareholder value last year, we go a lot of -- in 2015 and there's no reason to think we can't continue to increase our cash as we look at 2016.
So with that, John, I think we're ready for questions."

So it's not a huge business, but it has a big, big, big drawback when you have the change. In fact, it is primarily U.S. business. So it's oil and gas component was down 30% in '15 from '14. And we expect it will another 30% in '16 for '15, but it's still a fairly small number. So it's about a $20 million revenue drag that we're modeling into '16. None of the other businesses in Industrial Technology have anything to do with oil and gas. They are instrument companies or -- over half is the Neptune, water pump [ph] business, which is going to grow next year. So it's just that one isolated and there's no mid-stream and downstream activity, really, in Industrial. When you get into Energy, much, much bigger total dollars of what you're talking about, about 60% of the segment is oil and gas, but only some of it is upstream, primarily the upstream portion, there are a couple of very small businesses, Viatran and that's a little bit of [indiscernible] and then quite a lot of Compressor Controls. So Compressor Controls has been living off of a great project backlog. Their service work, we expect could be a record this year, in 2016, but we think their project will drop really dramatically. It could drop $30 million, $40 million. And the midstream and downstream activity for the year has been really decent, all the way along. The only drag has been the currency. But then in the fourth quarter, we didn't get as much of a seasonal uptick in those downstream businesses as we normally do, so mostly testing businesses, so that bodes for slight deterioration, probably in '16. The rest of the Energy businesses, the 40%, are really mostly test and measurement kind of businesses and then [indiscernible] were up really sharply at Zetec, so that helps offset. And that's why we're saying 15% for Energy, but it's 30% for the upstream portion of Industrial."

It's just pure -- the biggest component, of course, is currency, but then from a unit situation, it's the project work at Compressor Controls. This year, has really easy to detail that out. So those numbers are pretty good. Last year, we actually said when we initiated guidance, we thought upstream would be down about 20%. You correctly challenged us about -- CapEx was down 30%, it might not be down 30% and we said, ""Well, it could be down more than 20%, but we thought we had a particular arrangement around surface drilling, which is new technology, which is rapidly gaining share, that was doing that at the time that we thought that would continue in the second quarter. But in the second quarter, they basically stopped all ordering and consumed all inventory they could and that hurt us a little bit. And then in the fourth quarter, we didn't get any seasonal balance, any -- well, we did, but not as much as you normally would. So we're very comfortable around guiding down $20 million on oil and gas, and Industrial and around $50 million in Energy, I think that's quite, quite correct.

I mean, the oil and gas businesses, we put the whole thing together, they have an EBITDA margin of 34%. And they don't take a lot of assets. They are very, very cash accretive to our number.

Or really there's a real crowd out of traditional private equity and really you can kind of sweep in, besides just the normal. Is there particular vertical or end market, where you're really well positioned or well advantaged? And does this allow for bigger deals or size of a certain decile to be shaken out in this environment?"

I noticed on some of the large things that we've looked at, if they get buffed by private equity, it isn't 1 fund, it's 3 guys going together. But that staples are still out there, I mean, we're looking at a deal [indiscernible] that has a 6.5x debt staple on it. So as long as debt staples are that high and while we wouldn't use it, private equity is going to use them, right? They can put in 4x of EBITDA, and you're still 10.5x EBITDA. And so -- the kind of businesses that we acquire and they were public, they tend to trade at 25x enterprise value to EBITDA are more. I know it's hard for people to follow that because they're looking at traditional multi-industry step, but multiples are dramatically less. So we're going to continue to look at these things that are worth a great deal from an arbitrage perspective in a public market versus what we have to pay for them. And those tend to crowd out the lesser quality of businesses, where people pay 8, 9, 10x for something that's worth 10. And we tend to pay 11 and 12x for something that's worth 25. And that's really how we get all this out [indiscernible] performance consistently over a long period of time, and that's going to continue. Now last year, we did something that I wouldn't have forecast, which is we did 6 or 7 deals to get the $2 billion. We would have rather down $1.5 billion deal and a $500 million deal, but the small deals were unbelievably compelling, and they're all growing double digits. So I mean it was a good thing to do. We are still seeing a lot of those kind of opportunities. So as the year unfolds, it will be a battle between sort of saving our powder for really large transactions and we're going ahead and investing early on things that are somewhat modest. At the end of the day, for our shareholders, the result's about the same. It's just easier for us to do a large deal than 5 small deals. But we're -- it should be an easy year for us to deploy capital very favorably."

And then as a follow-up, I mean, just obviously and ramping up coverage of you all again after a long dormancy, the cash return investment kind of metrically used and the kind of animates your M&A and capital deployment strategy, obviously, makes a heck of a lot of sense and I certainly have tried with a cool head with respect to the discipline around it. But I think the most important tiffany coming out of it is basically the strategy and the metrics were kind of completely aligned. In other words, you don't stretch for what is perceived as a strategic deal, because a strategic deal is one which meets the metrics, right? So I guess, the only question I have is where do you think there are risks to the CRI discipline or maybe the businesses you're looking at? Do you think it's maybe an assessment of the code? I know you used a third-party consultancy to kind of look at kind of these related intellectual property and software in association with deals. And there can be obviously risk there. There can be risk of technological substitution. Maybe if you could just talk about where were you just levelheadedly think about the risks in association with your capital redeployment strategy?"

If you look at the transactions because people were asking questions about that we buy some cheap stuff, right? So the cheap stuff in Industrial, and they're all kinds of stuff, but their public stocks are going to continue to deteriorate, and you can buy, -- ""Hey, what's wrong with us."" They can get disintermediated from distribution channels. They can wind up with a premium model out of Google on some bizarre thing. Or they wind up with Amazon selling past their competition at low price points. And they are all kinds of things that happen. They desperately need absorption. So, if revenue falls off, there's nothing they could do without big restructuring charges. When we get to our space, it's really around whether or not the people in the niche that we acquire have domain expertise, which is very hard for somebody to break into. And so the entry barriers for their success are entirely different. So the risk is that we continue to assess the quality of the management teams that we acquire well, and we understand whether or not there are technologies that could leapfrog what they do. So that we spent most of our time around the people aspects of the business and then around maybe risks that those people don't see that we would put a kind of different factor on. We tend to discount their forward growth projections because we don't pay for synergies, for forward growth. We only pay for what we think the business is going to deliver at the time of the acquisition. And that really puts a huge dampening effect on the risk that we might otherwise have. And we've been kind of blessed to be fortunate in that arena. But I think our disciplines are such because we actually start with somebody's balance sheet and then we start with what it takes to run the business. We don't do -- like what a private equity people do, they'll buy a software company and they'll mandate an immediate 10% reduction. One of the private equity firms out there actually goes in and does a listing of the highest paid people and they whack off the highest paid people and put new college guys in with big salary reductions. And then that kind of hideous activity doesn't manifest itself in a business for 4 or 5 years. So you have to understand what each private equity group's business model is when you're looking at the assets they hold and you are acquiring it. And I think we can do that better than anybody."

Because at Neptune, we paid 4x EBITDA at the enterprise in December 2003 to acquire Neptune at what some you probably felt was a high price for $500 million. The next year, in 2004, we just paid about 4x, again, trailing revenue with the firm, 3.5% or something; for TransCore, $600 million. Well, neither one of those businesses have blend themselves to adding exciting bolt-on activities to them or giving you domain experience in an area that was easily widened, all right? So when you acquire a leading laboratory software provider in a world that's going to have more and more laboratory instrument usage and will move to genomics in the immediate future, you have big upside ramp. We have MHA with senior living in nursing homes, all the things around nonacute hospitalization shifts and demography. These things just give you all kinds of opportunity. Well, good heavens, we've acquired now SoftWriters for MHA, which is growing at double digits. That's a terrific acquisition. We've been able to acquire CliniSys, which we can act really with Sunquest, we acquired Data Innovations, which is a phenomenal company, that guides all the instrumentation in a hospital into various systems and yet it's part of Sunquest. So that's why we didn't look at these things, which are somewhat synergistic at least in the marketplace or in the information technology side of them that we couldn't do with the Industrial and Energy businesses."

Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, Vice President of Planning and Investor Relations. 
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our website. 
If you turn to Slide 2, we begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described on this page, and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.
Next slide. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation on our website.
For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of 3 items: first, we completed the divestiture of ABEL Pumps during the fourth quarter, resulting in a pretax book gain of $70.9 million. This was partially offset by an impairment charge of $9.5 million relating to an imaging investment we made in 2007; second, a $4 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquired deferred revenue relating to software acquisitions made in 2015. This represents revenue that those companies would have recognized if not for our acquisition; finally, we have a $2.6 million inventory step-up expense relating to the acquisition of RF IDeas.
Now if you please turn to Slide 4, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. And after his remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?"

They were flat to last year, we'll talk a little bit about that, at $948 million. It's exactly the same number as last year but with lot of activity to get you there. We had another 2 points of FX headwind in the quarter and then the acquisitions net of the ABEL divestiture offset the organic shortfall in energy primarily.
The industrial and energy markets declined in the fourth quarter and really had less seasonal adjustment favorable in the fourth quarter than normally, and we'll talk about that when we get to that segment. But we had very strong growth in medical and the RF segments. Our gross margins continued to escalate. They were up 190 basis points in the quarter to 61.8%.
Our EBITDA margin also hit 35.9%. That's the EBITDA margin, not the gross margin. And EBITDA was up another 2% to $341 million, which is sort of an annualized run rate of $1.364 billion.
Our free cash flow was up to $261 million, and is 140% cash conversion. And we also issued a 5- and a 10-year bond, which totaled $900 million in the month of December, and deployed over $700 million in a quarter in some very attractive acquisitions, so we enjoyed both good execution in the quarter and terrific disciplined capital deployment.
Next slide. If we look at the income statement in the quarter, you can see that, while the orders and the revenue were exactly the same as the year ago, no 2 businesses would have been the same. So this was a case of watching the ducks on the pond with a whole lot of paddling going on underneath it.
The book-to-bill at 0.98 is actually pretty good for a fourth quarter. Just to give you some sense of history: in 2011, our book-to-bill in the fourth quarter was 0.94; in '12, it was 0.95; and in '13, it was flat at 1 or 1.01; '14, it was 0.98; and this year, it's 0.98. So from a historical perspective, it's about what we would expect to see.
Our gross profit as we said was up from 59.9% to 61.8% and operating income, the margin was 30.1% and that absorbed 70 basis points of higher noncash amortizations as acquisitions came in.
The interest expense was up $5 million due the bond issuance and  a little bit more drawn at the revolver during the quarter.
Net earnings were down 1% from $187 to $186, which you could see just from the interest.
Next slide. Here, we shift into the full year enterprise results.
So next slide. On the enterprise results, the whole point of the year, really, was our ability to demonstrate nimble execution in the field and then deploy capital in a -- in really a tough acquisition market with great transactions.
So if you look at the records, everything, once again, was a record. We had the most orders, the highest revenue, the best margins, the highest net earnings, and best EBITDA and cash flow of any year in our history. The growth was led by Medical and RF. We had continued margin improvement throughout the year. The gross margin was up 140 basis points on the year to 60.7% and the operating margin was up 80 basis points to 29% operating profit margin and, of course, EBITDA was higher. 
A very strong cash flow. We were up 11% in cash flow for the year, and that was 26% of the revenue. Our free cash flow was also up 11% and our cash conversion on a free cash flow basis was 132%.
We deployed $1.8 billion in acquisitions in 2015, with almost entirely a focus on software and medical technologies.
All of our acquisitions are really very high-margin businesses. They're all asset light, they're very specific leaders in niche markets, and they have high recurring revenue and strong management teams at each one of these companies that we acquired.
And our recent acquisitions have been growing in excess of 10% a year, which gives us, as they become organic rather than acquisitions, a benefit to organic notes [ph] .
Next slide. If we look at this bridge we put together, I think, really help people understand about the performance and the forward nature of what we'll do in 2016. If you look at the base revenue in 2015, it was $3.552 billion, and it ended the year at $3.593 billion. But that's not the story, being up 1%. The story is that we had organic growth in our RF segment, we had organic growth in medical, we had substantial acquisitions even though we divested ABEL, which was $20-plus million revenue business.
So those 3 components added 7% to our trailing revenue number of last year. But we had a 3% currency headwind almost all of which was in the energy and industrial segments, and that 3% brought the number down. And then we had $35 million of negative organic growth in industrial, almost all of which was in Roper and FTI, which are our upstream fluid handling businesses.
And then we had $72 million negative organic in energy, the vast majority of which was again upstream.
Although in the fourth quarter, we didn't get the seasonal push that we normally would get, so we had a little bit of a falloff in the fourth quarter in the mid- and downstream business. So about 2.5% of the 3% negative organic in Industrial and Energy was related directly to oil and gas. Also something that gets obscured a bit by the numbers is our organic growth in the first quarter of '15 was 6%, excluding oil and gas. And we actually grew 2% in the second, third and fourth quarter, excluding oil and gas, so those headwinds that we've had to contend with in 2015 around oil and gas markets will be dramatically smaller in '16 than they were this year, although there are still some real challenges. And the currency isn't going to be $104 million, it will be probably 80% less than that negative number.
Next slide. If we look at the outstanding margins, you can see on the left-hand side the gross margins in 2013, we were at 58.6%, and those were raised 70 basis points in '14 and then raised twice that, 140 basis points this year to 60.7%.
And our EBITDA margins in 2013 were 32.8%, they were raised 100 basis points in '14 to 33.8% and another 80 basis points this year to 34.6%.
So the continued margin expansion just comes, really, from a focus on our asset-light businesses being able to reinvest for growth in themselves. And we had great leverage throughout the enterprise as a result.
Next slide. We get to, really, what's the core of our entire business model is compounding our cash flow. And this compounding, you can see continues to be outstanding. In a year where we really only had 1% revenue growth, our free cash flow was up 11%. Our free cash flow at 9/29 is up $89 million from $840 million. So we had a great quarter in the fourth quarter with $269 million of cash. But we had a terrific year with the $893 million, and cash in our view is still the best measure of performance.
If you look at our cash guidance, you'll see our cash guidance tells a different story than the EPS guidance.
Next slide. If you look at the financial position of the company, here, you can see cash at the end of this past year closed out at $779 million, up from $610 million the year before and up from $460 million in 2013.
Now we've deployed almost 1/3 of that here in January to close the CliniSys acquisition, which is a little bit over $250 million, and that happened in the month of January.
We also upsized our revolver. Our revolver used to be $1.5 billion. The revolver is now $1.850 billion, and you can see on our undrawn revolver, we have $1.670 billion. So between cash and undrawn revolver, there's about $2.5 billion of powder there. 
Our trailing 12 months EBITDA at $1.25 billion, of course, will be -- that's not a pro forma number, and it will continue to get bigger as the year goes on. But even at $1.245 billion, our net debt-to-EBITDA is only 2.0x. At the end of '13, it was 1.9x. So we've done over a couple of billion of acquisitions and only have net debt up about $500 million. So we still have a great deal of ample liquidity to do anything we want to do in the acquisition front in 2016.
Next slide. Here, we'll start to look at the specific segment detail and outlook. 
Next slide. If we look at the 4 segments, the Energy segment, the Industrial, the RF and the Medical segment, you'll see that they all are performing phenomenally from an EBITDA and gross margin basis. So even though you have a year where Energy and Industrial together came in at $1.333 billion, which was down 12% from the prior year's $1.519 billion, they still delivered 31% EBITDA margins in both years and both were over 50% in gross margins.
In our RF and medical space, those guys were up 11% from $2 billion, roughly, to $2.260 billion. And of course, they have even stronger margins with 36% EBITDA for RF and 45% EBITDA for medical.
And the medical and RF businesses are now already 70% of our total EBITDA and -- even though all the segments have extraordinary margins.
Next slide. So we'll start first with medical, which is our largest segment. And here you can see in the quarter, we had organic revenue of plus 3%, acquisitions of plus 12% and foreign exchange, a negative 3%. The SHP and IPA acquisitions from '14, finally went to organic, and they delivered double-digit growth for us in this quarter. 
We had very strong sales out of Verathon, nearly double digit, with new product launches that we had talked about earlier in the year continuing to gain traction.
And our Northern Digital business had an outstanding year, we're up more than 10% with very strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter.
Atlas Medical, which is a small acquisition that we bolted into Sunquest in the fourth quarter, its integration activity is doing well, and we expect that to contribute in 2016.
MHA, we should comment on, completed a all-time record year. It's compounding their growth and everything going well in that arena.
In 2016, the way we see the year unfolding is that we'll continue to be nimble, and I want to say our operating leverage for the full year in Medical was 50%. So as these grow, they contribute outsized incremental gains for us.
We think we'll have mid-single-digit organic growth in Medical throughout '16. And we think that will get stronger as the year goes on. Sunquest has a number of version changes and software release updates that are rolling out in the second half that will be quite beneficial. And then Strata, Data Innovations and SoftWriters, which are growing rapidly will become organic in the second half.
Verathon and Northern Digital are going continue to grow at a relatively high rate in '16. And then we closed, on January 7, the CliniSys acquisition in the U.K, which is a European hospital laboratory software provider. And it will add to our acquisition sales growth in 2016.
Next slide. Here we look at RF Technology. And RF Technology was up in the fourth quarter 4% organically. It had a negative FX of 1 point and acquisitions and divestitures added 15%. So the revenue was up 18%, operating profit up 30% and the operating profit margin, 31.1%.
Software throughout the segment performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter as we returned to pretty good growth at iTrade and double-digit growth at freight matching.
Aderant was acquired in October, and it's off to a great start with the Aderant team. And in fact, some of us are working with them in terms of coordinating some of the large clients being more secure going in with Aderant in the future as opposed to the fact that they were owned by private equity in the past.
Toll and traffic projects are progressing really quite well. Riyadh is doing all right, although the start-ups in traffic in Riyadh tend to be more civil engineering at the beginning before we get all the software revenue but they're still fine. 
And our Infinity Lanes that we've been rolling out in Florida and Texas are on schedule and contributing substantially.
We think we'll have mid-single digit organic growth for the year, with stronger growth in the second half for RF. Primarily, because TransCore is finally out of an arrangement where we were providing tolling administration in Puerto Rico, and that's been quite a challenge in the last half of this past year and will be completely out of our business model this year.  So it's a little bit dilutive to our revenue, but it's very much accretive to our sanity as trying to get money out of Puerto Rico, as you know, is not an easy task. But that will put a drag on revenue in the first 2 quarters, about $10 million each quarter, but that's revenue we're happy to avoid.
Our operating leverage for this segment by the way, in 2015 was 56%. So here, again, as we get incremental revenue and we expect to have that in 2016, you'll see continued margin enhancement.
The software businesses we think will grow at kind of mid-single digits, but they do have exceptional margins that allow us to use cash to reinvest in other transactions.
And then the recent acquisitions that we've had, Aderant, RF IDeas and On Center, are all growing at a pretty strong rate, and they have excellent cash flow performance and, eventually, they too will become organic.
Next slide. If we look at Industrial Technology, here, in the fourth quarter, organic revenue was down 8%. It's all pretty much all oil and gas, upstream with our businesses that are related to that. To give some context about this:
in 2014, the oil and gas portion of Industrial Technology was about 12% of revenue, and unlike RF where it's 0 and Medical where it's 0. In Industrial Tech, it was 12% in '14. This year that dropped down to 9% of revenue. And in our forecast for '16, we think it will be down to about 6% of revenue in the segment. It's almost exclusively upstream activity for surface and water pumping projects.
We also had the divestiture in -- which came from a circle with ABEL with about -- in the low 20 to revenue that contributed nothing in the fourth quarter this year. Of course, it will be out all of  next year.
Neptune grew really quite well, double-digit growth in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. The Toronto project was still there as a headwind. As we told you last year it's close to $10 million a quarter. But it finally sunsets in the first quarter of next year. So Neptune's growth in 2016 will be outsized compared to the way it has looked with the Toronto headwind in it in the past.
We're forecasting continuing declines, really, in the upstream oil and gas. It was off about 30% for 2015. And we think it will be off another 30% in 2016. But of course, it gets to be down to a smaller number. So it's about a $20 million headwind for the segment going into 2016. 
And the rest of the businesses we think will grow at kind of low single-digit numbers, maybe a little bit better than that. 
So we'll go to the next slide. Oh, I want -- should say that OP leverage in  Industrial for the year, it delevered at 40%. So with gross margins above 50% and delevering at 40%, we think that was pretty good performance.
Next slide. On Energy Systems & Controls, they had this continued falloff as one would expect, particularly in the upstream arena. Their operating leverage for 2015 though was really quite good at negative 39%, and their gross margins are 58%. So I think everybody performed quite nimbly, although in the fourth quarter, Compressor Controls started to see really a deep dive on their project work and hadn't really structured around that yet, and that activity will happen here in the first quarter. So they've contributed terrifically over the last several years, but are going to have to face the reality of a major decline in project work that's not going to reoccur for some long period of time.
Now in the quarter, organic growth then was off as you can see 17%, FX by 4%. Our seasonal improvement actually did occur sort of as we forecasted just not quite as much. We were up 9% seasonally in the fourth quarter in energy, but normally, we're up kind of 17% to 20% and occasionally, 25% in the fourth quarter. So we had thought we'd be up maybe 15% in the fourth quarter and by only coming up 9% at that kind of pullback of revenue a tad in the fourth quarter, which was direct result of seeing a little less revenue than we expected out of them. 
Certainly backlogs are reduced in this segment, and the oil and gas project businesses are going to rapidly deteriorate, although that's not a surprise.
But unbelievable growth in Zetec as both South Korea, Japan and Middle East are roaring back. And in fact, we were up quite dramatically in Zetec, and we think that will accrete to a very strong performance for Zetec in 2016.
The operating margin, which really speaks to the nimbleness of the operating people we have in these businesses, was still 32.7% even though the segment was down substantially in revenue.
If we look at the -- what we're talking about here for 2016, you can see sort of high single-digit organic decline for the segment. Oil and gas, we think, will be down about 15%, which will be about a $50 million drag on the settlement. So about $20 million out of industrial, about $50 million out of energy. The project activity is going to force Compressor Controls to do some aggressive restructuring, and I know that it's a challenge for everybody but there's no question the market requires us to do that.
And then we think we'll have modest growth in the rest of the areas in the industrial and nuclear arena.
Next slide. So here as we get into the 2016 guidance. Next slide. We created another bridge for you here for 2016, so you get a sense of what's really going on in the health of the overall business.
You can see we finished this past year '15, at $3.593 billion. We expect revenue to be up between 8% and 10% in 2016, and we think organic revenue will be between 2% and 4% in the coming year. So we'll get mid-single digits organic growth out of RF and mid-single digits organic growth out of medical. I think we'll have low single-digit organic growth out of industrial whereas last year, you might remember, it was a negative number. And then already completed acquisitions net of the ABEL divestiture are going to contribute a sizable portion of revenue in 2016. We think we'll still have the high single-digit organic drop in energy but that's a big improvement over last year's organic drop. And then foreign exchange, which was $104 million last year is probably going to be -- about an 80% less headwind for us in 2016. So maybe something in the $20 million to $25 million arena and that makes just as we showed you, we grew last year 7% until you hit the oil and gas number. Just easier comps throughout the year for us once we get past the first quarter.
Next slide. So if we look at the 2016 guidance, you can see for the full year, we're saying operating cash flow we would hope would meet or exceed $1 billion. Net operating cash flow is going to have just a very limited CapEx drag for it to convert to free cash flow this past year. I think our CapEx was $36 million. We wouldn't expect it to be any higher than that this year. So certainly less than 1% of revenue, probably quite a bit less than 1% of revenue.
Free cash flow -- I'm sorry, full year adjusted DEPS, we're saying or $6.85 to $7.15. And the key assumptions around that is that we get, for the full year, revenue growth of 8% to 10%; organic growth of 2% to 4%. Comps ease after the first quarter. In the first quarter, we've got a lot of headwinds, we've got revenue drag out of Puerto Rico, we've got -- oil and gas had not really hit us in the first quarter of last year, and we had some unique revenue coming out of Roper Pump that won't continue.
We had, I think, a little higher interest cost because of the bigger draw with the acquisitions, but we also get benefit in earnings.
But Q1 last year had 6% organic and the last 3 quarters had 2% organic, so we certainly don't expect 6% organic net of oil and gas in the first quarter.
Our noncash amortization increases by $30 million, so our noncash amortization will be $195 million in 2016. And if you want to use cash earnings, you can add that back to the net earnings number.
Interest expense is about $25 million higher than last year to $109 million. Our tax rate is going to be somewhat similar to this past year in the 30% to 30.5% arena. And of course, none of these include any new acquisitions, and we do expect to be pretty active in 2016 in adding additional high-quality businesses.
In the first quarter, we're going to establish guidance at $1.42 to $1.47 because of those things that we have to face in the first quarter that were not there last year, But we'll get improvement throughout the year on those things, with quite dramatic improvement in the second half, which is not based on hope but just the reality of what we know to be the case.
Next slide. As we look at the 2015 summary and then the outlook for the year, we delivered record annual results for orders and  revenue, margin and net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow in '15. And that was despite probably the biggest headwind period we've had with so much coming from currency and oil and gas. 
Our operating cash flow was up 11% and free cash flow also up 11%. We had terrific margin improvement with gross margins up 140 basis points to 60.7%, EBITDA margins up 80 basis points to 34.6% and free cash flow at $893 million, represented 25% of every dollar of our revenue and 132% cash conversion versus the DEPS number.
We deployed $1.8 billion in really attractive acquisitions, and we increased our dividend by 20%. 
As we go into this year, we expect to deliver record performance in '16 with that revenue growth we mentioned just the slide before at 8% to 10%, operating cash flow around $1 billion. We think we'll deploy well over $1 billion in acquisitions. It could be easily be higher than that. And we've already closed our first one with CliniSys for about $250 million in January.
We got a very attractive pipeline. We're looking at a transaction on Friday and another one on Monday. And so there's just a great deal of activity going on, probably the most that we've ever seen in terms of the pipeline.
We continue to compound cash, increase shareholder value last year. You got a lot out of us in 2015, and there's no reason to think we can't continue to increase our cash as we look at 2016.
So with that, John, I think we're ready for questions."

So it's not a huge business, but it has a big, big drawback when you have the change in frac-ing. It's primarily a U.S. business. So it's oil and gas component was down 30% in '15 from '14. And we expect it will be down another 30% in '16 from '15, but it's still a fairly small number. So it's about a $20 million revenue drag that we're modeling into '16. None of the other businesses in Industrial Technology have anything to do with oil and gas. They are instrument companies or -- over half is the Neptune water meter business, which is going to grow next year. So it's just that one isolated -- and there's no mid-stream and downstream activity, really, in industrial. When you get into energy, much, much bigger total dollars of what you're talking about: about 60% of the segment is oil and gas, but only some of it is upstream, primarily the upstream portion, there are a couple of very small businesses, Viatran and DEF [ph], a little bit of AMOT and then quite a lot of Compressor Controls. So Compressor Controls has been living off of a great project backlog.
Their service work we expect could be a record this year, in 2016, but we think their project work will drop really dramatically. It could drop $30 million, $40 million. And the midstream and downstream activity for the year has been really decent all the way along. The only drag has been the currency. But then in the fourth quarter, we didn't get as much of a seasonal uptick in those downstream businesses as we normally do, so mostly testing businesses, so that bodes for slight deterioration, probably in '16. The rest of the energy businesses, the 40%, are really mostly test and measurement kind of businesses. And then we're up really sharply at Zetec so that helps offset that. That's why we're saying 15% for energy, but it's 30% for the upstream portion of industrial."

It's just pure -- the biggest component, of course, is currency, but then from a unit situation, it's the project work at Compressor Controls. This year it's really easy to detail that out. So those numbers are pretty good. Last year, we actually said when we initiated guidance, we thought upstream would be down about 20%. You correctly challenged us about, well, CapEx was down 30%, might it not be down 30%? And we said, ""Well, it could be down more than 20%,"" but we thought we had a particular arrangement around surface drilling, which is new technology, which has rapidly gained share. And it was doing that at the time, and we thought that would continue in the second quarter. But in the second quarter, they basically stopped all ordering and consumed all inventory they could and that hurt us a little bit. And then in the fourth quarter, we didn't get any seasonal balance, any -- well, we did, but not as much as you normally would. So we're very comfortable around guiding down $20 million on oil and gas and industrial, and around $50 million in energy, I think that's quite, quite correct. And then there'd still be a little bit more drag on a nominal number basis with currency, but it's definitely not pricing.

It could be spun off as an independent entity where people would be able to make a kind of one-for-one decision about whether they wanted to be in that space as an investor, and it could be put together with another business in some kind of merger. Again, it's not something we'd likely sell because the tax leakage in a sale is just pretty prohibitive and the businesses are very good. I mean, the oil and gas businesses, when we put the whole thing together, they have an EBITDA margin of 34%. And they don't take a lot of assets. They are very, very cash accretive to our number. And for those people who like EPS, they give us terrific EPS because there's no amortization. But you're right, I mean, that -- it's something we're always going to look at.

And so what happens is it's usually difficult for an industrial asset to have the kind of cash returns that we are going to demand.

We bought a pure product company in RF IDeas this year, which is just a world-class business with terrific leadership, very high margins, relatively light assets, but they're certainly making stuff and they're selling stuff. So it depends on the quality of what it is we see, but we would never buy something at a public market deep discount. Let's say, some energy business dropped 30%. We wouldn't buy something because it dropped 30%. We would only buy something because its forward cash returns were extremely attractive. And as generally as a rule, people overpay for low-quality assets under the theory that they're going to find some way to make them better. So we'll leave the buying of distressed assets to others. We want to buy businesses that have consistent growth and recurring revenue and light-asset models.

But in terms of just coming back to that question, is there particular types of companies that you're kind of looking at now that really lend themselves to be acquired in these environments? Where, really, there's a real crowd out of traditional private equity and, really, you can kind of sweep in. Besides just the normal, is there a particular vertical or end market where you're really well positioned or well advantaged? And does this allow for bigger deals of size or of a certain decile to be shaken out in this environment?"

I noticed on some of the large things that we've looked at, if they get buffed by private equity, it isn't 1 fund, it's 3 guys going together. But debt staples are still out there, I mean, we're looking at a deal Friday that has a 6.5x debt staple on it. So as long as debt staples are that high and while we wouldn't use it, private equity is going to use them, right? They can put in 4 turns of EBITDA, and you're still at 10.5x EBITDA. And so -- the kind of businesses that we acquire, if they were public, they tend to trade at 25x enterprise value to EBITDA or more. I know it's hard for people to follow that because they're looking at traditional multi-industry stuff, but -- multiples that are dramatically less. So we're going to continue to look at these things that are worth a great deal from an arbitrage perspective in a public market versus what we have to pay for them. And those tend to crowd out the lesser quality businesses, where people pay 8, 9, 10x for something that's worth 10. And we tend to pay 11 and 12x for something that's worth 25. And that's really how we get all this alpha performance consistently over a long period of time, and that's going to continue. Now last year, we did something that I wouldn't have forecast, which is we did 6 or 7 deals to get to $2 billion. We would have rather done  a $1.5 billion deal and a $500 million deal, but the small deals were unbelievably compelling, and they're all growing double digits. So I mean it was a good thing to do. We are still seeing a lot of those kind of opportunities. So as the year unfolds, it will be a battle between sort of saving our powder for a really large transaction or going ahead and investing early on things that are somewhat modest. At the end of the day, for our shareholders, the result's about the same. It's just easier for us to do a large deal than 5 small deals. But we're -- it should be an easy year for us to deploy capital very favorably."

And then as a follow-up, I mean, just obviously in ramping up coverage of you all again after a long dormancy, the cash return on investment kind of metric you use and the kind of animates your M&A and capital deployment strategy, obviously, makes a heck of a lot of sense and I certainly have drunk the Kool-Aid with respect to the discipline around it. And I think the most important epiphany coming out of it is, basically, the strategy and the metrics are kind of completely aligned. In other words, you don't stretch for what is perceived as a strategic deal, because a strategic deal is one which meets the metrics, right? So I guess, the only question I have is where do you think there are risks to the CRI discipline or maybe the businesses you're looking at? Do you think it's maybe an assessment of the code? I know you use a third-party consultancy to kind of look at kind of these related intellectual property and software in association with deals. And there can be, obviously, risk there. There can be risk of technological substitution. Maybe if you could just talk about where were you just level-headedly think about the risks in association with your capital redeployment strategy?"

Because people are asking questions about that we buy some cheap stuff, right? So the cheap stuff in industrial, and there's all kinds of stuff and their public stocks are going to continue to deteriorate, and you can buy them.  Okay, what's wrong with those is they can get disintermediated from distribution channels. They can wind up with a freemium model out of Google on some bizarre thing. Or they wind up with Amazon selling past their competition at low price points. And there are all kinds of things that happen. They desperately need absorption. So, if revenue falls off, there's nothing they can do without big restructuring charges. When we get to our space, it's really around whether or not the people in the niche that we acquire have domain expertise, which is very hard for somebody to break into. And so the entry barriers for their success are entirely different. So the risk is that we continue to assess the quality of the management teams that we acquire well, and we understand whether or not there are technologies that could leapfrog what they do. So that -- we spent most of our time around the people aspects of the business and then around maybe risks that those people don't see that we would put a kind of different factor on. We tend to discount their forward growth projections because we don't pay for synergies for forward growth. We only pay for what we think the business is going to deliver at the time of the acquisition. And that really puts a huge dampening effect on the risk that we might otherwise have. And we've been kind of blessed to be fortunate in that arena. But I think our disciplines are such because we actually start with somebody's balance sheet and then we start with what it takes to run the business. We don't do -- like what a lot of private equity people do, they'll buy a software company and they'll mandate an immediate 10% reduction. One of the private equity firms out there actually goes in and does a listing of the highest paid people and they whack off the highest paid people and put new college guys in at big salary reductions. And then that kind of hideous activity doesn't manifest itself in a business for 4 or 5 years. So you have to understand what each private equity group's business model is when you're looking at the assets they hold and you are acquiring it. And I think we can do that better than anybody."

Let's go back and think about. The reason I said some time ago that the Sunquest and MHA acquisitions were more transformational than the Neptune and TransCore transformations were is because at Neptune, we paid 4x EBITDA of the enterprise in December 2003 to acquire Neptune at what some people probably felt was a high price for $500 million. The next year, in 2004, we just paid about 4x, again, the trailing revenue of the firm, 3.5% or something for TransCore at $600 million. Well, neither one of those businesses have lend themselves to adding exciting bolt-on activities to them or giving you domain experience in an area that was easily widened, all right? So when you acquire a leading laboratory software provider in a world that's going to have more and more laboratory instrument usage and will move to genomics in the immediate future, you have big upside ramp. When you have MHA with senior living in nursing homes and all the things around nonacute hospitalization shifts in demography. These things just give you all kinds of opportunity. Well, good heavens, we've acquired now SoftWriters for MHA, which is growing at double digits. That's a terrific acquisition. We've been able to acquire CliniSys, which we can connect, really, with Sunquest. We acquired Data Innovations, which is a phenomenal company, that guides all the instrumentation in a hospital into the various systems and yet it's part of Sunquest. So that's why we can look at these things, which are somewhat synergistic at least in the marketplace or in the information technology side of them that we couldn't do with the industrial and energy businesses."

Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. That press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our website. 
If you turn to Slide 2, we begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described on this page, and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. Next slide. 
Today we, will be discussing our results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also as a part of this presentation on our website. 
For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consist of 3 items: Our normal adjustments related to recently acquired businesses on both deferred revenue and inventory valuation, which totaled $3 million to both revenue and income measures. 
We've also adjusted our operating cash flow to account for the cash taxes paid in the first quarter for the ABEL divestiture. The ABEL divestiture, you may recall, is completed in the fourth quarter last year. 
GAAP requires this amounts, $37 million in those tax payments to be recorded as an operating cash flow item even though it is related to that divestiture. We've added this $37 million back to reflect the ongoing nature of our cash flow. 
And as you please turn to Slide 4, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President , Chief Executive Officer. And after his remarks, we'll take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?"

So we'll go through today, the first quarter enterprise results, and we'll look at the details around the 4 segments and the outlook for the remaining of the year. And while we're doing that, we'll comment on the second quarter and full year guidance at the end and then take your questions. 
Next slide. So we start with the Q1 enterprise results. Go to the next slide, Slide 6. You can see there's a lot of great things here. It was a very, very good quarter for us and certainly puts us on track for a record 2016, but just one word I'd say before we get started. Mr. Humphrey over here is actually just celebrating this month his 10th completed year with the enterprise and as John refers to, it's actually his 40th quarter. 
So with that, let's take a look at our first quarter, right? Congratulations, John. Revenue 
was up 4.4% to $906 million versus the first quarter of a year ago. And organic, it was down 3.2%, which is really not the story because, excluding oil and gas, the company's organic was actually up, around 1%. And then if you look at the headwinds that we newly had with the end of Toronto and Puerto Rico and so forth, really, the underlying basis the activity seemed better than that, more like plus 3. 
Our orders were up 9% in the quarter to a record. Book-to-bill was really spectacular because we haven't had a book-to-bill above 1.01 to where 2.5 years and this time, we were at -- as you combine Industrial, Energy together, the book-to-bill was 1.04 and Medical was 1.03 and RF was even just a hair above 1, but actually had an adjustment in there for some debookings around the business that we're doing something with. Otherwise, it would have been 1.02. 
So very good backlog at $1.12 billion is also very good. Gross margin was spectacular. Gross margin was up 210 basis points to 62.1% and what's really remarkable given the macroeconomic challenges around the world is each of our 4 segments improved their gross margin in the first quarter. 
EBITDA was up 4% and reached 34% EBITDA margin. We're going to talk some more about that. We still don't report in cash earnings but increasingly, we need to make sure people understand that quality of our earnings and the cash earnings nature because we just have so much noncash and amortization. 
Our earnings per share in the first quarter were $1.50. Our operating cash flow was $245 million, which represented 27% of our revenue. 
And the recent acquisitions that we made in 2015 are really performing sort of beyond very well. They have outstanding growth. For us, almost all of our double-digit grower, so we'll talk more about that throughout today's session. 
We deployed $265 million in acquisitions in the first quarter. We have extremely big and attractive pipeline that we'll talk a little bit more. 
And so with that, we can move to the next slide, which is 7. On the income statement, just to kind of backup some idea about how important the orders were. I'll give the our book-to-bill for the last 8 quarters was -- last year, it start out at 98, or 102 on a consolidated basis here. The next quarter was 99 and 101 at 98. The year before that was 101, 99, 101, 98. 
So you have all the way back to Q2, up 13 to see something as high as the bill book-to-bill we got here, and that was despite revenue being up. 
Gross profit was up 8%. Our operating income was basically flat to the prior period, but that's only because amortization in the quarter was up 120 basis points, so $11 million, results of which is noncash, so big difference between reporting GAAP operating income and what's really happening on the cash quality of the earnings. 
Interest expense was up $7 million. We did $900 million brand offering in December, which really went -- kind of termed out what we were doing on the revolver. So it gives a substantial capacity, well over $1.8 billion to be able to deploy here capital deployment throughout the year, and it's certainly worth $0.05 impact. That said, the different last year's was 55 but 50, is in fact, that $0.05. 
Next slide. If we look here at operating and EBITDA margins as a company, you'll see that incrementally, the operating margin went from 28.7 to 27.4, that's with a 120 basis points of amortization. They added back in, you can see that essentially, it was the same outstanding result as the year before. 
On the right-hand signed though, you can see that EBITDA margins was increasingly are more important for us. And here, there's no D in either side of the equation, there's just earnings before interest tax and amortization. So that's actually up in the last 2 years, 130 basis points, from 31.6% to 32.9%. 
Furthermore, this gross margin increase we're getting is encouraging us, which we're doing at a very fast pace to step up our R&D and engineering investment, which in this quarter was up 120 basis points over the first quarter of last year and is now reaching 7% of revenue. 
Next slide. Our asset-light business model continues. It were still easily able to compound our investment in asset-light businesses. And you get some sense about how important that is. 
So there's 2 aspect to slide like this. One is our governance process with our existing businesses and the second is the quality of the businesses that we continue to acquire. 
And at the end of the first quarter, just 3 years ago, in 2013, our net number here was 7.7%. Today, it's 4%, nearly a 50% reduction in just 3 years. Inventory back in '13 was 6.8%. Today, it's 5.5%. Receivables were 19.3 and in tough market for receivables. Today, they're only 17.4. And payables were 18.4. Now, they're 19. All going our way, so we go from 7.7%, down to 4%. 
And even just in the last 2 years, they've gone from 6.3% to 4%, which is truly a remarkable number, we're very proud of for our people focusing on asset velocity and the quality of the businesses that new leadership teams are bringing to us as we acquire them. 
Next slide. If you look at our cash flow performance here, you can see in the quarter, operating cash flow was 27% of revenue, free cash flow was 26% of revenue, that's not a gross margin number, that's the free cash flow to revenue number, 26%. 
Trailing 12-month operating cash conversion is 135%, and even though the cash conversion in the quarter is above 150, we really thought it's much more balanced to look at the trailing 12 months' operating cash flow to eliminate quarterly seasonality that occur sometime. So even there, you can see we've gone from 8 44 to 9 13 and we fully expect this year operating cash flow for the full year would be $1 billion or more. 
We're continuing to compound cash flow despite these macroeconomic challenges and they're quite substantial for us. We had about $100 million of foreign exchange in the last 12 months and another $100 million of oil and cash headwinds and also the Toronto project for millions of dollars and the Puerto Rico escape, which was another $10 million a quarter. So that compounding is still continuing. The same we would expect to continue. And we still think cash is the best measure of performance. 
Next slide. If we look at the financial position, the balance sheet is in really great shape. It gives us tremendous amount of powder for capital deployment in our pipeline is really is good, maybe the best it's ever been. 
Here, you can see, we still have $0.5 billion of cash. Our undrawn revolver is actually paid off. Now, it's $1.850 billion, which is very substantial if you look at cash and the undrawn revolver, you'd be over $2.3 billion. 
And you could see the EBITDA at $1.256 billion will continue to grow handsomely throughout the year, so we'll have a very solid debt ratio opportunities. 
If you look at the last 15 months, we've deployed over $2 billion in acquisitions and with a $1.8 billion undrawn revolver, we could absolutely repeat that effort and deploy another $2 billion in the next 15 to 18 months. 
Next slide. Here, we get into the very specific segment detail. 
Next slide. So in the first quarter, the segment performance, you can see here was, again, very strong all the way across the line on our EBITDA measurements, down at the bottom. There are 2 really big messages that we try to convey with this slide. First is that our RF software segment and the medical solutions segments together represent over 3/4 of the company's total EBITDA. But there's an equally important message here on the left-hand side, where we look at the energy and industrial businesses, which remain as really extraordinary businesses. 
Those 2 businesses you can see had 25% EBITDA and Energy even with all the difficulty that you see, we have very nimble leadership and the quality of this businesses still allow us to drive this kind of result. 
If you combine the 2 together, $119 million in energy and $171 billion in Industrial, you only have $300 million out of our 906 in revenue, and yet we have $81 million of EBITDA on $300 million base or 27% and those EBITDA margins in Energy is going to continue to improve throughout the year. So great extraordinary businesses in industrial and energy despite the oil and gas and oil and gas is becoming less and less critical. And here, it's well less than 9% of revenue. 
All right, next slide. We start off with the smallest segment, which is energy. Energy had negative organic in the quarter of 14%, but essentially, all of that was driven by the oil and gas business, which now represents just a little over half of the total segment. 
And inside Energy, it's different than the industrial portion of oil and gas because our energy business is primarily downstream, about 75% downstream, about 25% upstream. And the FX, as you can see, was 1 point. Oil and gas as a portion of the energy segment was down a little over 20%, which is pretty much consistent with what we expected throughout the year. The biggest challenge in there used to be our diesel engine shutoff valve business. This year, we'll shift over with our compressor control business and they're moving quickly to try to address everything they can do from a shortfall in projects that we'll see throughout the year. 
Very nimble execution. We haven't really talked to the market about any restructuring we've done, which has been pretty considerable. I will do a little bit more in the second quarter, but we're really not even asking from an adjustment in our restructuring investments because payback is pretty quick. 
Zetec in the quarter did extremely well, it's up high single digits. There's a lot of activity around the power generation side of nuclear and Zetec is best-in-class in this area, and it's going to enjoy some continuing tailwinds for the next couple of years. 
And then just as we move to thinking about the remainder of the year, Q2 to Q4, I'll just remind you that with the pull back in oil and gas, about half of the energy systems business is actually industrial measurement technologies. 
We expect high single digit organic decline in the rest of the year, but that's just because of the oil and gas. And then we think we'll get this modest growth in the other half of the sector, and we think margins will improve throughout the year sequentially.  And energy, as you can see, now, is down to only 9% of the company's EBITDA. 
Next slide. If you look at Industrial Technology, the same situation with the oil and gas. Organic as a segment was down 5%. However, if they exclude oil and gas, industrial was up organically, 3% in the quarter. 
So the upstream activity, which in here is really Roper Pump and a little bit up adjacency there, that upstream is about 80% of the market. And the total value of that is only about $10 million out of $171 million in the segment, so it's down to less than 5% of revenue. 
Neptune had a really strong quarter, they were up double digits and enjoy a very good U.S. which overcame the fact this was the last quarter with the negative Toronto project variants, which was mid-millions of dollars of headwind. 
This is segment EBITDA margins, I think, you're going to look at 2, which were really 30.1% on industrial. So the performance, despite any of the headwinds that you see, is still very solid. 
In second half of the year, we're looking at kind of low single digit organic growth for the segment. We don't see any improvement in upstream oil and gas, we think that will actually continue to decline a little bit. But we'll have kind of flat to modest growth in all of the other markets and then very strong growth at Neptune because as we get into the second quarter, the Toronto project tailwind is essentially behind us, and that was worth quite a bit of -- will be quite a positive various now in 2, 3 and 4. 
Next slide. If we look at the RF Technology and software business, and we have try the software recognition in here because the software business is actually becoming as large -- or larger than the tolling business. 
So when we look at the segment, you can see organic was down 1 %, but actually, organic would have been of up, excluding the roll off of the Puerto Rico exit that we had, which was $10 million just in that quarter. 
We had record margin performance throughout the segment, very strong software and SaaS business growth with terrific margins and cash flow in all of those businesses. 
Aderant, our most recent acquisition is performing very well. We've got several new winds, which are strategic importance that Play Go community can be talking about and has already started to discuss and comment on our share gains. 
In the toll and traffic area, as we say, our ITS business was down because of Puerto Rico. Our tech business continued to be strong, very good project execution. 
I'd also want to point out that, that OP margin, which was up 170 basis points to 32.2, again, belies the quality of the cash margin. Our EBITDA margins were at 39.2%, up 360 basis points, so the first quarter of the year ago. 
As we look to the second quarter, we expect flat organic growth in Q2 only because we still have one more quarter of the Puerto Rico drag of about $10 million, and that's 3 to 4 points. 
But in the second half, we'll have a much stronger organic growth because that Puerto Rico comps will be going away. 
We'll get multiple opportunities, we think, in the TransCore projects. We have very exceptional amount of bids in line, we're pretty confident in a lot of those. The timing of when those are able to be announced will be important for us. 
And then RF IDeas, which is doing phenomenally well, will become organic in the fourth quarter, so that will help our organic revenue comparisons. 
The software and SaaS businesses should grow kind of mid- to high single digits. Feel a little better than we might have expected previously in the give us strong cash returns. And then Aderant is going to continue to gain share, which will help this segment. 
Next slide. Here, we look at the medical solutions. Medical solutions, boy, it's another EBITDA margin story. You see the operating profit margin at 34.7%, but that just because of a lot of noncash amortization. Our EBITDA margin is 43.5% in medical. 
Organic was up 2%, acquisitions added 13%, but medicals organic as a standalone portion of the segment, was up 6% organically, while imaging was down 13%. We had double-digit growth in the medical products, which really was driven primarily by Verathon and Northern Digital. The acquisitions that we made in this segment are performing extremely well. If you put them all together, they actually are growing both at double-digit revenue and EBITDA basis. 
We had a really exceptional growth at Strata, which is up very dramatically as more hospitals understand what we're doing and are signing up our SaaS solutions on their cost visibility and how they contain and structure their costs. 
We acquired a small business called PCI Medical in the quarter, which will boost Civco's offering in ultrasound, and that business closed and led some revenue for us. 
If you look at the balance of the year, you have a high single digit organic growth in the segment. That comes from continued strength in the medical arena and then Strata, SoftWriters and Data Innovations become organic in Q2, which will make those comps standout, with very strong performance in all of those acquisitions, the IPA business that we announced some time ago has done particularly well from a growth perspective. 
Imaging will continue to improve with kind of substantial gains out of Gatan. Gatan, we're pouring a lot of money into innovation at Gatan to focus on cryo OEM markets. These involve significant R&D investments but with exciting out year opportunities. 
Some of you have read about the discovery of the Zika virus and how that was done and our products were absolutely crucial to the discovery technologies that have been announced recently. 
We have positive contributions from our CliniSys acquisition. Although CliniSys comes in initially at lower margins than the rest of the business, but we'll continue to improve those as we work with them. 
Sunquest investments and genetics continues. We acquired on -- just a day after the quarter, so we didn't included it here, GeneInsight, which is a technology and business that was really built by Partners Health that we've been doing in concert with and will have long-term implications in the out years here at medical. 
Also we'll just say that when you look at medical in this pie chart down here, it's 43% of the company's total EBITDA. And to put that in perspective, you can see there's energy the smallest piece of that pie in industrial is the next smallest. Those 2 together, only 24% of our EBITDA and medical is 43% and RF is 33%. So you can see what the future looks like. 
Next slide. So here, we'll get into the guidance of the company for the balance of the year. Next slide. 
So the guidance update we're going to continue our current guidance as we articulated at the beginning of the year, so we said the full year will be between $6.85 and $7.15 with the midpoint at $7 and then operating cash flow would be about $1 billion. And our tax rate guidance is the same as it was at the beginning of the year and really everything else, we see the same sort of revenue opportunities. There's one thing we'd say about the second quarter where we established the guidance at $1.56 to $1.61. We had an extraordinarily low tax rate in the second quarter last year than some people were maybe not looking at carefully. Tax rate was only 25%. We would expect the tax rate in the second quarter to be 30% to 30.5%. 
Another piece of good news when we look at FY, we're really comfortable with the second half of the year is that we're not really seeing any industrial contagion at all in those portions of either industrial energy businesses that are not oil and gas. And certainly, at the beginning of the year, that was something that many people were worried about. 
And the high end of our range will really be dependent on production rates and project timing and seasonal activity. So we feel quite good about reinforcing the full year guidance. 
Next slide. If we look at the summary of 2016, it pretty simples series of things here, right? Revenue is up 4.4%. Medical and software and Neptune, we're able to offset all of those declines in oil and gas. Our orders reached record level and got over $1 billion backlog. Our gross margin, which we'd like you to know how customers continue to feel about us and the products and services we provide, were up 210 basis points and as we said each of the 4 segments increased their gross margin. We're investing at fastest rates in our history in R&D. Our EBITDA margin you can see is 32.9%. Not all EBITDA is the same. We're always sometimes frustrated when people tell us about some of these EBITDA margins but it's really mostly D and then CapEx sucks away. And in our world, the leakage between EBITDA at 34 and EBITDA at 32.9 is only 110 basis points. 
EBITDA, as we said, was up 4% to 3.07%. Acquisitions performing very well. We really can't say enough about how well the acquired leadership teams are performing and how well they've embraced the Roper governance process. Every single one of these acquisitions is outperforming our expectation, and we have very attractive pipeline. We expect that we would -- as said earlier, we expect to deploy over $1 billion in the year, and it could easily be more than that. 
So great quarter, on track for record 2016. And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

So in that case, if you look at the net earnings of the business and then you add back the noncash charges, and you divide it by the gross investment, which is the physical plant and equipment plus accumulated depreciation, plus net working capital. All of those acquisitions all well above 1% cash returns. Many of them are in the several 100% cash return basis. And some of them get paid in advance for what they do, so they have a negative cash return, which is even more powerful. So they're all doing very well. I think as a general rule anymore, you can assume that our acquisitions are going to come in and they're going to be substantially above the 34% EBITDA margin that the overall enterprise has and that they're going to have higher gross margins than the enterprise and they're going to have higher cash returns than the enterprise."

So I think there's a lot of forces that work. It's certainly been lumpy feedback to sellers about just how much debt capacity they can get on things, although frankly, we don't ever see any well. we see one thing right now it's done 6x stable and then other one that we're really pursuing has 6 75 stable. They're still some 7 stable. But the cost of debt has flipped around quite a lot. Sometimes, the mezzanine portion and secured bonds are 10.5% and other times, it's 9%. The LIBOR at floor, comes into play sometimes and then may be you get 4.75 in the term loan. But there really isn't because there will be a LIBOR of 100 and 5 75. So I do think that there are a lot of private equity people feel that they've got an asset that they're going to sell in the foreseeable future. It may still be as good a time now to sell. And they changed weekly. I mean, first, they're very opportunistic, right? So in our situation, we are not affected by those things and our ability to finance stuff is certainly easier and better than their cost to debt. So I think that helps. But also, there's a lot of things we're looking have -- they have been in various portfolios for a while, and they need to get out, they might be more worried about the financing markets in 2017 than they are now, so I can't think of the time we made a call somebody to talk about their business that they haven't said, come on over."

So the idea that we're going to be up 2% of 4% organically over the course of the year is not a big challenge. I mean we should do pretty well in the second half but thinks it can affect that are going to be the adoption rate of new products and some versions of software that are rolling out in the second half, and you never know what those adoption rates look like, right? So if they're high, then we have a much better opportunity to get to that midpoint number and above. If they're moderate, then it's harder. The second thing, the tolling projects, we have an enormous amount, a bid activity right now, but there is never anything us as a supplier can do to influence the beginning or the execution of those projects. So if they go at an expected pace, then that helps. If they go at a slow pace, and it's not particularly helpful. And then last year, we got nothing out of the year in instrumentation businesses in terms of seasonality. That's the only time that's happened in a decade. So we would expect to get some more modest return to seasonality in the fourth quarter in those instrumentation businesses. So those are the things that will determine where we're at.

Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. That press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our website. 
If you turn to Slide 2, we'll begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described on this page, and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. Next slide. 
Today, we'll be discussing our results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also as a part of this presentation on our website. 
For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consist of 3 items: our normal adjustments related to recently acquired businesses on both deferred revenue and inventory valuation, which total $3 million to both revenue and income measures. 
We've also adjusted our operating cash flow to account for the cash taxes paid in the first quarter for the ABEL divestiture. The ABEL divestiture, you may recall, is completed in the fourth quarter last year. 
GAAP requires this amount, $37 million in those tax payments, to be recorded as an operating cash flow item even though it is related to that divestiture. We've added this $37 million back to reflect the ongoing nature of our cash flow. 
And now if you'll please turn to Slide 4, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Then after his remarks, we'll take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?"

And while we're doing that, we'll comment on the second quarter and full year guidance at the end, and then take your questions. 
Next slide. So we start with the Q1 enterprise results. Go to the next slide, Slide 6. You can see there's a lot of great things here. It was a very, very good quarter for us and certainly puts us on track for a record 2016. 
But just one word I'd say before we get started. Mr. Humphrey over here is actually just celebrating this month his 10th completed year with the enterprise. And as John refers to, it's actually his 40th quarter. So with that, let's take a look at our first quarter, right? Congratulations, John. 
Revenue was up 4.4% to $906 million versus the first quarter of the year ago. And organic, you can see it was down 3.2%, which is really not the story because, excluding oil and gas, the company's organic was actually up around 1%. And if you look at the headwinds that we knew we had with the end of Toronto and Puerto Rico and so forth, really, the underlying basis of the activity seemed better than that, more like plus 3%. 
Our orders are up 9% in the quarter to a record. Book-to-bill was really spectacular because we haven't had a book-to-bill above 1.01 for 2.5 years. And this time, we were at -- if you combine Industrial and energy together, the book-to-bill was 1.04 and Medical was 1.03. And RF was even just a hair above 1 but actually had an adjustment in there for some debookings around the business that we're doing something with. And otherwise, it would have been 1.02. So very good backlog at $1.12 billion is also very good. 
Gross margin was spectacular. Gross margin was up 210 basis points to 62.1%. And what's really remarkable given the macroeconomic challenges around the world is each of our 4 segments improved their gross margin in the first quarter. 
EBITDA was up 4% and reached 34% EBITDA margins. We're going to talk some more about that. We still don't report on cash earnings. But increasingly, we need to make sure people understand the quality of our earnings and the cash earnings nature because we just have so much noncash amortization. Our earnings per share in the first quarter were $1.50. Our operating cash flow was $245 million, which represented 27% of our revenue. 
And the recent acquisitions that we made in 2015 are really performing sort of beyond very well. They have outstanding growth. For us, almost all are double-digit growers, so we'll talk more about that throughout today's session. 
We deployed $265 million in acquisitions in the first quarter. We have an extremely big and attractive pipeline that we'll talk a little bit more. 
And so with that, we can move to slide -- next slide, which is 7. On the income statement. Just to kind of back up some idea about how important the orders were, I'll give you our book-to-bill for the last 8 quarters was -- last year, it started out at 0.98 or 1.02 on a consolidated basis here. The next quarter was 0.99 and 1.01 at 0.98. Year before that was 1.01, 0.99, 1.01, 0.98. So if -- you have all the way back to Q2 of '13 to see something as high as the book-to-bill we got here, and that was despite revenue being up. 
Gross profit was up 8%. Our operating income was basically flat to the prior period, but that's only because amortization in the quarter was up 120 basis points. So our $11 million result of which is noncash, so big difference between reporting GAAP operating income and what's really happening on the cash quality of the earnings. 
Interest expense was up $7 million. We did a $900 million bond offering in December, which really went -- kind of termed out what we were doing on the revolver. So it gives us a substantial capacity, well over $1.8 billion, to be able to deploy here a capital deployment throughout the year, and it's certainly worth the $0.05 impact. That said, the difference between last year's $1.55 and $1.50 is, in fact, that $0.05. 
Next slide. If we look here at the operating and EBITDA margins as a company, you'll see that incrementally, the operating margin went from 28.7% to 27.4%. That's with the 120 basis points of amortization. You add it back in, you can see that essentially, it was the same outstanding result as the year before. 
On the right-hand signed, though, you can see the EBITDA margins, which increasingly are more important for us. And here, there's no D in either side of that equation. This is just earnings before interest, tax and amortization. So that's actually up in the last 2 years 130 basis points from 31.6% to 32.9%. Furthermore, this gross margin increase we're getting is encouraging us, which we're doing at a very fast pace to step up our R&D and engineering investment, which in this quarter was up 120 basis points over the first quarter of last year and is now reaching 7% of revenue. 
Next slide. Our asset-light business model continues. We're still easily able to compound our investment in asset-light businesses. And you get some sense about how important that is. So there's 2 aspects to a slide like this: one is our governance process with our existing businesses and the second is the quality of the businesses that we continue to acquire. And at the end of the first quarter just 3 years ago in 2013, our net number here was 7.7%. Today, it's 4%, nearly a 50% reduction in just 3 years. Inventory back in '13 was 6.8%. Today, it's 5.5%. Receivables were 19.3%, and in a tough market for receivables. Today, they're only 17.4%. And payables were 18.4%. And now they're 19%, all going our way. So we go from 7.7% down to 4%. 
And even just in the last 2 years, they've gone from 6.3% to 4%, which is truly a remarkable number. We're very proud of all of our people focusing on asset velocity and the quality of the businesses that new leadership teams are bringing to us as we acquire them. 
Next slide. If you look at our cash flow performance here, you can see in the quarter, operating cash flow was 27% of revenue, free cash flow was 26% of revenue. That's not a gross margin number, that's the free cash flow to revenue number, 26%. Trailing 12 months operating cash conversion is 135%. And even though the cash conversions in the quarter is above 150%, we really thought it's much more balanced to look at the trailing 12 months operating cash flow to eliminate quarterly seasonality that occurs sometimes. So even there, you can see we've gone from $844 million to $913 million. And we fully expect this year's operating cash flow for the full year would be $1 billion or more. 
We're continuing to compound cash flow despite these macroeconomic challenges, and they're quite substantial for us. We had about $100 million of foreign exchange in the last 12 months; and another $100 million of oil and gas headwinds; and also the Toronto project for millions of dollars; and the Puerto Rico escape, which was another $10 million a quarter. So the compounding is still continuing the same way we would expect to continue. And we still think cash is the best measure of performance. 
Next slide. If we look at the financial position, the balance sheet is in really great shape. It gives us tremendous amount of powder for capital deployment, and our pipeline is -- really is good, maybe the best it's ever been. 
Here, you can see we still have $0.5 billion of cash. Our undrawn revolver is actually paid off. Now it's $1.850 billion, which is very substantial. If you looked at cash and the undrawn revolver, you'd be over $2.3 billion. And you could see the EBITDA at $1.256 billion will continue to grow handsomely throughout the year, so we'll have very solid debt ratio opportunities. 
If you look at the last 15 months, we've deployed over $2 billion in acquisitions. And with a $1.8 billion undrawn revolver, we could absolutely repeat that effort and deploy another $2 billion in the next 15 to 18 months. 
Next slide. Here, we get into the very specific segment detail. 
Next slide. So in the first quarter, the segment performance, you can see here, was again very strong all the way across the line on our EBITDA measurements down at the bottom. There are 2 really big messages that we try to convey with this slide: first is that our RF software segment and the medical solutions segments together represent over 3/4 of the company's total EBITDA. But there's an equally important message here on the left-hand side, where we look at the energy and industrial businesses, which remain as really extraordinary businesses. Those 2 businesses you can see have 25% EBITDA in energy. Even with all the difficulty that you see, we have very nimble leadership, and the quality of these businesses still allow us to drive this kind of result. 
If you combine the 2 together, $119 million in energy and $171 million in industrial, you only have $300 million out of our $906 million in revenue, and yet you have $81 million of EBITDA on a $300 million base or 27%. And those EBITDA margins in energy are going to continue to improve throughout the year. So great extraordinary businesses in industrial and energy despite oil and gas. And oil and gas is becoming less and less critical. And here, it's well less than 9% of revenue. 
All right, next slide. We start off with the smallest segment, which is energy. Energy had negative organic in the quarter of 14%. But essentially, all of that was driven by the oil and gas business, which now represents just a little over half of the total segment. 
And inside energy, it's different than the industrial portion of oil and gas because our energy business is primarily downstream, about 75% downstream, about 25% upstream. And the FX, as you can see, it was a point. Oil and gas as a portion of the energy segment was down a little over 20%, which is pretty much consistent with what we expected throughout the year. The biggest challenge in there used to be our diesel engine shutoff valve business. This year, it'll shift over really to our compressor control business, and they're moving quickly to try to address everything they can do from shortfall in projects that we'll see throughout the year. 
Very nimble execution. We haven't really talked to the market about any restructuring we've done, which has been pretty considerable. I will do a little bit more in the second quarter, but we're really not even asking for an adjustment on our restructuring investments because the payback is pretty quick. 
Zetec in the quarter did extremely well. It was up high single digits. There's a lot of activity around the power generation side of nuclear, and Zetec is best-in-class in this area and is going to enjoy some continuing tailwinds for the next couple of years. 
And then just as we move to thinking about the remainder of the year, Q2 through Q4, I'll just remind you that with the pullback in oil and gas, about half of the energy systems business is actually industrial measurement technologies. We expect high single-digit organic decline in the rest of the year, but that's just because of the oil and gas. And then we think we'll get this modest growth in the other half of the sector, and we think margins will improve throughout the year sequentially. And energy, as you can see now, is down to only 9% of the company's EBITDA. 
Next slide. If you look at Industrial Technology, the same situation with the oil and gas. Organic as a segment was down 5%. However, if you exclude oil and gas, industrial was up organically 3% in the quarter. So the upstream activity, which in here is really Roper Pump and a little bit of adjacency there, that upstream is about 80% of the market. And the total value of that is only about $10 million out of $171 million in the segment, so it's down to less than 5% of revenue. 
Neptune had a really strong quarter. They were up double digits and enjoying very good U.S., which overcame the fact this was the last quarter with the negative Toronto project variance, which was millions of dollars of headwind. This segment EBITDA margins, I think you can all look at 2, which were really 30.1% on industrial. So the performance, despite any of the headwinds that you see, is still very solid. 
In second half of the year, we're looking at kind of low single-digit organic growth for the segment. We don't see any improvement in upstream oil and gas. We think that will actually continue to decline a little bit. But we'll have kind of flat to modest growth in all of the other markets, and then very strong growth at Neptune because as we get into the second quarter, the Toronto project tailwind is essentially behind us. And that was worth quite a bit of -- will be quite a bit of positive variance now in 2, 3 and 4. 
Next slide. If we look at the RF and technology and software business, and we have to throw the software recognition in here because the software business is actually becoming as large -- or larger than the tolling business. So when we look at the segment, you can see organic was down 1%. But actually, organic would have been up, excluding the roll-off of the Puerto Rico exit that we had, which was $10 million just in that quarter. 
We had record margin performance throughout the segment, very strong software and SaaS business growth with terrific margins and cash flow in all of those businesses. 
Aderant, our most recent acquisition, is performing very well. We got several new wins, which are strategic importance that the legal community can be talking about and has already started to discuss and comment on our share gains. 
In the toll and traffic area, as we say, our ITS business was down because of Puerto Rico. Our tech business continued to be strong, very good project execution. 
And I also want to point out that, that OP margin, which was up 170 basis points to 32.2%, again belies the quality of the cash margin. Our EBITDA margins were at 39.2%, up 360 basis points over the first quarter of the year ago. As we look to the second quarter, we expect flat organic growth in Q2 only because we still have one more quarter of the Puerto Rico drag of about $10 million, and that's 3 to 4 points. But in the second half, we'll have a much stronger organic growth because the Puerto Rico comps will be going away. 
We'll get multiple opportunities, we think, in the TransCore projects. We have very exceptional amount of bids in line. We're pretty confident in a lot of those. The timing of when those are able to be announced will be important for us. 
And then RF IDeas, which is doing phenomenally well, will become organic in the fourth quarter, so that will help our organic revenue comparisons. 
The software and SaaS businesses should grow kind of mid- to high single digits, which is a little bit better than we might have expected previously, and they give us strong cash returns. And then Aderant is going to continue to gain share, which will help this segment. 
Next slide. Here, we look at the medical solutions. Medical solutions, boy, it's another EBITDA margin story. You see the operating profit margin at 34.7%, but that's just because of a lot of noncash amortization. Our EBITDA margins are 43.5% in medical. Organic was up 2%. Acquisitions added 13%. But medical's organic as a stand-alone portion of the segment was up 6% organically, while imaging was down 13%. We had double-digit growth in the medical products, which really was driven primarily by Verathon and Northern Digital. The acquisitions that we made in this segment are performing extremely well. If you put them all together, they actually are growing both at double-digit revenue and EBITDA basis. 
We had really exceptional growth at Strata, which is up very dramatically, as more hospitals understand what we're doing and are signing up our SaaS solution on their cost visibility and how they contain and structure their costs. 
We acquired a small business called PCI Medical in the quarter, which will boost Civco's offering in ultrasound, and that business has closed and will add some revenue for us. 
If you look at the balance of the year, you have a high single-digit organic growth in the segment. That comes from continued strength in the medical arena. And then Strata, SoftWriters and Data Innovations become organic in Q2, which will make those comps stand out. We have very strong performance in all of those acquisitions. The IPA business that we announced some time ago has done particularly well from a growth perspective. 
Imaging will continue to improve with kind of substantial gains out of Gatan. Gatan, we're pouring a lot of money into innovation at Gatan to focus on cryo-EM markets. These involve significant R&D investments but with really exciting out-year opportunities. Some of you have read about the discovery of the Zika virus and how that was done, and our products were absolutely crucial to the discovery technologies that have been announced recently. 
We have positive contributions from our CliniSys acquisition. Although CliniSys comes in initially at lower margins than the rest of our business, but we'll continue to improve those as we work with them. 
Sunquest investments in genetics continues. We acquired on the -- just a day after the quarter so we didn't include it in here GeneInsight, which is a technology and business that was really built by Partners Health that we've been doing in concert with and will have long-term implications in the out-years here at medical. 
Also, I will just say that when you look at medical in this pie chart down here, it's 43% of the company's total EBITDA. And to put that in perspective, you can see energy the smallest piece of that pie, and industrial is the next smallest. Those 2 together are only 24% of our EBITDA, and medical is 43% and RF is 33%. So you can see what the future looks like. 
Next slide. So here, we'll get into the guidance of the company for the balance of the year. 
Next slide. So the guidance update. We're going to continue our current guidance, as we articulated at the beginning of the year. So we said the full year would be between $6.85 and $7.15 with the midpoint at $7, and then operating cash flow will be about $1 billion. And our tax rate guidance is the same as it was at the beginning of the year. And really everything else, we see the same sort of revenue opportunities. There's one thing we'd say about the second quarter, where we established the guidance at $1.56 to $1.61. We had an extraordinarily low tax rate in the second quarter last year. I think some people were maybe not looking at carefully. Tax rate was only 25%. We would expect the tax rate in the second quarter to be 30% to 30.5%. 
Another piece of good news when we look at FY, really comfortable with the second half of the year, is that we're not really seeing any industrial contagion at all in those portions of either industrial or the energy businesses that are not oil and gas. And certainly, at the beginning of the year, that was something that many people were worried about. And the high end of our range will really just be dependent on adoption rates and project timing and seasonal activity. So we feel quite good about reinforcing the full year guidance. 
Next slide. If we look at the summary of 2016, it -- pretty simple series of things here, right? Revenue is up 4.4%. Medical and software and Neptune were able to offset all of the declines in oil and gas. Our orders reached record level and got over a $1 billion backlog. Our gross margin, which would let you know how customers continue to feel about us and the products and services we provide, were up 210 basis points. And as we said, each of the 4 segments increased their gross margin. We're investing at the fastest rate in our history in R&D. Our EBITA margin, you can see, is 32.9%. Not all EBITDA is the same. We're always sometimes a little frustrated. People tell us about somebody's EBITDA margins. But it's really mostly D, and then the CapEx sucks it away. In our world, the leakage between EBITDA at 34% and EBITA, 32.9%, is only 110 basis points. 
EBITDA, as we said, was up 4% to 3.07%. Acquisitions, performing very well. We really can't say enough about how well the acquired leadership teams are performing and how well they've embraced the Roper governance process. Every single one of these acquisitions is outperforming our expectation. And we have a very attractive pipeline. We'd expect -- as said earlier, we expect to deploy over $1 billion in the year, and it could easily be more than that. 
So a great quarter, on track for record 2016. And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

So in our world, we look at the cash return on investment. So in that case, if you look at the net earnings of the business and then you add back the noncash charges and you divide it by the gross investment, which is the physical plant and equipment plus accumulated depreciation plus net working capital, all of those acquisitions are well above 100% cash returns. Many of them are in the several 100% cash return basis. And some of them get paid in advance for what they do, so they have a negative cash return, which is even more powerful. So they're all doing very well. I think as a general rule anymore, you can assume that our acquisitions are going to come in and they're going to be substantially above the 34% EBITDA margin that the overall enterprise has and that they're going to have higher gross margins than the enterprise and they're going to have higher cash returns than the enterprise."

So just think about what -- when we think about it, it's very simple, is we're going to deploy our cash flow, we're going to lever this 3x or more that to the acquired EBITDA.

We've had some dividends or whatever, and we multiply that for the acquisitions, it'd be very easy for us to deploy $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion all the time. So that's why we say we'll deploy $8 billion over the next 4 or 5 years. And as we said, we deployed $2 billion in the last 15 months. We could easily deploy $2 billion in the next 15 months.

So there's -- doesn't bother us in any way. Now medical products had spectacular performance versus the medical software, which -- and services, so we would kind of put Sunquest and MHA and then medical software services component, and they were down a little bit organically in the first quarter. Medical products was up more than double digits. And then of course, we still have a little bit of corruption around imaging because we've actually been intentionally winding down certain kinds of imaging businesses while we're going to have much better growth in Gatan. But the camera stuff is -- we're trying to only participate in profitable markets and the like. So I don't know if that helps you, but that's the best way to explain it."

They would either go to a strategic or they get flipped to another private equity group. So I think there's a lot of forces at work. There's certainly been lumpy feedback to sellers about just how much debt capacity they can get on things, although, frankly, we don't ever see any. Well, we see one thing right now. It's got a 6x staple, but another one that we're really pursuing has a 6.75 staple. And there's still some 7 staples. But the cost of debt has flipped around quite a lot. Sometimes, the mezzanine portion of unsecured bonds are 10.5%, and other times are 9%. And the LIBOR at floor comes into play sometimes and maybe they get 4.75% on the term loan. But there really isn't because there'll be a LIBOR floor of 100 and 5.75%. So I do think that there are a lot of private equity people, who feel that they've got an asset that they're going to sell in the foreseeable future. It may still be as good a time now to sell. And they change weekly. I mean, first, they're very opportunistic, right? So our own situation, we're not affected by those things, and our ability to finance stuff is certainly easier and better than their cost to debt. So I think that helps. But also, there's -- a lot of things we're looking have -- they have been in various portfolios for a while, and they need to get out. They might be more worried about the financing markets in 2017 and -- than they are now, so I can't think of a time we made a call to somebody to talk about their business that they haven't said come on over."

So the idea that we're going to be up 2% to 4% organically over the course of the year is not a big challenge. I mean, we should do pretty well in the second half. Now things that can affect that are going to be the adoption rate of new products and some versions of software that are rolling out in the second half, and you never know what those adoption rates will look like, right? So if they're high, then we have a much better opportunity to get to that midpoint number and above. If they're moderate, then it's harder. The second thing are the tolling projects. We have an enormous amount, a bid activity right now, but there's never anything us as a supplier can do to influence the beginning or the execution of those projects. So if they go at an expected pace, then that helps. If they go at a slow pace, then it's not particularly helpful. And then last year, we got nothing out of the year in instrumentation businesses in terms of seasonality. That's the only time that's happened in a decade. So we would expect to get some more modest return to seasonality in the fourth quarter in those instrumentation businesses. So those are the things that will determine where we're at.

But we haven't gone to the point of saying, well, here's what the cash earnings are and here's our share count, that's the earnings -- cash earnings per share basis. We think investors are smart enough to figure that out."

Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Rob Crisci, Vice President of Planning and Investor Relations. 
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. That press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also on our website. 
If you turn to Slide 2, we'll begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described on this page, and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. Next slide. 
Today, we'll be discussing our results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also is a part of this presentation on our website. 
For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consist of 3 items: our normal adjustments related to recently acquired businesses on both deferred revenue and inventory valuation, which total $3 million to both revenue and income measures. 
We've also adjusted our operating cash flow to account for the cash taxes paid in the first quarter for the ABEL divestiture. The ABEL divestiture, you may recall, was completed in the fourth quarter last year. 
GAAP requires this amount, $37 million in those tax payments, to be recorded as an operating cash flow item even though it is related to that divestiture. We've added this $37 million back to reflect the ongoing nature of our cash flow. 
And now if you'll please turn to Slide 4, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and after his remarks, we'll take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?"

And while we're doing that, we'll comment on the second quarter and full year guidance at the end, and then take your questions. 
Next slide. So we start with the Q1 enterprise results. Go to the next slide, Slide 6. You can see there's a lot of great things here. It was a very, very good quarter for us and, certainly, puts us on track for a record 2016. 
But just one word I'd say before we get started. Mr. Humphrey over here is actually just celebrating this month his 10th completed year with the enterprise. And as John refers to it, it's actually his 40th quarter. So with that, let's take a look at our first quarter, right? Congratulations, John. 
Revenue was up 4.4% to $906 million versus the first quarter of a year ago. And organic, you can see it was down 3.2%, which is really not the story because, excluding oil and gas, the company's organic was actually up around 1%. And if you look at the headwinds that we knew we had with the end of Toronto and Puerto Rico and so forth, really, the underlying basis of the activity seemed better than that, more like a plus 3%. 
Our orders are up 9% in the quarter to a record. Book-to-bill was really spectacular because we haven't had a book-to-bill above 1.01 for 2.5 years. And this time, we were at -- if you combine Industrial and energy together, the book-to-bill was 1.04 and Medical was 1.03. And RF was even just a hair above 1 but actually had an adjustment in there for some debookings around a business that we're doing something with. And -- or otherwise, it would have been 1.02 so very good. Backlog at $1.12 billion is also very good. 
Gross margin was spectacular. Gross margin was up 210 basis points to 62.1%. And what's really remarkable given the macroeconomic challenges around the world is each of our 4 segments improved their gross margin in the first quarter. 
EBITDA was up 4% and reached 34% EBITDA margins. We're going to talk some more about that. We still don't report on cash earnings. But increasingly, we need to make sure people understand the quality of our earnings and the cash earnings nature because we just have so much noncash amortization. Our earnings per share in the first quarter were $1.50. Our operating cash flow was $245 million, which represented 27% of our revenue. 
And the recent acquisitions that we made in 2015 are really performing sort of beyond very well. They have outstanding growth -- almost all are double-digit growers, and we'll talk more about that throughout today's session. 
We deployed $265 million in acquisitions in the first quarter. We have an extremely big and attractive pipeline that we'll talk a little bit more. 
And so with that, we can move to slide -- next slide, which is 7. On the income statement. Just to kind of back up, some idea about how important the orders were, I'll give you our book-to-bill for the last 8 quarters was -- last year, it started out at 0.98 and we're at 1.02 on a consolidated basis here. The next quarter was 0.99 then 1.01 up 0.98. Year before that was 1.01, 0.99, 1.01, 0.98. So if -- you have to go all the way back to Q2 of '13 to see something as high as the book-to-bill we got here, and that was despite revenue being up. 
Gross profit was up 8%. Our operating income was basically flat to the prior period, but that's only because amortization in the quarter was up 120 basis points or $11 million all of which is noncash, so big difference between reporting GAAP operating income and what's really happening on the cash quality of your earnings. 
Interest expense was up $7 million. We did a $900 million bond offering in December, which really went -- kind of termed out what we were doing on the revolver. So it gives us substantial capacity, well over $1.8 billion, to be able to deploy here in capital deployment throughout the year, and it's certainly worth the $0.05 impact. That said, the difference between last year's $1.55 and $1.50 is, in fact, that $0.05. 
Next slide. If we look here at the operating and EBITDA margins as a company, you'll see that, incrementally, the operating margin went from 28.7% to 27.4%. That's with the 120 basis points of amortization. You add it back in, you can see that, essentially, it was the same outstanding result as the year before. 
On the right-hand signed, though, you can see the EBITA margins, which increasingly are more important for us. And here, there's no D in either side of that equation. This is just earnings before interest, tax and amortization. So that's actually up in the last 2 years 130 basis points from 31.6% to 32.9%. Furthermore, this gross margin increase that we're getting is encouraging us, which we're doing at a very fast pace, to step up our R&D and engineering investment, which in this quarter was up 120 basis points over the first quarter of last year and is now reaching 7% of revenue. 
Next slide. Our asset-light business model continues. We're still easily able to compound our investment in asset-light businesses. And you get some sense about how important that is. So there's 2 aspects to a slide like this: one is our governance process with our existing businesses and the second is the quality of the businesses that we continue to acquire. And at the end of the first quarter just 3 years ago in 2013, our net number here was 7.7%. Today, it's 4%, nearly a 50% reduction in just 3 years. Inventory back in '13 was 6.8%. Today, it's 5.5%. Receivables were 19.3%, and in a tough market for receivables. Today, they're only 17.4%. And payables were 18.4%. And now they're 19%, all going our way. So we go from 7.7% down to 4%. 
And even just in the last 2 years, they've gone from 6.3% to 4%, which is truly a remarkable number. We're very proud of all of our people focusing on asset velocity and the quality of the businesses that new leadership teams are bringing to us as we acquire them. 
Next slide. If you look at our cash flow performance here, you can see in the quarter, operating cash flow was 27% of revenue, free cash flow was 26% of revenue. That's not a gross margin number, that's the free cash flow to revenue number, 26%. Trailing 12 months operating cash conversion is 135%. And even though the cash conversions -- the quarter is above 150%, we really thought it's much more balanced to look at the trailing 12 months operating cash flow to eliminate quarterly seasonality that occurs sometimes. So even there, you can see we've gone from $844 million to $913 million. And we fully expect this year's operating cash flow for the full year would be $1 billion or more. 
We're continuing to compound cash flow despite these macroeconomic challenges, and they're quite substantial for us. We had about $100 million of foreign exchange in the last 12 months; and another $100 million of oil and gas headwinds; and also the Toronto project for millions of dollars; and the Puerto Rico escape, which was another $10 million a quarter. So the compounding is still continuing the same way we would expect it to continue. And we still think cash is the best measure of performance. 
Next slide. If we look at the financial position, the balance sheet is in really great shape. It gives us tremendous amount of powder for capital deployment, and our pipeline is -- really is good, maybe the best it's ever been. 
Here, you can see we still have $0.5 billion of cash. Our undrawn revolver is actually paid off. Now it's $1.850 billion, which is very substantial. If you looked at cash and the undrawn revolver, you'd be over $2.3 billion. And you could see the EBITDA at $1.256 billion will continue to grow handsomely throughout the year, so we'll have very solid debt ratio opportunities. 
If you look at the last 15 months, we've deployed over $2 billion in acquisitions. And with a $1.8 billion undrawn revolver, we could absolutely repeat that effort and deploy another $2 billion in the next 15 to 18 months. 
Next slide. Here, we get into the very specific segment detail. 
Next slide. So in the first quarter, the segment performance, you can see here, was again very strong all the way across the line on our EBITDA measurements down at the bottom. There are 2 really big messages that we try to convey with this slide: first is that our RF software segment and the medical solutions segments together represent over 3/4 of the company's total EBITDA. But there's an equally important message here on the left-hand side, where we look at the energy and industrial businesses, which remain as really extraordinary businesses. Those 2 businesses you can see have 25% EBITDA. In energy, even with all of the difficulty that you see, we have very nimble leadership, and the quality of those businesses still allow us to drive this kind of result. 
If you combine the 2 together, $119 million in energy and $171 million in industrial, you only have $300 million out of our $906 million in revenue, and yet you have $81 million of EBITDA on a $300 million base or 27%. And those EBITDA margins in energy are going to continue to improve throughout the year. So great extraordinary businesses in industrial and energy despite oil and gas. And oil and gas is becoming less and less critical. And here, it's well less than 9% of revenue. 
All right, next slide. We start off with the smallest segment, which is energy. Energy had negative organic in the quarter of 14%. But essentially, all of that was driven by the oil and gas business, which now represents just a little over half of the total segment. 
And inside energy, it's different than the industrial portion of oil and gas because our energy business is primarily downstream, about 75% downstream, about 25% upstream. And the FX, as you can see, was a point. Oil and gas as a portion of the energy segment was down a little over 20%, which is pretty much consistent with what we expected throughout the year. The biggest challenge in there used to be our diesel engine shutoff valve business. This year, it'll shift over really to our compressor control business, and they're moving quickly to try to address everything they can do from a shortfall in projects that we'll see throughout the year. 
Very nimble execution. We haven't really talked to the market about any restructuring we've done, which has been pretty considerable. I -- we'll do a little bit more in the second quarter, but we're really not even asking for an adjustment on our restructuring investments because the payback is pretty quick. 
Zetec in the quarter did extremely well. It was up high single digits. There's a lot of activity around the power generation side of nuclear, and Zetec is best-in-class in this area and is going to enjoy some continuing tailwinds for the next couple of years. 
And then just as we move to thinking about the remainder of the year, Q2 through Q4, I'd just remind you that with the pullback in oil and gas, about half of the energy systems business is actually industrial measurement technologies. We expect high single-digit organic decline in the rest of the year, but that's just because of the oil and gas. And then we think we'll get this modest growth in the other half of the sector, and we think margins will improve throughout the year, sequentially. And energy, as you can see now, is down to only 9% of the company's EBITDA. 
Next slide. If you look at Industrial Technology, the same situation with the oil and gas. Organic as a segment was down 5%. However, if you exclude oil and gas, industrial was up, organically, 3% in the quarter. So the upstream activity, which in here is really Roper Pump and a little bit of adjacency there, that upstream is about 80% of the market. And the total value of that is only about $10 million out of $171 million in the segment, so it's down to less than 5% of revenue. 
Neptune had a really strong quarter. They were up double digits and enjoying very good U.S., which overcame the fact this was the last quarter with the negative Toronto project variance, which was millions of dollars of headwind. This segment EBITDA margins, I think you've got to look at, too, which were really 30.1% on industrial. So the performance, despite any of the headwinds that you see, is still very solid. 
In second half of the year, we're looking at kind of low single-digit organic growth for the segment. We don't see any improvement in upstream oil and gas. We think that will actually continue to decline a little bit. But we'll have kind of flat to modest growth in all of the other markets, and then very strong growth at Neptune because as we get into the second quarter, the Toronto project tailwind is, essentially, behind us. And that was worth quite a bit of -- will be quite a bit of positive variance now in 2, 3 and 4. 
Next slide. If we look at the RF and technology and software business, and we have to throw the software recognition in here because the software business is actually becoming as large -- or larger than the tolling business. So when we look at the segment, you can see organic was down 1%. But actually, organic would have been up, excluding the roll-off of the Puerto Rico exit that we had, which was $10 million just in that quarter. 
We had record margin performance throughout the segment, very strong software and SaaS business growth with terrific margins and cash flow in all of those businesses. 
Aderant, our most recent acquisition, is performing very well. We got several new wins, which are of strategic importance that the legal community can be talking about and has already started to discuss and comment on our share gains. 
In the toll and traffic area, as we say, our ITS business was down because of Puerto Rico. Our tag business continued to be strong, very good project execution. 
And I also want to point out that, that OP margin, which was up 170 basis points to 32.2%, again belies the quality of the cash margin. Our EBITDA margins were at 39.2%, up 360 basis points over the first quarter of a year ago. As we look to the second quarter, we expect flat organic growth in Q2 only because we still have one more quarter of the Puerto Rico drag of about $10 million, and that's 3 to 4 points. But in the second half, we'll have a much stronger organic growth because the Puerto Rico comps will be going away. 
We'll get multiple opportunities, we think, in the TransCore projects. We have a very exceptional amount of bids in line and pretty confident in a lot of those. The timing of when those are able to be announced will be important for us. 
And then RF IDeas, which is doing phenomenally well, will become organic in the fourth quarter, so that will help our organic revenue comparisons. 
The software and SaaS businesses should grow kind of mid- to high single digits, which is a little bit better than we might have expected previously, and they give us strong cash returns. And then Aderant is going to continue to gain share, which will help this segment. 
Next slide. Here, we look at the medical solutions. Medical solutions, boy, it's another EBITDA margin story. You see the operating profit margin at 34.7%, but that's just because of a lot of noncash amortization. Our EBITDA margins are 43.5% in medical. Organic was up 2%. Acquisitions added 13%. But medical's organic as a stand-alone portion of the segment was up 6% organically, while imaging was down 13%. We had double-digit growth in the medical products, which really was driven, primarily, by Verathon and Northern Digital. The acquisitions that we made in this segment are performing extremely well. If you put them all together, they actually are growing both at double-digit revenue and EBITDA basis. 
We had really exceptional growth at Strata, which is up very dramatically, as more hospitals understand what we're doing and are signing up for our SaaS solution on their cost visibility and how to contain and structure their costs. 
We acquired a small business called PCI Medical in the quarter, which will boost CIVCO's offering in ultrasound, and that business has closed and will add some revenue for us. 
If you look at the balance of the year, you have a high single-digit organic growth in the segment. That comes from continued strength in the medical arena. And then Strata, SoftWriters and Data Innovations become organic in Q2, which will make those comps stand out. We have very strong performance in all of those acquisitions. The IPA business that we announced some time ago has done particularly well from a growth perspective. 
Imaging will continue to improve with kind of substantial gains out of Gatan. Gatan, we're pouring a lot of money into innovation at Gatan to focus on cryo-EM markets. These involve significant R&D investments but with really exciting out-year opportunities. Some of you have read about the discovery of the Zika virus and how that was done, and our products were absolutely crucial to the discovery technologies that have been announced recently. 
We have positive contributions from our CliniSys acquisition. Although CliniSys comes in, initially, at lower margins than the rest of our business, but we'll continue to improve those as we work with them. 
Sunquest investments in genetics continues. We acquired on the -- just a day after the quarter so we didn't include it in here, GeneInsight, which is a technology and business that was really built by Partners Health that we've been doing in concert with and will have long-term implications in the out-years here at medical. 
Also, I would just say that when you look at medical in this pie chart down here, it's 43% of the company's total EBITDA. And to put that in perspective, you can see there's energy the smallest piece of that pie, and industrial is the next smallest. Those 2 together are only 24% of our EBITDA, and medical is 43% and RF is 33%. So you can see what the future looks like. 
Next slide. So here, we'll get into the guidance of the company for the balance of the year. 
Next slide. So the guidance update. We're going to continue our current guidance, as we articulated at the beginning of the year. So we said the full year would be between $6.85 and $7.15 with the midpoint at $7, and that operating cash flow will be about $1 billion. And our tax rate guidance is the same as it was at the beginning of the year. And really everything else, we see the same sort of revenue opportunities. There's one thing we'd say about the second quarter, where we established the guidance at $1.56 to $1.61. We had an extraordinarily low tax rate in the second quarter last year that I think some people were maybe not looking at carefully. Tax rate was only 25%. We would expect the tax rate in the second quarter to be 30% to 30.5%. 
Another piece of good news when we look at FY and we're really comfortable with the second half of the year, is that we're not really seeing any industrial contagion at all in those portions of either industrial or the energy businesses that are not oil and gas. And certainly, at the beginning of the year, that was something that many people were worried about. And the high end of our range will really just be dependent on adoption rates and project timing and seasonal activity. So we feel quite good about reinforcing the full year guidance. 
Next slide. If we look at the summary of 2016, it -- pretty simple series of things here, right? Revenue is up 4.4%. Medical and software and Neptune were able to offset all of the declines in oil and gas. Our orders reached record level and got over a $1 billion backlog. Our gross margin, which would let you know how customers continue to feel about us and the products and services we provide, were up 210 basis points. And as we said, each of the 4 segments increased their gross margin. We're investing at the fastest rate in our history in R&D. Our EBITA margin, you can see, is 32.9%. Not all EBITDA is the same. We're always sometimes a little frustrated. People tell us about somebody's EBITDA margins. But it's really mostly D, and then the CapEx sucks it away. In our world, the leakage between EBITDA at 34% and EBITA, 32.9%, is only 110 basis points. 
EBITDA, as we said, was up 4% to 3.07%. Acquisitions, performing very well. We really can't say enough about how well the acquired leadership teams are performing and how well they've embraced the Roper governance process. Every single one of these acquisitions is outperforming our expectation. And we have a very attractive pipeline. We'd expect -- we had said earlier this year, we expect to deploy over $1 billion in the year, and it could easily be more than that.

So in our world, we look at the cash return on investment. So in that case, if you look at the net earnings of the business and then you add back the noncash charges and you divide it by the gross investment, which is the physical plant and equipment plus accumulated depreciation plus net working capital, all of those acquisitions are well above 100% cash returns. Many of them are in the several 100% cash return basis. And some of them get paid in advance for what they do, so they have a negative cash return, which is even more powerful. So they're all doing very well. I think as a general rule anymore, you can assume that our acquisitions are going to come in and they're going to be substantially above the 34% EBITDA margin that the overall enterprise has and that they're going to have higher gross margins than the enterprise and they're going to have higher cash returns than the enterprise."

They would either go to a strategic or they get flipped to another private equity group. So I think there's a lot of forces at work. There's certainly been lumpy feedback to sellers about just how much debt capacity they can get on things, although, frankly, we don't ever see any -- well, we see one thing right now. It's got a 6x staple, but another one that we're really pursuing has a 6.75 staple. And there's still some 7 staples. But the cost of debt has flipped around quite a lot. Sometimes, the mezzanine portion of unsecured bonds are 10.5%, and other times they're 9%. And the LIBOR floor comes into play sometimes. Maybe they get 4.75% on the term loan, but it really isn't because there'll be a LIBOR floor of 100 -- paying 5.75%. So I do think that there are a lot of private equity people who feel that they've got an asset that they're going to sell in the foreseeable future. It may still be as good a time now to sell. And they change weekly. I mean, first, they're very opportunistic, right? So our own situation, we're not affected by those things, and our ability to finance stuff is certainly easier and better than their cost to debt. So I think that helps. But also, there's -- a lot of things we're looking at have -- they have been in various portfolios for a while, and they need to get out. They might be more worried about the financing markets in 2017 and -- than they are now, so I can't think of a time we made a call to somebody to talk to them about their business that they haven't said come on over."

So the idea that we're going to be up 2% to 4% organically over the course of the year is not a big challenge. I mean, we should do pretty well in the second half. Now things that can affect that are going to be the adoption rate of new products and some versions of software that are rolling out in the second half, and you never know what those adoption rates will look like, right? So if they're high, then we have a much better opportunity to get to that midpoint number and above. If they're moderate, then it's harder. The second thing are the tolling projects. We have an enormous amount of bid activity right now. But there's never anything us, as a supplier, can do to influence the beginning of the execution of those projects. So if they go at an expected pace, then that helps. If they go at a slow pace, then it's not particularly helpful. And then last year, we got nothing out of the year-end instrumentation businesses in terms of seasonality. That's the only time that's happened in a decade. So we would expect to get some more modest return to seasonality in the fourth quarter in those instrumentation businesses. So those are the things that will determine where we're at. But within our guidance, we're certainly comfortable that we're going to be within our guidance for the year irrespective of what happens with Q2 orders."

We'll take a quick look at sort of summary, an enterprise financial results here in the quarter and then look at individual performance of the segments and the outlook for each segments and then turn to the guidance for the remainder of the year and go to Q&A. 
So next slide is simply the introduction to the Q2 enterprise results. Next slide is the explanation of so. 
Orders were actually up to a record $956 million. They were up 9% in the quarter and our book to bill for the enterprise was 1.02. 
Revenue was up 5% to $934 million versus last year's first quarter. Organic revenue was down 2%. We had the divestiture that's still in our numbers through the third quarter, the ABEL divestiture, which pulled 1% away and acquisition were up 80%. 
We had really terrific growth in Medical and in software, in water, we'll talk more about that within those respective segments. 
But the oil and gas declines were actually worse than we expected. We went into the year thinking that we'd be down may be in the high teens to 20%. In the quarter, we were down 25%. But in the upstream areas, we were down dramatically more, 44%, 51%, 52% numbers that really were amazing for us. Those are, of course, all businesses, so they all are directly EPS-type businesses because they don't have much in the way of noncash amortization. 
The toll and traffic project delay was also a little bit of a disappointment as Saudi is rolling out their program slowly. We're on track with everything we do, but their rate of initiation of new zones has been slow. 
Our gross margin was another record, up 90 basis points to 61% and EBITDA was up to $314 million, 33.6% of revenue. 
Our DEPS number at $1.56 was disappointing from our perspective because it did hit the low end of the range but in the quarter where we had record orders of record sales, record backlog and record EBITDA and operating profit, we just came up a little light on the revenue side from the oil and gas and project delays, each of which probably cost us $6 million to $7 million of revenue, and that's why we were $1.56 at the low range instead of being up at the higher end up $1.61. 
Our operating cash flow was $170 million, which is strong in Q2. Year-to-date, our operating cash flow has been $414 million, which is 23% of revenue, and that's a particularly pleasing number when you're going through the sort of oil and gas decline that you could still maintain these kind of ratios. 
Our recent acquisitions are performing well. We have an extremely strong pipeline, which is very active. We'll talk about it a little bit. 
So it was a solid quarter, but we did have to adjust our outlook for the economic realities we see in the second half of the year, and we'll talk about that when we get to guidance. 
Next slide. Here, we're looking at Q2 income statement. As you can see, orders up 9%; book to bill, 1.02; revenue, up 5%; gross profit was up 6%; gross margin, up 90 basis points. The operating income ratio is 27.4% versus last year's 28.5%, but as you can see, amortization increased by $10 million and our EBITDA performance, if we were reporting that way, would look better in terms of continued sustained upward trends in our ratios. 
The earnings before tax number was down 2% and the tax rate was a relatively big headwind in the quarter, although the tax rate is really sort of appropriate for us at 29.8%. 
Last year, we had extremely unusual event in the Q2 numbers, which was $15.9 million of a good guide that came from a long-term settlement of a tax position, and that really, that $1.70, if you adjust it, for the $0.16 of that onetime benefit would have been $1.54 and this year, we're at $1.56. 
Next slide. If we look here at the revenue bridge, I think most people find this to be quite surprising. The underlying core nature of the business is continuing to grow at double digits. 
Here, you can see, if we look at last year's second quarter, we printed $892 million. That included the $10 million Puerto Rico situation that we were trying to get out of because of all the reasons everybody knows. We were successful, but it's still in the number in the second quarter at $10 million. Now we have the divestiture of the Eastern German pump company for $6 million and then the oil and gas decrement in the second quarter alone was $33 million. 
So those things were at $49 million headwind. If we look at the base entity, 43, you'll see we added $91 million to that number, so while the total revenue is up 5%, the revenue, excluding the oil and gas and these things that are anniversary-ing was up 11%. It's really almost identical to what happened in the first quarter where if you exclude oil and gas in Puerto Rico and divestiture, we were also up 11%. 
The good news is that for the balance of the year, we think the second half will be similar, where we got more than 10%, excluding oil and gas but will have a better organic growth so there'll be a little less in the acquisition dollars and more in the organic growth dollars where at least until we do another acquisition. 
So actually we felt the growth is pretty solid despite the headwinds. 
Next slide. Here, you can see that we continue with the governance process we have to make remarkable progress in our asset-light business model. 2 years ago, our inventory was at 6% of revenue and at the end of June, this year, it's down to 5.1% so a 90 basis point improvement. Receivables actually declined from 17.7% to 16.9%, so we got faster receivables and payables and [indiscernible] went up as we like, from 17.4% to 18.9%. 
So we literally cut our working capital as a function of annualized sales in half in the last 2 years from 6.2% to 3.1%. And that really speaks to the quality of the work that all of our independent operating people do at executing our strategy. 
Next slide. On cash flow performance, again, extremely good cash flow performance. Year-to-date, it's $414 million, which is 23% of revenue. Our free cash flow was 22% of revenue and our operating cash flow conversion was 132%. 
And note on this slide, you'll see in 2 years ago, our year-to-date cash flow had been $353 million, and last year, we printed $433 million. But $20 million of that was a onetime payment by Puerto Rico as we got out of that situation with Puerto Rico. So it's real money, but it wasn't onetime event. 
So if you take the $20 million, you're looking at $413 million [ph] and this year is $414 million. Our cash performance will be even stronger in the second half. But still conversion is great. 
Next slide. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to be a very well positioned. You can see that they got completely undrawn revolver of $1.850 billion at the moment, up from $1.185 billion last year. So if you look at the cash on undrawn revolver, you're getting about $2.5 billion. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA is $1.267 billion, so our net debt number to EBITDA is running about $1.9 billion -- or 1.9x, and that's after in that 12-month period, we've invested $1.450 billion.  So after -- well $1.45 billion, we still have a 1.9x debt-to-EBITDA number so ample liquidity. We've got a very active pipeline and really, most of the newer acquisitions that we're involved with now in late stages are application software companies, and it's likely we'll be doing something soon. 
Next slide. Here, we'll look at the individual detail and the outlook for each one of the segments. 
Next slide. All 4 segments continue to perform remarkably well. When you look at the kind of all up in the oil and gas that affects the energy business and to a lesser degree, the Industrial Technology because Roper Pumps is sitting there. 
Here these 2 are clipping along with energy at 26%, EBITDA to revenue and actually sequentially up for the first quarter. And Industrial Technology at 31%. So those remain remarkable performance numbers. 
Our software business at 38%, Medical at 43%. As you can see in te4h enterprise as a whole, running at 37% without the corporate expense. 
Next slide. So we'll take the largest segment first, which is Medical. Here you can see that revenue was up 12%, 19 -- 8 points of acquisition and 4 points overall organic revenue, although Imaging pulled that down by 1 point. So medical organic in the quarter was 5%, which is the 10th consecutive quarter that our medical organic revenue has been mid-single digits or better. We certainly don't see that slowing. 
Growth was really led by the adoption of new products in 3 of our medical product companies and software businesses as well. We had strong adoption of our ultimate site Healthware Solution businesses where as SHP and SoftWriters were growing at a very high rate and our internal software within MHA did well as well. 
Our new product launches at Sunquest, which should be very important for 2017 and hopefully, important yet as the year winds down, are launched and on schedule. We've got the sales pipeline, which is growing, growing really rapidly, and we had a couple of large people that we're talking to, but we would expect to begin to see that affect the second half results favorably, which we'll see below. 
In the second half, we think that the organic growth in Medical is going to be in the sort of 6% to 9% range. The product growth that we have in the core products are going to continue. We think that trend, the alternate site growth strength and tear because we are getting some real push out of SHP and SoftWriters becoming organic rather than just acquisitions.  Anyway it actually has same favorable comps that we benefit MHA as the year unfolds. 
The laboratory software orders are going to increase on the adoption many new products and while they're literally over 15 different things that are being launched, there are 4 core large launches around analytics and diagnostic communities and integrated pathologies and clinical content that we think will drive the future of Sunquest. 
Our Imaging businesses are going to benefit in the second half as the cryo-EM technology emergence is getting better understood by people and sort of our phones are ringing off the hook. They have a strong backlog going into the second half and their product releases are on schedule. 
Importantly, and here when you look at the operating profit margin, you see 33.7%, which is down from the prior year. A couple of reasons for that, the newer acquisitions have a lot of amortization. In fact, the second quarter number at 33.7% for OP when you add back the noncash amortization at 7.9%, you wind up at 41.6% for the -- every dollar of revenue contributing. 
And an on EBITDA basis, it's nearly 43%. So good mix between Medical products and software and service. And then Imaging should do better in the second half. 
Next slide. In the RF segment, which is really now increasingly split between RF and Software, you can see revenue was up 14%, acquisitions were up 18%, organic was down 4%. But the organic revenue on our software and SaaS business segment was up 9%. 
Our toll and traffic had very strong orders but our revenue declined because of the Puerto Rico contract, which finally anniversary-ed in the second quarter, so that's a $10 million headwind that goes away. And then the Riyadh project is moving much more slowly. It could easily be $20 million less than what we were told earlier in the year, which is part of the reason for our guide down on the earnings profile. It's still going to continue to happen, the contribution margin we're getting as it rolls out is fine. It's just it's moving more slowly, and it's not the only thing going into Saudi Arabia these days, it's moving very slowly. 
We had very strong segment book to bill here at 1.09. Orders were up 26% with organic orders being up 9. Again, lots of amortization in this segment so you're see an OP margin of 31.5%, which is up 20 basis points, but when you add back the amortization, which is 5.8% of revenue in the segment, and you see the EBITDA number, it's 37.3, the EBITDA number is 38.1, up 190 basis points from the second quarter of last year. 
We see at bottom here in terms of forecasting revenue for the balance of the year earnings. The segment organic revenue, we think would be up 5% to 7%. Toll and traffic will improve in the second half. We've gotten strong orders in Q2. The execution of those should be pretty favorable, and we have a big pipeline of opportunity. What has caused us to slow down the guidance for the balance of the year and is that decision-making process around that has been slower than normal. And whether that's related to an election situation with people wondering about kind of ensuring their commitments is something that's not clear. 
Our software and SaaS businesses continue to grow at high single digits with incredible cash returns that turns other investments and acquisitions. 
And then RFID business and our On Center acquisitions from last year will go to organic in the fourth quarter, which is why you'll see this greater mix of organic in the second half of the year and less on acquisitions than you did in the first 2 quarters. 
Next slide. On the Industrial Technology segment. Here, you can see that orders declined -- well actually orders were up 3%,but the organic growth declined by 1%. The divestiture was 3%. 
The organic, if we exclude oil and gas and industrial, was up 4%. The problem with this segment was simply that the upstream was worse than expected for Roper Pump, and we had expected a big down, but it was down 44%. A little bigger than we had anticipated. The good news is it does appear that, that's the bottom of the situation. And of course, Roper Pump impact for the segment is dramatically be escalated as the revenue has dropped so much over the last 2 years. 
Neptune on the other hand is doing extremely well. They had double-digit growth in the second quarter on both orders and revenue. They continue to gain share in the marketplace despite people other people that are trying to sale their businesses. Neptune will continue to have record performance. 
The material analysis portion of the business, sort of test and measurement had record orders in the second quarter, which is very encouraging because revenue had been down sort of high single digits, so that bodes well for the second half. 
If you look at second half, we think that the overall organic revenue in the business will be flat because we don't see any improvement in the upstream markets, although there is a declining impact in the segment as the underlying base business of Roper Pump is getting very strong. 
Neptune and instrumentation will be able to offset any of the declines we have in oil and gas and finally, in the fourth quarter, the divestiture will anniversary and go away. 
Next slide. Here, we look at the Energy Systems & Controls segment. You can see that revenue there was down 15%, and it's really a tale of 2 different businesses, the Test and Measurement business, which was okay. And then the Oil and Gas businesses, which were off. So oil and gas was down 25% in the segment, and that really doesn't quite tell the story either because our Petroleum Analyzer business, if you exclude its small portion of the upstream [indiscernible] was really flat, which actually improved profit contribution. But Compressor Controls, which is a high margin business was down by more than a third of revenue and delevered at a quite high rate. But we do feel that from here, it gets no longer as negative on the comparison basis as we sort of see some of course softness throughout the year. 
We did have sequential margin improvement. You can see the OP margin came in at 22.5% and the segment had some amortization, which brought it to 25.8% and EBITDA a little bit higher. The OP margin in the first quarter was 20.4, so we picked up 210 basis points of sequential margin improvement. 
In the second half of the year, we think that the organic revenue and energy is likely to be down between 7% and 10%, which is really driven by the continued lack of improvement in the oil and gas businesses. 
We do have an easier comp in the fourth quarter in these Oil and Gas businesses. They are normal so there may be some optimism there and fourth quarter seasonal increase, we assume will be similar to what it was last year, which was not very good and that could be a positive surprise. 
The industrial Test and Measurement businesses will continue to improve. They're doing pretty well now certainly in the low to mid-single digits growth mode. And the margins there are going to continue to improve, and so that's quite good.  And the orders in the to bill of the segment is about 1, so this seems to be pretty well under control. 
When we get to the guidance here -- next slide. The outlook for the year, we took the full year down to $6.57 to $6.71, which gives you a midpoint, I guess, of $6.64, which is certainly lower than what we had before. It really is being driven by the more severe downturn in oil and gas. We thought maybe we'd be down in a neighborhood of $75 million in oil and gas for the year, but we're going to be down like $100 million. So that's a $25 million revenue hit. And then the project pushout and tolling are another sort of $20 million, $25 million. And then there's currency that we didn't have, Brexit and other factors in currency is another $10 million, so there's about $60 million revenue hit there, and you can assume that comes in at close to 50% on a contribution basis. 
And then the rest is really just recognition of a somewhat lower global growth environment, so we think that takes 1 point or maybe 2 points off of the organic growth versus what we expected when we initiated guidance at the beginning of the year. 
We get a very thorough bottoms-up review for guidance this time with all of our senior operating people involved and really kind of rebuilding what everybody had to assure ourselves that we were very comfortable with whatever the guidance we're going to put in place. We really could have some things that will become favorable for us. The fact that if we brought it down in the oil and gas, severity, project delays and tolling, global growth challenges, maybe there's a little optimism there, but we're not ready to embed any of that in our guidance. 
In terms of an upside, certainly the toll projects could accelerate. I think that people had a clearer view of what's going to happen with the election. They might have a better idea about whether they think they're going to be personally benefited or not economically from policy. 
The product launches that we have pretty ramps faster than we have in our guidance, that would be nice, but you never know. And then our capital deployment, which we certainly expect to have more of augment growth as the year unfolds, but it's not in our guidance numbers. 
If we look at kind of forward revenue and EBITDA leverage. EBITDA leverage is running a little better than 1/3 of new revenue. So even with the deleverage we got from oil and gas, we're still having overall net positive EBITDA leverage on new revenue and if we what else we got sort of organic growth is 2% to 4% with revenue growth at 7% to 9% for the second half. If we did a bridge like we did at the beginning of the presentation, you'd see it would show similar results with revenue being up by 10% or more, excluding oil and gas. 
Our second half tax rate is probably around 30% and then in third quarter, we're looking at $1.59 to $1.63. 
Next slide. Here, if we look at the summary of what happened in the quarter, you can see for us it was normally we'll talk about the fact that we had record orders and backlog record sales and operating profit and EBITDA, which is good, the margins are good, but we hit the lower end the guidance, so we don't feel like meeting this kind of record results when we were a little bit disappointed on the actual EPS number. 
Orders, as we said, were all-time record and up 9% with a backlog of $1.14 billion, a book to bill, well above 1, so we're well positioned to continue to have a stronger second half. 
We get rid of the $10 million a quarter drag from Puerto Rico beginning now here in the third quarter, and we get rid of the drag on the divestiture of ABEL in the fourth quarter, so a little bit of a drag in Q3. 
Revenue being up 5%, we were able to do that because we had sort of high single digits, low double-digit growth between medical, software and water, which allowed us to survive this greater than 40% reduction in our upstream oil and gas businesses. Gross margin at 61%, we feel very good about that. EBITDA margin is fine, like we're going to improve in the second half a little bit. 
Operating cash flow, the same thing, 132% conversion and $414 million, it'll to be stronger as always is in the second half, so we're quite comfortable with where we are on the operating cash flow. 
Back in '14, our Oil and Gas business was a little above $500 million and 14% of the company. In 2015, that had dropped to around $400 million and about 11.5% of the company. And today, we think it will finish the year at around $300 million, which will be less than our 8% of the company and the upstream portion is going to be less 50% of the company with midstream being around 6. So the orders were behind us for this kind of change and we're looking forward to that. 
We got a very active pipeline. We opened on quite a few deals. We said at the beginning of the year, we expect to deploy $1 billion, but $275 million to work thus far. It's not going to be difficult to find our way to deploying that well of activity. 
We still have a great opportunity to continue to compound results. It's really continues to drive our strategy, so we've got our underlying core businesses doing relatively well in a growth perspective, adjusted the oil and gas and unique situation with Puerto Rico, which was a win for us even though it shows up negatively in the first half revenue. It keeps us all of our strategies alive, and we're very comfortable with our ability to compound results from here out. 
So with that, we'll open it up to questions."

A lot of the people that are running these private companies aren't interested in becoming public. They would much rather join our firm at the public equity and our firm that -- and not have the quarterly calls and all of the things that you have to do with investors and banks. So we remain a very attractive home for people and I think that acquisitions we made in the last couple of years give us a wider variety of things that we can look at. Application software has a huge number of potential verticals and there are a lot of niches within that the largest people, that are roll up people are going to be interested in. So it's still a very favorable hunting ground for us. Now the challenge, I think, for the all the industry guys in buying things is they tend to not buy things that are us higher quality is what we're buying. And if you're in a marketplace where you're looking for synergies that are going to be driven by overhead absorption or business consolidation or administrative synergies or something, those businesses are trading at a disproportionately high price than the way they normally would because the interest rates are so low. The highest quality businesses, oddly enough, trade at a much deeper discount to public comps. People will look at Roper and say, oh my gosh, look, they pay 12x for something. Well, if you look at the public company comp, it was trading at 25 or 26x. So I think that people are focused on product-oriented, more asset-intensive businesses that are trading at 12 or 13x because of very low interest rates and people are buying them for 12 or 13 or 14. We're not in that space. We're in a space where buying stuff at 12 or 13 or 14 that if we were public we'll trade at a higher number because of our willingness and experience in how to effectuate those companies joining our public family."

So Sunquest customers are the largest, most complicated laboratories in the United States. These are laboratories that do million of tests a year and what our software does is automate from start to finish the laboratory processes, so you get a super high quality results at low cost to operate the lab. So what Sunquest, the new [indiscernible] I n Sunquest is the extend that capability that's been steeped in the [indiscernible] side or the fluid side of the lab and extend to the other parts of the laboratory. So first is a major product that is the integration of the pathologies inside of a hospital. So it integrates the blood and the tissue to the molecular genetic, very important products for us and for our customers as they deliver medicine inside of their institutions. The second one is a completely refreshed view about how do you collect samples at the bedside. It's mobile-enabled, it's integrated into a nurse workflow, important in terms of getting the draws correct at the right location with the right patient and get it into the laboratories as quickly as possible. The third category of new products is helping to hospitals extend their reach into the communities. Importantly, in the changing reimbursement landscape in U.S. health care, health hospitals want the collaboratory samples that are in the community being where the physicians that feed patients into the hospital. They want a blood test that are collected in all laboratories test that are collected in the physicians offices to be routed into the hospital's laboratory, not just to drive volume in laboratory but to give the clinical information. And so we have a series of tools that integrate into the electronic medical records at the physicians offices for ordering and resulting. And then finally, laboratory space has been baked in at any meaningful analytics about how they run the operations, how they benchmark themselves against their peers and improve the operations, so we have a large analytics release that's happening in the second half of this year. Those are 4 net new opportunities. As we talked earlier this a series of meaningful upgrades. We've just released a major upgrades to our core of clinical pathology and our core blood bank. We've seen the opportunities associated with those upgrades, number in the hundreds, and so we're excited about what the team has been able to build their products with respect at Sunquest."

And that's true on -- not only the software-type businesses like Neil was just talking about, but also our product businesses and particularly at Gatan, some of our imaging business will have have higher gross margins because of all the technology and all the R&D that we invest there. It does result in higher gross margins. So if the volume increases, we expect the fall through to improve.

Now, we're going to be down $100 million. So that $25 million extra negative situation on revenue is disappointing because it comes in at 50% or frankly, 60% contribution. So it's a big EPS number. It doesn't really diminish our cash performance if I mention all, and those businesses at the moment are just a free shot and goal for 2017 and '18. They're on the books for we did extremely low basis, so the only way if you were going to do something if you want to do either a straight stand or response to stand or you want to do on what somebody about it, it would be safe to say that our phone's been ringing off people who want to do those kinds of things. But we actually think there's substantial upside in those businesses just not this year. And probably not in the first 3 quarters and next year. But if they start cranking just modestly in 2018, we're going to have windfall kind of results, so we prefer to hold onto them, continue to invest. The industrial business was 26% EBITDA in the quarter, I would say and Energy business we used to get 31 in Industrial, 26 on energy. So these are really good businesses. Most of our investors when we talk to that guys, their fear is, gee, if you put those someplace, how could be trusted around them as well as you can and we always say, boy, say well it may be right. So these are great businesses. They're just in situation where if somebody is off, 44% to 52%, it's incredible, but they're still able to perform at the levels they are because there's some nimble. So I don't really see those as necessary sales. We know how to run them, we know how to run them well. If they didn't have this extra $25 million headwind the second half, our guidance reduction would have been so great. And no one could have predict what happened with -- what's going on in Saudi is certainly an interesting time, it affected several of our businesses revenues in the second quarter. So I think the underlying thesis for us is, we've got some cash cow businesses that are at their absolute nadir. They're going to drive a lot of performance over the years and they're great annuity value for our investors."

And then the other piece as far as the relative mix between so medical grow so far this year and in fact, for the remainder of the year as well, although not as much in the fourth quarter has been driven more by product, by medical products sales. Still terrific businesses in great margin, but not the highest margin businesses inside the segment, which is really more of the software and services side. So it's more of mix issue, but we see that mix issue actually moderating as we go throughout the year.

You have mentioned earlier in the M&A pipeline, it was pulled the application software businesses, there were lab on prospects in there.

We've seen good success with Sunquest and MHA and tucking in some related businesses at Sunquest, at CliniSys and GeneInsight and Atlas. And I'm curious, do we stay on that path with more of the bolt-ons to Sunquest and MHA? Or is there something in there with some scale that we could pull in?"

If you look at the last larger transaction was Aderant. There are a lot of things that was sort of the size of Aderant. And Aderant also offers us an opportunity for some bolt-on acquisitions to kind of grow its platform status. I would hope that the next acquisition we have is more like that, where it's meaningful, it's something that we know how to do, people would be confident that we're already doing those kinds of things. So that is likely what the next thing would be. Now that said, this year, we look at the number of very large transactions. And those are always of interest. We're incredibly conservative and careful around those. But I would be disappointed in the next 2 or 3 years if we didn't do a quite large transaction."

Now if you please turn to Slide 2. We'll begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are described on this page, and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.

For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consist of 2 items: first, a $2.5 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue for software acquisitions that we've made. This represents revenue that those companies would have recognized if not for our acquisition; second, a small inventory step-up expense related to the acquisition of RF IDeas last year in the fourth quarter.

Good morning, everybody.We'll take a quick look at sort of summary of the enterprise results here in the quarter, and then look at individual performance in this segments and the outlook for each segments, and then turn to the guidance",4025,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody.
We'll take a quick look at sort of summary of the enterprise results here in the quarter, and then look at individual performance in this segments and the outlook for each segments, and then turn to the guidance for the remainder of the year, and go to Q&A.
So next slide is simply the introduction to the Q2 enterprise results. Next slide is the explanation of those.
So orders were actually up to a record $956 million. They were up 9% in the quarter, and our book to bill for the enterprise was 1.02.
Revenue was up 5% to $934 million versus last year's first quarter. Organic revenue was down 2%. We had the divestiture that's still in our numbers through the third quarter, the ABEL divestiture, which pulled 1% away, and acquisition were up 80%.
We had really terrific growth in medical and in software, in water, we'll talk more about that within those respective segments.
But the oil and gas declines were actually worse than we expected. We went into the year thinking that we'd be down may be in the high teens to 20%. In the quarter, we were down 25%. But in the upstream areas, we were down dramatically more, 44%, 51%, 52% numbers that really were amazing for us. Those are, of course, all businesses, so they all are directly EPS-type businesses because they don't have much in the way of noncash amortization.
The toll and traffic project delay was also a little bit of a disappointment as Saudi is rolling out their program slowly. We're on track with everything we do, but their rate of initiation of new zones has been slow.
Our gross margin was another record, up 90 basis points to 61% and EBITDA was up to $314 million, 33.6% of revenue.
Our DEPS number at $1.56 was disappointing from our perspective because it did hit the low end of the range, but in a quarter where we had record orders of record sales, record backlog and record EBITDA and operating profit, we just came up a little light on the revenue side from the oil and gas and project delays, each of which probably cost us $6 million to $7 million of revenue, and that's why we were about $1.56 at the low range instead of being up at the higher end of $1.61.
Our operating cash flow was $170 million, which is strong in Q2. Year-to-date, our operating cash flow has been $414 million, which is 23% of revenue, and that's a particularly pleasing number when you're going through the sort of oil and gas decline that you could still maintain these kind of ratios.
Our recent acquisitions are performing well. We have an extremely strong pipeline, which is very active. We'll talk about it in a little bit.
So it was a solid quarter, but we did have to adjust our outlook for the economic realities we see in the second half of the year, and we'll talk about that when we get to guidance.
Next slide. Here, we're looking at the Q2 income statement. As you can see, orders up 9%; book to bill, 1.02; revenue, up 5%; gross profit was up 6%; gross margin, up 90 basis points. The operating income ratio is 27.4% versus last year's 28.5%, but as you can see, amortization increased by $10 million, and our EBITDA performance, if we were reporting in that way, would look better in terms of continued sustained upward trends in our ratios.
The earnings before tax number was down 2%, and the tax rate was a relatively big headwind in the quarter, although the tax rate is really sort of appropriate for us at 29.8%.
Last year, we had an extremely unusual event in the Q2 numbers, which was $15.9 million of a good guy that came from a long-term settlement of a tax position, and that really, that $1.70, if you adjust it, for the $0.16 of that onetime benefit would have been about $1.54 and this year, we're at $1.56.
Next slide. If we look here at the revenue bridge, I think most people find this to be quite surprising. The underlying core nature of the business is continuing to grow at double digits.
Here, you can see, if we looked at last year's second quarter, we printed $892 million. That included the $10 million Puerto Rico situation that we were trying to get out of because of all the reasons everybody knows. We were successful, but it's still in the number in the second quarter at $10 million. Now we have the divestiture of the Eastern German pump company for $6 million, and then the oil and gas decrement in the second quarter alone was $33 million.
So those things were at $49 million headwind. If we look at the base entity, 43, you'll see we added $91 million to that number, so while the total revenue is up 5%, the revenue, excluding the oil and gas and these things that are anniversarying was up 11%. It's really almost identical to what happened in the first quarter, where if you exclude oil and gas in Puerto Rico and the divestiture, we were also up 11%.
The good news is that for the balance of the year, we think the second half will be similar, where we got more than 10%, excluding oil and gas, but will have a better organic growth, so there'll be a little less in the acquisition dollars and more in the organic growth dollars, where at least until we do another acquisition.
So -- actually, we felt the growth is pretty solid despite the headwinds.
Next slide. Here, you can see that we continue with the governance process. We have to make remarkable progress in our asset-light business model. Two years ago, our inventory was at 6% of revenue, and at the end of June, this year, it's down to 5.1%, so a 90 basis point improvement. Receivables actually declined from 17.7% to 16.9%, so we got faster receivables, and payables and accruals went up, as we like, from 17.4% to 18.9%.
So we literally cut our working capital as a function of annualized sales in half, in the last 2 years, from 6.2% to 3.1%. And that really speaks to the quality of the work that all of our independent operating people do executing our strategy.
Next slide. On cash flow performance, again, extremely good cash flow performance. Year-to-date, it's $414 million, which is 23% of revenue. Our free cash flow was 22% of revenue, and our operating cash flow conversion was 132%.
And note on this slide, you'll see in 2 years ago, our year-to-date cash flow had been $353 million, and last year, we printed $433 million. But $20 million of that was a onetime payment by Puerto Rico as we got out of that situation with Puerto Rico. So it's real money, but it was a onetime event.
So if you take the $20 million, you're looking at $413 (sic) [ 433 ] million and this year's $414 million, our cash performance will be even stronger in the second half. But still conversion is great. 
Next slide. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to be very well positioned. You can see that we got a completely undrawn revolver of $1.850 billion at the moment, up from $1.185 billion of last year. So if you look at the cash and undrawn revolver, you're getting about $2.5 billion. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA is $1.267 billion, so our net debt number to EBITDA is running about $1.9 billion -- or 1.9x, and that's after in that 12-month period, we've invested $1,450,000,000. So after -- well, $1.45 billion, we still have a 1.9x debt-to-EBITDA number, so ample liquidity. We've got a very active pipeline, and really, most of the -- numerous acquisitions that were involved with now in late stages are application software companies, and it's likely we'll be doing something soon.
Next slide. Here, we'll look at the individual detail and the outlook for each one of the segments.
Next slide. All 4 segments continue to perform remarkably well. When you look at it as a kind of all-up in the oil and gas that affects the energy business and to a lesser degree, the Industrial Technology because Roper Pump is sitting in there.
Here these 2 are clipping along with energy at 26%, EBITDA to revenue and, actually, sequentially up from the first quarter, and Industrial Technology at 31%. So those remain remarkable performance numbers.
Our software business at 38%, medical at 43% as you can see, and the enterprise as a whole running at 37% without the corporate expense.
Next slide. So we'll take the largest segment first, which is medical. Here you can see that revenue was up 12%, that came from 8 points of acquisition and 4 points overall organic revenue, although imaging pulled that down by 1 point. So medical organic in the quarter was 5%, which is the 10th consecutive quarter that our medical organic revenue has been mid-single digits or better. We certainly don't see that slowing.
Growth was really led by the adoption of new products in 3 of our medical product companies and software businesses as well. We had strong adoption of our alternate site healthcare solution businesses where SHP and SoftWriters were growing at a very high rate and our internal software within MHA did well as well.
Our new product launches at Sunquest, which should be very important for 2017, and hopefully, important yet as the year winds down, are launched and on schedule. We've got the sales pipeline, which is growing, growing really rapidly, and we have a couple of large people that we're talking to. But we would expect to begin to see that affect the second half results favorably, which we'll see below.
In the second half, we think that the organic growth in medical is going to be in the sort of 6% to 9% range. The product growth that we have in the core products is going to continue. We think that trend, the alternate site growth strength is here because we are getting some real push out of SHP and SoftWriters becoming organic rather than just acquisitions. Anyway, actually we had some favorable comps that will benefit MHA as the year unfolds.
The laboratory software orders are going to increase on the adoption of many new products. And while they're literally over 15 different things that are being launched, there are 4 core large launches around analytics and diagnostic communities and integrated pathologies and clinical content that we think will drive the future of Sunquest.
Our imaging businesses are going to benefit in the second half as the cryo-EM technology emergence is getting better understood by people and sort of our phones are ringing off the hook. They have a strong backlog going into the second half and their product releases are on schedule.
Importantly -- and here, when you look at the operating profit margin, you see 33.7%, which is down from the prior year. A couple of reasons for that, the newer acquisitions have a lot of amortization. In fact, the second quarter number at 33.7% for OP when you add back the noncash amortization at 7.9%, you wind up at 41.6% for the -- every dollar of revenue contributing, and on an EBITDA basis, it's nearly 43%. So good mix between medical products and software and service, and then imaging should do better in the second half.
Next slide. In the RF segment, which is really now increasingly split between RF and software, you can see revenue was up 14%, acquisitions were up 18%, organic was down 4%. But the organic revenue on our software and SaaS business segment was up 9%.
Our toll and traffic had very strong orders, but our revenue declined because of the Puerto Rico contract, which finally anniversaried in the second quarter, so that's a $10 million headwind that goes away. And then the Riyadh project is moving much more slowly. It could easily be $20 million less than what we were told earlier in the year, which is part of the reason for our guide down on the earnings profile. It's still going to continue to happen, the contribution margin we're getting as it rolls out is fine. It's just that it's moving more slowly, and it's not the only thing going in the Saudi Arabia these days that's moving very slowly.
We had very strong segment book to bill here at 1.09. Orders were up 26% with organic orders being up 9%. Again, lots of amortization in this segment, so you see an OP margin of 31.5%, which is up 20 basis points, but when you add back the amortization, which is 5.8% of revenue in the segment and you see the EBITA number is 37.3%, the EBITDA number is 38.1%, up 190 basis points from the second quarter of last year.
We see there -- at bottom here, in terms of forecasting revenue for the balance of the year earnings, the segment organic revenue, we think will be up 5% to 7%. Toll and traffic will improve in the second half. We've gotten strong orders in Q2. The execution of those should be pretty favorable. And we have a big pipeline of opportunity. What has caused us to slow down the guidance for the balance of the year is that decision-making process around that has been slower than normal, and whether that's related to an election situation with people wondering about -- kind of ensuring their commitments is something that's not clear.
Our software and SaaS businesses continue to grow at high single digits with incredible cash returns that earns other investments and acquisitions.
And then RFID business and our On Center acquisitions from last year will go to organic in the fourth quarter, which is why you'll see this bigger mix of organic in the second half of the year and less on acquisitions than you did in the first 2 quarters. 
Next slide. On the Industrial Technology segment. Here, you can see that orders declined -- well, actually, orders were up 3%, but the organic growth declined by 1%. The divestiture was 3%.
The organic, if we exclude oil and gas and industrial, was up 4%. The problem with this segment was simply that the upstream was worse than expected for Roper Pump, and we had expected a big down, but it was down 44%, so a little bigger than we had anticipated. The good news is it does appear that, that's the bottom of the situation. And of course, Roper Pump's impact on the segment is dramatically de-escalated as their revenue has dropped so much over the last 2 years.
Neptune on the other hand is doing extremely well. They had double-digit growth in the second quarter on both orders and revenue. They continue to gain share in the marketplace despite people reading about other people that are trying to sell their businesses. Neptune will continue to have record performance.
The material analysis portion of the business, sort of test and measurement, had record orders in the second quarter, which is very encouraging because their revenue had been down sort of high single digits, so that bodes well for the second half.
If you look at the second half, we think that the overall organic revenue in the business will be flat because we don't see any improvement in the upstream markets, although there is a declining impact in the segment as the underlying base business of Roper Pump is getting very small.
Neptune, an instrumentation, will be able to offset any of the declines we have in oil and gas and finally, in the fourth quarter, the divestiture will anniversary and go away.
Next slide. Here, we look at the Energy Systems & Controls segment. You can see that revenue there was down 15%, and it's really a tale of 2 different businesses, the test and measurement business, which was okay. And then the oil and gas businesses, which were off. So oil and gas was down 25% in the segment, and that really doesn't quite tell the story either because our petroleum analyzer business, if you exclude its small portion of the upstream it has was really flat, which actually improved profit contribution. But Compressor Controls, which is a high margin business was down by more than 1/3 in revenue and delevered at a quite high rate. We do feel that, from here, it gets no longer as negative on a comparison basis as we sort of see of course some softness throughout the year.
We did have sequential margin improvement. You can see the OP margin came in at 22.5%, and this segment had some amortization, which brought it to 25.8% and EBITDA a little bit higher. The OP margin in the first quarter was 20.4%, so we picked up 210 basis points of sequential margin improvement.
In the second half of the year, we think that the organic revenue and energy is likely to be down between 7% and 10%, which is really driven by the continued lack of improvement in the oil and gas businesses.
We do have an easier comp in the fourth quarter in these oil and gas businesses. They are normal, so there may be some optimism there. And fourth quarter seasonal increase, we assume, will be similar to what it was last year, which was not very good and that could be a positive surprise.
The industrial test and measurement businesses will continue to improve. They're doing pretty well now, certainly in a low to mid-single digits growth mode. And the margins there are going to continue to improve, and so that's quite good. And the orders, book to bill, in the segment is about 1, so this seems to be pretty well under control.
When we get to the guidance here -- next slide. The outlook for the year, we took the full year down to $6.57 to $6.71, which gives you a midpoint, I guess, of $6.64, which is certainly lower than what we had before. It really is being driven by the more severe downturn in oil and gas. We thought maybe we'd be down in a neighborhood of $75 million in oil and gas for the year, but we're going to be down more like $100 million, so that's a $25 million revenue hit. And then the project pushouts and tolling are another sort of $20 million, $25 million. And then there's currency that we didn't have, Brexit and other factors in currency is another $10 million. So there's about $60 million revenue hit there, and you can assume that comes in at close to 50% on a contribution basis.
And then the rest is really just recognition of a somewhat lower global growth environment, so we think that takes 1 point, or maybe 2 points, off of the organic growth versus what we expected when we initiated guidance at the very beginning of the year.
We get a very thorough bottoms-up review for guidance this time with all of our senior operating people involved, and really kind of rebuilding what everybody had to assure ourselves that we were very comfortable with whatever the guidance we're going to put in place. We really could have some things that will become favorable for us. The fact that if we brought it down in the oil and gas, severity, project delays and tolling, global growth challenges, maybe there's a little optimism there, but we're not ready to embed any of that in our guidance.
In terms of an upside, certainly, the toll projects could accelerate. I think that people had a clearer view of what's going to happen with the election. They might have a better idea about whether they think they're going to be personally benefited or not economically from policy.
The product launches that we have could ramps faster than we have in our guidance, that would be nice, but you never know. And then our capital deployment, which we certainly expect to have more of augment growth as the year unfolds, but it's not in our guidance numbers.
If we look at kind of forward revenue and EBITDA leverage, EBITDA leverage is running a little better than 1/3 of new revenue. So even with the deleverage we got from oil and gas, we're still having overall net positive EBITDA leverage on new revenue. And if we -- what else we got -- sort of organic growth is 2% to 4% with revenue growth at 7% to 9% for the second half. If we did a bridge like we did at the beginning of the presentation, you'd see it would show similar results with revenue being up by 10% or more, excluding oil and gas.
Second half tax rate is probably around 30%, and then in the third quarter, we're looking at $1.59 to $1.63.
Next slide. Here, if we look at the summary of what happened in the quarter, you can see for us it was -- normally, we'd talk about the fact that we had record orders and backlog record sales and operating profit and EBITDA, all which is good, the margins are good, but we hit the lower end of the guidance, so we just didn't feel like leading with this kind of record results when we were a little bit disappointed on the actual EPS number.
Orders, as we said, were an all-time record and up 9%, with a backlog of $1.14 billion; a book to bill, well above 1. So we're well positioned to continue to have a stronger second half.
We get rid of the $10 million a quarter drag from Puerto Rico beginning now, here in the third quarter, and we get rid of the drag on the divestiture of ABEL in the fourth quarter, so a little bit of a drag in Q3.
Revenue being up 5%. We were able to do that because we had sort of high single digits, low double-digit growth between medical, software and water, which allowed us to survive this greater than 40% reduction in our upstream oil and gas businesses. Gross margin at 61%, we feel very good about that. EBITDA margin is fine, likely we're going to improve in the second half a little bit.
Operating cash flow is the same thing, 132% conversion and $414 million. It'll to be stronger as always is in the second half, so we're quite comfortable with where we are on the operating cash flow.
Back in '14, our oil and gas business was a little above $500 million and 14% of the company. And in 2015, that had dropped to around $400 million and about 11.5% of the company. And today, we think it will finish the year at around $300 million, which will be less than 8% of the company, and the upstream portion is going to be less 50% of the company with the midstream being around 6. So the orders stood behind us for this kind of change, and we're looking forward to that.
We got a very active pipeline. We are open on quite a few deals. We said at the beginning of the year, we expect to deploy $1 billion, but $275 million to work thus far. It's not going to be difficult to find our way to deploying that level of activity.
We still have a great opportunity to continue to compound results. It's really continues to drive our strategy, so we've got our underlying core businesses doing relatively well on a growth perspective, it's just the oil and gas and unique situation with Puerto Rico, which was a win for us, even though it shows up negatively in the first half revenue. It keeps us and all of our strategies alive, and we're very comfortable with our ability to compound results from here out.

It's pretty high, but fortunately, for us, we are not buying public companies and paying a premium for it. So we're buying private companies that if they were public we'd trade at a higher value than they do trade in the private marketplace, which gives us always some beneficial arbitrage. There are as many things available in the acquisition market as I've ever seen. We have looked at billions of dollars of transactions this year, and we're directly engaged with a couple now that have a higher likelihood of closing. I think that the ones that we were looking at earlier in the year because of the quality of the business. A lot of the people that are running these private companies aren't interested in becoming public. They would much rather join our firm at the public equity and our firm that -- and not have the quarterly calls and all of the things that you have to do with investors and banks. So we remain a very attractive home for people, and I think that acquisitions we made in the last couple of years give us a wider variety of things that we can look at. Application software has a huge number of potential verticals, and there are a lot of niches within that the largest people, that are roll up people, aren't going to be interested in. So it's still a very favorable hunting ground for us. Now the challenge, I think, for the -- all the industry guys in buying things is they tend to not buy things that are us higher quality is what we're buying. And if you're in a marketplace where you're looking for synergies that are going to be driven by overhead absorption or business consolidation or administrative synergies or something, those businesses are trading at a disproportionately high price than the way they normally would because the interest rates are so low. The highest quality businesses, oddly enough, trade at a much deeper discount to public comps. People will look at Roper and say, ""Oh my gosh, look, they paid 12x for something."" Well, if you looked at the public company comp, it was trading at 25x or 26x. So I think that people are focused on product-oriented, more asset-intensive businesses that are trading at 12x or 13x because of very low interest rates, and people are buying them for 12x or 13x or 14x. We're not in that space. We're in a space where buying stuff at 12x or 13x or 14x, that if it we were public, we'd trade at a higher number because of our willingness and experience in how to effectuate those companies joining our public family."

So Sunquest customers are the largest, most complicated laboratories in the United States. These are laboratories that do millions of tests a year. And what our software does is automate from start to finish the laboratory processes. So you get super high-quality results at low cost to operate the labs. So what Sunquest, the new -- the current products at Sunquest is to extend that capability that's been steeped in the blood side or the fluid side of the lab and extend it to the other parts of the laboratory. So first is a major product that is the integration of the pathologies inside of a hospital. So it integrates the blood, to the tissue, to the molecular genetic. Very important product for us and for our customers as they deliver medicine inside of their institutions. The second one is a completely refreshed view about how do you collect samples at the bedside. It's mobile-enabled, it's integrated into a nurse workflow, important in terms of getting the draws correct at the right location with the right patient, and get it to the laboratories as quickly as possible. The third category of new products is helping the hospitals extend their reach into the communities. Importantly, in the changing reimbursement landscape in U.S. health care, hospitals want the laboratory samples that are in the community being where the physicians that see patients into their hospitals. They want the blood test that are collected in all laboratories test that are collected in the physicians offices to be routed into the hospital's laboratory, not just to drive volume in laboratory but to give the clinical information. And so we have a series of tools that integrate into the electronic medical records at the physicians offices for ordering and resulting. And then finally, laboratory space has been vacant of any meaningful analytics about how they run the operations, how they benchmark themselves against their peers and improve the operations. So we have a large analytics release that's happening in the second half of this year. Those are 4 net new opportunities. As we talked about earlier, there is a series of other meaningful upgrades. We've just released a major upgrade to our core clinical pathology on our core blood bank. We've seen the opportunities associated with those upgrades number in the hundreds, and so we are very excited about what the team has been able to build their products with respect to Sunquest."

And so as we see incremental growth on the top side, we expect that to fall through. And so that really is what drives the margin improvement as we go throughout the year. And that's true on -- not only the software-type businesses, like Neil was just talking about, but also our products businesses, and particularly at Gatan and some of our imaging business will have very high gross margins because of all the technology and all the R&D that we invest there.

See, when we went into the year thinking that would be down about $100 million in the oil and gas, which comes in a little bit into industrial, mostly into energy -- I'm sorry, we thought we did -- we're down about $75 million, now we're going to be down $100 million. So that $25 million extra negative situation on revenue is disappointing because it comes in at 50%, or frankly, 60% contribution. So it's a big EPS number. It doesn't really diminish our cash performance by much at all. And those businesses, at the moment, are just a free shot on goal for 2017 and '18. They're on the books for an extremely low basis. So the only way if you were going to do something with them, if you want to do either a straight stand or response or to stand or whether you want to do an RFP with somebody on it, it will be safe to say that our phone has been ringing off the hook, with people who want to do those kind of things. But we actually think there's substantial upside in those businesses just not this year, and probably not in the first 3 quarters or next year. But if they start cranking, just modestly in 2018, we're going to have windfall kind of results. So we prefer to hold onto them, continue to invest. The industrial business was 26% EBITDA in the quarter, I would say, and energy business -- we got 31% in industrial and 26% in energy. So -- I mean, these are really good businesses. Most of our investors, when we talk to the long [ph] guys, their fear is, ""Gee, if you put those someplace, how could we trust they can run them as well as you can."" And we always humbly say, ""Well, you may be right."" So these are great businesses. They're just in situation where if somebody is off 44% to 52%, it's incredible, but they're still able to perform at the levels they are, because they are so nimble. So I don't really see those as necessary sales. We know how to run them, we know how to run them well. If they didn't have this extra $25 million headwind in the second half, our guidance reduction wouldn't have been so great. And then no one could have predict what happened with -- what's going on in Saudi is certainly an interesting time, and it affected several of our businesses' revenues in the second quarter. So I think the underlying thesis for us is we've got some cash cow businesses that are at their absolute nadir. They're going to continue to drive a lot of performance over the years, and they are a great annuity value for our investors."

And then the other piece is as far as the relative mix between -- so our medical growth so far this year and in fact, for the remainder of the year as well, although not as much in the fourth quarter has been driven more by product, by medical products sales. Still terrific businesses and great margin, but not the highest margin businesses inside the segment, which is really more of the software and services side. So it's more of a mix issue, but we see that mix issue actually moderating as we go throughout the year.

It's going to be extremely valuable over a long period of time. But in the short run, we're going to likely get at least $20 million less than we expected in the beginning of the year. And we got somewhat less in the quarter -- in this quarter. And all of our numbers issues are really just around the severity of the upstream being far worse than we thought. And the toll and traffic kind of stuff, if you look at the quarter, it's pretty significant. When you look at the year, it's easier to calibrate now."

And Aderant also offers us an opportunity for some bolt-on acquisitions to kind of grow its platform status. I would hope that the next acquisition we have is more like that, where it's meaningful, it's something that we know how to do, people would be confident that we're already doing those kinds of things. So that is likely what the next thing would be. Now that said, this year, we look at a number of very large transactions. And those are always of interest.

For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consist of 2 items: first, a $2.5 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue for software acquisitions that we've made. This represents revenue that those companies would have recognized if not for our acquisition; second, a small inventory step-up expense related to the acquisition of RF IDeas last year in the fourth quarter.

Good morning, everybody.
We'll take a quick look at sort of summary of the enterprise results here in the quarter, and then look at individual performance in this segments and the outlook for each segments, and then turn to the guidance for the remainder of the year, and go to Q&A.
So next slide is simply the introduction to the Q2 enterprise results. Next slide is the explanation of those.
So orders were actually up to a record $956 million. They were up 9% in the quarter, and our book to bill for the enterprise was 1.02.
Revenue was up 5% to $934 million versus last year's first quarter. Organic revenue was down 2%. We had the divestiture that's still in our numbers through the third quarter, the ABEL divestiture, which pulls 1% away, and acquisition were up 80%.
We had really terrific growth in medical and in software, and in water, we'll talk more about that within those respective segments.
But the oil and gas declines were actually worse than we expected. We went into the year thinking that we'd be down may be in the high teens to 20%. In the quarter, we were down 25%. But in the upstream areas, we were down dramatically more, 44%, 51%, 52%, numbers that really were amazing for us. Those are, of course, old businesses, so they all are directly EPS-type businesses because they don't have much in the way of noncash amortization.
The toll and traffic project delay was also a little bit of a disappointment as Saudi is rolling out their program slowly. We're on track with everything we do, but their rate of initiation of new zones has been slow.
Our gross margin was another record, up 90 basis points to 61% and EBITDA was up to $314 million, 33.6% of revenue.
Our DEPS number at $1.56 was disappointing from our perspective because it did hit the low end of the range, but in a quarter where we had record orders and record sales, record backlog and record EBITDA and operating profit, we just came up a little light on the revenue side from the oil and gas and project delays, each of which probably cost us $6 million to $7 million of revenue, and that's why we were about $1.56 at the low range instead of being up at the higher end of $1.61.
Our operating cash flow was $170 million, which is strong in Q2. Year-to-date, our operating cash flow has been $414 million, which is 23% of revenue, and that's a particularly pleasing number when you're going through the sort of oil and gas decline that you could still maintain these kind of ratios.
Our recent acquisitions are performing well. We have an extremely strong pipeline, which is very active. We'll talk about it in a little bit.
So it was a solid quarter, but we did have to adjust our outlook for the economic realities we see in the second half of the year, and we'll talk about that when we get to guidance.
Next slide. Here, we're looking at the Q2 income statement. As you can see, orders up 9%; book to bill, 1.02; revenue, up 5%; gross profit was up 6%; gross margin, up 90 basis points. The operating income ratio is 27.4% versus last year's 28.5%, but as you can see, amortization increased by $10 million, and our EBITA performance, if we were reporting in that way, would look better in terms of continued sustained upward trends in our ratios.
The earnings before tax number was down 2%, and the tax rate was a relatively big headwind in the quarter, although the tax rate is really sort of appropriate for us at 29.8%.
Last year, we had an extremely unusual event in the Q2 numbers, which was $15.9 million of a good guy that came from a long-term settlement of a tax position, and that really, that $1.70, if you adjusted it for the $0.16 of that onetime benefit, would have been about $1.54 and this year, we're at $1.56.
Next slide. If we look here at the revenue bridge, I think most people find this to be quite surprising. The underlying core nature of the business is continuing to grow at double digits.
Here, you can see, if we looked at last year's second quarter, we printed $892 million. That included the $10 million Puerto Rico situation that we were trying to get out of because of all the reasons everybody knows. We were successful, but it's still in the number in the second quarter at $10 million. And then we had the divestiture of the Eastern German pump company for $6 million, and then the oil and gas decrement in the second quarter alone was $33 million.
So those things were a $49 million headwind. If we look at the base then at $843 million, you'll see we added $91 million to that number, so while the total revenue is up 5%, the revenue, excluding the oil and gas and these things that are anniversarying was up 11%. It's really almost identical to what happened in the first quarter, where if you exclude oil and gas in Puerto Rico and the divestiture, we were also up 11%.
The good news is that for the balance of the year, we think the second half will be similar, where we got more than 10%, excluding oil and gas, but will have a better organic growth, so there'll be a little less in the acquisition dollars and more in the organic growth dollars, where at least until we do another acquisition.
So -- actually, we felt the growth is pretty solid despite the headwinds.
Next slide. Here, you can see that we continue with the governance process we have to make remarkable progress in our asset-light business model. Two years ago, our inventory was at 6% of revenue, and at the end of June, this year, it's down to 5.1%, so a 90 basis point improvement. Receivables actually declined from 17.7% to 16.9%, so we got faster receivables, and payables and accruals went up, as we'd like, from 17.4% to 18.9%.
So we literally cut our working capital as a function of annualized sales in half, in the last 2 years, from 6.2% to 3.1%. And that really speaks to the quality of the work that all of our independent operating people do executing our strategy.
Next slide. On cash flow performance, again, extremely good cash flow performance. Year-to-date, it's $414 million, which is 23% of revenue. Our free cash flow was 22% of revenue, and our operating cash flow conversion was 132%.
And note on this slide, you'll see in -- 2 years ago, our year-to-date cash flow had been $353 million, and last year, we printed $433 million. But $20 million of that was a onetime payment by Puerto Rico as we got out of that situation with Puerto Rico. So it's real money, but it was a onetime event.
So if you take the $20 million, you're looking at $413 million and this year's $414 million, our cash performance will be even stronger in the second half. But still conversion is great. 
Next slide. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to be very well positioned. You can see that we got a completely undrawn revolver of $1.850 billion at the moment, up from $1.185 billion of last year. So if you look at the cash and undrawn revolver, you're getting about $2.5 billion. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA is $1.267 billion, so our net debt number to EBITDA is running about $1.9 billion -- or 1.9x, and that's after, in that 12-month period, we've invested $1,450,000,000. So after -- well, $1.45 billion, we still have a 1.9x debt-to-EBITDA number, so ample liquidity. We've got a very active pipeline, and really, most of the -- numerous acquisitions that were involved with now in late stages are application software companies, and it's likely we'll be doing something soon.
Next slide. Here, we'll look at the individual detail and the outlook for each one of the segments.
Next slide. All 4 segments continue to perform remarkably well. When you look at that kind of ball-up in the oil and gas that affects the energy business and to a lesser degree, the Industrial Technology because Roper Pump is sitting in there.
Here these 2 are clipping along with energy at 26%, EBITDA to revenue and, actually, sequentially up from the first quarter, and Industrial Technology at 31%. So those remain remarkable performance numbers.
Our software business at 38%, medical at 43% as you can see, and the enterprise as a whole running at 37% without the corporate expense.
Next slide. So we'll take the largest segment first, which is medical. Here you can see that revenue was up 12%, that came from 8 points of acquisition and 4 points overall organic revenue, although imaging pulled that down by 1 point. So medical organic in the quarter was 5%, which is the 10th consecutive quarter that our medical organic revenue has been mid-single digits or better. We certainly don't see that slowing.
Growth was really led by the adoption of new products in 3 of our medical product companies and software businesses as well. We had strong adoption of our alternate site healthcare solution businesses where SHP and SoftWriters were growing at a very high rate and our internal software within MHA did well as well.
Our new product launches at Sunquest, which should be very important for 2017, and hopefully, important yet as the year winds down, are launched and on schedule. We've got the sales pipeline, which is growing, growing really rapidly, and we have a couple of large people that we're talking to. But we would expect to begin to see that affect the second half results favorably, which we'll see below.
In the second half, we think that the organic growth in medical is going to be in the sort of 6% to 9% range. The product growth that we have in the core products is going to continue. We think that trend, the alternate site growth strength is here because we are getting some real push out of SHP and SoftWriters becoming organic rather than just acquisitions. And then we actually we had some favorable comps that will benefit MHA as the year unfolds.
The laboratory software orders are going to increase on the adoption of many new products. And while they're literally over 15 different things that are being launched, there are 4 core large launches around analytics and diagnostic communities and integrated pathologies and clinical content that we think will drive the future of Sunquest.
Our imaging businesses are going to benefit in the second half as the cryo-EM technology emergence is getting better understood by people and sort of our phones are ringing off the hook. They have a strong backlog going into the second half and their product releases are on schedule.
Importantly -- and here, when you look at the operating profit margin, you see 33.7%, which is down from the prior year. A couple of reasons for that, the newer acquisitions have a lot of amortization. In fact, the second quarter number at 33.7% for OP when you add back the noncash amortization at 7.9%, you wind up at 41.6% for the -- every dollar of revenue contributing, and on an EBITDA basis, it's nearly 43%. So good mix between medical products and software and service, and then imaging should do better in the second half.
Next slide. In the RF segment, which is really now increasingly split between RF and software, you can see revenue was up 14%, acquisitions were up 18%, organic was down 4%. But the organic revenue on our software and SaaS business segment was up 9%.
Our toll and traffic had very strong orders, but our revenue declined because of the Puerto Rico contract, which finally anniversaried in the second quarter, so that's a $10 million headwind that goes away. And then the Riyadh project is moving much more slowly. It could easily be $20 million less than what we were told earlier in the year, which is part of the reason for our guide down on the earnings profile. It's still going to continue to happen, the contribution margin we're getting as it rolls out is fine. It's just that it's moving more slowly, and it's not the only thing going in the Saudi Arabia these days that's moving very slowly.
We had very strong segment book to bill here at 1.09. Orders were up 26% with organic orders being up 9%. Again, lots of amortization in this segment, so you see an OP margin of 31.5%, which is up 20 basis points, but when you add back the amortization, which is 5.8% of revenue in the segment and you see the EBITA number is 37.3%, the EBITDA number is 38.1%, up 190 basis points from the second quarter of last year.
We see there -- at bottom here, in terms of forecasting revenue for the balance of the year earnings, the segment organic revenue, we think will be up 5% to 7%. Toll and traffic will improve in the second half. We've gotten strong orders in Q2. The execution of those should be pretty favorable. And we have a big pipeline of opportunity. What has caused us to slow down the guidance for the balance of the year is that decision-making process around that has been slower than normal, and whether that's related to an election situation with people wondering about -- kind of ensuring their commitments is something that's not clear.
Our software and SaaS businesses continue to grow at high single digits with incredible cash returns that earns other investments and acquisitions.
And then RF IDeas business and our On Center acquisitions from last year will go to organic in the fourth quarter, which is why you'll see this bigger mix of organic in the second half of the year and less on acquisitions than you did in the first 2 quarters. 
Next slide. On the Industrial Technology segment. Here, you can see that orders declined -- well, actually, orders were up 3%, but the organic growth declined by 1%. The divestiture was 3%.
The organic, if we exclude oil and gas and industrial, was up 4%. The problem with this segment was simply that the upstream was worse than expected for Roper Pump, and we had expected a big down, but it was down 44%, so a little bigger than we had anticipated. The good news is it does appear that, that's the bottom of the situation. And of course, Roper Pump's impact on the segment is dramatically de-escalated as their revenue has dropped so much over the last 2 years.
Neptune on the other hand is doing extremely well. They had double-digit growth in the second quarter on both orders and revenue. They continue to gain share in the marketplace despite people reading about other people that are trying to sell their businesses. Neptune will continue to have record performance.
The material analysis portion of the business, sort of test and measurement, had record orders in the second quarter, which is very encouraging because their revenue had been down sort of high single digits, so that bodes well for the second half.
If you look at the second half, we think that the overall organic revenue in the business will be flat because we don't see any improvement in the upstream markets, although there is a declining impact in the segment as the underlying base business of Roper Pump is getting very small.
Neptune, and Instrumentation, will be able to offset any of the declines we have in oil and gas and finally, in the fourth quarter, the divestiture will anniversary and go away.
Next slide. Here, we look at the Energy Systems & Controls segment. You can see that revenue there was down 15%, and it's really a tale of 2 different businesses, the test and measurement business, which was okay. And then the oil and gas businesses, which were off. So oil and gas was down 25% in the segment, and that really doesn't quite tell the story either because our petroleum analyzer business, if you exclude its small portion of the upstream it has was really flat with, actually, improved profit contribution. But Compressor Controls, which is a high margin business was down by more than 1/3 in revenue and delevered at a quite high rate. We do feel that, from here, it gets -- no longer is negative on a comparison basis as we started to see, of course, some softness throughout the year.
We did have sequential margin improvement. You can see the OP margin came in at 22.5%, and this segment had some amortization, which brought it to 25.8% and EBITDA a little bit higher. The OP margin in the first quarter was 20.4%, so we picked up 210 basis points of sequential margin improvement.
In the second half of the year, we think that the organic revenue in Energy is likely to be down between 7% and 10%, which is really driven by the continued lack of improvement in any of those oil and gas businesses.
We do have an easier comp in the fourth quarter in those oil and gas businesses than normal, so there may be some optimism there. And fourth quarter seasonal increase, we assume, will be similar to what it was last year, which was not very good and that could be a positive surprise.
The industrial test and measurement businesses will continue to improve. They're doing pretty well now, certainly in a low to mid-single digits growth mode. And the margins there are going to continue to improve, and so that's quite good. And the orders, book to bill, in the segment is about 1, so this seems to be pretty well under control.
When we get to the guidance here -- next slide. The outlook for the year, we took the full year down to $6.57 to $6.71, which gives you a midpoint, I guess, of $6.64, which is certainly lower than what we had before. It really is being driven by the more severe downturn in oil and gas. We thought maybe we'd be down in a neighborhood of $75 million in oil and gas for the year, but we're going to be down more like $100 million, so that's a $25 million revenue hit. And then the project pushouts and tolling are another sort of $20 million, $25 million. And then there's currency that we didn't have, Brexit and other factors in currency is another $10 million. So there's about $60 million revenue hit there, and you can assume that comes in at close to 50% on a contribution basis.
And then the rest is really just recognition of a somewhat lower global growth environment, so we think that takes 1 point, or maybe 2 points, off of the organic growth versus what we expected when we initiated guidance at the very beginning of the year.
We get a very thorough bottoms-up review for guidance this time with all of our senior operating people involved, and really kind of rebuilding what everybody had to assure ourselves that we were very comfortable with whatever new guidance we were going to put in place. We really could have some things that will become favorable for us. The factors that brought it down in oil and gas, severity, project delays and tolling, global growth challenges, maybe there's a little optimism there, but we're not ready to embed any of that in our guidance.
In terms of an upside, certainly, the toll projects could accelerate. I think that people had a clearer view of what's going to happen with the election. They might have a better idea about whether they think they're going to be personally benefited or not economically from policy.
The product launches that we have could ramp faster than we have in our guidance, that would be nice, but you never know. And then our capital deployment, which we certainly expect to have more of, will augment growth as the year unfolds, but it's not in our guidance numbers.
If we look at kind of forward revenue and EBITDA leverage, EBITDA leverage is running a little better than 1/3 of new revenue. So even with the deleverage we got from oil and gas, we're still having overall net positive EBITDA leverage on new revenue. And if we -- what else? We got sort of organic growth is 2% to 4% with revenue growth at 7% to 9% for the second half. If we did a bridge like we did at the beginning of the presentation, you'd see it would show similar results with the revenue being up by 10% or more, excluding oil and gas.
Second half tax rate is probably around 30%, and then in the third quarter, we're looking at $1.59 to $1.63.
Next slide. Here, if we look at the summary of what happened in the quarter, you can see for us it was -- normally, we'd talk about the fact that we had record orders and backlog, record sales and operating profit and EBITDA, all which is good, the margins are good, but we hit the lower end of the guidance, so we just didn't feel like leading with those kind of record results when we were a little bit disappointed on the actual EPS number.
Orders, as we said, were an all-time record and up 9%, with a backlog of $1.14 billion and a book to bill, well above 1. So we're well positioned to continue to have a stronger second half.
We get rid of the $10 million a quarter drag from Puerto Rico beginning now, here in the third quarter, and we get rid of the drag on the divestiture of ABEL in the fourth quarter, so a little bit of a drag in Q3.
Revenue being up 5%. We were able to do that because we had sort of high single digits, low double-digit growth between medical, software and water, which allowed us to survive this greater than 40% reduction in our upstream oil and gas businesses. Gross margin at 61%, we feel very good about that. EBITDA margin is fine, likely to improve in the second half a little bit.
Operating cash flow is the same thing, 132% conversion and $414 million. It'll to be stronger as it always is in the second half, so we're quite comfortable with where we are on the operating cash flow.
Back in '14, our oil and gas business was a little above $500 million and 14% of the company. And in 2015, that had dropped to around $400 million and about 11.5% of the company. And today, we think it will finish the year at around $300 million, which will be less than 8% of the company, and the upstream portion is going to be less than 2% of the company with the midstream being around 6%. So the worst is behind us for this kind of change, and we're looking forward to that.
We got a very active pipeline. We are open on quite a few deals. We said at the beginning of the year, we expect to deploy $1 billion, we've put $275 million to work thus far. It's not going to be difficult to find our way to deploying that level of activity.
We still have a great opportunity to continue to compound results. It's really continues to drive our strategy, so we've got our underlying core businesses doing relatively well on a growth perspective, it's just that the oil and gas and unique situation with Puerto Rico, which was a win for us, even though it shows up negatively in the first half revenue, keeps us and all of our strategies alive, and we're very comfortable with our ability to compound results from here out.
So with that, we'll open it up to questions."

It's pretty high, but fortunately, for us, we are not buying public companies and paying a premium for it. So we're buying private companies that if they were public we'd trade at a higher value than they do trade in the private marketplace, which gives us always some beneficial arbitrage. There are as many things available in the acquisition market as I've ever seen. We have looked at billions of dollars of transactions this year, and we're directly engaged with a couple now that have a higher likelihood of closing I think than the ones that we were looking at earlier in the year because of the quality of the business. A lot of the people that are running these private companies aren't interested in becoming public. They would much rather join our firm, have the public equity and our firm that -- and not have the quarterly calls and all of the things that you have to do with investors and banks. So we remain a very attractive home for people, and I think that acquisitions we made in the last couple of years give us a wider variety of things that we can look at. Application software has a huge number of potential verticals, and there are a lot of niches within them that the largest people, that are roll up people, aren't going to be interested in. So it's still a very favorable hunting ground for us. Now the challenge, I think, for the -- all the industry guys in buying things is they tend to not buy things that are us high of quality as what we're buying. And if you're in a marketplace where you're looking for synergies that are going to be driven by overhead absorption or business consolidation or administrative synergies or something, those businesses are trading at a disproportionately high price than where they normally would because the interest rates are so low. The highest quality businesses, oddly enough, trade at a much deeper discount to public comps. People will look at Roper and say, ""Oh my gosh, look, they paid 12x for something."" Well, if you looked at the public company comp, it was trading at 25x or 26x. So I think that people are focused on product-oriented more asset-intensive businesses that are trading at 12x or 13x because of very low interest rates, and people are buying them for 12x or 13x or 14x. We're not in that space. We're in a space where buying stuff at 12x or 13x or 14x, that if it were public, we'd trade at a higher number because of our willingness and experience in how to effectuate those companies joining our public family."

So Sunquest customers are the largest, most complicated laboratories in the United States. These are laboratories that do millions of tests a year. And what our software does is automate from start to finish the laboratory processes. So you get super high-quality results at low cost to operate the labs. So what Sunquest, the new -- the current product directed for Sunquest is to extend that capability that's been steeped in the blood side or the fluid side of the lab and extend it to the other parts of the laboratory. So first is a major product that is the integration of the pathologies inside of a hospital. So it integrates the blood, to the tissue, to the molecular genetics. Very important product for us and for our customers as they deliver medicine inside of their institutions. The second one is a completely refreshed view about how you collect samples at the bedside. It's mobile-enabled, it's integrated into a nurse workflow, important in terms of getting the draws correct at the right location with the right patient, and get it to the laboratory as quickly as possible. The third category of new products is helping the hospitals extend their reach into the communities. Importantly, in the changing reimbursement landscape in U.S. health care, hospitals want the laboratory samples that are in the community, meaning where the physicians that feed patients into their hospitals they want the blood tests that are collected and the all laboratories tests that are collected in the physicians’ offices to be routed into the hospital's laboratory, not just to drive volume in laboratory but to give the clinical information. And so we have a series of tools that integrate into the electronic medical records at the physicians’ offices for ordering and resulting. And then finally, laboratory space has been vacant of any meaningful analytics about how they run the operations, how they benchmark themselves against their peers and improve the operations. So we have a large analytics release that's happening in the second half of this year. Those are 4 net new opportunities. As we've talked about earlier, there is a series of other meaningful upgrades. We've just released a major upgrade to our core clinical pathology on our core blood bank. We've seen the opportunities associated with those upgrades number in the hundreds, and so we are very excited about what the team has been able to build their products with respect to Sunquest."

If the order growth was both on the toll and traffic side where the book-to-bill ratio was very strong, 1.14, I believe, but it was also on the software side. Now a little bit of that is seasonal is our CBORD business, in particular, which serves the college and university market. They have a lot of their renewals and upgrades and security applications that are booked in the second quarter and then delivered or recognized as revenue throughout the year. And so a little bit of that is seasonal, but we saw fundamental growth on the software orders as well. But the largest reason for the book to bill being well above 1 is the backlog that's building on the toll and traffic side. Even though we've seen delays there, we still see fundamental growth happening there in the second half."

See, when we went into the year thinking that would be down about $100 million in the oil and gas, which comes in a little bit into industrial, mostly into energy -- I'm sorry, we thought we'd be down about $75 million, now we're going to be down $100 million. So that $25 million extra negative situation on revenue is disappointing because it comes in at 50%, or frankly, 60% contribution. So it's a big EPS number. It doesn't really diminish our cash performance by much at all. And those businesses, at the moment, are just a free shot on goal for 2017 and '18. They're on the books for an extremely low basis. So the only way if you were going to do something with them, if you want to do either a straight spin or a sponsored spin or you'd want to do an RMP with somebody. It would be safe to say that our phone has been ringing off the hook with people who want to do those kind of things. But we actually think there's substantial upside in those businesses just not this year, and probably not in the first 3 quarters or next year. But if they start cranking, just modestly in 2018, we're going to have windfall kind of results. So we prefer to hold onto them, continue to invest. The industrial business, it was 26% EBITDA in the quarter, I would say, and energy business -- we got 31% in industrial and 26% in energy. So -- I mean, these are really good businesses. Most of our investors, when we talk to the long guys, their fear is, ""Gee, if you put those someplace, how could we trust they can run them as well as you can."" And we always humbly say, ""Well, you may be right."" So these are great businesses. They're just in situation where if somebody is off 44% to 52%, it's incredible, but they're still able to perform at the levels they are, because they are so nimble. So I don't really see those as necessary sales. We know how to run them, we know how to run them well. If they didn't have this extra $25 million headwind in the second half then our guidance reduction wouldn't have been so great. And then no one could have predicted what happened with -- what's going on in Saudi is certainly an interesting time, and it's affected several of our businesses' revenues in the second quarter. So I think the underlying thesis for us is we've got some cash cow businesses that are at their absolute nadir. They're going to continue to drive a lot of performance over the years, and they are a great annuity value for our investors."

Because we acquired CliniSys, which on an operating-profit basis is below the segment average. And frankly, even on an EBITDA basis, it's below the segment average, right? Remember the segment average here is at the low 40% EBITDA margin range. So the fact that CliniSys comes in at only in the 35%, maybe a little bit less than that, EBITDA margin range means it drags it down. So that is a contributor. And then the other piece is roughly the relative mix between -- so our medical growth so far this year and, in fact, for the remainder of the year as well, although not as much in the fourth quarter has been driven more by product, by medical products sales. Still terrific businesses and great margin, but not the highest margin businesses inside the segment, which is really more of the software and services side. So it's more of a mix issue, but we see that mix issue actually moderating as we go throughout the year. And to an earlier question, that's why we see some fall through in margin expansion in the fourth quarter."

So orders were actually up to a record $956 million. They were up 9% in the quarter, and our book to bill for the enterprise was 1.02.
Revenue was up 5% to $934 million versus last year's first quarter. Organic revenue was down 2%. We had the divestiture that's still in our numbers through the third quarter, the ABEL divestiture, which pulls 1% away, and acquisition were up 80%.
We had really terrific growth in medical and in software, and in water, we'll talk more about that within those respective segments.
But the oil and gas declines were actually worse than we expected. We went into the year thinking that we'd be down may be in the high teens to 20%. In the quarter, we were down 25%. But in the upstream areas, we were down dramatically more, 44%, 51%, 52%, numbers that really were amazing for us. Those are, of course, old businesses, so they all are directly EPS-type businesses because they don't have much in the way of noncash amortization.
The toll and traffic project delay was also a little bit of a disappointment as Saudi is rolling out their program slowly. We're on track with everything we do, but their rate of initiation of new zones has been slow.
Our gross margin was another record, up 90 basis points to 61% and EBITDA was up to $314 million, 33.6% of revenue.
Our DEPS number at $1.56 was disappointing from our perspective because it did hit the low end of the range, but in a quarter where we had record orders and record sales, record backlog and record EBITDA and operating profit, we just came up a little light on the revenue side from the oil and gas and project delays, each of which probably cost us $6 million to $7 million of revenue, and that's why we were about $1.56 at the low range instead of being up at the higher end of $1.61.
Our operating cash flow was $170 million, which is strong in Q2. Year-to-date, our operating cash flow has been $414 million, which is 23% of revenue, and that's a particularly pleasing number when you're going through the sort of oil and gas decline that you could still maintain these kind of ratios.
Our recent acquisitions are performing well. We have an extremely strong pipeline, which is very active. We'll talk about it in a little bit.
So it was a solid quarter, but we did have to adjust our outlook for the economic realities we see in the second half of the year, and we'll talk about that when we get to guidance.
Next slide. Here, we're looking at the Q2 income statement. As you can see, orders up 9%; book to bill, 1.02; revenue, up 5%; gross profit was up 6%; gross margin, up 90 basis points. The operating income ratio is 27.4% versus last year's 28.5%, but as you can see, amortization increased by $10 million, and our EBITA performance, if we were reporting in that way, would look better in terms of continued sustained upward trends in our ratios.
The earnings before tax number was down 2%, and the tax rate was a relatively big headwind in the quarter, although the tax rate is really sort of appropriate for us at 29.8%.
Last year, we had an extremely unusual event in the Q2 numbers, which was $15.9 million of a good guy that came from a long-term settlement of a tax position, and that really, that $1.70, if you adjusted it for the $0.16 of that onetime benefit, would have been about $1.54 and this year, we're at $1.56.
Next slide. If we look here at the revenue bridge, I think most people find this to be quite surprising. The underlying core nature of the business is continuing to grow at double digits.
Here, you can see, if we looked at last year's second quarter, we printed $892 million. That included the $10 million Puerto Rico situation that we were trying to get out of because of all the reasons everybody knows. We were successful, but it's still in the number in the second quarter at $10 million. And then we had the divestiture of the Eastern German pump company for $6 million, and then the oil and gas decrement in the second quarter alone was $33 million.
So those things were a $49 million headwind. If we look at the base then at $843 million, you'll see we added $91 million to that number, so while the total revenue is up 5%, the revenue, excluding the oil and gas and these things that are anniversarying was up 11%. It's really almost identical to what happened in the first quarter, where if you exclude oil and gas in Puerto Rico and the divestiture, we were also up 11%.
The good news is that for the balance of the year, we think the second half will be similar, where we got more than 10%, excluding oil and gas, but will have a better organic growth, so there'll be a little less in the acquisition dollars and more in the organic growth dollars, where at least until we do another acquisition.
So -- actually, we felt the growth is pretty solid despite the headwinds.
Next slide. Here, you can see that we continue with the governance process we have to make remarkable progress in our asset-light business model. Two years ago, our inventory was at 6% of revenue, and at the end of June, this year, it's down to 5.1%, so a 90 basis point improvement. Receivables actually declined from 17.7% to 16.9%, so we got faster receivables, and payables and accruals went up, as we'd like, from 17.4% to 18.9%.
So we literally cut our working capital as a function of annualized sales in half, in the last 2 years, from 6.2% to 3.1%. And that really speaks to the quality of the work that all of our independent operating people do executing our strategy.
Next slide. On cash flow performance, again, extremely good cash flow performance. Year-to-date, it's $414 million, which is 23% of revenue. Our free cash flow was 22% of revenue, and our operating cash flow conversion was 132%.
And note on this slide, you'll see in -- 2 years ago, our year-to-date cash flow had been $353 million, and last year, we printed $433 million. But $20 million of that was a onetime payment by Puerto Rico as we got out of that situation with Puerto Rico. So it's real money, but it was a onetime event.
So if you take the $20 million, you're looking at $413 million and this year's $414 million, our cash performance will be even stronger in the second half. But still conversion is great. 
Next slide. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to be very well positioned. You can see that we got a completely undrawn revolver of $1.850 billion at the moment, up from $1.185 billion of last year. So if you look at the cash and undrawn revolver, you're getting about $2.5 billion. Our trailing 12 months EBITDA is $1.267 billion, so our net debt number to EBITDA is running about $1.9 billion -- or 1.9x, and that's after, in that 12-month period, we've invested $1,450,000,000. So after -- well, $1.45 billion, we still have a 1.9x debt-to-EBITDA number, so ample liquidity. We've got a very active pipeline, and really, most of the -- numerous acquisitions that were involved with now in late stages are application software companies, and it's likely we'll be doing something soon.
Next slide. Here, we'll look at the individual detail and the outlook for each one of the segments.
Next slide. All 4 segments continue to perform remarkably well. When you look at that kind of ball-up in the oil and gas that affects the energy business and to a lesser degree, the Industrial Technology because Roper Pump is sitting in there.
Here these 2 are clipping along with energy at 26%, EBITDA to revenue and, actually, sequentially up from the first quarter, and Industrial Technology at 31%. So those remain remarkable performance numbers.
Our software business at 38%, medical at 43% as you can see, and the enterprise as a whole running at 37% without the corporate expense.
Next slide. So we'll take the largest segment first, which is medical. Here you can see that revenue was up 12%, that came from 8 points of acquisition and 4 points overall organic revenue, although imaging pulled that down by 1 point. So medical organic in the quarter was 5%, which is the 10th consecutive quarter that our medical organic revenue has been mid-single digits or better. We certainly don't see that slowing.
Growth was really led by the adoption of new products in 3 of our medical product companies and software businesses as well. We had strong adoption of our alternate site health care solution businesses where SHP and SoftWriters were growing at a very high rate and our internal software within MHA did well as well.
Our new product launches at Sunquest, which should be very important for 2017, and hopefully, important yet as the year winds down, are launched and on schedule. We've got the sales pipeline, which is growing, growing really rapidly, and we have a couple of large people that we're talking to. But we would expect to begin to see that affect the second half results favorably, which we'll see below.
In the second half, we think that the organic growth in medical is going to be in the sort of 6% to 9% range. The product growth that we have in the core products is going to continue. We think that trend, the alternate site growth strength is here because we are getting some real push out of SHP and SoftWriters becoming organic rather than just acquisitions. And then we actually we had some favorable comps that will benefit MHA as the year unfolds.
The laboratory software orders are going to increase on the adoption of many new products. And while they're literally over 15 different things that are being launched, there are 4 core large launches around analytics and diagnostic communities and integrated pathologies and clinical content that we think will drive the future of Sunquest.
Our imaging businesses are going to benefit in the second half as the cryo-EM technology emergence is getting better understood by people and sort of our phones are ringing off the hook. They have a strong backlog going into the second half and their product releases are on schedule.
Importantly -- and here, when you look at the operating profit margin, you see 33.7%, which is down from the prior year. A couple of reasons for that, the newer acquisitions have a lot of amortization. In fact, the second quarter number at 33.7% for OP when you add back the noncash amortization at 7.9%, you wind up at 41.6% for the -- every dollar of revenue contributing, and on an EBITDA basis, it's nearly 43%. So good mix between medical products and software and service, and then imaging should do better in the second half.
Next slide. In the RF segment, which is really now increasingly split between RF and software, you can see revenue was up 14%, acquisitions were up 18%, organic was down 4%. But the organic revenue on our software and SaaS business segment was up 9%.
Our toll and traffic had very strong orders, but our revenue declined because of the Puerto Rico contract, which finally anniversaried in the second quarter, so that's a $10 million headwind that goes away. And then the Riyadh project is moving much more slowly. It could easily be $20 million less than what we were told earlier in the year, which is part of the reason for our guide down on the earnings profile. It's still going to continue to happen, the contribution margin we're getting as it rolls out is fine. It's just that it's moving more slowly, and it's not the only thing going in the Saudi Arabia these days that's moving very slowly.
We had very strong segment book to bill here at 1.09. Orders were up 26% with organic orders being up 9%. Again, lots of amortization in this segment, so you see an OP margin of 31.5%, which is up 20 basis points, but when you add back the amortization, which is 5.8% of revenue in the segment and you see the EBITA number is 37.3%, the EBITDA number is 38.1%, up 190 basis points from the second quarter of last year.
We see there -- at bottom here, in terms of forecasting revenue for the balance of the year earnings, the segment organic revenue, we think will be up 5% to 7%. Toll and traffic will improve in the second half. We've gotten strong orders in Q2. The execution of those should be pretty favorable. And we have a big pipeline of opportunity. What has caused us to slow down the guidance for the balance of the year is that decision-making process around that has been slower than normal, and whether that's related to an election situation with people wondering about -- kind of ensuring their commitments is something that's not clear.
Our software and SaaS businesses continue to grow at high single digits with incredible cash returns that earns other investments and acquisitions.
And then RF IDeas business and our On Center acquisitions from last year will go to organic in the fourth quarter, which is why you'll see this bigger mix of organic in the second half of the year and less on acquisitions than you did in the first 2 quarters. 
Next slide. On the Industrial Technology segment. Here, you can see that orders declined -- well, actually, orders were up 3%, but the organic growth declined by 1%. The divestiture was 3%.
The organic, if we exclude oil and gas and industrial, was up 4%. The problem with this segment was simply that the upstream was worse than expected for Roper Pump, and we had expected a big down, but it was down 44%, so a little bigger than we had anticipated. The good news is it does appear that, that's the bottom of the situation. And of course, Roper Pump's impact on the segment is dramatically de-escalated as their revenue has dropped so much over the last 2 years.
Neptune on the other hand is doing extremely well. They had double-digit growth in the second quarter on both orders and revenue. They continue to gain share in the marketplace despite people reading about other people that are trying to sell their businesses. Neptune will continue to have record performance.
The material analysis portion of the business, sort of test and measurement, had record orders in the second quarter, which is very encouraging because their revenue had been down sort of high single digits, so that bodes well for the second half.
If you look at the second half, we think that the overall organic revenue in the business will be flat because we don't see any improvement in the upstream markets, although there is a declining impact in the segment as the underlying base business of Roper Pump is getting very small.
Neptune, and Instrumentation, will be able to offset any of the declines we have in oil and gas and finally, in the fourth quarter, the divestiture will anniversary and go away.
Next slide. Here, we look at the Energy Systems & Controls segment. You can see that revenue there was down 15%, and it's really a tale of 2 different businesses, the test and measurement business, which was okay. And then the oil and gas businesses, which were off. So oil and gas was down 25% in the segment, and that really doesn't quite tell the story either because our petroleum analyzer business, if you exclude its small portion of the upstream it has was really flat with, actually, improved profit contribution. But Compressor Controls, which is a high margin business was down by more than 1/3 in revenue and delevered at a quite high rate. We do feel that, from here, it gets -- no longer is negative on a comparison basis as we started to see, of course, some softness throughout the year.
We did have sequential margin improvement. You can see the OP margin came in at 22.5%, and this segment had some amortization, which brought it to 25.8% and EBITDA a little bit higher. The OP margin in the first quarter was 20.4%, so we picked up 210 basis points of sequential margin improvement.
In the second half of the year, we think that the organic revenue in Energy is likely to be down between 7% and 10%, which is really driven by the continued lack of improvement in any of those oil and gas businesses.
We do have an easier comp in the fourth quarter in those oil and gas businesses than normal, so there may be some optimism there. And fourth quarter seasonal increase, we assume, will be similar to what it was last year, which was not very good and that could be a positive surprise.
The industrial test and measurement businesses will continue to improve. They're doing pretty well now, certainly in a low to mid-single digits growth mode. And the margins there are going to continue to improve, and so that's quite good. And the orders, book to bill, in the segment is about 1, so this seems to be pretty well under control.
When we get to the guidance here -- next slide. The outlook for the year, we took the full year down to $6.57 to $6.71, which gives you a midpoint, I guess, of $6.64, which is certainly lower than what we had before. It really is being driven by the more severe downturn in oil and gas. We thought maybe we'd be down in a neighborhood of $75 million in oil and gas for the year, but we're going to be down more like $100 million, so that's a $25 million revenue hit. And then the project pushouts and tolling are another sort of $20 million, $25 million. And then there's currency that we didn't have, Brexit and other factors in currency is another $10 million. So there's about $60 million revenue hit there, and you can assume that comes in at close to 50% on a contribution basis.
And then the rest is really just recognition of a somewhat lower global growth environment, so we think that takes 1 point, or maybe 2 points, off of the organic growth versus what we expected when we initiated guidance at the very beginning of the year.
We get a very thorough bottoms-up review for guidance this time with all of our senior operating people involved, and really kind of rebuilding what everybody had to assure ourselves that we were very comfortable with whatever new guidance we were going to put in place. We really could have some things that will become favorable for us. The factors that brought it down in oil and gas, severity, project delays and tolling, global growth challenges, maybe there's a little optimism there, but we're not ready to embed any of that in our guidance.
In terms of an upside, certainly, the toll projects could accelerate. I think that people had a clearer view of what's going to happen with the election. They might have a better idea about whether they think they're going to be personally benefited or not economically from policy.
The product launches that we have could ramp faster than we have in our guidance, that would be nice, but you never know. And then our capital deployment, which we certainly expect to have more of, will augment growth as the year unfolds, but it's not in our guidance numbers.
If we look at kind of forward revenue and EBITDA leverage, EBITDA leverage is running a little better than 1/3 of new revenue. So even with the deleverage we got from oil and gas, we're still having overall net positive EBITDA leverage on new revenue. And if we -- what else? We got sort of organic growth is 2% to 4% with revenue growth at 7% to 9% for the second half. If we did a bridge like we did at the beginning of the presentation, you'd see it would show similar results with the revenue being up by 10% or more, excluding oil and gas.
Second half tax rate is probably around 30%, and then in the third quarter, we're looking at $1.59 to $1.63.
Next slide. Here, if we look at the summary of what happened in the quarter, you can see for us it was -- normally, we'd talk about the fact that we had record orders and backlog, record sales and operating profit and EBITDA, all which is good, the margins are good, but we hit the lower end of the guidance, so we just didn't feel like leading with those kind of record results when we were a little bit disappointed on the actual EPS number.
Orders, as we said, were an all-time record and up 9%, with a backlog of $1.14 billion and a book to bill, well above 1. So we're well positioned to continue to have a stronger second half.
We get rid of the $10 million a quarter drag from Puerto Rico beginning now, here in the third quarter, and we get rid of the drag on the divestiture of ABEL in the fourth quarter, so a little bit of a drag in Q3.
Revenue being up 5%. We were able to do that because we had sort of high single digits, low double-digit growth between medical, software and water, which allowed us to survive this greater than 40% reduction in our upstream oil and gas businesses. Gross margin at 61%, we feel very good about that. EBITDA margin is fine, likely to improve in the second half a little bit.
Operating cash flow is the same thing, 132% conversion and $414 million. It'll to be stronger as it always is in the second half, so we're quite comfortable with where we are on the operating cash flow.
Back in '14, our oil and gas business was a little above $500 million and 14% of the company. And in 2015, that had dropped to around $400 million and about 11.5% of the company. And today, we think it will finish the year at around $300 million, which will be less than 8% of the company, and the upstream portion is going to be less than 2% of the company with the midstream being around 6%. So the worst is behind us for this kind of change, and we're looking forward to that.
We got a very active pipeline. We are open on quite a few deals. We said at the beginning of the year, we expect to deploy $1 billion, we've put $275 million to work thus far. It's not going to be difficult to find our way to deploying that level of activity.
We still have a great opportunity to continue to compound results. It's really continues to drive our strategy, so we've got our underlying core businesses doing relatively well on a growth perspective, it's just that the oil and gas and unique situation with Puerto Rico, which was a win for us, even though it shows up negatively in the first half revenue, keeps us and all of our strategies alive, and we're very comfortable with our ability to compound results from here out.
So with that, we'll open it up to questions."

They would much rather join our firm, have the public equity and our firm that -- and not have the quarterly calls and all of the things that you have to do with investors and banks. So we remain a very attractive home for people, and I think that acquisitions we made in the last couple of years give us a wider variety of things that we can look at. Application software has a huge number of potential verticals, and there are a lot of niches within them that the largest people, that are roll up people, aren't going to be interested in. So it's still a very favorable hunting ground for us. Now the challenge, I think, for the -- all the industry guys in buying things is they tend to not buy things that are us high of quality as what we're buying. And if you're in a marketplace where you're looking for synergies that are going to be driven by overhead absorption or business consolidation or administrative synergies or something, those businesses are trading at a disproportionately high price than where they normally would because the interest rates are so low. The highest quality businesses, oddly enough, trade at a much deeper discount to public comps. People will look at Roper and say, ""Oh my gosh, look, they paid 12x for something."" Well, if you looked at the public company comp, it was trading at 25x or 26x. So I think that people are focused on product-oriented more asset-intensive businesses that are trading at 12x or 13x because of very low interest rates, and people are buying them for 12x or 13x or 14x. We're not in that space. We're in a space where buying stuff at 12x or 13x or 14x, that if it were public, we'd trade at a higher number because of our willingness and experience in how to effectuate those companies joining our public family."

So Sunquest customers are the largest, most complicated laboratories in the United States. These are laboratories that do millions of tests a year. And what our software does is automate from start to finish the laboratory processes. So you get super high-quality results at low cost to operate the labs. So what Sunquest, the new -- the current product directed for Sunquest is to extend that capability that's been steeped in the blood side or the fluid side of the lab and extend it to the other parts of the laboratory. So first is a major product that is the integration of the pathologies inside of a hospital. So it integrates the blood, to the tissue, to the molecular genetics. Very important product for us and for our customers as they deliver medicine inside of their institutions. The second one is a completely refreshed view about how you collect samples at the bedside. It's mobile-enabled, it's integrated into a nurse workflow, important in terms of getting the draws correct at the right location with the right patient, and get it to the laboratory as quickly as possible. The third category of new products is helping the hospitals extend their reach into the communities. Importantly, in the changing reimbursement landscape in U.S. health care, hospitals want the laboratory samples that are in the community, meaning where the physicians that feed patients into their hospitals they want the blood tests that are collected and the all laboratories tests that are collected in the physicians’ offices to be routed into the hospital's laboratory, not just to drive volume in laboratory but to give the clinical information. And so we have a series of tools that integrate into the electronic medical records at the physicians’ offices for ordering and resulting. And then finally, laboratory space has been vacant of any meaningful analytics about how they run the operations, how they benchmark themselves against their peers and improve the operations. So we have a large analytics release that's happening in the second half of this year. Those are 4 net new opportunities. As we've talked about earlier, there is a series of other meaningful upgrades. We've just released a major upgrade to our core clinical pathology on our core blood bank. We've seen the opportunities associated with those upgrades number in the hundreds, and so we are very excited about what the team has been able to build their products with respect to Sunquest."

And that's true on -- not only the software-type businesses, like Neil was just talking about, but also our products businesses, and particularly at Gatan and some of our imaging business where they have very high gross margins because of all the technology and all the R&D that we invest there. It does result in higher gross margins. So as the volume increases, we expect that fall through to improve.

Even though we've seen delays there, we still see fundamental growth happening there in the second half."

See, when we went into the year thinking that would be down about $100 million in the oil and gas, which comes in a little bit into industrial, mostly into energy -- I'm sorry, we thought we'd be down about $75 million, now we're going to be down $100 million. So that $25 million extra negative situation on revenue is disappointing because it comes in at 50%, or frankly, 60% contribution. So it's a big EPS number. It doesn't really diminish our cash performance by much at all. And those businesses, at the moment, are just a free shot on goal for 2017 and '18. They're on the books for an extremely low basis. So the only way if you were going to do something with them, if you want to do either a straight spin or a sponsored spin or you'd want to do an RMP with somebody. It would be safe to say that our phone has been ringing off the hook with people who want to do those kind of things. But we actually think there's substantial upside in those businesses just not this year, and probably not in the first 3 quarters or next year. But if they start cranking, just modestly in 2018, we're going to have windfall kind of results. So we prefer to hold onto them, continue to invest. The industrial business, it was 26% EBITDA in the quarter, I would say, and energy business -- we got 31% in industrial and 26% in energy. So -- I mean, these are really good businesses. Most of our investors, when we talk to the long guys, their fear is, ""Gee, if you put those someplace, how could we trust they can run them as well as you can."" And we always humbly say, ""Well, you may be right."" So these are great businesses. They're just in situation where if somebody is off 44% to 52%, it's incredible, but they're still able to perform at the levels they are, because they are so nimble. So I don't really see those as necessary sales. We know how to run them, we know how to run them well. If they didn't have this extra $25 million headwind in the second half then our guidance reduction wouldn't have been so great. And then no one could have predicted what happened with -- what's going on in Saudi is certainly an interesting time, and it's affected several of our businesses' revenues in the second quarter. So I think the underlying thesis for us is we've got some cash cow businesses that are at their absolute nadir. They're going to continue to drive a lot of performance over the years, and they are a great annuity value for our investors."

Because we acquired CliniSys, which on an operating-profit basis is below the segment average. And frankly, even on an EBITDA basis, it's below the segment average, right? Remember the segment average here is at the low 40% EBITDA margin range. So the fact that CliniSys comes in at only in the 35%, maybe a little bit less than that, EBITDA margin range means it drags it down. So that is a contributor. And then the other piece is roughly the relative mix between -- so our medical growth so far this year and, in fact, for the remainder of the year as well, although not as much in the fourth quarter has been driven more by product, by medical products sales. Still terrific businesses and great margin, but not the highest margin businesses inside the segment, which is really more of the software and services side. So it's more of a mix issue, but we see that mix issue actually moderating as we go throughout the year. And to an earlier question, that's why we see some fall through in margin expansion in the fourth quarter."

It is also a little bit of what we're talking about with the margin impact and the outlook for the rest of the year."

We've seen good success with Sunquest and MHA and tucking in some related businesses at Sunquest, that CliniSys and GeneInsight and Atlas. And I'm curious, do we stay on that path with more of the bolt-ons to Sunquest and MHA? Or is there something in there with some scale that we could pull in?"

If you look at the -- the last larger transaction was Aderant. There are a lot of things that was sort of the size of Aderant. And Aderant also offers us an opportunity for some bolt-on acquisitions to kind of grow its platform status. I would hope that the next acquisition we have is more like that, where it's meaningful, it's something that we know how to do, people would be confident that we're already doing those kinds of things. So that is likely what the next thing would be. Now that said, this year, we looked at a number of very large transactions. And those are always of interest. We're incredibly conservative and careful around those. But I would be disappointed in the next 2 or 3 years if we didn't do a quite large transaction."

Joining me on the call this morning are Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Humphrey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Paul Soni, our Vice President and Controller. 
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast or also available on our website. 
Now if you'll please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. 
And now please turn to Slide 3. Today, we'll be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation on our website. 
For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consist of 2 items: First, a $2.2 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue relating to software acquisitions. This represents revenue that those companies would have recognized if not for our acquisition. Second, a $0.9 million debt extinguishment charge related to the replacement of our former credit facility with a new $2.5 billion facility that closed in the quarter. 
And now if you'll please turn to Slide 4. I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?"
22751,404143078,1067133,"Roper Technologies, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Roper Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everybody. We'll start here with the Q3 enterprise results, so next slide. We had a record for just about everything again in the third quarter. Our orders were an all-time record at $929 million. And by the way, if we",3553,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everybody. We'll start here with the Q3 enterprise results, so next slide. 
We had a record for just about everything again in the third quarter. Our orders were an all-time record at $929 million. And by the way, if we had booked the MTA order a couple of days earlier, but it wasn't quite ready to go, we would have been -- we'd have our first $1 billion quarter in our history. 
Revenue was strong. Net earnings were, of course, a record EBITDA cash flow. Revenue was up 7% to $947 million, which gave us 2 points of organic growth despite the headwinds in oil and gas. FX cost is 1 point. And acquisitions and divestitures, netted out, plus 6% because this was still the last quarter without all of the divestment in it.
Growth was led by both the Medical and RF Technology software [ph] businesses. And certainly, Neptune had an outstanding quarter. You'll see in a minute. 
Declines in oil and gas were basically about what we thought. We thought they'd be sort of down 20% or so, and they were.  Gross margins were up 60 basis points to 61.3%, and EBITDA was up 8% to $328 million.  Our net earnings reached $169 million, which gave us a DEPS earnings per share number of $1.65, ahead of our guidance. 
Free cash flow was up 40%. Really, an astonishing quarter, where our free cash flow is up 11% year-to-date, but up 40% in the third quarter. 
And then our ConstructConnect acquisition, which we're announcing today and which will close this week, is another terrific business for us. It's a SaaS network business for the preconstruction industry, and we'll detail that later in the call this morning, and it should close yet this week. 
So we have very strong cash quarter. We had record results, and then we had this great acquisition. 
So the next slide. Here if you look at the income statement, you can see orders were up 4%. The book-to-bill was 0.98, which is okay because of sort of lumpy activity. It's in the wheelhouse. But had we'd [ph] been able to book the MTA order, our book-to-bill would have been 105, which gives you some idea about how strong really the core orders were. The only thing then in the quarter that was odd is that the normal fourth quarter delivery schedule stuff was not very strong. 
Revenue was up 7%, our gross profit was up 8%. You can see we're up 60 basis points in gross profit. The operating income margin, because of the acquisition and amortization in these things, you can see it going to 28.5%, which is still spectacular but down 20 basis points. The reality is, on the next slide, you'll see the EBITA margin actually went up 30 basis points, which is the right way to look at a cash-oriented business like ours.  And then net earnings were up 4%. Tax rate, about what we thought. 
Next slide. If you compare the operating and the EBITA margins, we certainly have not reported leading, first, with those kind of numbers. But our EBITA margin, as you can see in 2014's third quarter, were 32.5%. Last year at 33.4%. And this year, 33.7%. So our margins on the operating cash side are up 120 basis points in just 2 years, and our gross margins continue up as well. If -- focusing on the operating profit margin, where you get a lot of noncash amortization charges, would lead people to the wrong conclusion, it's the wrong way to think about cash business like ours, even though the results are outstanding. So we're really focused on continuing to improve our EBITA margins, which were up 30 basis points. 
Next slide. We continue to compound [ph] cash flow at a quite strong clip, and we don't see that slowing down anytime soon. We really have terrific operating cash flow in the quarter, $317 million. Both operating and free cash flow were up 40%. And you can see the comparison to last year at $660 million year-to-date operating cash flow and now we're at $731 million, up 11% despite less-than-robust end markets in our industrial and energy businesses. 
Conversion was pretty spectacular. You can see our year-to-date conversion on operating cash flow is 146%, so excellent cash performance. 
Next slide. Our asset-light business model, which 5 years ago people told me you couldn't make it any better than it was, continues to improve at really phenomenal rates. Here, you can see inventory is down 80 basis points from 2 years ago. Receivables are down 150 basis points, and payables and accruals are actually up 160. So 2 years ago, we had 5.8% net working capital to revenue, and the way we measure it, today, we closed the quarter at 1.9%. That's a 67% reduction as a function of revenue in just [ph] 2 years, 390 basis points.  So the quality of the asset-light acquisitions that we've been doing the last couple of years in addition to our own governance process around improving everything we own is really having just astonishing impact on our ability to compound cash and deploy future capital. 
Next slide. If you look here at the financial position of the company, you get some sense of the balance sheet. Just as a quick note, this is absolutely the biggest balance sheet that we have ever had to capture capital deployment opportunities.  We now have an undrawn revolver of $2.5 billion, and we have $882 million of cash, so nearly $3.4 billion of powder. Even after paying for the ConstructConnect business, our acquisition powder is right around $2.8 billion. 
We begin -- we've deployed capital since January 1, 2015, at a rate of $2.7 billion during that 21-month period. So our compounding of the cash and the strength of the balance sheet and the flexibility that our new credit facility gives us is all great because we're going to be able to put that to good use with the incredible acquisition pipeline that we continue to see. And you can see our net debt to EBITDA number is only 1.7 after the acquisition. It's still just around 2, so we got a lot of ramp space here to be able to continue to make transactions that are accretive to the company. 
Next slide. We'll look at the segment detail of each of the 4 segments the way we record it, and then talk about the detail of the business here after that. 
So the next slide. Here, if we look at the Q3 segment performance of energy, you can see its EBITDA margin was 29%; Industrial tech, 32%. The first point about thinking around these businesses is how remarkable their margin performance is in these challenging markets. The nimble execution that we have inside the presence that's around these [ph] businesses is really amazing.  In 2003, those businesses, the Energy and Industrial businesses taken together, had about $377 million in revenue. And this year taken together, they had $303 million and yet the EBITDA margin in '14 was 32% of those combined businesses. And here this year, it's 31%. So despite a significant falloff in revenue, the margins have been able to be maintained. 
The second point of this slide is that, of course, our future in the nature of the enterprise you can see continues to compound towards the RF, the application software, the medical software and the medical products businesses, which now make up nearly 75% of the EBITDA of Roper's entire entity. And they also have done remarkably well. Two years ago, those businesses had about 39% EBITDA. Today, those businesses have about 41% EBITDA. 
Next slide. If we look at the first, our smallest segment, Energy Systems now is down to barely 10% of the company. And its organic growth was down 13% generally the way we thought it would be. The segment, while down, is [ph] expected really did modestly better than it did in the second quarter and is likely to do modestly better again in the fourth quarter. 
Terrific profitability. The OP margins in the second and third quarter were 25.4%, and EBITDA margins were 29.2%. 
When we look at the fourth quarter, we think oil and gas will be down about another 20% in this particular segment, same as it was in the third quarter, but we don't think we're going to get much growth in terms of fourth quarter seasonality. We didn't get much last year. But generally, it's been quite substantial, so we're sort of assuming that we won't get that this year. 
Margins will improve again in the fourth quarter. We started the year out in energy with 20.4% OP; second quarter went to 22.5%; the third quarter is already up to 25.4%; and the fourth quarter will be substantially materially above that. So these businesses still in our view represents sort of free shot [ph] on goal for us, and they only represent 10% or less of revenue. 
Next slide. On the Industrial Technology side, you can see that this is the -- fortunately, the last quarter we'll talk about this divestiture of ABEL. If you adjust for the divestiture, the segment was actually flat despite the upstream oil and gas piece that's in Industrial Technology being down 35%. So how did that happen? What happened from double-digit growth at Neptune, who continues to gain market share, and very strong demand for the R900 Automated Meter Reading and AMI technology with lots of migrating upgrades. We had a significant number of wins last quarter, over 10. And really, the $50 million that we put into R&D in the last 3 years in Neptune has gotten us into a very outstanding position that people will begin to appreciate just how much we've done and how far advanced we are going to be over the next couple of years in the space. 
We did get some sequential improvement at Roper Pump, and we expect to have a little bit better results again in the fourth quarter despite basically that -- 2 other businesses in here that are really purely related to upstream and have been severely hampered. 
The rest of our businesses in here are -- it's kind [ph] of test businesses are all doing relatively well. Some of them actually have record quarters. And on balance, we don't see any deterioration in those businesses. 
In the fourth quarter, we think we'll have sort of similar revenue and margin performance to what we had in the third quarter. And while upstream markets are sequentially flat, there is a tiny bit of improvement that we're seeing. 
Next slide. Here, we'll look at the RF Technology and Software segment. It's really increasingly right to think about 3 legs in this segment with the RF product side of activity, and then you have the tolling side of activity, and then you have all this application software business. And of course now in addition to that, with ConstructConnect. 
So here, the business' revenue was up 20% in the quarter. The operating profit was up 26%. The OP margin is 31.7%, but the EBITDA margin was 38%, up 230 basis points. 
We had organic growth of 7% in this segment and had about 1 point of foreign exchange headwind, and acquisitions helped by 14%. 
Very strong growth at toll and traffic on project activity in Florida and Texas and Pennsylvania. Sounds like swing states in the election. 
Continued high single-digit growth in Software led by freight matching and CBORD. We did some really exciting things at freight matching. We've moved to a more modern software-friendly location in the Portland, Oregon area, and then we've put together the freight matching network, so DAT in the U.S. and Getloaded, into a new software development process that's going to expand our customer base. 
We had double-digit growth in the RF products business. A lot of that's driven by senior living. There are several of our businesses that touch senior living. 
And then toll and traffic had -- would have had spectacular orders, of course, if we would have been able to book the bridge and toll project -- toll -- tunnel project, which we hoped would happen a little bit earlier in the year.  We had a 5-year extension of our toll mandate in Dubai. And the Saudi project is sort of back on track. We wound up with about 30 installations here in the fourth quarter, we think, which will get us to about 70 of the 350. So we feel much better about the progress in Riyadh. 
In the fourth quarter, TransCore was awarded a $70 million plus MTA project to convert 9 bridges and tunnels around the 5 boroughs. All of you who go back and forth are now well aware of what that's like. There's like 800,000 people a day going through that process. And conversion with our Infinity Lane technology will allow people to not have tollbooths, and there'll be fines, of course, based on video tolling. But if you have your normal tool tank, you'll be able to get through.  The growth in toll and traffic, we think, will continue to manifest itself in the fourth quarter and certainly, into 2017. 
The Software businesses universally remain strong. We had kind of mid-single-digit organic growth in the whole segment, which gives a really strong momentum going into '17, certainly the best position we've had in this segment in a long time. 
And now we've acquired ConstructConnect, which we'll talk about here in a second, for $632 million. Got about $150 million in revenue and sort of Roper-type expected EBITDA margins, which will get better as it gets inside the Roper -- the governance process. 
Next slide. So talking about ConstructConnect for a minute. We issued a separate press release on this. I think today is an interesting day in addition to being a record quarter. It's a record number of press releases for Roper. This is really an amazing business. When our teams made the trips in the diligence process and working with Dave Conway's staff, you get a work in there, training center, and you can watch the network live. It's really -- it's just like watching the floor or the exchange with all this activity going -- you realize how many people are interacting with this thing. They had $55 million of bid -- $1 billion of bid activity, and it's just remarkable. It's like our freight matching network works something is [ph] up for maybe 1, 1.2 seconds before it's grabbed by somebody else in the network. And here, you're seeing all this usage around the data, which is just unprecedented, that is inside the network that's accessible to everybody. So it's all cloud-based technology. 
The network allows people to see what projects are coming up. They can see what contractors form their own opinions about who might be competing for it, what the call-off is for everyone's specifications. They're also going to be benefited, by the way, because they will work together with our On Center business that was just for drywall construction only and their other niche things that are going to be able to fold into ConstructConnect going forward. 
Those 800,000 users were laughing about this in preparation of the call that basically there's 800,000 people that use the bridge and tunnels in New York everyday, so we decided to perhaps every person going through the tunnel represents a ConstructConnect user. 
This business is headquartered in Cincinnati. Its revenue for next year should be something hopefully above $150 million. It's kind of generates something in the $50-plus million of EBITDA to us. And remember cash amortization these things, so terrific cash business. It will meet all of our acquisition requirements. It got a great management team. Dave has been running this business through its acquisition phase and through its evolutionary shaping of the preconstruction industry. So he really is the domain expert. 
Very high recurring revenue. It's a subscription business, so you have all of those great cash characteristics that has deferred revenues so you have very few assets of any kind, and it really has multiple growth opportunities, and that's another reason why we found it to be a very attractive acquisition. I think a great home for ConstructConnect who can now focus really on continuing to shape the evolution of the preconstruction industry. 
Next slide. The Medical & Scientific Imaging business. You can see here, we were up by about 12%, 8% on acquisitions, 4% on organic, a little less of 1 point of negative FX, but it's rounded down as opposed to up. The medical businesses are 85% of the segment, and they grew organically at 5% and interestingly throughout the year, the Medical businesses have grown organically 5%. 
Each one of the separate businesses are sort of hospital software alternate site solutions business and the medical products, all 3 groups group. 
Sunquest, the way we look at order intake is sort of different than bookings against the entire business because there's so much recurring revenue that doesn't really change from a bookings basis. But on an order intake basis, they had a record in the third quarter, which up the most it's ever been. 
Scientific Imaging, which is about 15% in the second did okay in the third quarter. It's at modest growth but actually, it's a bifurcated situation where the life science portion because of cryo-EM market opportunities grew over 100% in the quarter while the physical science business continued to be pretty weak. It was down about 20%. So the opportunity in front of these businesses is the best it's ever been. 
In the fourth quarter, we think we'll have continued mid-single-digit growth for the medical businesses, led really by the alternate site solutions business. 
Our scientific Imaging, we think, will be terrific on demand and bookings for new products, but most of those probably will have early 2017 deliveries, which is another reason that we may be hit some here in the fourth quarter, we'll just have to see, but we're going to assume that mostly that's going to be a first half next year event. 
Okay, the next slide is the guidance update. Turn to page, and here's the specifics on guidance. We're going to go in for the fourth quarter at $1.77 to $1.89. It's a broad range probably not really a broad range given how much money we make and our few shares we have. So seasonality in the Industrial and Energy business is not something that we think will help this year. We could be wrong about that, and if we get normal seasonality, then we'll be towards the higher the end of the range. 
The New York City MTA ramp is very important in the fourth quarter. There's a commitment to get the first 3 projects completed by January 1 and how that project ramps will have direct impact on whether we're towards the low or the higher end of the guidance. And then customer preferences around delivery, we thought the third quarter orders were satisfactory but not carry immediate delivery kind of results. So I think there's some hesitancy in the Industrial and Energy markets about exactly when they want things if they're booked and committed to. 
The full year guidance given the fourth quarter as addition to our year-to-date results would give us somewhere around $6.48 to $6.60. Most of our internal projections and external projections run around $6.55 to $6.60. 
3-year cash flow conversion still be spectacular, 140% or so, and that will allow us despite terrific oil and gas headwinds this year to have 5% to 6% revenue and EBITDA growth for the year. 
Next slide. If we look at the summary of how we did in the third quarter, it's kind of a long list of good things. We got record orders revenue, net earnings EBITDA and cash flow. 4 stand out businesses, they're Medical, Software, Tolling and Neptune were quite good because remember we got 20-plus negative on the energy side of the business. 
EBITDA got up to 34.6% of revenue and our free cash flow was phenomenal. 
The New York City MTA bridge and tunnel All-Electronic Tolling project, we've really expect to win for some time, but the news about it, the commitment around didn't come last Friday, so we have been planning for Q4 kickoff, and we will do what we said we would do for them, which to get the 3 projects done. But almost the vast majority of this work is going to come in 2017 and not in the fourth quarter. 
We acquired a great SaaS network business in ConstructConnect, and it alone with the things you can do with On Center in a cooperative way will be very beneficial for us in 2017. 
The cash performance that we have year-to-date, along with the brand-new balance sheet with a much better credit facility supports our continued ability to deploy capital. It's the most powder we've ever had and opportunities that we see here is excellent. So we had outstanding results in the third quarter, and we're very well positioned for 2017 and ready to take questions."

And as far as the barriers, I mean the barriers, of course, for a network business is the strength and size of the network and the ability for all of the different users to be able to transact business and grow their own business by utilizing the ConstructConnect network and software solutions. And I think it goes to the size of the network. What Brian talked about, 800,000 users and $55 million invitations to bid every year encompassing almost 400,000 different commercial construction projects. I mean, the size of the network and the combination that the ConstructConnect has been able to put together between their different brands of square foot and bid quarter Construct data and really turn that into a single integrated platform, that's really unique insight industry. So from a competitive position, I think for most of those customers, the way that they are able to grow their business and to bid on more projects and to win more is through connection to the ConstructConnect network. And so that's really the strength of that and the competitive position, there are couple of comparators out there that also provide, particularly on the construction data side. But on the network and integrated data, we really don't think there's any one of size there."

In terms of its contribution on the growth side, it was up in the kind of 3% or 4% in the third quarter, and we expect that to be modestly better in the fourth quarter. From a drug pricing standpoint, I mean, you're right, that is something that we look at. A lot of the headlines that you see around drug pricing aren't really targeted for or being sold our senior population. Remember MHA is around alternate site health care and the largest portion of their revenue is coming from skilled nursing homes, long-term care facilities. It's not really the headline prices around EpiPen or whatever else that you might read in the Wall Street Journal. It's really for kind of the longer chronic illnesses that they are being sold through the MHA contracting vehicles. So we do look at drug pricing. It's been lower than what we would have seen in years past, but still positive in 2016. While I want talk an awful lot of drug pricing left as we think about the future for MHA. They continue to expand their solutions and nondrug supply chains, including food and other things for our long-term care facilities and other nursing homes. So they continue to expand that and then also expand their software solutions around data analytics. You've seen us make a couple of acquisition that also serve the alternate site health care, which are not GPO but are really around software solutions that allow those numbers and customers to run their businesses more efficiently. That's where we look for growth. We don't really count on underlying drug price increases as something that is going to drive our performance. Although it does have an impact on our revenue."

Joining me on the call this morning are Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Humphrey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Paul Soni, our Vice President and Controller. 
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast or also available on our website. 
Now if you'll please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. 
And now please turn to Slide 3. Today, we'll be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation on our website. 
For third the quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consist of 2 items: First, a $2.2 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue relating to software acquisitions. This represents revenue that those companies would have recognized if not for our acquisition. Second, a $0.9 million debt extinguishment charge related to the replacement of our former credit facility with a new $2.5 billion facility that closed in the quarter. 
And now if you'll please turn to Slide 4. I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?"

We'll start here with the Q3 enterprise results, so next slide. We had a record for just about everything again in the third quarter. Our orders were an all-time record at $929 million. And by the way, if we",3560,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everybody. We'll start here with the Q3 enterprise results, so next slide. 
We had a record for just about everything again in the third quarter. Our orders were an all-time record at $929 million. And by the way, if we had booked the MTA order a couple of days earlier, but it wasn't quite ready to go, we would have been -- we'd have our first $1 billion quarter in our history. 
Revenue was strong. Net earnings were, of course, a record EBITDA cash flow. Revenue was up 7% to $947 million, which gave us 2 points of organic growth despite the headwinds in oil and gas. FX cost is 1 point. And acquisitions and divestitures, netted out, plus 6% because this was still the last quarter without all of the divestment in it.
Growth was led by both the Medical and RF Technology and Software businesses. And certainly, Neptune had an outstanding quarter. You'll see in a minute. 
Declines in oil and gas were basically about what we thought. We thought they'd be sort of down 20% or so, and they were. Gross margins were up 60 basis points to 61.3%, and EBITDA was up 8% to $328 million. Our net earnings reached $169 million, which gave us a DEPS earnings per share number of $1.65, ahead of our guidance. 
Free cash flow was up 40%. Really, an astonishing quarter, where our free cash flow is up 11% year-to-date, but up 40% in the third quarter. 
And then our ConstructConnect acquisition, which we're announcing today and which will close this week, is another terrific business for us. It's a SaaS network business for the preconstruction industry, and we'll detail that later in the call this morning, and it should close yet this week. 
So we have very strong cash quarter. We had record results, and then we had this great acquisition. 
So the next slide. Here if you look at the income statement, you can see orders were up 4%. The book-to-bill was 0.98, which is okay because of sort of lumpy activity. It's in the wheelhouse. But had we been able to book the MTA order, our book-to-bill would have been 105, which gives you some idea about how strong really the core orders were. The only thing then in the quarter that was odd is that the normal fourth quarter delivery schedule stuff was not very strong. 
Revenue was up 7%, our gross profit was up 8%. You can see we're up 60 basis points in gross profit. The operating income margin, because of the acquisition and amortization in these things, you can see it going to 28.5%, which is still spectacular but down 20 basis points. The reality is, on the next slide, you'll see the EBITA margin actually went up 30 basis points, which is the right way to look at a cash-oriented business like ours. And then net earnings were up 4%. Tax rate, about what we thought. 
Next slide. If you compare the operating and the EBITA margins, we certainly have not reported leading, first, with those kind of numbers. But our EBITA margin, as you can see in 2014's third quarter, were 32.5%. Last year at 33.4%. And this year, 33.7%. So our margins on the operating cash side are up 120 basis points in just 2 years, and our gross margins continue up as well. If -- focusing on the operating profit margin, where you get a lot of noncash amortization charges, would lead people to the wrong conclusion, it's the wrong way to think about cash business like ours, even though the results are outstanding. So we're really focused on continuing to improve our EBITA margins, which were up 30 basis points. 
Next slide. We continue to comp out cash flow at a quite strong clip, and we don't see that slowing down anytime soon. We really have terrific operating cash flow in the quarter, $317 million. Both operating and free cash flow were up 40%. And you can see the comparison to last year at $660 million year-to-date operating cash flow and now we're at $731 million, up 11% despite less-than-robust end markets in our industrial and energy businesses. 
Conversion was pretty spectacular. You can see our year-to-date conversion on operating cash flow is 146%, so excellent cash performance. 
Next slide. Our asset-light business model, which 5 years ago people told me you couldn't make it any better than it was, continues to improve at really phenomenal rates. Here, you can see inventory is down 80 basis points from 2 years ago. Receivables are down 150 basis points, and payables and accruals are actually up 160. So 2 years ago, we had 5.8% net working capital to revenue, and the way we measure it, today, we closed the quarter at 1.9%. That's a 67% reduction as a function of revenue in just 2 years, 390 basis points. So the quality of the asset-light acquisitions that we've been doing the last couple of years in addition to our own governance process around improving everything we own is really having just astonishing impact on our ability to compound cash and deploy future capital. 
Next slide. If you look here at the financial position of the company, you get some sense of the balance sheet. Just as a quick note, this is absolutely the biggest balance sheet that we have ever had to capture capital deployment opportunities. We now have an undrawn revolver of $2.5 billion, and we have $882 million of cash, so nearly $3.4 billion of powder. Even after paying for the ConstructConnect business, our acquisition powder is right around $2.8 billion. 
We begin -- we've deployed capital since January 1, 2015, at a rate of $2.7 billion during that 21-month period. So our compounding of the cash and the strength of the balance sheet and the flexibility that our new credit facility gives us is all great because we're going to be able to put that to good use with the incredible acquisition pipeline that we continue to see. And you can see our net debt to EBITDA number is only 1.7 after the acquisition. It's still just around 2, so we got a lot of ramp space here to be able to continue to make transactions that are accretive to the company. 
Next slide. We'll look at the segment detail of each of the 4 segments the way we record it, and then talk about the detail of the business here after that. 
So the next slide. Here, if we look at the Q3 segment performance of energy, you can see its EBITDA margin was 29%; Industrial Tech, 32%. The first point about thinking around these businesses is how remarkable their margin performance is in these challenging markets. The nimble execution that we have inside the presence that's around those businesses is really amazing. In 2003, those businesses, the energy and industrial businesses taken together, had about $377 million in revenue. And this year taken together, they had $303 million and yet the EBITDA margin in '14 was 32% of those combined businesses. And here this year, it's 31%. So despite a significant falloff in revenue, the margins have been able to be maintained. 
The second point of this slide is that, of course, our future in the nature of the enterprise you can see continues to compound towards the RF, the application software, the medical software and the medical products businesses, which now make up nearly 75% of the EBITDA of Roper's entire entity. And they also have done remarkably well. Two years ago, those businesses had about 39% EBITDA. Today, those businesses have about 41% EBITDA. 
Next slide. If we look at the first, our smallest segment, Energy Systems now is down to barely 10% of the company. And its organic growth was down 13% generally the way we thought it would be. The segment, while down, is expected really did modestly better than it did in the second quarter and is likely to do modestly better again in the fourth quarter. 
Terrific profitability. The OP margins in the second and third quarter were 25.4%, and EBITDA margins were 29.2%. 
When we look at the fourth quarter, we think oil and gas will be down about another 20% in this particular segment, same as it was in the third quarter, but we don't think we're going to get much growth in terms of fourth quarter seasonality. We didn't get much last year. But generally, it's been quite substantial, so we're sort of assuming that we won't get that this year. 
Margins will improve again in the fourth quarter. We started the year out in energy with 20.4% OP; second quarter went to 22.5%; the third quarter is already up to 25.4%; and the fourth quarter will be substantially materially above that. So these businesses still in our view represents sort of free shot on goal for us, and they only represent 10% or less of revenue. 
Next slide. On the Industrial Technology side, you can see that this is the -- fortunately, the last quarter we'll talk about this divestiture of ABEL. If you adjust for the divestiture, the segment was actually flat despite the upstream oil and gas piece that's in Industrial Technology being down 35%. So how did that happen? What happened from double-digit growth at Neptune, who continues to gain market share, and very strong demand for the R900 Automated Meter Reading and AMI technology with lots of migrating upgrades. We had a significant number of wins last quarter, over 10. And really, the $50 million that we put into R&D in the last 3 years in Neptune has gotten us into a very outstanding position that people will begin to appreciate just how much we've done and how far advanced we are going to be over the next couple of years in the space. 
We did get some sequential improvement at Roper Pump, and we expect to have a little bit better results again in the fourth quarter despite basically that -- 2 other businesses in here that are really purely related to upstream and have been severely hampered. 
The rest of our businesses in here are -- it's kind of test businesses are all doing relatively well. Some of them actually have record quarters. And on balance, we don't see any deterioration in those businesses. 
In the fourth quarter, we think we'll have sort of similar revenue and margin performance to what we had in the third quarter. And while upstream markets are sequentially flat, there is a tiny bit of improvement that we're seeing. 
Next slide. Here, we'll look at the RF Technology and Software segment. It's really increasingly right to think about 3 legs in this segment with the RF product side of activity, and then you have the tolling side of activity, and then you have all this application software business. And of course now in addition to that, with ConstructConnect. 
So here, the business' revenue was up 20% in the quarter. The operating profit was up 26%. The OP margin is 31.7%, but the EBITDA margin was 38%, up 230 basis points. 
We had organic growth of 7% in this segment and had about 1 point of foreign exchange headwind, and acquisitions helped by 14%. 
Very strong growth at toll and traffic on project activity in Florida and Texas and Pennsylvania. Sounds like swing states in the election. 
Continued high single-digit growth in Software led by freight matching and CBORD. We did some really exciting things at freight matching. We've moved to a more modern software-friendly location in the Portland, Oregon area, and then we've put together the freight matching network, so DAT in the U.S. and Getloaded, into a new software development process that's going to expand our customer base. 
We had double-digit growth in the RF products business. A lot of that's driven by senior living. There are several of our businesses that touch senior living. 
And then toll and traffic had -- would have had spectacular orders, of course, if we would have been able to book the bridge and toll project -- toll -- tunnel project, which we hoped would happen a little bit earlier in the year. We had a 5-year extension of our toll mandate in Dubai. And the Saudi project is sort of back on track. We wound up with about 30 installations here in the fourth quarter, we think, which will get us to about 70 of the 350. So we feel much better about the progress in Riyadh. 
In the fourth quarter, TransCore was awarded a $70 million plus MTA project to convert 9 bridges and tunnels around the 5 boroughs. All of you who go back and forth are now well aware of what that's like. There's like 800,000 people a day going through that process. And conversion with our Infinity Lane technology will allow people to not have tollbooths, and there'll be fines, of course, based on video tolling. But if you have your normal tool tank, you'll be able to get through. The growth in toll and traffic, we think, will continue to manifest itself in the fourth quarter and certainly, into 2017. 
The Software businesses universally remain strong. We had kind of mid-single-digit organic growth in the whole segment, which gives a really strong momentum going into '17, certainly the best position we've had in this segment in a long time. 
And now we've acquired ConstructConnect, which we'll talk about here in a second, for $632 million. Got about $150 million in revenue and sort of Roper-type expected EBITDA margins, which will get better as it gets inside the Roper -- the governance process. 
Next slide. So talking about ConstructConnect for a minute. We issued a separate press release on this. I think today is an interesting day in addition to being a record quarter. It's a record number of press releases for Roper. This is really an amazing business. When our teams made the trips in the diligence process and working with Dave Conway's staff, you get a work in there, training center, and you can watch the network live. It's really -- it's just like watching the floor or the exchange with all this activity going -- you realize how many people are interacting with this thing. They had $55 million of bid -- $1 billion of bid activity, and it's just remarkable. It's like our freight matching network works some things up for maybe 1, 1.2 seconds before it's grabbed by somebody else in the network. And here, you're seeing all this usage around the data, which is just unprecedented, that is inside the network that's accessible to everybody. So it's all cloud-based technology. 
The network allows people to see what projects are coming up. They can see what contractors form their own opinions about who might be competing for it, what the call-off is for everyone's specifications. They're also going to be benefited, by the way, because they will work together with our On Center business that was just for drywall construction only and their other niche things that are going to be able to fold into ConstructConnect going forward. 
Those 800,000 users, we're laughing about this. In preparation of the call, basically, there's 800,000 people that use the bridge and tunnels in New York every day, so we've decided that perhaps every person going through the tunnel represents a ConstructConnect user. This business is headquartered in Cincinnati. Its revenue for next year should be something hopefully above $150 million. It's -- it kind of generates something in the $50-plus million of EBITDA to us. And remember, lots of noncash amortization in these things. So terrific cash business. It'll meet all of our acquisition requirements. It's got a great management team. Dave has been running this business through its acquisition phase and through its evolutionary shaping of the preconstruction industry, so he really is the domain expert. Very high recurring revenue. It's a subscription business, so you have all of this great cash characteristics. It has deferred revenues. You have very few assets of any kind, and it really has multiple growth opportunities. And that's another reason why we found it to be a very attractive acquisition. I think a great home for ConstructConnect, who can now focus really on continuing to shape the evolution of the preconstruction industry. 
Next slide. The Medical and Scientific Imaging business. You can see here we were up 12%: 8% on acquisitions, 4% on organic. A little less than 1 point of negative FX, but rounded down as opposed to up. The medical businesses are 85% of the segment, and they grew organically at 5%. And interestingly throughout the year, the medical businesses have grown organically at 5%. Each one of the separate businesses are sort of hospital software, alternate site solutions business and the medical products, all 3 groups group, grew. 
Sunquest. The way we look at order intake is sort of different than bookings against the entire business because there's so much recurring revenue that doesn't really change from a bookings basis. But on an order intake basis, they had a record in the third quarter. It was up the most it's ever been. 
Scientific Imaging, which is about 15% in the second, did okay in the third quarter. It's had modest growth. But actually, it's a bifurcated situation, where the life science portion -- because of cryo-EM market opportunities grew over 100% in the quarter, while the physical science business continued to be pretty weak. It was down about 20%. So these -- the opportunity in front of these businesses is the best it's ever been. In the fourth quarter, we think we'll have continued mid-single-digit growth for the medical businesses, led really by the alternate site solutions business. 
Scientific Imaging, we think, will be terrific on demand and bookings for new products, but most of those probably will have early 2017 deliveries, which was another reason that -- maybe hit some here in the fourth quarter. We'll just have to see. But we're going to assume that mostly that's going to be a first half next year benefit. 
Okay. The next slide is the guidance update. Turn to page -- here's the specifics on the guidance. We're going to go in for the fourth quarter at $1.77 to $1.89. It's a broad range. Probably not really a broad range given how much money we make and how few shares we have. So seasonality in the industrial and energy business is not something that we think will help this year. We could be wrong about that. And if we get normal seasonality, then we'd be towards the higher the end of the range. 
The New York City MTA ramp is very important in the fourth quarter. There's a commitment to get the first 3 projects completed by January 1, and how that project ramps will have a direct effect on whether we're towards the low or the higher end of the guidance. And then customer preferences around delivery. We thought the third quarter orders were satisfactory, but not carrying immediate delivery kind of results. So I think there's some hesitancy in the industrial and energy markets about exactly when they want things that they're booked and committed to. 
The full year guidance, given the fourth quarter as addition to our year-to-date results, would give us somewhere around $6.48 to $6.60. I think most of our internal projections and external projections run around $6.55 to $6.60. 
3-year cash flow conversion will still be spectacular, 140% or so, and that will allow us despite terrific oil and gas headwinds this year to have 5% to 6% revenue and EBITDA growth for the year. 
Next slide. If we look at the summary of how we did in the third quarter, it's kind of a long list of good things. We got record orders revenue, net earnings EBITDA and cash flow. Four standout businesses there. Medical, Software, tolling and Neptune were quite good because remember, we got 20-plus negative on the energy side of the business. EBITDA got up to 34.6% of revenue, and our free cash flow was phenomenal. 
The New York City MTA bridge and tunnel All-Electronic Tolling project, we really expected to win this for some time, but the news about it, the commitment around it, didn't come until last Friday. So we have been planning for a Q4 kickoff, and we will do what we said we would do for them, which is to get the 3 projects done. But almost the vast majority of this work is going to come in 2017 and not in the fourth quarter. 
We acquired a great SaaS network business in ConstructConnect, and it, along with the things it can do with On Center in a cooperative way, will be very beneficial for us in 2017.

I -- so as far as barriers, I mean, the barrier, of course, for a network business is the strength and size of the network and the ability for all of the different users to be able to transact business and grow their own business by utilizing the ConstructConnect network and software solutions. And I think it goes to the size of the network. When Brian talked about 800,000 users and $55 million invitations to bid every year encompassing almost 400,000 different commercial construction projects, I mean, the size of the network and the combination that ConstructConnect has been able to put together between their different brands of iSqFt and BidClerk and Construct Data and really turn that into a single integrated platform, that's really unique inside the industry. So from a competitive position, I think for most of those customers, the way that they're able to grow their business and to bid on more projects and to win more is through connection to the ConstructConnect network. And so that's really the strength of that and the competitive position. There are a couple of competitors out there that also provide, particularly on the construction data side.

So the process in order to be able to turn that from order to delivery can easily be a 60, 90, 120 days depending on yield and throughput, particularly from suppliers around some of the sensors.

The difference is we don't like to go above like 4x debt to EBITDA. And those guys are willing to take debt staples and bank split-on things, and nonbank entities split-on things had 8x EBITDA, right? So they don't deploy much more equity in a transaction than we do. We just don't want to have 7 or 8x debt to EBITDA. We're going to remain investment-grade. And to do that, you want to be around 4x debt to EBITDA, coming back to 3%, 3.5% or something. So we're very disciplined about wanting to and guaranteeing ourselves to maintain an investment-grade status. The prices that people are paying for things are really bifurcated. Oddly enough, the industrial assets are trading really more than they're worth in a normalized interest environment in a M&A world because they don't have a lot of EBITDA, even though they'll require a lot of capital spending to maintain that EBITDA. So those multiples are interestingly high. Then the asset-light business has traded a premium to that, but the arbitrage for us on the asset-light businesses is more favorable than those people that are buying the more capital-intensive businesses. So something like ConstructConnect is -- will be a long-term compounder of investment for us, which is great, as opposed to the guys that are buying the capital-intensive businesses thinking that, gee, it looks like I'm paying a lot, but they're at the [indiscernible] of their cyclical activity.

People think you could never get lower, and now we're at 1.9%. Certainly, a lot of that as you get deferred revenue and you get paid in advance for work you do, and most of the things that we look at these days have those qualities. So we -- I thought it enough if we get to 0 or ultimately negative at some point, but I don't see us going up. The amount of small niche businesses that work in kind of oligopolies or customer industry is critical, and then those that have the ability to have kind of a network effect, there are more of those things out there than you might imagine because when you're focused on product businesses, you don't necessarily see some of these kind of things. But all of the people that are involved in transactions in the banking businesses and the private equity businesses kind of know what we favor, what we look like, and so the funnel that we have of incoming opportunity is really amazing. And it's just incumbent on us to sort through that funnel, find the best management teams and the best end market opportunities there in favorably competitive environments. And believe me, there is more high-quality things available that our balance sheet could tolerate. Fortunately, we got a big-enough balance sheet to capture some of them."

So in terms of its contribution on the growth side, it was up in the kind of 3% or 4% in the third quarter, and we expect that to be modestly better in the fourth quarter. From a drug pricing standpoint, I mean, you're right, that is something that we look at. A lot of the headlines that you see around drug pricing aren't really targeted for or being sold to the senior population. Remember, MHA is around alternate site health care, and the largest portion of their revenue is coming from skilled nursing homes, long-term care facilities. It's not really the headline prices around EpiPen or whatever else that you might read in the Wall Street Journal. It's really for kind of the longer chronic illnesses that are being sold through the MHA contracting vehicles. So we do look at drug pricing. It's been lower than what we would have seen in years past, but still positive in 2016. We're not counting on an awful lot of drug pricing lift as we think about the future for MHA. They continue to expand their solutions in nondrug supply chains, including food and other things for our long-term care facilities and other nursing homes. So they continue to expand that and then also expand their software solutions around data analytics. You've seen us make a couple of acquisitions that also serve the alternate site health care, which are not GPO but are really around software solutions that allow those members and customers to run their businesses more efficiently. That's where we look for growth. We don't really count on underlying drug price increases as something that is going to drive our performance, although it does have an impact on our revenue."

Joining me on the call this morning are Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Humphrey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Paul Soni, our Vice President and Controller. 
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast or also available on our website. 
Now if you'll please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. 
And now please turn to Slide 3. Today, we'll be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation on our website. 
For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of 2 items: First, a $2.2 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue relating to software acquisitions. This represents revenue that those companies would have recognized if not for our acquisition. Second, a $0.9 million debt extinguishment charge related to the replacement of our former credit facility with a new $2.5 billion facility that closed in the quarter. 
And now if you'll please turn to Slide 4. I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?"

We'll start here with the Q3 enterprise results, so next slide. We had a record for just about everything again in the third quarter. Our orders were an all-time record at $929 million. And by the way, if we",3572,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everybody. We'll start here with the Q3 enterprise results, so next slide. 
We had a record for just about everything again in the third quarter. Our orders were an all-time record at $929 million. And by the way, if we had booked the MTA order a couple of days earlier, but it wasn't quite ready to go, we would have been -- we'd have had our first $1 billion quarter in our history. 
Revenue was strong. Net earnings were, of course, a record EBITDA cash flow. Revenue was up 7% to $947 million, which gave us 2 points of organic growth despite the headwinds in oil and gas. FX cost is 1 point. And then acquisitions and divestitures, netted out, plus 6% because this was still the last quarter without all of the divestment in it.
Growth was led by both the Medical and RF Technology Software businesses. And certainly, Neptune had an outstanding quarter as you'll see in a minute. 
Declines in oil and gas were basically about what we thought. We thought they'd be sort of down 20% or so, and they were. Gross margins were up 60 basis points to 61.3%, and EBITDA was up 8% to $328 million. Our net earnings reached $169 million, which gave us a DEPS earnings per share number of $1.65, ahead of our guidance. 
Free cash flow was up 40%. Really, an astonishing quarter, where our free cash flow is up 11% year-to-date, but up 40% in the third quarter. 
And then our ConstructConnect acquisition, which we're announcing today and which will close this week, is another terrific business for us. It's a SaaS network business for the preconstruction industry, and we'll detail that later in the call this morning, and it should close, again, this week. 
So we have very strong cash quarter. We had record results, and then we had this great acquisition. 
So the next slide. Here, if you look at the income statement, you can see orders were up 4%. The book-to-bill was 0.98, which is okay because of sort of lumpy activity. It's in the wheelhouse. But had we been able to book the MTA order, our book-to-bill would have been 105, which gives you some idea about how strong really the core orders were. The only thing then in the quarter that was odd is that the normal fourth quarter delivery schedule stuff was not very strong. 
Revenue was up 7%, our gross profit was up 8%. You can see we're up 60 basis points in gross profit. The operating income margin, because of the acquisition and amortization in these things, you can see it going to 28.5%, which is still spectacular but down 20 basis points. The reality is, on the next slide, you'll see the EBITA margin actually went up 30 basis points, which is the right way to look at a cash-oriented business like ours. And then net earnings were up 4%. Tax rate, about what we thought. 
Next slide. If you compare the operating and the EBITA margins, we certainly have not reported leading, first, with those kind of numbers. But our EBITA margin, as you can see in 2014's third quarter, were 32.5%. Last year at 33.4%. And this year, 33.7%. So our margins on the operating cash side are up 120 basis points in just 2 years, and our gross margins continue up as well. If -- focusing on the operating profit margin, where you get a lot of noncash amortization charges, would lead people to the wrong conclusion. It's the wrong way to think about cash business like ours, even though the results are outstanding. So we're really focused on continuing to improve our EBITA margins, which were up 30 basis points. 
Next slide. We continue to comp out cash flow at a quite strong clip, and we don't see that slowing down anytime soon. We really have terrific operating cash flow in the quarter, $317 million. Both operating and free cash flow were up 40%. And you can see the comparison to last year at $660 million year-to-date operating cash flow and now we're at $731 million, up 11% despite less-than-robust end markets in our industrial and energy businesses. 
Conversion was pretty spectacular. You can see our year-to-date conversion on operating cash flow is 146%, so excellent cash performance. 
Next slide. Our asset-light business model, which 5 years ago people told me you couldn't make it any better than it was, continues to improve at really phenomenal rates. Here, you can see inventory is down 80 basis points from 2 years ago. Receivables are down 150 basis points, and payables and accruals are actually up 160. So 2 years ago, we had 5.8% net working capital to revenue, and the way we measure it, today, we closed the quarter at 1.9%. That's a 67% reduction as a function of revenue in just 2 years, 390 basis points. So the quality of the asset-light acquisitions that we've been doing the last couple of years in addition to our own governance process around improving everything we own is really having a just astonishing impact on our ability to compound cash and deploy future capital. 
Next slide. If you look here at the financial position of the company, you get some sense of the balance sheet. Just as a quick note, this is absolutely the biggest balance sheet that we have ever had to capture capital deployment opportunities. We now have an undrawn revolver of $2.5 billion, and we have $882 million of cash, so nearly $3.4 billion of powder. Even after paying for the ConstructConnect business, our acquisition powder is right around $2.8 billion. 
We begin -- we've deployed capital since January 1, 2015, at a rate of $2.7 billion during that 21-month period. So our compounding of the cash and the strength of the balance sheet and the flexibility that our new credit facility gives us is all great because we're going to be able to put that to good use with the incredible acquisition pipeline that we continue to see. And you can see our net debt to EBITDA number is only 1.7 after the acquisition. It's still just around 2, so we've got a lot of ramp space here to be able to continue to make transactions that are accretive to the company. 
Next slide. We'll look at the segment detail of each of the 4 segments the way we record it, and then talk about the detail of the business here after that. 
So the next slide. Here, if we look at the Q3 segment performance of energy, you can see its EBITDA margin was 29%; Industrial Tech, 32%. The first point about thinking around these businesses is how remarkable their margin performance is in these challenging markets. The nimble execution that we have inside the presence that's around those businesses is really amazing. In 2003, those businesses, the energy and industrial businesses taken together, had about $377 million in revenue. And this year taken together, they had $303 million and yet the EBITDA margin in '14 was 32% of those combined businesses. And here this year, it's 31%. So despite a significant falloff in revenue, the margins have been able to be maintained. 
The second point of this slide is that, of course, our future and the nature of the enterprise you can see continues to compound towards the RF, the application software, the medical software and the medical products businesses, which now make up nearly 75% of the EBITDA of Roper's entire entity. And they also have done remarkably well. Two years ago, those businesses had about 39% EBITDA. Today, those businesses have about 41% EBITDA. 
Next slide. If we look at the first, our smallest segment, Energy Systems now is down to barely 10% of the company. And its organic growth was down 13% generally the way we thought it would be. The segment, while down as expected, really did modestly better than it did in the second quarter and is likely to do modestly better again in the fourth quarter. 
Terrific profitability. The OP margins in the second and third quarter were 25.4%, and EBITDA margins were 29.2%. 
When we look at the fourth quarter, we think oil and gas will be down about another 20% in this particular segment, same as it was in the third quarter, but we don't think we're going to get much growth in terms of fourth quarter seasonality. We didn't get much last year. But generally, it's been quite substantial, so we're sort of assuming that we won't get that this year. 
Margins will improve again in the fourth quarter. We started the year out in energy with 20.4% OP; second quarter went to 22.5%; the third quarter is already up to 25.4%; and the fourth quarter will be substantially materially above that. So these businesses still in our view represent a sort of free shot on goal for us, and they only represent 10% or less of revenue. 
Next slide. On the Industrial Technology side, you can see that this is the -- fortunately, the last quarter we'll talk about this divestiture of ABEL. If you adjust for the divestiture, the segment was actually flat despite the upstream oil and gas piece that's in Industrial Technology being down 35%. So how did that happen? What happened from double-digit growth at Neptune, who continues to gain market share, and very strong demand for the R900 Automated Meter Reading and AMI technology with lots of migrating upgrades, we had a significant number of wins last quarter, over 10. And really, the $50 million that we put into R&D in the last 3 years in Neptune has gotten us into a very outstanding position that people will begin to appreciate just how much we've done and how far advanced we are going to be over the next couple of years in the space. 
We did get some sequential improvement at Roper Pump, and we expect to have a little bit better results again in the fourth quarter despite basically that -- 2 other businesses in here that are really purely related to upstream and have been severely hampered. 
The rest of our businesses in here are -- it's kind of test businesses that are all doing relatively well. Some of them actually had record quarters. And on balance, we don't see any deterioration in those businesses. 
In the fourth quarter, we think we'll have sort of similar revenue and margin performance to what we had in the third quarter. And while upstream markets are sequentially flat, there is a tiny bit of improvement that we're seeing. 
Next slide. Here, we'll look at the RF Technology and Software segment. It's really increasingly right to think about 3 legs in this segment with the RF product side of activity, and then you have the tolling side of activity, and then you have all this application software business. And of course now in addition to that, with ConstructConnect. 
So here, the business' revenue was up 20% in the quarter. The operating profit was up 26%. The OP margin is 31.7%, but the EBITDA margin was 38%, up 230 basis points. 
We had organic growth of 7% in this segment and had about 1 point of foreign exchange headwind, and acquisitions helped by 14%. 
Very strong growth at toll and traffic on project activity in Florida and Texas and Pennsylvania. Sounds like swing states in the election. 
Continued high single-digit growth in Software led by freight matching and CBORD. We did some really exciting things at freight matching. We've moved to a more modern software-friendly location in the Portland, Oregon area, and then we've put together the freight matching network, so DAT in the U.S. and Getloaded, into a new software development process that's going to expand our customer base. 
We had double-digit growth in the RF products business. A lot of that's driven by senior living. There are several of our businesses that touch senior living. 
And then toll and traffic had -- would have had spectacular orders, of course, if we would have been able to book the bridge and toll project -- toll -- tunnel project, which we hoped would happen a little bit earlier in the year. We had a 5-year extension of our toll mandate in Dubai. And the Saudi project is sort of back on track. We wound up with about 30 installations here in the fourth quarter, we think, which will get us to about 70 of the 350. So we feel much better about the progress in Riyadh. 
In the fourth quarter, TransCore was awarded a $70 million plus MTA project to convert 9 bridges and tunnels around the 5 boroughs. All of you who go back and forth are now well aware of what that's like. There's like 800,000 people a day going through that process. And conversion with our Infinity Lane technology will allow people to not have tollbooths, and there'll be fines, of course, based on video tolling. But if you have your normal toll tag, you'll be able to get through. The growth in toll and traffic, we think, will continue to manifest itself in the fourth quarter and certainly, into 2017. 
The Software businesses universally remain strong. We had kind of mid-single-digit organic growth in the whole segment, which gives a really strong momentum going into '17, certainly the best position we've had in this segment in a long time. 
And now we've acquired ConstructConnect, which we'll talk about here in a second, for $632 million. Got about $150 million in revenue and sort of Roper-type expected EBITDA margins, which will get better as it gets inside the Roper -- the governance process. 
Next slide. So talking about ConstructConnect for a minute. We issued a separate press release on this. I think today is an interesting day -- in addition to being a record quarter, it's a record number of press releases for Roper. This is really an amazing business. When our teams made the trips in the diligence process and working with Dave Conway's staff, you get to work in their training center, and you can watch the network live. It's really -- it's just like watching the floor of the exchange with all this activity going -- you realize how many people are interacting with this thing. They had $55 million of bid -- $1 billion of bid activity, and it's just remarkable. It's like our freight-matching network, where something's up for maybe 1, 1.2 seconds before it's grabbed by somebody else in the network. And here, you're seeing all this usage around the data, which is just unprecedented, and that is inside the network that's accessible to everybody. So it's all cloud-based technology. 
The network allows people to see what projects are coming up. They can see what contractors -- and form their own opinions about who might be competing for it, what the call-off is for everyone's specifications. They're also going to be benefited, by the way, because they will work together with our On Center business that was just for drywall construction only, and then there are other niche things that are going to be able to fold into ConstructConnect going forward. 
Those 800,000 users -- we were laughing about this in preparation for the call, but basically, there's 800,000 people that use the bridges and tunnels in New York every day, so we've decided that perhaps every person going through the tunnel represents a ConstructConnect user. This business is headquartered in Cincinnati. Its revenue for next year should be something hopefully above $150 million. It's going to generate something in the -- $50-plus million of EBITDA to us. And remember, lots of noncash amortization in these things. So terrific cash business. It'll meet all of our acquisition requirements. It's got a great management team. Dave has been running this business through its acquisition phase and through its evolutionary shaping of the preconstruction industry, so he really is the domain expert. Very high recurring revenue. It's a subscription business, so you have all of these great cash characteristics. It has deferred revenues. You have very few assets of any kind, and it really has multiple growth opportunities. And that's another reason why we found it to be a very attractive acquisition. I think a great home for ConstructConnect, who can now focus really on continuing to shape the evolution of the preconstruction industry. 
Next slide. The Medical and Scientific Imaging business. You can see here we were up 12%: 8% on acquisitions, 4% on organic. A little less than 1 point of negative FX, but rounded down as opposed to up. The medical businesses are 85% of the segment, and they grew organically at 5%. And interestingly throughout the year, the medical businesses have grown organically at 5%. Each one of the separate businesses are sort of hospital software, alternate site solutions business and the medical products, all 3 groups group, grew. 
Sunquest. The way we look at order intake is sort of different than bookings against the entire business because there's so much recurring revenue that it doesn't really change from a bookings basis. But on an order intake basis, they had a record in the third quarter. It was up the most it's ever been. 
Scientific Imaging, which is about 15% in the second, did okay in the third quarter. It's had modest growth. But actually, it's a bifurcated situation, where the life science portion -- because of cryo-EM market opportunities grew over 100% in the quarter, while the physical science business continued to be pretty weak. It was down about 20%. So these -- the opportunity in front of these businesses is the best it's ever been. In the fourth quarter, we think we'll have continued mid-single-digit growth for the medical businesses, led really by the alternate site solutions business. 
Scientific Imaging, we think, will be terrific on demand and bookings for new products, but most of those probably will have early 2017 deliveries, which was another reason that -- maybe get some here in the fourth quarter. We'll just have to see. But we're going to assume that mostly that's going to be a first half next year benefit. 
Okay. The next slide is the guidance update. Turn to page -- here's the specifics on the guidance. We're going to go into the fourth quarter at $1.77 to $1.89. It's a broad range. Probably not really a broad range given how much money we make and how few shares we have. So seasonality in the industrial and energy business is not something that we think will help this year. We could be wrong about that. And if we get normal seasonality, then we'd be towards the higher the end of the range. 
The New York City MTA ramp is very important in the fourth quarter. There's a commitment to get the first 3 projects completed by January 1, and how that project ramps will have a direct effect on whether we're towards the low or the higher end of the guidance. And then customer preferences around delivery. We thought the third quarter orders were satisfactory, but not carrying immediate delivery kind of results. So I think there's some hesitancy in the industrial and energy markets about exactly when they want things that they're booked and committed to. 
The full year guidance, given the fourth quarter as an addition to our year-to-date results, would give us somewhere around $6.48 to $6.60. I think most of our internal projections and external projections run around $6.55 to $6.60. 
3-year cash flow conversion will still be spectacular, 140% or so, and that will allow us, despite terrific oil and gas headwinds this year, to have 5% to 6% revenue and EBITDA growth for the year. 
Next slide. If we look at the summary of how we did in the third quarter, it's kind of a long list of good things. We got record orders revenue, net earnings EBITDA and cash flow. Four standout businesses there: Medical, Software, tolling and Neptune were quite good because remember, we got 20-plus negative on the energy side of the business. EBITDA got up to 34.6% of revenue, and our free cash flow was phenomenal. 
The New York City MTA bridge and tunnel All-Electronic Tolling project, we really expected to win this for some time, but the news about it, the commitment around it, didn't come until last Friday. So we had been planning for a Q4 kickoff, and we will do what we said we would do for them, which is to get the 3 projects done. But almost the vast majority of this work is going to come in 2017 and not in the fourth quarter. 
We acquired a great SaaS network business in ConstructConnect, and it, along with the things it can do with On Center in a cooperative way, will be very beneficial for us in 2017. 
The cash performance that we have year-to-date, along with the brand-new balance sheet with a much better credit facility, supports our continued ability to deploy capital. It's the most powder we've ever had, and the opportunities that we see are excellent. 
So we had outstanding results in the third quarter, and we're very well positioned for 2017 and ready to take your questions."

I -- so as far as barriers, I mean, the barrier, of course, for a network business is the strength and size of the network and the ability for all of the different users to be able to transact business and grow their own business by utilizing the ConstructConnect network and software solutions. And I think it goes to the size of the network. When Brian talked about 800,000 users and $55 million invitations to bid every year encompassing almost 400,000 different commercial construction projects, I mean, the size of the network and the combination that ConstructConnect has been able to put together between their different brands of iSqFt and BidClerk and Construct Data and really turn that into a single integrated platform, that's really unique inside the industry. So from a competitive position, I think for most of those customers, the way that they're able to grow their business and to bid on more projects and to win more is through connection to the ConstructConnect network. And so that's really the strength of that and the competitive position. There are a couple of competitors out there that also provide, particularly on the construction data side.

So all the life science things that Brian talked about earlier, those are actually very sophisticated instruments and cameras and filters that aren't as kind of the -- it's not just like machining and creating a pump. So the process in order to be able to turn that from order to delivery can easily be a 60, 90, 120 days depending on yield and throughput, particularly from suppliers around some of the sensors. And so as we look at the deliveries and the delivery schedule, particularly on the imaging product side and also on the medical product side, that's where we see a slight difference from what we would have thought before.

The difference is we don't like to go above like 4x debt to EBITDA. And those guys are willing to take debt staples and then bank split-on things and nonbank entities split-on things at 8x EBITDA, right? So they don't deploy much more equity in a transaction than we do. We just don't want to have 7 or 8x debt to EBITDA. We're going to remain investment-grade. And to do that, you want to be around 4x debt to EBITDA, coming back to 3%, 3.5% or something. So we're very disciplined about wanting to and guaranteeing ourselves to maintain an investment-grade status. The prices that people are paying for things are really bifurcated. Oddly enough, the industrial assets are trading at really more than they're worth in a normalized interest environment in a M&A world because they don't have a lot of EBITDA, even though they'll require a lot of capital spending to maintain that EBITDA. So those multiples are interestingly high. Then the asset-light businesses trade at a premium to that, but the arbitrage for us on the asset-light businesses is more favorable than those people that are buying the more capital-intensive businesses. So something like ConstructConnect is -- will be a long-term compounder of investment for us, which is great, as opposed to the guys that are buying the capital-intensive businesses thinking that, ""Gee, it looks like I'm paying a lot, but they're at the nadir of their cyclical activity.

But also, I wouldn't ignore the investments that we've made around genetic testing and the workflows associated with that. So you really have the blood side, which is the core lab high-volume testing environment that every hospital has to have. And the other side, which is anatomic pathology and the emerging genetic workflows around genetic testing. That's where we've made important investments with the acquisition of GeneInsight and continued R&D around being able to make that workflow as efficient and as quick with getting the information back to the doctor as timely as happens today on the blood side. And so for all those reasons, I think the Sunquest and our entire platform of hospital software solutions -- which, of course, includes Data Innovations and CliniSys and GeneInsight and a variety of other things, all of those businesses really deliver those software solutions to hospitals. I think their future looks very bright as a result of the investments that we continue to make there."

People think you could never get lower, and now we're at 1.9%. Certainly, a lot of that as you get deferred revenue and you get paid in advance for work you do, and most of the things that we look at these days have those qualities. So we -- I don't know if we get to 0 or ultimately negative at some point, but I don't see us going up. The amount of small niche businesses that work in kind of oligopolies where customer industry is critical, and then those that have the ability to have kind of a network effect, there are more of those things out there than you might imagine because when you're focused on product businesses, you don't necessarily see some of these kind of things. But all of the people that are involved in transactions in the banking businesses and the private equity businesses kind of know what we favor, what we look like, and so the funnel that we have of incoming opportunity is really amazing. And it's just incumbent on us to sort through that funnel, find the best management teams and the best end market opportunities there in favorably competitive environments. And believe me, there is more high-quality things available that our balance sheet could tolerate. Fortunately, we've got a big-enough balance sheet to capture some of them."

From a drug pricing standpoint, I mean, you're right, that is something that we look at. A lot of the headlines that you see around drug pricing aren't really targeted for or being sold to the senior population. Remember, MHA is around alternate site health care, and the largest portion of their revenue is coming from skilled nursing homes, long-term care facilities. It's not really the headline prices around EpiPen or whatever else that you might read in the Wall Street Journal. It's really for kind of the longer chronic illnesses that they're being sold through the MHA contracting vehicles. So we do look at drug pricing. It's been lower than what we would have seen in years past, but still positive in 2016. We're not counting on an awful lot of drug pricing lift as we think about the future for MHA. They continue to expand their solutions in nondrug supply chains, including food and other things for our long-term care facilities and other nursing homes. So they continue to expand that and then also expand their software solutions around data analytics. You've seen us make a couple of acquisitions that also serve the alternate site health care, which are not GPO but are really around software solutions that allow those members and customers to run their businesses more efficiently. That's where we look for growth. We don't really count on underlying drug price increases as something that is going to drive our performance, although it does have an impact on our revenue."

Joining me on the call this morning are Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Humphrey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Paul Soni, our Vice President and Controller. 
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast or also available on our website. 
Now if you'll please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. 
And now please turn to Slide 3. Today, we'll be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning and also included as a part of this presentation on our website. 
For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of 2 items: First, a $2.2 million purchase accounting adjustment to acquire deferred revenue relating to software acquisitions. This represents revenue that those companies would have recognized if not for our acquisition. Second, a $0.9 million debt extinguishment charge related to the replacement of our former credit facility with a new $2.5 billion facility that closed in the quarter. 
And now if you'll please turn to Slide 4. I will turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. After his prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?"

We'll start here with the Q3 enterprise results, so next slide. We had a record for just about everything again in the third quarter. Our orders were an all-time record at $929 million. And by the way, if we",3572,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everybody. We'll start here with the Q3 enterprise results, so next slide. 
We had a record for just about everything again in the third quarter. Our orders were an all-time record at $929 million. And by the way, if we had booked the MTA order a couple of days earlier, but it wasn't quite ready to go, we would have been -- we'd have had our first $1 billion quarter in our history. 
Revenue was strong. Net earnings were, of course, a record EBITDA cash flow. Revenue was up 7% to $947 million, which gave us 2 points of organic growth despite the headwinds in oil and gas. FX cost is 1 point. And then acquisitions and divestitures, netted out, plus 6% because this was still the last quarter without all of the divestment in it.
Growth was led by both the Medical and RF Technology Software businesses. And certainly, Neptune had an outstanding quarter as you'll see in a minute. 
Declines in oil and gas were basically about what we thought. We thought they'd be sort of down 20% or so, and they were. Gross margins were up 60 basis points to 61.3%, and EBITDA was up 8% to $328 million. Our net earnings reached $169 million, which gave us a DEPS earnings per share number of $1.65, ahead of our guidance. 
Free cash flow was up 40%. Really, an astonishing quarter, where our free cash flow is up 11% year-to-date, but up 40% in the third quarter. 
And then our ConstructConnect acquisition, which we're announcing today and which will close this week, is another terrific business for us. It's a SaaS network business for the preconstruction industry, and we'll detail that later in the call this morning, and it should close, again, this week. 
So we have very strong cash quarter. We had record results, and then we had this great acquisition. 
So the next slide. Here, if you look at the income statement, you can see orders were up 4%. The book-to-bill was 0.98, which is okay because of sort of lumpy activity. It's in the wheelhouse. But had we been able to book the MTA order, our book-to-bill would have been 105, which gives you some idea about how strong really the core orders were. The only thing then in the quarter that was odd is that the normal fourth quarter delivery schedule stuff was not very strong. 
Revenue was up 7%, our gross profit was up 8%. You can see we're up 60 basis points in gross profit. The operating income margin, because of the acquisition and amortization in these things, you can see it going to 28.5%, which is still spectacular but down 20 basis points. The reality is, on the next slide, you'll see the EBITA margin actually went up 30 basis points, which is the right way to look at a cash-oriented business like ours. And then net earnings were up 4%. Tax rate, about what we thought. 
Next slide. If you compare the operating and the EBITA margins, we certainly have not reported leading, first, with those kind of numbers. But our EBITA margin, as you can see in 2014's third quarter, were 32.5%. Last year at 33.4%. And this year, 33.7%. So our margins on the operating cash side are up 120 basis points in just 2 years, and our gross margins continue up as well. If -- focusing on the operating profit margin, where you get a lot of noncash amortization charges, would lead people to the wrong conclusion. It's the wrong way to think about cash business like ours, even though the results are outstanding. So we're really focused on continuing to improve our EBITA margins, which were up 30 basis points. 
Next slide. We continue to comp out cash flow at a quite strong clip, and we don't see that slowing down anytime soon. We really have terrific operating cash flow in the quarter, $317 million. Both operating and free cash flow were up 40%. And you can see the comparison to last year at $660 million year-to-date operating cash flow and now we're at $731 million, up 11% despite less-than-robust end markets in our industrial and energy businesses. 
Conversion was pretty spectacular. You can see our year-to-date conversion on operating cash flow is 146%, so excellent cash performance. 
Next slide. Our asset-light business model, which 5 years ago people told me you couldn't make it any better than it was, continues to improve at really phenomenal rates. Here, you can see inventory is down 80 basis points from 2 years ago. Receivables are down 150 basis points, and payables and accruals are actually up 160. So 2 years ago, we had 5.8% net working capital to revenue, and the way we measure it, today, we closed the quarter at 1.9%. That's a 67% reduction as a function of revenue in just 2 years, 390 basis points. So the quality of the asset-light acquisitions that we've been doing the last couple of years in addition to our own governance process around improving everything we own is really having a just astonishing impact on our ability to compound cash and deploy future capital. 
Next slide. If you look here at the financial position of the company, you get some sense of the balance sheet. Just as a quick note, this is absolutely the biggest balance sheet that we have ever had to capture capital deployment opportunities. We now have an undrawn revolver of $2.5 billion, and we have $882 million of cash, so nearly $3.4 billion of powder. Even after paying for the ConstructConnect business, our acquisition powder is right around $2.8 billion. 
We begin -- we've deployed capital since January 1, 2015, at a rate of $2.7 billion during that 21-month period. So our compounding of the cash and the strength of the balance sheet and the flexibility that our new credit facility gives us is all great because we're going to be able to put that to good use with the incredible acquisition pipeline that we continue to see. And you can see our net debt to EBITDA number is only 1.7 after the acquisition. It's still just around 2, so we've got a lot of ramp space here to be able to continue to make transactions that are accretive to the company. 
Next slide. We'll look at the segment detail of each of the 4 segments the way we record it, and then talk about the detail of the business here after that. 
So the next slide. Here, if we look at the Q3 segment performance of energy, you can see its EBITDA margin was 29%; Industrial Tech, 32%. The first point about thinking around these businesses is how remarkable their margin performance is in these challenging markets. The nimble execution that we have inside the presence that's around those businesses is really amazing. In 2003, those businesses, the energy and industrial businesses taken together, had about $377 million in revenue. And this year taken together, they had $303 million and yet the EBITDA margin in '14 was 32% of those combined businesses. And here this year, it's 31%. So despite a significant falloff in revenue, the margins have been able to be maintained. 
The second point of this slide is that, of course, our future and the nature of the enterprise you can see continues to compound towards the RF, the application software, the medical software and the medical products businesses, which now make up nearly 75% of the EBITDA of Roper's entire entity. And they also have done remarkably well. Two years ago, those businesses had about 39% EBITDA. Today, those businesses have about 41% EBITDA. 
Next slide. If we look at the first, our smallest segment, Energy Systems now is down to barely 10% of the company. And its organic growth was down 13% generally the way we thought it would be. The segment, while down as expected, really did modestly better than it did in the second quarter and is likely to do modestly better again in the fourth quarter. 
Terrific profitability. The OP margins in the second and third quarter were 25.4%, and EBITDA margins were 29.2%. 
When we look at the fourth quarter, we think oil and gas will be down about another 20% in this particular segment, same as it was in the third quarter, but we don't think we're going to get much growth in terms of fourth quarter seasonality. We didn't get much last year. But generally, it's been quite substantial, so we're sort of assuming that we won't get that this year. 
Margins will improve again in the fourth quarter. We started the year out in energy with 20.4% OP; second quarter went to 22.5%; the third quarter is already up to 25.4%; and the fourth quarter will be substantially materially above that. So these businesses still in our view represent a sort of free shot on goal for us, and they only represent 10% or less of revenue. 
Next slide. On the Industrial Technology side, you can see that this is the -- fortunately, the last quarter we'll talk about this divestiture of ABEL. If you adjust for the divestiture, the segment was actually flat despite the upstream oil and gas piece that's in Industrial Technology being down 35%. So how did that happen? What happened from double-digit growth at Neptune, who continues to gain market share, and very strong demand for the R900 Automated Meter Reading and AMI technology with lots of migrating upgrades, we had a significant number of wins last quarter, over 10. And really, the $50 million that we put into R&D in the last 3 years in Neptune has gotten us into a very outstanding position that people will begin to appreciate just how much we've done and how far advanced we are going to be over the next couple of years in the space. 
We did get some sequential improvement at Roper Pump, and we expect to have a little bit better results again in the fourth quarter despite basically that -- 2 other businesses in here that are really purely related to upstream and have been severely hampered. 
The rest of our businesses in here are -- it's kind of test businesses that are all doing relatively well. Some of them actually had record quarters. And on balance, we don't see any deterioration in those businesses. 
In the fourth quarter, we think we'll have sort of similar revenue and margin performance to what we had in the third quarter. And while upstream markets are sequentially flat, there is a tiny bit of improvement that we're seeing. 
Next slide. Here, we'll look at the RF Technology and Software segment. It's really increasingly right to think about 3 legs in this segment with the RF product side of activity, and then you have the tolling side of activity, and then you have all this application software business. And of course now in addition to that, with ConstructConnect. 
So here, the business' revenue was up 20% in the quarter. The operating profit was up 26%. The OP margin is 31.7%, but the EBITDA margin was 38%, up 230 basis points. 
We had organic growth of 7% in this segment and had about 1 point of foreign exchange headwind, and acquisitions helped by 14%. 
Very strong growth at toll and traffic on project activity in Florida and Texas and Pennsylvania. Sounds like swing states in the election. 
Continued high single-digit growth in Software led by freight matching and CBORD. We did some really exciting things at freight matching. We've moved to a more modern software-friendly location in the Portland, Oregon area, and then we've put together the freight matching network, so DAT in the U.S. and Getloaded, into a new software development process that's going to expand our customer base. 
We had double-digit growth in the RF products business. A lot of that's driven by senior living. There are several of our businesses that touch senior living. 
And then toll and traffic had -- would have had spectacular orders, of course, if we would have been able to book the bridge and toll project -- toll -- tunnel project, which we hoped would happen a little bit earlier in the year. We had a 5-year extension of our toll mandate in Dubai. And the Saudi project is sort of back on track. We wound up with about 30 installations here in the fourth quarter, we think, which will get us to about 70 of the 350. So we feel much better about the progress in Riyadh. 
In the fourth quarter, TransCore was awarded a $70 million plus MTA project to convert 9 bridges and tunnels around the 5 boroughs. All of you who go back and forth are now well aware of what that's like. There's like 800,000 people a day going through that process. And conversion with our Infinity Lane technology will allow people to not have tollbooths, and there'll be fines, of course, based on video tolling. But if you have your normal toll tag, you'll be able to get through. The growth in toll and traffic, we think, will continue to manifest itself in the fourth quarter and certainly, into 2017. 
The Software businesses universally remain strong. We had kind of mid-single-digit organic growth in the whole segment, which gives a really strong momentum going into '17, certainly the best position we've had in this segment in a long time. 
And now we've acquired ConstructConnect, which we'll talk about here in a second, for $632 million. Got about $150 million in revenue and sort of Roper-type expected EBITDA margins, which will get better as it gets inside the Roper -- the governance process. 
Next slide. So talking about ConstructConnect for a minute. We issued a separate press release on this. I think today is an interesting day -- in addition to being a record quarter, it's a record number of press releases for Roper. This is really an amazing business. When our teams made the trips in the diligence process and working with Dave Conway's staff, you get to work in their training center, and you can watch the network live. It's really -- it's just like watching the floor of the exchange with all this activity going -- you realize how many people are interacting with this thing. They had $55 million of bid -- $1 billion of bid activity, and it's just remarkable. It's like our freight-matching network, where something's up for maybe 1, 1.2 seconds before it's grabbed by somebody else in the network. And here, you're seeing all this usage around the data, which is just unprecedented, and that is inside the network that's accessible to everybody. So it's all cloud-based technology. 
The network allows people to see what projects are coming up. They can see what contractors -- and form their own opinions about who might be competing for it, what the call-off is for everyone's specifications. They're also going to be benefited, by the way, because they will work together with our On Center business that was just for drywall construction only, and then there are other niche things that are going to be able to fold into ConstructConnect going forward. 
Those 800,000 users -- we were laughing about this in preparation for the call, but basically, there's 800,000 people that use the bridges and tunnels in New York every day, so we've decided that perhaps every person going through the tunnel represents a ConstructConnect user. This business is headquartered in Cincinnati. Its revenue for next year should be something hopefully above $150 million. It's going to generate something in the -- $50-plus million of EBITDA to us. And remember, lots of noncash amortization in these things. So terrific cash business. It'll meet all of our acquisition requirements. It's got a great management team. Dave has been running this business through its acquisition phase and through its evolutionary shaping of the preconstruction industry, so he really is the domain expert. Very high recurring revenue. It's a subscription business, so you have all of these great cash characteristics. It has deferred revenues. You have very few assets of any kind, and it really has multiple growth opportunities. And that's another reason why we found it to be a very attractive acquisition. I think a great home for ConstructConnect, who can now focus really on continuing to shape the evolution of the preconstruction industry. 
Next slide. The Medical and Scientific Imaging business. You can see here we were up 12%: 8% on acquisitions, 4% on organic. A little less than 1 point of negative FX, but rounded down as opposed to up. The medical businesses are 85% of the segment, and they grew organically at 5%. And interestingly throughout the year, the medical businesses have grown organically at 5%. Each one of the separate businesses are sort of hospital software, alternate site solutions business and the medical products, all 3 groups group, grew. 
Sunquest. The way we look at order intake is sort of different than bookings against the entire business because there's so much recurring revenue that it doesn't really change from a bookings basis. But on an order intake basis, they had a record in the third quarter. It was up the most it's ever been. 
Scientific Imaging, which is about 15% in the second, did okay in the third quarter. It's had modest growth. But actually, it's a bifurcated situation, where the life science portion -- because of cryo-EM market opportunities grew over 100% in the quarter, while the physical science business continued to be pretty weak. It was down about 20%. So these -- the opportunity in front of these businesses is the best it's ever been. In the fourth quarter, we think we'll have continued mid-single-digit growth for the medical businesses, led really by the alternate site solutions business. 
Scientific Imaging, we think, will be terrific on demand and bookings for new products, but most of those probably will have early 2017 deliveries, which was another reason that -- maybe get some here in the fourth quarter. We'll just have to see. But we're going to assume that mostly that's going to be a first half next year benefit. 
Okay. The next slide is the guidance update. Turn to page -- here's the specifics on the guidance. We're going to go into the fourth quarter at $1.77 to $1.89. It's a broad range. Probably not really a broad range given how much money we make and how few shares we have. So seasonality in the industrial and energy business is not something that we think will help this year. We could be wrong about that. And if we get normal seasonality, then we'd be towards the higher the end of the range. 
The New York City MTA ramp is very important in the fourth quarter. There's a commitment to get the first 3 projects completed by January 1, and how that project ramps will have a direct effect on whether we're towards the low or the higher end of the guidance. And then customer preferences around delivery. We thought the third quarter orders were satisfactory, but not carrying immediate delivery kind of results. So I think there's some hesitancy in the industrial and energy markets about exactly when they want things that they're booked and committed to. 
The full year guidance, given the fourth quarter as an addition to our year-to-date results, would give us somewhere around $6.48 to $6.60. I think most of our internal projections and external projections run around $6.55 to $6.60. 
3-year cash flow conversion will still be spectacular, 140% or so, and that will allow us, despite terrific oil and gas headwinds this year, to have 5% to 6% revenue and EBITDA growth for the year. 
Next slide. If we look at the summary of how we did in the third quarter, it's kind of a long list of good things. We got record orders revenue, net earnings EBITDA and cash flow. Four standout businesses there: Medical, Software, tolling and Neptune were quite good because remember, we got 20-plus negative on the energy side of the business. EBITDA got up to 34.6% of revenue, and our free cash flow was phenomenal. 
The New York City MTA bridge and tunnel All-Electronic Tolling project, we really expected to win this for some time, but the news about it, the commitment around it, didn't come until last Friday. So we had been planning for a Q4 kickoff, and we will do what we said we would do for them, which is to get the 3 projects done. But almost the vast majority of this work is going to come in 2017 and not in the fourth quarter. 
We acquired a great SaaS network business in ConstructConnect, and it, along with the things it can do with On Center in a cooperative way, will be very beneficial for us in 2017. 
The cash performance that we have year-to-date, along with the brand-new balance sheet with a much better credit facility, supports our continued ability to deploy capital. It's the most powder we've ever had, and the opportunities that we see are excellent. 
So we had outstanding results in the third quarter, and we're very well positioned for 2017 and ready to take your questions."

I -- so as far as barriers, I mean, the barrier, of course, for a network business is the strength and size of the network and the ability for all of the different users to be able to transact business and grow their own business by utilizing the ConstructConnect network and software solutions. And I think it goes to the size of the network. When Brian talked about 800,000 users and $55 million invitations to bid every year encompassing almost 400,000 different commercial construction projects, I mean, the size of the network and the combination that ConstructConnect has been able to put together between their different brands of iSqFt and BidClerk and Construct Data and really turn that into a single integrated platform, that's really unique inside the industry. So from a competitive position, I think for most of those customers, the way that they're able to grow their business and to bid on more projects and to win more is through connection to the ConstructConnect network. And so that's really the strength of that and the competitive position. There are a couple of competitors out there that also provide, particularly on the construction data side. But on the network and the integrated data, we really don't think there's anyone of size there."

That's exiting closer to the 5% growth rate. And that combined with the timing of imaging the orders and delivery. So all the life science things that Brian talked about earlier, those are actually very sophisticated instruments and cameras and filters that aren't as kind of the -- it's not just like machining and creating a pump. So the process in order to be able to turn that from order to delivery can easily be a 60, 90, 120 days depending on yield and throughput, particularly from suppliers around some of the sensors. And so as we look at the deliveries and the delivery schedule, particularly on the imaging product side and also on the medical product side, that's where we see a slight difference from what we would have thought before.

The difference is we don't like to go above like 4x debt to EBITDA. And those guys are willing to take debt staples and then bank split-on things and nonbank entities split-on things at 8x EBITDA, right? So they don't deploy much more equity in a transaction than we do. We just don't want to have 7 or 8x debt to EBITDA. We're going to remain investment-grade. And to do that, you want to be around 4x debt to EBITDA, coming back to 3%, 3.5% or something. So we're very disciplined about wanting to and guaranteeing ourselves to maintain an investment-grade status. The prices that people are paying for things are really bifurcated. Oddly enough, the industrial assets are trading at really more than they're worth in a normalized interest environment in a M&A world because they don't have a lot of EBITDA, even though they'll require a lot of capital spending to maintain that EBITDA. So those multiples are interestingly high. Then the asset-light businesses trade at a premium to that, but the arbitrage for us on the asset-light businesses is more favorable than those people that are buying the more capital-intensive businesses. So something like ConstructConnect is -- will be a long-term compounder of investment for us, which is great, as opposed to the guys that are buying the capital-intensive businesses thinking that, ""Gee, it looks like I'm paying a lot, but they're at the nadir of their cyclical activity.

We actually have a review coming up with Sunquest in about a month, where we will be talking about not only 2017, but importantly, 2018 and 2019 and the plans that they have around the investments there. And so one is the -- is what I was kind of just mentioning in terms of the continued on the upgrade side around Lab 8.0 and the new blood bank solution. But also, I wouldn't ignore the investments that we've made around genetic testing and the workflows associated with that. So you really have the blood side, which is the core lab high-volume testing environment that every hospital has to have. And the other side, which is anatomic pathology and the emerging genetic workflows around genetic testing. That's where we've made important investments with the acquisition of GeneInsight and continued R&D around being able to make that workflow as efficient and as quick with getting the information back to the doctor as timely as happens today on the blood side. And so for all those reasons, I think the Sunquest and our entire platform of hospital software solutions -- which, of course, includes Data Innovations and CliniSys and GeneInsight and a variety of other things, all of those businesses really deliver those software solutions to hospitals. I think their future looks very bright as a result of the investments that we continue to make there."

People think you could never get lower, and now we're at 1.9%. Certainly, a lot of that as you get deferred revenue and you get paid in advance for work you do, and most of the things that we look at these days have those qualities. So we -- I don't know if we get to 0 or ultimately negative at some point, but I don't see us going up. The amount of small niche businesses that work in kind of oligopolies where customer industry is critical, and then those that have the ability to have kind of a network effect, there are more of those things out there than you might imagine because when you're focused on product businesses, you don't necessarily see some of these kind of things. But all of the people that are involved in transactions in the banking businesses and the private equity businesses kind of know what we favor, what we look like, and so the funnel that we have of incoming opportunity is really amazing. And it's just incumbent on us to sort through that funnel, find the best management teams and the best end market opportunities there in favorably competitive environments. And believe me, there is more high-quality things available that our balance sheet could tolerate. Fortunately, we've got a big-enough balance sheet to capture some of them."

So in terms of its contribution on the growth side, it was up in the -- kind of 3% or 4% in the third quarter, and we expect that to be modestly better in the fourth quarter. From a drug pricing standpoint, I mean, you're right, that is something that we look at. A lot of the headlines that you see around drug pricing aren't really targeted for or being sold to the senior population. Remember, MHA is around alternate site health care, and the largest portion of their revenue is coming from skilled nursing homes, long-term care facilities. It's not really the headline prices around EpiPen or whatever else that you might read in the Wall Street Journal. It's really for kind of the longer chronic illnesses that they're being sold through the MHA contracting vehicles. So we do look at drug pricing. It's been lower than what we would have seen in years past, but still positive in 2016. We're not counting on an awful lot of drug pricing lift as we think about the future for MHA. They continue to expand their solutions in nondrug supply chains, including food and other things for our long-term care facilities and other nursing homes. So they continue to expand that and then also expand their software solutions around data analytics. You've seen us make a couple of acquisitions that also serve the alternate site health care, which are not GPO but are really around software solutions that allow those members and customers to run their businesses more efficiently. That's where we look for growth. We don't really count on underlying drug price increases as something that is going to drive our performance, although it does have an impact on our revenue."
