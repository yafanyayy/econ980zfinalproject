I was pleased with the fourth quarter came in as expected with year-over-year revenue down 1% in constant currency and non-GAAP EPS of $0.70. We continue to make progress on our key transformation initiatives centered on revenue growth and our cost structure, which I'll cover later. 
First, I will provide some color on our results that are specific to our going forward Data and Analytics business without our Marketing Applications and from a constant currency perspective. For the full year, revenue was down 2%. Services revenue was up 5%; and within services, maintenance were up 6% and consulting 4% for the year. Consulting services is on a good growth trajectory. After growing 2% in the first half, revenue grew 6% in the second half. In addition, we grew recurring revenue $74 million, which was up 7% for the year. Recurring revenue as a percent of total revenue increased from 43% in 2014 to 47% in 2015 and accounted for  59% of total revenue, excluding one-time professional services.  We expect to see both recurring revenue and services growth in 2016. 
Looking at our results by region, we were pleased to see the Americas grow revenue 3% in the fourth quarter. Our top 50 customers grew in the quarter and declined 3% for the year, which was slightly better than 2014. We have kept the top 50 group of customers static over the last 3 years so that we could measure their performance. This metric has become less relevant as we now have 14 different customers that qualify to be in the top 50, which is normal. Going forward, we will record a more relevant metrics such as recurring revenue and other metrics that relate to the transformational them transformation of the company. In international, revenue was down 1% for the full year. Fourth quarter revenue declined 8% with declines in Western Europe, Australia and China, which was mostly due to lumpiness. All 3 were roughly flat for the full year. 
Turning to our big data results, revenue increased more than 50% in 2015 and maintenance revenue more than doubled. Excluding the 1000 Souris, revenue grew more than 60%. Big data and new customer wins increased sequentially each quarter, resulting in a significant increase in new customer wins compared to 2014. We continue to see increasing demand for our big data consulting as companies struggle to manage the analytic ecosystem and the extract value from the data. For the full year, our big data consulting services revenue, which includes the Q3 2014 acquisition of Think Big, was up 80%. 
Turning to our Teradata managed cloud. Revenue is still small but growing rapidly, and it is very strategic to us. We more than doubled the number of customers in 2015 and revenue was close to double. Our cloud offers customers flexibility in how they buy and how they deploy Teradata. Today, most of our cloud customers are running workloads such as discovery, custom development, -- the recovery and production. Our cloud delivers the same performance and functionality as our on-premises data warehouses, which is extremely important to our customers. We have had new customer start out small with our Teradata cloud, then based on Teradata's outstanding performance, purchased Teradata to use on premises and replace competitors in the process. Regarding the sale of our Marketing Applications business, we have strong interest from a number of buyers and are now in the due diligence process and expect to complete the sale in the next few months. In the fourth quarter, our Marketing Applications revenue of $50 million was up 4% over prior year. Our digital marketing cloud had good recurring revenue growth of 13%. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on our transformation and the future of our company, which I am personally excited about. Last quarter, I described 4 key transformational initiatives: Expand our data warehouse market opportunity with our software-only solutions for public and private clouds; second, focus on big data solutions that can contribute revenue growth and increase our relevance in the analytic ecosystem; third, and enhance our value-added services and extend the market opportunity; fourth, evolve our go-to-market approach and transform our cost structure.
Over the last quarter, we have made a lot of progress and had further refined our plans and evolved our initiatives, which I'm going to share with you now. We have developed a comprehensive transformation blueprint to place the company on a trajectory of meaningful revenue growth. This blueprint addresses the challenges of the analytic ecosystem, cloud, software-only and open-source. It also addresses customers changing behaviors, how they buy, how they consume and how they deploy analytics. Teradata is universally known as the leader in the high-performance data analytics and consulting services. Many of our customers are leaders in their industries, and we are recognized as their partner of choice for driving business value from the data.
Our business transformation is building on this position of strength and will advance our leadership and expand our market opportunity. The broad-reaching transformation will now drive change in the 4 key revenue-generating areas and will create a more diversified, stable and predictable revenue stream. These 4 areas are: on-premises data warehouse, cloud, analytic ecosystem and value-added services and solutions. We expect the mix of revenues to increase significantly for cloud analytic ecosystem and value-added services over time as these are fast-growing markets. This will also help increase our mix of recurring revenue.
First, we continue to see the on-premises data warehouse market as a solid opportunity for revenue growth by growing wallet share with existing customers and by penetrating the more than 75% of the Global 5000 that don't use Teradata. We will make it easier for customers to buy Teradata by offering multiple consumption and pricing options to make it easier to budget and purchase in a more predictable manner. We will also provide the ability to seamlessly expand our data warehouses and to buy in smaller increments.
In addition, our software-only version Teradata will open doors with both new customers and existing customers. Second, cloud will extend our market opportunity and become a significant contributor to recurring revenue. As I discussed earlier, we are having great success with our Teradata managed cloud, which delivers the same performance and functionality as we do on-premises. Teradata software-only public cloud environments will provide flexible options that allow customers to quickly and easily stand up with Teradata environment for a wide range of uses, including discovery, experimentation, test and development, backup and archive and production workloads. We continue to shift engineering resources to our cloud team and add outside talent with cloud experience. We plan to make Teradata available on multiple public clouds, which gives our customers choice and will also be a key differentiator for us.
We are on track to deliver our initial software-only version of Teradata on AWS later this quarter and are fully scalable MPP version in early 2017. We are building new services for cloud migration as well as for design and implementation. Third, the analytic ecosystem will continue to be a major driver of revenue growth. Our big data portfolio, which plays in the analytic ecosystem, had revenue growth of approximately 60% last year. We expect to see strong demand to continue for our solutions and services. We want to be the best in providing software, services and solutions to help customers connect, manage and extract value from the various platforms and data across the analytic ecosystem.
We will continue to add to our software offerings that focus on this, such as with unity, QueryGrid and listener that help connect and manage the ecosystem and with Aster that helps to step value from the extract value from the data. Fourth, our value-added services and solutions represent a critical strategic vector, driving revenues by themselves but, more importantly, service to be the enabler and key differentiator for all of our revenue-generating initiatives. In this area, we have a strong foundation for building repeatable solutions with our logical data models, business improvement opportunities and use cases. We had good success with this today, such as with that use cases to help penetrate the manufacturing industry with predictive parts failures, preventive maintenance and warranty solutions. These types of use cases save customers tens of millions of dollars annually and we are investing to create more of them. Many of these repeatable solutions will contain IP, such as with our Teradata Analytics for SAP solution -- and to enter in key applications, such as with our customer interaction management applications. The point is we need to invest systematically, capturing use cases and IP from engagements around the world and invest in packaging them for ease of delivery and implementation.
Turning to go-to-market, which is a central and critical element of our transformation. This is about from 1 initiative into 4, which are aligned and integrated with our 4 revenue-generating initiatives. We have the most work to do with our public cloud go-to-market and are in the early stages of developing our plan. We will continue to provide more details at a later date. We have already begun taking steps to optimize our go-to-market for on-premises data warehouse and analytic ecosystem, and we are exploring new ways to generate demand. 
Finally, we are making good progress with our cost transformation. This is critical to enable us to increase investments into our 4 key revenue-generating areas and into R&D. I'm excited by the steps we have already taken. The entire leadership team is committed to the success of our business transformation. Given the magnitude of transformational change across the company, we have created a transformation team, which is led by John Denning, 1 of my direct reports. Additionally,, we are committed to add more outside talent to our team to address these key initiatives. As we execute our transformation, new metrics will be added to help you track our success. We will be providing more details regarding Teradata's transformation and longer-term financial outlook at our Analyst Day later this summer. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve, who will provide more detail on our Q4 and full year results and our 2016 guidance. Steve?"

Teradata's establishing a solid transformational foundation for the future while also focused on delivering near-term results. Our team has embraced our strategic initiatives, including cost optimization, organization talent initiatives and our go-to-market enhancements. During my discussion today, except where otherwise noted, I'll be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and other special items, including the goodwill impairment charges taken in the second and the fourth quarters. Product gross margin in the fourth quarter was 57.5% compared to last year's Q4 product margin of 60-point -- 65.8%. The primary drivers of the change were deal mix, including sizable core --, increasing capacity and demand and greater mix of larger customers and currency. For the full year, product gross margin was 59.9% compared to 65.2% in 2014. The lower margin 2015 was primarily due to the deal mix, including pricing programs that make it easier to buy Teradata and the currency impact. Services gross margin in the quarter was 47.9%, down from the 48.9% in Q4 2014. Services gross margin for the full year was 46.4% compared to 47.6% in 2014. The decrease for the period was primarily due to investments to support demand creation in our big data consulting practice. Overall gross margin was 52.2% in the fourth quarter versus 56.9% in the fourth quarter 2014. For the full year, gross margin was 52% compared to 55.5% in 2014. 
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $194 million was $4 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, SG&A was $708 million, a 1% decrease from the 2014 level. Research and development expense in the quarter was $47 million, down $1 million from the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year, R&D increased 11% to $199 million. The increase was related to growth initiatives although the increase was not as much as we had planned when we began the year. As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 18.6% versus the 24.6% in Q4 2014. For the full year, operating margin was 16% versus 22.7% in 2014. Teradata's non-GAAP tax rate was 28.8% compared to 25.1% in 2014. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by fourth quarter catch-up due to the proportion of actual foreign pretax earnings in 2015 being lower than what we had previously forecasted. For the full year, 2015 non-GAAP tax rate was 27.5% as compared to 27.2% for 2014. Looking forward, for 2016, we expect the gap effective tax rate to be approximately 26%, excluding the tax impact from the pending sale of our Marketing Applications business. The non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 27.5% and will not be impacted by the Marketing Applications disposition. However, both tax rates are heavily dependent upon our actual earnings mix. 
Turning to our cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $31 million in Q4 2015 compared to $97 million in the fourth quarter 2014. In addition to the impact of lower net income, the lower cash flow performance was primarily due to  abnormally high level of collections of accounts receivable in the fourth quarter 2014, which improved the 2014 full year cash flow by approximately $100 million but then correspondingly reduced the full year 2015 cash flow by the same amount. Free cash flow for the full year 2015 was $281 million versus the $551 million in 2014. Again, the year-over-year change was negatively impacted by lower net income and the early collection of approximately $100 million receivables in Q4 2014. Going forward, due to the expected differences between free cash flow and net income, such as a stock-based compensation and other acquired intangible amortization, we expect full year free cash flow to be up approximately $50 million higher or be up to $50 million higher than GAAP net income. 
Our balance sheet. We had $839 million of cash as of December 31, 2015. More than 95% is held offshore. In Q4, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares of stock for approximately $99 million. In 2015, we repurchased approximately 19 million shares for $647 million. To fund a portion of these share repurchases, we drew down $180 million in our $400 million credit facility as of December 31. As of December 31, 2015, we have approximately $573 million of share repurchases -- repurchase authorization remaining. Additionally, we have used $50 million to repurchase approximately 2.2 million shares in 2016. As of February 3, 2016, we have approximately 523 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. As previously mentioned, a majority of the Marketing Applications business will be sold. As a result, we had made balance sheet adjustments to the assets held for sale in the liabilities held for sale to reflect the most current fair value. Future adjustments to these estimates may be necessary as the sale of business is not completed. The following balance sheet commentary includes the Marketing Applications business that we expect to exit. 
Accounts receivable was consistent between December 31, 2015, and 2014 and up 5% in constant currency. Day sales outstanding was 89 days as of December 31, 2015, compared to 83 days as of December 31, 2014. Total deferred revenue was $413 million as of 12/31/15, which is up $25 million from December 31, 2014, or up 10% in constant currency. As I transition in the guidance, I want to highlight a few items. As Mike said, we are making good progress in the exit of our Marketing Applications business and currently plan to complete the sale of that business around the end of the first quarter. For 2016, we'll provide you with a non-GAAP view of our results that excludes the Marketing Applications business. To give you an idea of the size and operating income impact of the Marketing Applications business we expect to exit in 2016, excluding the portion we will retain in 2015, we have approximately $115 million of revenue and an operating loss of approximately $45 million, which translates to a loss per share of approximately $0.23 in 2015. 
In terms of revenue guidance for 2016. Based on the exchange rates at the end of January and including approximately $40 million of the revenue from the Marketing Applications business in the first quarter 2016, but no revenue contribution from the Marketing Applications business remaining for the remaining 3 quarters of the year, our GAAP revenue is expected to be in the approximate range of $2.315 billion to $2.360 billion dollars, down 7% to 8% year-over-year or down 5% to 7% in constant currency. Excluding the anticipated marketing -- excluding the anticipated Marketing Applications revenue from Q1 2016, we expect non-GAAP revenue to be down 8% to 10%, down 6% to 8% in constant currency. This translates into for the revenue and the approximate range of $2.275 billion to $2.320 billion. For the comparison purposes, when the Marketing Applications business excluded for both 2015 and 2016, revenue expected to be down 2% to 4% reported or flat or down 2% in constant currency. 
In terms of EPS, including the expected Q1 results of marketing applications business, but excluding any potential tax impact from the sale of Marketing Applications business, we expect full year 2016 GAAP EPS in the range of $1.68 to $1.83 range. Excluding the Q1 results from the Marketing Applications business, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the $2.35 to $2.50 range. 
Other specific items impacting our 2016 guidance include: We are on track for the cost reduction of approximately $70 million in 2016. As a reminder,, last quarter we estimated we will be able to lower cost exclusive of exiting the Marketing Applications business by approximately $80 million to $100 million over the 2016 to 2017 time frame with approximately $70 million of the redemption reduction in costs realized in 2016 and the remainder in 2017. We expect product gross margin expectations to be consistent with 2015 and services gross margin forecast expected to improve slightly. Consistent with what we said during the third quarter earnings call, the cost savings in 2016 will be somewhat offset by increased variable compensation cost in 2016 due to Teradata not achieving our incentive compensation targets in 2015, but we would assume we will achieve the targets in 2015, thereby creating a year-over-year increase in incentive compensation approximately $30 million. We also reference approximately $10 million increase in overall salary expense for performance increases across the spread across the total employee base, which is also included in our guidance. Netting these items, we expect the net benefit approximately $30 million in 2016 operating income specifically due to the cost rationalization work we have underway. Weighted average shares outstanding for the full year is expected to approximate $132 million with a similar number of shares expected for Q1. And finally, specifically as it relates to Q1 2016, we expect to start Q1 very slowly from a non-GAAP revenue perspective due to our international region facing approximate 5 point currency headwind and also comparing against the 7% constant currency growth into Q1 2015, and we also expect a significant realignment of our U.S. sales force related to our strategic go-to-market initiatives may create some disruption of activity -- of productivity in the first part of 2016. 
In closing, Teradata's strategically focused on transitioning back to meaningful growth, and we made significant progress since our last earnings call. More specifically, we are in the process of exiting the Marketing Applications business. We expect to achieve our cost-reduction initiatives. However, there's transition elements of our cost-reduction initiatives that spans 2016 and 2017. We have begun the process of strengthening our talent to better align our organization with our strategic initiatives. We have aligned our sales model in the Americas to increase our results productivity and lower our overall sales cost. And last, we have dedicated team of internal functional leaders led by a well-respected direct report to Mike, our CEO, in place to drive our transformation. Our transformation is far from complete, but I'm excited about the progress we have made. The team is energized on leveraging our technological and consulting strengths to reignite our growth engine. We have a lot of work streams and process and look forward to providing you more detailed information relating to our initiatives later this summer. And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

But most of the customers tend to buy in smaller increments and start in smaller increments, and that's been the most recent trend that impacts product revenue. So if you look at the average dollar size for new customer wins, it's gone down because we're just starting in smaller increments. Then in the user base, that all the customers continue to buy Teradata but in smaller increments and less floor sweeps. So the absence change, which we're trying to try of change into how we do business as it relates to our core data warehouse in our product revenue, absent that change, it would take some of those dynamics to change, and we're not counting on the way customers are buying and what the customers prefer. We are not counting on that to change. We're changing in how we make it easier for customers to consume and buy Teradata. And that is what we're counting on 2 transform ourselves to get the product revenue growing meaningfully."

As Mike said, we're making it easier through this transformation strategic initiatives to have our customers, particularly larger customers buy in or consume Teradata. Through there, you can have VPAs, you can have DLAs, again all these items make it easier for customers to consume. We saw that impact positive and constructively through in Q4. But it did have an impact in our product gross margin in Q4. With that being said, let me just kind of reset. We finished the year 59 9, but there is about 200 basis points for FX and FAS 86 impact so it's really 62% versus 65% for the year in '15 over '14. We expect 2016 with these programs, 2016 probably closer approximate 2015 and going from there. So we're expecting these programs to be in place in '16 and having overall product gross margin that range of '15. So that's giving me a little bit some -- a little bit conservative on it that we have another 200 basis points of maybe movement in that product side. On the services side, yes, 2015, we continue to invest particularly in our Think Big big data and building out the bench strength and building out the team to take advantage of that, and that -- those costs as you're building out become expense through services. So we expect services gross margin to improve slightly, possibly improve slightly in 2016."

And we have the opportunity to look at now the time has passed, and we have been optimizing them the last couple of years. But we have an opportunity to go deeper and it's not like you're reducing sales coverage. You have the opportunity or customer coverage, you have the opportunity to combine territories and provide coverage to the same customer base and I can argue the more customers with less territories. So just think of it that way. Our results specialist and our go-to-market in compensation, no meaningful change there. We will commit to evolve our go-to-market. We're in early stages of that is basically the net-net as we look at Q1. So you don't get into some changes of account assignments and things like that, and it can have an impact when you do it. So there is little bit during the first quarter. 
So listen, in closing, we remain the undisputed leader for on-premise analytics, and we're well on the path to becoming a leading large-scale production analytic engine in the cloud, a leading analytic services company and a leader in repeatable analytical solutions across the entire analytic ecosystem. We look forward to share with -- more with you in the future, and I hope you all have a good day. Thank you very much."

I was pleased with the fourth quarter came in as expected with year-over-year revenue down 1% in constant currency and non-GAAP EPS of $0.70. We continue to make progress on our key transformation initiatives centered on revenue growth and our cost structure, which I'll cover later. 
First, I will provide some color on our results that are specific to our going-forward Data and Analytics business without our Marketing Applications and from a constant-currency perspective. For the full year, revenue was down 2%. Services revenue was up 5%, and within services, maintenance was up 6% and consulting 4% for the year. Consulting services is on a good growth trajectory. After growing 2% in the first half, revenue grew 6% in the second half. In addition, we grew recurring revenue $74 million, which was up 7% for the year. Recurring revenue as a percent of total revenue increased from 43% in 2014 to 47% in 2015, and accounted for 59% of total revenue, excluding onetime professional services. We expect to see both recurring revenue and services growth in 2016. 
Looking at our results by region. We were pleased to see the Americas grow revenue 3% in the fourth quarter. Our top 50 customers grew in the quarter and declined 3% for the year, which was slightly better than 2014. We have kept the top 50 group of customers static over the last 3 years, so that we could measure their performance. This metric has become less relevant as we now have 14 different customers that qualify to be in the top 50, which is normal. Going forward, we will report on more relevant metrics, such as recurring revenue, and other metrics that relate to the transformation of the company. In international, revenue was down 1% for the full year. Fourth quarter revenue declined 8% with declines in Western Europe, Australia and China, which was mostly due to lumpiness. All 3 were roughly flat for the full year. 
Turning to our big data results. Revenue increased more than 50% in 2015 and maintenance revenue more than doubled. Excluding the 1000 Series, revenue grew more than 60%. Big data new customer wins increased sequentially each quarter, resulting in a significant increase in new customer wins compared to 2014. We continue to see increasing demand for our big data consulting as companies struggle to manage the analytic ecosystem and the extract value from the data. For the full year, our big data consulting services revenue, which includes the Q3 2014 acquisition of Think Big, was up 80%. 
Turning to our Teradata managed cloud. Revenue is still small, but grown rapidly, and it is very strategic to us. We more than doubled the number of customers in 2015 and revenue was close to double. Our cloud offers customers flexibility in how they buy and how they deploy Teradata. Today, most of our cloud customers are running workloads, such as discovery, custom development, faster recovery and production. Our cloud delivers the same performance and functionality as our on-premises data warehouses, which is extremely important to our customers. We have had new customer start out small with our Teradata Cloud. Then based on Teradata's outstanding performance, purchased Teradata to use on-premises and replace competitors in the process. Regarding the sale of our Marketing Applications business, we have strong interest from a number of buyers and are now in the due diligence process and expect to complete the sale in the next few months. In the fourth quarter, our Marketing Applications revenue of $50 million was up 4% over prior year. Our digital marketing cloud had good recurring revenue growth of 13%. 
Now, I'd like to provide an update on our transformation and the future of our company, which I am personally excited about. Last quarter, I described 4 key transformational initiatives: Expand our data warehouse market opportunity with our software-only solutions for public and private clouds; second, focus on big data solutions that can contribute revenue growth and increase our relevance in the analytic ecosystem; third, enhance our value-added services and extend the market opportunity; fourth, evolve our go-to-market approach and transform our cost structure.
Over the last quarter, we have made a lot of progress and had further refined our plans and evolved our initiatives, which I'm going to share with you now. We have developed a comprehensive transformation blueprint to place the company on a trajectory of meaningful revenue growth. This blueprint addresses the challenges of the analytic ecosystem, cloud, software-only and open source. It also addresses customers' changing behaviors, how they buy, how they consume and how they deploy analytics. Teradata is universally known as the leader in the high-performance data analytics and consulting services. Many of our customers are leaders in their industries, and we are recognized as their partner of choice for driving business value from the data.
Our business transformation is building on this position of strength and we'll advance our leadership and expand our market opportunity. The broad-reaching transformation will now drive change in the 4 key revenue-generating areas and will create a more diversified, stable and predictable revenue stream. These 4 areas are: On-premises data warehouse, cloud, analytic ecosystem and value-added services and solutions. We expect the mix of revenues to increase significantly for cloud analytic ecosystem and value-added services over time as these are fast-growing markets. This will also help increase our mix of recurring revenue.
First, we continue to see the on-premises data warehouse market as a solid opportunity for revenue growth by growing wallet share with existing customers and by penetrating the more than 75% of the Global 5000 that don't use Teradata. We will make it easier for customers to buy Teradata by offering multiple consumption and pricing options to make it easier to budget and purchase in a more predictable manner. We will also provide the ability to seamlessly expand our data warehouses and to buy in smaller increments.
In addition, our software-only version of Teradata will open doors with both new customers and existing customers. Second, cloud will extend our market opportunity and become a significant contributor to recurring revenue. As I discussed earlier, we are having great success with our Teradata managed cloud, which delivers the same performance and functionality as we do on-premises. Teradata software-only public cloud environments will provide flexible pay-as-you-go options that will allow customers to quickly and easily stand up with Teradata environment for a wide range of uses, including discovery, experimentation, test and development, backup and archive and production workloads. We continue to shift engineering resources to our cloud team and add outside talent with cloud experience. We plan to make Teradata available on multiple public clouds, which gives our customers choice and will also be a key differentiator for us.
We are on track to deliver our initial software-only version of Teradata on AWS later this quarter and our fully scalable MPP version in early 2017. We are building new services for cloud migration, as well as for design and implementation. Third, the analytic ecosystem will continue to be a major driver of revenue growth. Our big data portfolio, which plays in the analytic ecosystem, had revenue growth of approximately 60% last year. We expect to see strong demand to continue for our solutions and services. We want to be the best at providing software, services and solutions to help customers connect, manage and extract value from the various platforms and data across the analytic ecosystem. We will continue to add to our software offerings that focus on this, such as with Unity, QueryGrid and Listener that help connect and manage the ecosystem, and with Aster, that helps to extract value from the data. Fourth, our value-added services and solutions represent a critical strategic vector, driving revenues by themselves but more importantly, service is a key enabler and differentiator for all of our revenue-generating initiatives. In this area, we have a strong foundation for building repeatable solutions with our logical data models, business improvement opportunities and use cases. We've had good success with these today, such as with use cases to help penetrate the manufacturing industry with predictive parts failures, preventive maintenance and warranty solutions. These types of use cases save customers tens of millions of dollars annually, and we are investing to create more of them. Many of these repeatable solutions will contain IP, such as with our Teradata Analytics for SAP solution, some will be end-to-end turnkey applications, such as with our customer interaction management applications. The point is we need to invest systematically, capturing use cases and IP from engagements around the world and invest in packaging them for ease of delivery and implementation.
Turning to go-to-market, which is a central and critical element of our transformation. This is above from 1 initiative into 4, which are aligned and integrated with our 4 revenue-generating initiatives. We have the most work to do with our public cloud go-to-market and are in the early stages of developing our plan. We will continue to provide more details at a later date. We have already begun taking steps to optimize our go-to-market for on-premises data warehouse and analytic ecosystem, and we are exploring new ways to generate demand. 
Finally, we are making good progress with our cost transformation. This is critical to enable us to increase investments into our 4 key revenue-generating areas and into R&D. I'm excited by the steps we have already taken. The entire leadership team is committed to the success of our business transformation. Given the magnitude of transformational change across the company, we have created a transformation team, which is led by John Denning, one of my direct reports. Additionally, we are committed to add more outside talent to our team to address these key initiatives. As we execute our transformation, new metrics will be added to help you track our success. We will be providing more details regarding Teradata's transformation and longer-term financial outlook at our Analyst Day later this summer. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve, who will provide more detail on our Q4 and full year results and our 2016 guidance. Steve?"

Teradata is establishing a solid transformational foundation for the future, while also focused on delivering near-term results. Our team has embraced our strategic initiatives, including cost optimization, organization talent initiatives and our go-to-market enhancements. During my discussion today, except where otherwise noted, I'll be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and other special items, including the goodwill impairment charges taken in the second and the fourth quarters. Product gross margin in the fourth quarter was 57.5% compared to last year's Q4 product margin of 60-point -- 65.8%. The primary drivers of the change were deal mix, including sizable floor sweeps, increasing capacity and demand and a greater mix of larger customers and currency. For the full year, product gross margin was 59.9% compared to 65.2% in 2014. The lower margin in 2015 was primarily due to the deal mix, including pricing programs that make it easier to buy Teradata and the currency impact. Services gross margin in the quarter was 47.9%, down from the 48.9% in Q4 2014. Services gross margin for the full year was 46.4% compared to 47.6% in 2014. The decrease for the period was primarily due to investments to support demand creation in our big data consulting practice. Overall, gross margin was 52.2% in the fourth quarter versus 56.9% in the fourth quarter 2014. For the full year, gross margin was 52% compared to 55.5% in 2014. 
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $194 million was $4 million lower than the fourth quarter 2014. For the full year, SG&A was $708 million, a 1% decrease from the 2014 level. Research and development expense in the quarter was $47 million, down $1 million from the fourth quarter 2014. For the year, R&D increased 11% to $199 million. The increase was related to our growth initiatives, although the increase was not as much as we had planned when we began the year. As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 18.6% versus the 24.6% in Q4 2014. For the full year, operating margin was 16% versus 22.7% in 2014. Teradata's non-GAAP tax rate was 28.8% as compared to 25.1% in 2014. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by fourth quarter catch-up due to the proportion of actual foreign pretax earnings in 2015, being lower than what we had previously forecasted. For the full year, 2015 non-GAAP tax rate was 27.5% as compared to the 27.2% for 2014. Looking forward for 2016, we expect the GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 26%, excluding the taxes impact from the pending sale of our Marketing Applications business. The non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 27.5% and will not be impacted by the Marketing Applications disposition. However, both tax rates are heavily dependent upon our actual earnings mix. 
Turning to our cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $31 million in Q4 2015 compared to $97 million in the fourth quarter 2014. In addition to the impact of lower net income, the lower cash flow performance was primarily due to abnormally high level of collections of accounts receivable in the fourth quarter 2014, which improved the 2014 full year cash flow by approximately $100 million, but then correspondingly reduced the full year 2015 cash flow by the same amount. Free cash flow for the full year 2015 was $281 million versus the $551 million in 2014. Again, the year-over-year change was negatively impacted by lower net income and the early collection of approximately $100 million receivables in Q4 2014. Going forward, due to the expected differences between free cash flow and net income, such as stock-based compensation and other acquired intangible amortization, we expect full year free cash flow to be up approximately $50 million higher or be up to $50 million higher than GAAP net income. 
Our balance sheet. We had $839 million of cash as of December 31, 2015. More than 95% is held offshore. In Q4, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares of stock for approximately $99 million. In 2015, we repurchased approximately 19 million shares for $647 million. To fund a portion of these share repurchases, we drew down $180 million in our $400 million credit facility as of December 31. As of December 31, 2015, we have approximately $573 million of share repurchases -- repurchase authorization remaining. Additionally, we have used $50 million to repurchase approximately 2.2 million shares in 2016. As of February 3, 2016, we have approximately 523 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. As previously mentioned, a majority of the Marketing Applications business will be sold. As a result, we had made balance sheet adjustments to the assets held for sale and the liabilities held for sale to reflect the most current fair value. Future adjustments to these estimates may be necessary as the sale of the business is not completed. The following balance sheet commentary includes the Marketing Applications business that we expect to exit. 
Accounts receivable was consistent between December 31, 2015, and 2014 and up 5% in constant currency. Day sales outstanding was 89 days as of December 31, 2015, compared to 83 days as of December 31, 2014. Total deferred revenue was $413 million as of 12/31/15, which is up $25 million from December 31, 2014 or up 10% in constant currency. As I transition into guidance, I want to highlight a few items. As Mike said, we are making good progress in the exit of our Marketing Applications business and currently plan to complete the sale of that business around the end of the first quarter. For 2016, we'll provide you with a non-GAAP view of our results that excludes the Marketing Applications business. To give you an idea of the size and operating income impact of the Marketing Applications business we expect to exit in 2016, excluding the portion we will retain in 2015, we have approximately $115 million of revenue and an operating loss of approximately $45 million, which translated to a loss per share of approximately $0.23 in 2015. 
In terms of revenue guidance for 2016. Based on the exchange rates at the end of January and including approximately $40 million of revenue from the Marketing Applications business in the first quarter 2016, but no revenue contribution from the Marketing Applications business remaining -- for the remaining 3 quarters of the year, our GAAP revenue is expected to be in the approximate range of $2.315 billion to $2.360 billion, down 7% to 8% year-over-year or down 5% to 7% in constant currency. Excluding the anticipated marketing -- excluding the anticipated Marketing Applications revenue from Q1 2016, we expect non-GAAP revenue to be down 8% to 10%, down 6% to 8% in constant currency. This translates into a full year revenue in the approximate range of $2.275 billion to $2.320 billion. For the comparison purposes, when the Marketing Applications business is excluded for both 2015 and 2016, revenue expected to be down 2% to 4% reported or flat or down 2% in constant currency. 
In terms of EPS, including the expected Q1 results of Marketing Applications business, but excluding any potential tax impact from the sale of Marketing Applications business, we expect full year 2016 GAAP EPS in the range of $1.68 to $1.83 range. Excluding the Q1 results from the Marketing Applications business, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the $2.35 to $2.50 range. 
Other specific items impacting our 2016 guidance include: We are on track for the cost reduction of approximately $70 million in 2016. As a reminder, last quarter we estimated we will be able to lower our cost exclusive of exiting the Marketing Applications business by approximately $80 million to $100 million over the 2016 to 2017 time frame with approximately $70 million of the redemption costs realized in 2016 and the remainder in 2017. We expect product gross margin expectations to be consistent with 2015 and services gross margin forecast expected to improve slightly. Consistent with what we said during the third quarter earnings call, the cost savings in 2016 will be somewhat offset by increased variable compensation cost in 2016 due to Teradata not achieving our incentive compensation targets in 2015, but we would assume we will achieve the targets in 2016, thereby creating a year-over-year increase in incentive compensation of approximately $30 million. We also referenced an approximately $10 million increase in overall salary expense for performance increases spread across the total employee base, which is also included in our guidance. Netting these items, we expect the net benefit approximately $30 million in 2016 operating income specifically due to the cost rationalization work we have underway. Weighted average shares outstanding for the full year is expected to approximate $132 million with a similar number of shares expected for Q1. And finally, specifically as it relates to Q1 2016, we expect to start Q1 very slowly from a non-GAAP revenue perspective due to our international regime facing an approximate 5-point currency headwind and also comparing against the 7% constant-currency growth into Q1 2015, and we also expect that the significant realignment of our U.S. sales force related to our strategic go-to-market initiatives may create some disruption of productivity -- of productivity in the first part of 2016. 
In closing, Teradata is strategically focused on transitioning back to meaningful growth, and we made significant progress since our last earnings call. More specifically, we are in the process of exiting the Marketing Applications business. We expect to achieve our cost-reduction initiatives. However, there's transition elements of our cost-reduction initiatives that span 2016 and 2017. We have begun the process of strengthening our talent to better align our organization with our strategic initiatives. We have realigned our sales model in the Americas to increase our sales productivity and lower our overall sales cost. And last, we have dedicated team of internal functional leaders, led by a well-respected direct report to Mike, our CEO, in place to drive our transformation. Our transformation is far from complete, but I'm excited about the progress we have made. The team is energized on leveraging our technological and consulting strengths to reignite our growth engine.

And it's not just for data warehousing. It gets into the analytic ecosystem, our big data solutions than anything else, which all drives revenue. I think the common theme on the product revenue that's happened over the last couple of years is the customer wins keep going up, and they're at a very high rate, but most of the customers tend to buy in smaller increments and start in smaller increments, and that's been the most recent trend that impacts product revenue. So if you look at the average dollar size for new customer wins, it's gone down. The customers are starting in smaller increments. And then in the user base, that all the customers continue to buy Teradata, but in smaller increments and less floor sweeps. So the abstinent of change, which we're trying to drive change in that how do we do business as it relates to our core data warehouse and our product revenue, abstinent of change, it would take some of those dynamics to change, and we're not counting on the way customers are buying and what the customers prefer.

Through their's, you can have VPAs, you can get ELAs, again all these items make it easier for the customers to consume. We saw that impact positive and constructively through in Q4, but it did have an impact in our product gross margin in Q4. With that being said, let me just kind of reset. We finished the year 59.9%, but there is about 200 basis points for FX and FAS 86 impact. So it's really 62% versus 65% for the year in '15 over '14. We expect 2016, with these programs, 2016 probably closer approximate 2015 and going from there. So we're expecting these programs to be in place in '16 and having overall product gross margin in that range of '15. So that's giving me a little bit some -- a little bit conservative on it that we have another 200 basis points of, may be, movement in that product side. On the services side, yes, 2015, we continue to invest, particularly in our Think Big big data, and building out the bench strength and building out the team to take advantage of that, and that -- those costs as you're building out become expense through services. So we expect services gross margin to improve slightly -- possibly improve slightly in 2016."

But we have an opportunity to go deeper and it's not like you're reducing sales coverage. You have the opportunity -- or customer coverage. You have the opportunity to combine territories and provide coverage to the same customer base and I can argue the more customers with less territories. So just think of it that way. Our sales specialists and our go-to-market in compensation, no meaningful change there. We will continue to evolve our go-to-market where we're in the early stages, but that's basically the net-net as we look at Q1.

We continue to make progress on our key transformation initiatives cent",1691,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I was pleased with the fourth quarter came in as expected with year-over-year revenue down 1% in constant currency and non-GAAP EPS of $0.70. We continue to make progress on our key transformation initiatives centered on revenue growth and our cost structure, which I'll cover later. 
First, I will provide some color on our results that are specific to our going-forward Data and Analytics business without our Marketing Applications and from a constant-currency perspective. For the full year, revenue was down 2%. Services revenue was up 5%, and within services, maintenance was up 6% and consulting 4% for the year. Consulting services is on a good growth trajectory. After growing 2% in the first half, revenue grew 6% in the second half. In addition, we grew recurring revenue $74 million, which was up 7% for the year. Recurring revenue as a percent of total revenue increased from 43% in 2014 to 47% in 2015, and accounted for 59% of total revenue, excluding onetime professional services. We expect to see both recurring revenue and services growth in 2016. 
Looking at our results by region. We were pleased to see the Americas grow revenue 3% in the fourth quarter. Our top 50 customers grew in the quarter and declined 3% for the year, which was slightly better than 2014. We have kept the top 50 group of customers static over the last 3 years, so that we could measure their performance. This metric has become less relevant as we now have 14 different customers that qualify to be in the top 50, which is normal. Going forward, we will report on more relevant metrics, such as recurring revenue, and other metrics that relate to the transformation of the company. In international, revenue was down 1% for the full year. Fourth quarter revenue declined 8% with declines in Western Europe, Australia and China, which was mostly due to lumpiness. All 3 were roughly flat for the full year. 
Turning to our big data results. Revenue increased more than 50% in 2015 and maintenance revenue more than doubled. Excluding the 1000 Series, revenue grew more than 60%. Big data new customer wins increased sequentially each quarter, resulting in a significant increase in new customer wins compared to 2014. We continue to see increasing demand for our big data consulting as companies struggle to manage the analytic ecosystem and the extract value from the data. For the full year, our big data consulting services revenue, which includes the Q3 2014 acquisition of Think Big, was up 80%. 
Turning to our Teradata managed cloud. Revenue is still small, but grown rapidly, and it is very strategic to us. We more than doubled the number of customers in 2015 and revenue was close to double. Our cloud offers customers flexibility in how they buy and how they deploy Teradata. Today, most of our cloud customers are running workloads, such as discovery, custom development, faster recovery and production. Our cloud delivers the same performance and functionality as our on-premises data warehouses, which is extremely important to our customers. We have had new customer start out small with our Teradata Cloud. Then based on Teradata's outstanding performance, purchased Teradata to use on-premises and replace competitors in the process. Regarding the sale of our Marketing Applications business, we have strong interest from a number of buyers and are now in the due diligence process and expect to complete the sale in the next few months. In the fourth quarter, our Marketing Applications revenue of $50 million was up 4% over prior year. Our digital marketing cloud had good recurring revenue growth of 13%. 
Now, I'd like to provide an update on our transformation and the future of our company, which I am personally excited about. Last quarter, I described 4 key transformational initiatives: Expand our data warehouse market opportunity with our software-only solutions for public and private clouds; second, focus on big data solutions that can contribute revenue growth and increase our relevance in the analytic ecosystem; third, enhance our value-added services and extend the market opportunity; fourth, evolve our go-to-market approach and transform our cost structure.
Over the last quarter, we have made a lot of progress and have further refined our plans and evolved our initiatives, which I'm going to share with you now. We have developed a comprehensive transformation blueprint to place the company on a trajectory of meaningful revenue growth. This blueprint addresses the challenges of the analytic ecosystem, cloud, software-only and open source. It also addresses customers' changing behaviors, how they buy, how they consume and how they deploy analytics. Teradata is universally known as the leader in the high-performance data analytics and consulting services. Many of our customers are leaders in their industries, and we are recognized as their partner of choice for driving business value from the data.
Our business transformation is building on this position of strength and will advance our leadership and expand our market opportunity. The broad-reaching transformation will now drive change in the 4 key revenue-generating areas and will create a more diversified, stable and predictable revenue stream. These 4 areas are: On-premises data warehouse, cloud, analytic ecosystem and value-added services and solutions. We expect the mix of revenues to increase significantly for cloud analytic ecosystem and value-added services over time, as these are fast-growing markets. This will also help increase our mix of recurring revenue.
First, we continue to see the on-premises data warehouse market as a solid opportunity for revenue growth by growing wallet share with existing customers and by penetrating the more than 75% of the Global 5000 that don't use Teradata. We will make it easier for customers to buy Teradata by offering multiple consumption and pricing options to make it easier to budget and purchase in a more predictable manner. We will also provide the ability to seamlessly expand our data warehouses and to buy in smaller increments. In addition, our software-only version of Teradata will open doors with both new customers and existing customers. 
Second, cloud will extend our market opportunity and become a significant contributor to recurring revenue. As I discussed earlier, we are having great success with our Teradata managed cloud, which delivers the same performance and functionality as we do on-premises. Teradata software-only public cloud environments will provide flexible pay-as-you-go options that will allow customers to quickly and easily stand up a Teradata environment for a wide range of uses, including discovery, experimentation, test and development, backup and archive and production workloads. We continue to shift engineering resources to our cloud team and add outside talent with cloud experience. We plan to make Teradata available on multiple public clouds, which gives our customers choice and will also be a key differentiator for us. We are on track to deliver our initial software-only version of Teradata on AWS later this quarter and our fully scalable MPP version in early 2017.  We are building new services for cloud migration, as well as for design and implementation. 
Third, the analytic ecosystem will continue to be a major driver of revenue growth. Our big data portfolio, which plays in the analytic ecosystem, had revenue growth of approximately 60% last year. We expect to see strong demand to continue for our solutions and services. We want to be the best at providing software, services and solutions to help customers connect, manage and extract value from the various platforms and data across the analytic ecosystem. We will continue to add to our software offerings that focus on this, such as with Unity, QueryGrid and Listener that help connect and manage the ecosystem, and with Aster, that helps to extract value from the data. 
Fourth, our value-added services and solutions represent a critical strategic vector, driving revenues by themselves but more importantly, service is a key enabler and differentiator for all of our revenue-generating initiatives. In this area, we have a strong foundation for building repeatable solutions with our logical data models, business improvement opportunities and use cases. We've had good success with these today, such as with use cases to help penetrate the manufacturing industry with predictive parts failures, preventive maintenance and warranty solutions. These types of use cases save customers tens of millions of dollars annually, and we are investing to create more of them. Many of these repeatable solutions will contain IP, such as with our Teradata Analytics for SAP solution. Some will be end-to-end turnkey applications, such as with our customer interaction management applications. The point is we need to invest systematically, capturing use cases and IP from engagements around the world and invest in packaging them for ease of delivery and implementation.
Turning to go-to-market, which is a central and critical element of our transformation. This has evolved from 1 initiative into 4, which are aligned and integrated with our 4 revenue-generating initiatives. We have the most work to do with our public cloud go-to-market and are in the early stages of developing our plan. We will continue to provide more details at a later date. We have already begun taking steps to optimize our go-to-market for on-premises data warehouse and analytic ecosystem, and we are exploring new ways to generate demand. 
Finally, we are making good progress with our cost transformation. This is critical to enable us to increase investments into our 4 key revenue-generating areas and into R&D. I'm excited by the steps we have already taken. The entire leadership team is committed to the success of our business transformation. Given the magnitude of transformational change across the company, we have created a transformation team, which is led by John Denning, one of my direct reports. Additionally, we are committed to add more outside talent to our team to address these key initiatives. As we execute our transformation, new metrics will be added to help you track our success. We will be providing more details regarding Teradata's transformation and longer-term financial outlook at our Analyst Day later this summer. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve, who will provide more detail on our Q4 and full year results and our 2016 guidance. Steve?"

Teradata is establishing a solid transformational foundation for the future, while also focused on delivering near-term results. Our team has embraced our strategic initiatives, including cost optimization, organization talent initiatives and our go-to-market enhancements. During my discussion today, except where otherwise noted, I'll be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and other special items, including the goodwill impairment charges taken in the second and the fourth quarters. 
Product gross margin in the fourth quarter was 57.5% compared to last year's Q4 product margin of 60 -- 65.8%. The primary drivers of the change were deal mix, including sizable floor sweeps, increasing capacity and demand and a greater mix of larger customers and currency. For the full year, product gross margin was 59.9% compared to 65.2% in 2014. The lower margin in 2015 was primarily due to deal mix, including pricing programs that make it easier to buy Teradata and the currency impact. Services gross margin in the quarter was 47.9%, down from the 48.9% in Q4 2014. Services gross margin for the full year was 46.4% compared to 47.6% in 2014. The decrease for the period was primarily due to investments to support demand creation in our big data consulting practice. Overall, gross margin was 52.2% in the fourth quarter versus 56.9% in the fourth quarter 2014. For the full year, gross margin was 52% compared to 55.5% in 2014. 
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $194 million was $4 million lower than the fourth quarter 2014. For the full year, SG&A was $708 million, a 1% decrease from the 2014 level. Research and development expense in the quarter was $47 million, down $1 million from the fourth quarter 2014. For the year, R&D increased 11% to $199 million. The increase was related to our growth initiatives, although the increase was not as much as we had planned when we began the year. As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 18.6% versus the 24.6% in Q4 2014. For the full year, operating margin was 16% versus 22.7% in 2014. Teradata's non-GAAP tax rate was 28.8% as compared to 25.1% in 2014. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by a fourth quarter catch-up due to the proportion of actual foreign pretax earnings in 2015 being lower than what we had previously forecasted. For the full year, 2015 non-GAAP tax rate was 27.5% as compared to the 27.2% for 2014. 
Looking forward for 2016, we expect the GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 26%, excluding the taxes impact from the pending sale of our Marketing Applications business. The non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 27.5% and will not be impacted by the Marketing Applications disposition. However, both tax rates are heavily dependent upon our actual earnings mix. 
Turning to our cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $31 million in Q4 2015 compared to $97 million in the fourth quarter 2014. In addition to the impact of lower net income, the lower cash flow performance was primarily due to abnormally high level of collections of accounts receivable in the fourth quarter 2014, which improved the 2014 full year cash flow by approximately $100 million, but then correspondingly reduced the full year 2015 cash flow by the same amount. Free cash flow for the full year 2015 was $281 million versus the $551 million in 2014. Again, the year-over-year change was negatively impacted by lower net income and the early collection of approximately $100 million receivables in Q4 2014. Going forward, due to the expected differences between free cash flow and net income, such as stock-based compensation and other acquired intangible amortization, we expect full year free cash flow to be up approximately $50 million higher or be up to $50 million higher than GAAP net income. 
Our balance sheet. We had $839 million of cash as of December 31, 2015. More than 95% is held offshore. In Q4, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares of stock for approximately $99 million. In 2015, we repurchased approximately 19 million shares for $647 million. To fund a portion of these share repurchases, we drew down $180 million of our $400 million credit facility as of December 31. As of December 31, 2015, we have approximately $573 million of share repurchases -- repurchase authorization remaining. Additionally, we have used $50 million to repurchase approximately 2.2 million shares in 2016. As of February 3, 2016, we have approximately 523 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. As previously mentioned, a majority of the Marketing Applications business will be sold. As a result, we had made balance sheet adjustments to the assets held for sale and the liabilities held for sale to reflect the most current fair value. Future adjustments to these estimates may be necessary as the sale of the business is not completed. The following balance sheet commentary includes the Marketing Applications business that we expect to exit. 
Accounts receivable was consistent between December 31, 2015, and 2014 and up 5% in constant currency. Day sales outstanding was 89 days as of December 31, 2015, compared to 83 days as of December 31, 2014. Total deferred revenue was $413 million as of 12/31/15, which was up $25 million from December 31, 2014 or up 10% in constant currency. As I transition into guidance, I want to highlight a few items. As Mike said, we are making good progress in the exit of our Marketing Applications business and currently plan to complete the sale of that business around the end of the first quarter. For 2016, we'll provide you with a non-GAAP view of our results that excludes the Marketing Applications business. To give you an idea of the size and operating income impact of the Marketing Applications business we expect to exit in 2016, excluding the portion we will retain in 2015, we have approximately $115 million of revenue and an operating loss of approximately $45 million, which translated to a loss per share of approximately $0.23 in 2015. 
In terms of revenue guidance for 2016. Based on the exchange rates at the end of January and including approximately $40 million of revenue from the Marketing Applications business in the first quarter 2016, but no revenue contribution from the Marketing Applications business remaining -- for the remaining 3 quarters of the year, our GAAP revenue is expected to be in the approximate range of $2.315 billion to $2.360 billion, down 7% to 8% year-over-year or down 5% to 7% in constant currency. Excluding the anticipated Marketing Applications revenue from Q1 2016, we expect non-GAAP revenue to be down 8% to 10%, down 6% to 8% in constant currency. This translates into a full year revenue in the approximate range of $2.275 billion to $2.320 billion. For the comparison purposes, when the Marketing Applications business is excluded for both 2015 and 2016, revenue expected to be down 2% to 4% reported or flat or down 2% in constant currency. 
In terms of EPS, including the expected Q1 results of Marketing Applications business, but excluding any potential tax impact from the sale of the Marketing Applications business, we expect full year 2016 GAAP EPS in the range of $1.68 to $1.83 range. Excluding the Q1 results from the Marketing Applications business, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the $2.35 to $2.50 range. 
Other specific items impacting our 2016 guidance include: We are on track for the cost reduction of approximately $70 million in 2016. As a reminder, last quarter we estimated we'd be able to lower our cost exclusive of exiting the Marketing Applications business by approximately $80 million to $100 million over the 2016 to 2017 time frame with approximately $70 million of the reduction in cost realized in 2016 and the remainder in 2017. We expect product gross margin expectations to be consistent with 2015 and services gross margin forecast expected to improve slightly. 
Consistent with what we said during the third quarter earnings call, the cost savings in 2016 will be somewhat offset by increased variable compensation cost in 2016 due to Teradata not achieving our incentive compensation targets in 2015, but we would assume we will achieve the targets in 2016, thereby creating a year-over-year increase in incentive compensation of approximately $30 million. We also referenced an approximately $10 million increase in overall salary expense for performance increases spread across the total employee base, which is also included in our guidance. Netting these items, we expect a net benefit approximately $30 million in 2016 operating income specifically due to the cost rationalization work we have underway. 
Weighted average shares outstanding for the full year is expected to approximate $132 million with a similar number of shares expected for Q1. And finally, specifically as it relates to Q1 2016, we expect to start Q1 very slowly from a non-GAAP revenue perspective due to our international regime facing an approximate 5-point currency headwind and also comparing against the 7% constant-currency growth into Q1 2015, and we also expect that the significant realignment of our U.S. sales force related to our strategic go-to-market initiatives may create some disruption of productivity in the first part of 2016. 
In closing, Teradata is strategically focused on transitioning back to meaningful growth, and we made significant progress since our last earnings call. More specifically, we are in the process of exiting the Marketing Applications business. We expect to achieve our cost-reduction initiatives. However, there's transition elements of our cost-reduction initiatives that span 2016 and 2017. We have begun the process of strengthening our talent to better align our organization with our strategic initiatives. We have realigned our sales model in the Americas to increase our sales productivity and lower our overall sales cost. And last, we have dedicated team of internal functional leaders, led by a well-respected direct report to Mike, our CEO, in place to drive our transformation. Our transformation is far from complete, but I'm excited about the progress we have made. The team is energized on leveraging our technological and consulting strengths to reignite our growth engine. We have a lot of work streams in process and look forward to providing you more detailed information relating to our initiatives later this summer. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

And it's not just for data warehousing. It gets into the analytic ecosystem, our big data solutions and everything else, which all drives revenue. I think the common theme on the product revenue that's happened over the last couple years is the customer wins keep going up, and they're at a very high rate, but most of the customers tend to buy in smaller increments and start in smaller increments, and that's been the most recent trend that impacts product revenue. So if you look at the average dollar size for new customer wins, it's gone down. The customers are starting in smaller increments. And then in the user base, that all the customers continue to buy Teradata, but in smaller increments and less floor sweeps. So absent of change, which we're trying to drive change in how do we do business as it relates to our core data warehouse and our product revenue, absent of change, it would take some of those dynamics to change, and we're not counting on the way customers are buying and what the customers prefer.

Through there, you can have VPAs, you can get ELAs, again all these items make it easier for the customers to consume. We saw that impact positive and constructively through in Q4, but it did have an impact in our product gross margin in Q4. With that being said, let me just kind of reset. We finished the year 59.9%, but there is about 200 basis points for FX and FAS 86 impact. So it's really 62% versus 65% for the year in '15 over '14. We expect 2016, with these programs, 2016 probably closer to approximate 2015 and going from there. So we're expecting these programs to be in place in '16 and having overall product gross margin in that range of '15. So that's giving me a little bit -- some -- a little bit conservative on it that we have another 200 basis points of, may be, movement in that product side. On the services side, yes, 2015, we continue to invest, particularly in our Think Big big data, and building out the bench strength and building out the team to take advantage of that, and that -- those costs as you're building out become expense through services.

Our sales specialists and our go-to-market in compensation, no meaningful change there. We'll continue to evolve our go-to-market where we're in the early stages, but that's basically the net-net as we look at Q1.

Before Steve discusses our first quarter results, I want to take a few minutes to talk about today's announcement regarding my election as President and Chief Executive Officer of Teradata. The board felt that now is the right time for a change in leadership as we transform Teradata for long-term growth and shareholder value creation. that the board has used me for this role as you may know, I have been a member of Teradata's board since 2007, and during that time, I have gained an intimate knowledge of Teradata and how we will win in the marketplace. 
Throughout the course of my career, I have been involved in many successful organizations, and I plan to bring that experience to bear with me in this new role. Over the years, I've also developed a deep understanding of leadership, teambuilding, business transformation and the importance of team commitment and success. Given my age, it's clear that I am not going to be the CEO of Teradata over the long run, but I want to assure you that I have no intention of being a caretaker either. 
I plan to focus on the following key areas during my time here. First, we're going to continue and accelerate our transformation efforts. We are off to a great start, but I believe that our team is anxious to focus their efforts and to move faster. This will be my job to make sure that they get what they need to make this happen. Second, with our management team, I intend to focus on areas to improve our current operations. My belief is that we can maintain a proper cost focus but we need to ensure that, that is not coming at the expense of profitable revenue growth. Further, it's important as Teradata's transformation is to our long-term strategy, our current success is driven by who we are today, and we have to get that right. 
I will also focus on the change in our culture to instill a sense of urgency and accountability. We have great people, and we need to unleash their full potential. And finally and very importantly, I will lead the effort on behalf of the Board of Directors to ensure a strong leadership team. I expect to be fully engaged in this as soon as I, along with the board, have properly assessed the skills, personality and experience required to lead the company forward. While I don't have an exact time frame, I hope to give the board an initial assessment at our next meeting, which will happen in about 90 days. 
I'm highly energized because I believe the steps that Teradata has taken affirm that the transformation, our technology and the talent that our team has are right to move us forward. We need to focus the process to ensure timely and positive results by leveraging Teradata's clear and continued technology leadership and the support of our talented team, we will evolve and optimize our go-to-market strategy to align the changes and how our customers are purchasing and deploying technology. 
We will and create a hard-charging culture and there's no time to waste. All actions are intended to provide a better value for our customers, which will naturally lead to increased shareholder value. Teradata has an obligation to do everything that we can to deliver greater returns to our shareholders, and that is both near-term and long term as well, and we intend to do just that. I look forward to speaking to as many of you as possible in the coming weeks and months ahead. With that, where here to talk about the first quarter earnings, so I'm going to turn the call back over to Steve for that discussion."

Before I discuss the results of the quarter, I want to briefly summarize our pending sale of the Marketing Applications business. On April 22, we signed a definitive agreement to sell the business for approximately $90 million, subject to customary adjustments. We expect the transaction to close around June 30. The agreed-upon price was the result of a very active process involving multiple bidders. Although price was below what we had earlier anticipated, agreeing to proceed at this price was our best option, given our overall objective of the business, so that we can focus solely on the transforming of the core Teradata business with all of our resources and talent. 
We expect approximately $55 million to $60 million of net proceeds after adjustments, selling costs and taxes. To provide more transparency and to enable you to see the Marketing Applications business separately in 2016 since we no longer consider this business core to our ongoing operations, we've added a column showing the Marketing Applications business in our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables that we provide on our website. As such, my comments regarding margins, expenses and EPS will reflect our non-GAAP results excluding the Marketing Applications business in 2016 as well as stock-based compensation, third-party transformational costs and other special items, including the impairment of goodwill and other assets. 
Now turning to the first quarter results. Teradata delivered total revenue in Q1 of $545 million, which was down 6% as reported and down 4% in constant currency. Excluding the Marketing Applications business, revenue was $511 million, which also was down 6% as reported and down 4% in constant currency. In total, product revenue was down 20% as reported, down 18% in constant currency, while services revenue was up 3% as reported, up 5% in constant currency. 
Within services, consulting revenue was up 4% as reported, up 6% in constant currency, and maintenance revenue is up 2% as reported and up 4% in constant currency. 
Overall growth for consulting was driven by double-digit growth in international, 11%. During the quarter, we expanded our Think Big consulting unit into China, bringing new data consulting capabilities to the Chinese market. Overall, big data consulting grew double digits, and we also saw good growth in BI consulting in the Americas in the quarter. 
Turning to the regions. The Americas decreased 12% as reported, down 11% in constant currency. In Q1, as part of our cost rationalization initiatives, the Americas region underwent a substantial realignment of salespeople to new accounts, which caused a short-term, yet significant disruption to sales. Although it's difficult to quantify, this had a negative impact on America's revenue in Q1. However, we believe we should have this disruption behind us by midyear. 
Within customer accounts, we continue to see companies move away from large CapEx purchases. At the same time, there's increased interest in turn-based pricing alternatives and cloud offerings, which we are addressing in our business transformation initiatives. Our international region performed better with Q1 increasing 4% as reported and 7% in constant currency. Within international, EMEA revenue increased 3% as reported and 6% in constant currency. While APJ revenue increased 8% as reported and 11% in constant currency. 
Product gross margin in the first quarter improved to 59.6% from 56.4% in the first quarter of 2015, the improvement in product gross margin was largely due to favorable deal mix and product mix. Services gross margin in the quarter was 46.1%, an increase from 44.3% in Q1 2015. Services margin improved due to improved consulting margins as well as the exclusion of Marketing Applications business in 2016. As a result, overall gross margin was 51.1% in the quarter in Q1, compared to 49.3% in the first quarter of 2015. 
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $131 million was $39 million or 23% lower than the first quarter of 2015 as reported. Largely due to our cost reduction initiatives and the exclusion of the Marketing Applications business. Research and development expense in the quarter was $38 million, which was $18 million or 32% lower than the first quarter of 2015, about half the reduction was due to the exclusion of the Marketing Applications business. For the full year we anticipate R&D expenses to decrease approximately 10% to 15% on an as reported basis even though we expect R&D expense to be down 25% in the first half as we begin to see R&D expense increase in the second half due to our transformational initiatives. 
As a result of the higher product and services gross margin, the lower SG&A and R&D expense and the exit of the Marketing Applications business, operating margin in the first quarter was 18%, compared to 10.5% in Q1 2015. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 30.3% versus 27.9% in the same period in 2015, the higher tax rate was primarily driven by the timing of non-GAAP adjustments, which a higher proportion of call-out items falling in Q1 2016. 
On an annual basis, we expect our full year 2016 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27.5%. On a GAAP basis, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 34.5%, which includes the estimated discrete tax impact related to the sale of the Marketing Applications business. Both the effective tax rates are heavily dependent on our actual earnings mix for the full year. 
In terms of earnings per share, we reported GAAP EPS loss of $0.36 versus $0.15 of EPS in 2015. The large loss was largely due to the impairment charge, adjusting for the impairment charge, stock-based comp and other special items, which equated to $108 million of net income or $0.83 per share in the first quarter of 2016, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.47, compared to $0.30 in Q1 2015. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $251 million in Q1 2016, which was $29 million or 13% higher than the $222 million generated in the first quarter of 2015. After $26 million of capital expenditures versus $32 million in the first quarter 2015, we generated $225 million of free cash flow versus the $190 million of free cash flow generated in Q1 of 2015. The increase of free cash flow in the Q1 2016 versus Q1 2015 was primarily result timing of working capital items. 
For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of equal to, to $50 million higher than GAAP net income, which includes the impact of cash flow from all anticipated cash severance payments required to be made in 2016 in connection with our transformation initiatives. During Q1, we repurchased 2 million shares for approximately $47 million. As of March 31, the 16, we had $528 million of remaining authorization in our open-market share repurchase program. As March 31, 2016, we had total debt of $673 million, $80 million on our revolver and $593 million on the term loan. In addition to the $47 million of cash used for share repurchases in Q1, we also used $100 million of domestic cash generation to pay down our revolver.
Now turning to guidance for the full year. In Q1, we generally saw revenue in line with Street expectations. However, we saw about 1 point less currency headwind that we previously expected and we continue to see some deals deferred in the first quarter due to customer budget issues. Although we expect Q1 deferrals to close in Q2, we also see a couple of larger transactions in Q2 that are likely to rollout in the quarter. As a result of these anticipated rolling deferrals, we feel it's prudent to adjust our full year revenue guidance range. 
We expect full year revenue, excluding the Marketing Applications business, may be down 2% to 5%, as reported. We no longer anticipate any currency impact in Q2 or for the full year. We continue to expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the $2.35 to $2.50 range. Specifically for Q2, we anticipate that revenue, excluding the Marketing Applications business, will be in the $550 million to $560 million range. We estimate that SG&A may be down approximately 22% and R&D may be down approximately 20% from Q2 2015 as reported. This could result in non-GAAP EPS, excluding the Marketing Applications business being approximately $0.60 in Q2. 
Now let me briefly talk about our transformation that we are undertaking to evolve with the changing market environment. While the shifts in the market and the way our customers buy and deploy technology have challenged our overall results, we are making progress in our business transformation. The need for Data and Analytics remains a top priority, and we are seeing that a majority of the companies want a proven partner to help them, one who offers end-to-end solutions and delivers real business value in a seamless and pragmatic way. 
In Q1, we continue to execute against the transformation roadmap to address this need and I also want to highlight 2 top priority areas of progress: our cloud-based analytical ecosystem and our analytics solution initiatives. With our cloud initiative, we are delivering a high-grade analytical ecosystem, building on our strengths in on-premise analytical technology and consulting, and we are taking these superior capabilities into the cloud. This addresses customers' increasing requirements for computing environment that spans on-premise, managed cloud and public cloud solutions. Our overall objective with this initiative is to allow seamless integration across environments and to provide the expertise to help customers successfully architect, implement and manage their hybrid cloud analytical ecosystems. We believe this broadens our market opportunities. 
This cloud initiative is well under way. We have a vision, we are hiring strong cloud talent, and we continue to broaden our portfolio of cloud solutions. Concurrently, we are refining our go-to-market strategy, especially for the public cloud. 
Turning to our analytics solutions initiative. Here we truly distinguish Teradata and become a dramatically different company in the eyes of our customers. Teradata's well known for helping our customers derive significant value from their data. Our analytics solutions initiative will accelerate that value by providing a broader range of business users with pre-packaged solutions to leverage Data and Analytics to address their most pressing challenges. Through our more consulting-led approach, we are elevating our intellectual property into a more productized and repeatable solution. By combining multi-genre analytics with integrated data at scale, our solutions will focus on delivering new levels of business insights. For example, our new communications compliance analytics solution, developed in collaboration with a leading financial institution, we combine best practice compliance models and advanced analytics into an end-to-end solution that automatically detects suspect material in digital communications. 
Communications and compliance is extremely important for financial services institutions, health care providers and government organizations. Our analytics solutions will broaden our market opportunity by more directly addressing the needs of our business users. Now I'll turn the call over to Oliver who will highlight progress from an R&D perspective."

Before I get into some of the great progress we've made this year, I would like to talk about how we are approaching our technology innovation. We work closely with our leading customers, top executives and their teams, both on t",640,"Good morning, everyone. Before I get into some of the great progress we've made this year, I would like to talk about how we are approaching our technology innovation. 
We work closely with our leading customers, top executives and their teams, both on the IT and business sides. Through these relationships, we understand their business opportunities, the challenges they are facing and the key technologies they are exploring. Leveraging and expanding our top talent with relevant expertise in these technology areas and employing agile development methodologies, we deliver the right solutions to meet the needs of our customers. 
We have been able to and will continue to accelerate these solutions through increased focus in key investment areas as part of our transformation. Now I would like to highlight 3 major milestones in the last quarter. First, cloud. Second, in Teleflex [ph], and third, Big data services. 
First, let's talk about cloud. We delivered on our commitments to make Teradata available on AWS by the end of Q1. The initial offering includes the Teradata database and the associated tools. We also released a portfolio of public cloud consulting and managed services. The response has been very positive, especially when we demonstrated that using equivalent configurations, Teradata on AWS has 145x the throughput for mixed compared to the main competing cloud database. As another example, the product [indiscernible] runs in 12 minutes on Teradata on AWS versus more than 24 hours for the alternative, which is a 123x improvement. Customers love the Teradata on AWS is not a slimmed down version for the cloud. It is the same powerful Teradata database that is available on all platforms. This is a core element of our cloud differentiation. The solutions built on Teradata are fully portable across the range of architecture environments, public clouds, managed cloud and on-premises. 
Our Teradata on AWS launch is just that of the iceberg. We have accelerated our planned delivery of the MPP scale-out version of Teradata on public cloud, now targeted for year-end. 
Turning to our managed cloud offering. We are building upon our success in the Americas, and we recently announced European availability in the second half of the year, bringing greater choice to more customers worldwide. 
Next, I would like to talk about our recent announcements of Teradata IntelliFlex, our next-generation platform for on-premises data warehousing. In the on-premises environment, just like in the cloud, customers are looking for more flexibility in how they can seamlessly grow their Teradata environments while maintaining mission-critical availability. IntelliFlex allows customers to add storage and processing power independently so they can scale their systems in smaller increments, which makes Teradata easier to purchase, in line with business needs. Important new features include up to 3x more memory and the ability to double the size in just 1 hour with a simple database restart. 
Early customer interest for IntelliFlex is trying, and it will be available for shipping in Q3. 
Finally, I'd like to talk about our new Big Data consulting announcements. To expand the ways we support our customers' analytical ecosystem environments, we announced new consulting services from Think Big for enterprise data link design and deployment. These new services help customers accelerate time to value and remove risks from the data link implementations. Additionally, many organizations are experimenting to leverage spark as an engine for product recommendations, predictive analytics, central data analysis and analytics amongst others. To address this, we have introduced new consulting services to help customers incorporate apache spark into their big data environments. 
Let me wrap up by saying I'm truly excited by the progress we have made. With our renewed focus, sharpened by our transformation and the accelerated pace, we will rapidly advance Teradata's leadership position and the exceptional business value we bring to our customers. And now I'll turn the call back to Steve."

This is Vic, and I go by Vic, actually, but I put Victor because if I don't I end up Richard or Dick or something like that. So that is a very good question. And so the first thing that I would say to all of you that I've been here 9 hours and actually longing but on the board for a long time. So the detail is exactly what we're going to do, but there's a lot of effort that's going to be put in to the question you asked. I wouldn't say that, at this point in time, I think we have a need for a change in strategy. But I do think we have a need for a couple of things, and that, one, would be that we got to move faster. As a board, we are enthusiastic about what our transformational process has brought there. But one of the things that we've learned in that is that we have a lot of side load businesses. So for instance, we've got Think Big and then we've got Teradata labs and [indiscernible]. We need to focus everything we learned from that to make sure we have a laser focused on what our customers want, how we can deliver it and make sure that the customer knows that there is one Teradata and not 5. So I think the things that we have to work on are, clearly, we have to be more focused and more -- and we have to have a lot more speed in our strategy. And I'm thrilled with the people we've got. I'm thrilled with their enthusiasm, and so I think building momentum for the team, given them some leadership, telling them we're going to move fast and go forward is going to be my primary objective. Now if we find something in that process, we are certainly going to change, but I have an old saying. I worked for a colonel in Vietnam, who is a great guy, and he had a saying, ""If you want it bad, that's mostly how you get it."" And we have to thoughtful and careful about how we go, but we do not have to be slow, those 2 things don't necessarily go together. And so we will update you as time goes forward. I will be open and honest with you guys about what we see. But right now, I'm not here because we think we're on a crash course. I'm here because we want to get focused and we want to get faster. We have a great team here, and I'm enthusiastic about it. So I guess, that would be the best way I could answer that. We are, as a board, probably you should know how we got here. We've been through this process. As you all know, the board has 2 primary responsibilities. One is to ensure proper leadership of the corporation, and the second one is the create shareholder value. And our board is totally focused on those things. We have been about this in the process. I think we have been a bit of a pusher and a shover in this transformational effort to see we get there. So I think the board is up to speed and tuned in. We want to make sure that the process on leadership is thoughtful and careful. As I said in my opening remarks, I'm going to take 90 days and figure that out, and then we'll start working down that process. It is going to take a bit of time to get that done, I can't tell you exactly how long. But we will get it done, and we will drive our transformation forward. I think it's important for you to know that I'm not going to be a caretaker, but a 68 -year-old guy sets here and look at the world go by. We're going to get after some stuff. I'm enthusiastic and passionate about where we are, and I have a great confidence in the team at Teradata in what we're doing. So hopefully, that's an answer to your question."

So I'm still looking forward to that and you can see the numbers that I shared for Q2 on the revenue side, between 550 and 560.

We have talked about it as a board, but we think there's a lot of opportunity here that can be generated near term and long term. And part the question is always every situation is unique, right? But to a certain degree, to think that you have to be private to do what you need to do means that, one, you either don't understand your issues, you're afraid to take them on or you don't think you can create value for your shareholders. And I think where we are today, we believe we can do all of those things as a public company. So I guess the best answer is the board at the current time feels this is the best way to generate shareholder value. I'm enthusiastic about that, I believe we can do that. And so, that's the best way I can answer that question. The board believes this is the best way to create shareholder value over the appropriate period of time for our shareholders. Obviously, I'm not entrenched, I'm not going to be here, I'm not trying to hold the job for 15 years. I'm not looking after self interest.

But saying that, we still see that large capital transactions can have a difficult time getting through an organization.

So what we've been doing is working throughout the organization with all the business units and identifying the activities, the drivers of our costs. And you're looking at where we add value with those costs throughout the organization. And the costs are not just challenge within the silo, the cost reduction activities are all brought up to the leadership levels, so we understand the puts and the takes. We understand what could be at risk if we take these reductions or make these -- take these actions. So we're constantly balancing to drive the overall comment that Vic is making there, make sure we have the right infrastructure -- the right structure, processes, activities to continue to drive short-term and long-term revenue, particularly being led by product. So we continue to look at internally how we're going to take out additional costs to fund more investments in those transformational roadmaps.

But we'll still have a very strong solid on-premise perpetual model. So yes, what we're looking at doing is to provide you more clarity, more transparency in that model as we go and bring an Analyst Day to you guys. To really give you clarity or transparency, Karl, into where we think that, that model will be in 3 years. But we're not looking for a significant revolution from the adoption of subscription model where you see some companies have gone out within 2.5 years and into entirely subscription.

I'm going to take 90 days and kind of figure out the organization here, and then we'll have a board meeting and we will start that process. Hopefully, at that point in time, it will take however long it takes to get that going, we're going to look inside and outside to do that. As it relates to my actual milestones, I've got a couple of things and some are absolutely we can put numbers on and some we can't. But in -- just in the few days I've been around here and doing stuff, my #1one priority and hope, and I believe that it's going to be true, is I want to energize our base. Organizations, one of the things I learned over my life, and while I was younger it took me a while to believe this, but organizations love to be led, they love to have clarity and they love to have focus. And I think that unleashes more than anyone can imagine. And so the first thing I want to do is to energize this space, make sure that they all realize how great this company is and that they're pushing forward, they support of where we're going, and they have a belief in our future. So that is the #1 thing I'm going to do. #2, I want to get our sales effort very focused in the near term. I want to make sure that we are organized with the right people in the right place to drive our near-term revenue. As great as our transformation is, and we want to look at that. As you're seeing everywhere. You look at IBM, and you look S&P, you can look at Oracle, when you undertake changes and you have been around a while, it takes a while to transform your revenue base. And so as important as our transformation is to us, our near-term success and future for our shareholders is based on who we are today. And I got to make sure that's right and I will make sure that's right. And so those are the 2 primary things I'm going to work on there. And then the third thing is just to make sure that we really truly assess what does this organization need as a leader going forward. I mean what amount of tech, what amount of leadership skills, what amount of customer [indiscernible]. How important are all of those things going forward? So as you all know, maybe you don't know, but as a board member, you get a perspective of an organization, primarily from the Chief Executive Officer, right? And that's their view, we all have our biases, we have what we have. But my role here will be to come in and to try and gain a fresh look at that and help our board understand what that looks like so that we can go forward. So if I can accomplish those 3 things and make sure that our transformation gets the funding that it wants, that it needs and that the people that are leading the transformation know how important they are, and that they have license to get on and get it done. Those are the things I'm going to focus on. And they're all big issues, but I've got a lot of energy, I'm enthused about this, I believe in it. And so that's what I'm going to be focusing on. Next quarter, I will give you an update on all 4 of those things. I'll be honest with you about where we're going and how I feel about that. But those are the things I'm going to be focused on. The organization is going to be focused on all the things that Steve has been talking to you about, those are all important. We have a lot of good people running this business, and they don't need me to be down day-to-day, what they're doing. But we will move forward, and actually, I think you'll find that Teradata will actually become a tech company. We'll start acting like one, behaving like one. We'll have a speed of a tech company. We need to do all those things. And so that's what I'm going to be focused on."

In fact, a lot of executives are very excited about the extra opportunities that cloud deployment models give them, right? Because a lot of executives around the world are facing new business challenges and need to react very quick and very agile steps, right? And cloud gives them the ability to spin up new sandboxes, new capabilities very, very quickly even though they are not convinced in the long run that they want to use them, right? And so cloud takes that barrier away and allows companies to act in a much more agile, smaller steps, doing that. So it's very much a complementary thing that we're seeing. I think it broadens our customer base, it broadens our appeal to companies who want to use our technology, right? In fact, we're seeing actually the inverse, right? We're seeing companies that have accelerated some of their on-premises investments because we now have cloud and software options for them available. Because again, it makes it much more as an offering within this company. And in regard to pricing, again, I challenge you, I mean, we have now Teradata pricing on AWS, it's public, out there on the marketplaces. It is priced right in line where we feel that the market is for that. I told you a little bit about the performance differentiation that we have that ultimately blows total cost of ownership totally out of the ballpark, I think for something like Teradata. And that's -- so we will focus on our core strengths. We will deliver performance, capability, concurrency at even on cloud platforms, and we see it as a great complement to our on-premises offerings."

Before we get started, I want to make sure everyone has seen the press release we issued this morning announcing that Teradata's Board of Directors has decided that it's the right time to change the leadership of the company, and Mike Koehler has stepped down as Teradata's CEO. Stepping in as CEO from Teradata's Board of Directors is Victor Lund. 
Before we discuss Teradata's first quarter results, Victor will offer a few thoughts on the leadership change as well as Teradata's future. Steve Scheppmann, Teradata's CFO, will then discuss our Q1 financial performance and our transformational initiatives.
Also joining our call today is Oliver Ratzesberger, President of Teradata Labs, who will provide more detail on some of our R&D advances. Our discussion today includes forecasts and other information that are considered forward-looking statements. While these statements reflect our current outlook, they are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially. These risk factors are described in Teradata's 10-K, 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.
On today's call, we will also be discussing certain non-GAAP financial information, which excludes such items as stock-based compensation expense, asset impairments, acquisition and reorganization costs, the results of the Marketing Applications business and other special items as well as other non-GAAP items such as free cash flow and constant currency revenue comparisons. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our reported GAAP results and other information concerning these measures is included in our earnings release and on the Investor page of Teradata's website. 
A replay of this conference call will also be available later today on our website. Teradata assumes no obligation to update or revise the information included in this conference call whether as a result of new information or future results.

The board felt that",633,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Before Steve discusses our first quarter results, I want to take a few minutes to talk about today's announcement regarding my election as President and Chief Executive Officer of Teradata. The board felt that now is the right time for a change in leadership as we transform Teradata for long-term growth and shareholder value creation. I'm honored that the board has chose me for this role. As you may know, I have been a member of Teradata's board since 2007, and during that time, I have gained an intimate knowledge of Teradata and how we will win in the marketplace. 
Throughout the course of my career, I have been involved in many successful organizations, and I plan to bring that experience to bear with me in this new role. Over the years, I've also developed a deep understanding of leadership, team building, business transformation and the importance of team commitment and success. Given my age, it's clear that I am not going to be the CEO of Teradata over the long run, but I want to assure you that I have no intention of being a caretaker either.
I plan to focus on the following key areas during my time here. First, we're going to continue and accelerate our transformation efforts. We are off to a great start, but I believe that our team is anxious to focus their efforts and to move faster. This will be my job to make sure that they give what they need to make this happen. 
Second, with our management team, I intend to focus on areas to improve our current operations. My belief is that we can maintain a proper cost focus, but we need to ensure that, that is not coming at the expense of profitable revenue growth. Further, as important as Teradata's transformation is to our long-term strategy, our current success is driven by who we are today, and we have to get that right. 
I will also focus on the change in our culture to instill a sense of urgency and accountability. We have great people, and we need to unleash their full potential. And finally and very importantly, I will lead the effort on behalf of the Board of Directors to ensure a strong leadership team. I expect to be fully engaged in this as soon as I, along with the board, have properly assessed the skills, personality and experience required to lead the company forward. While I don't have an exact time frame, I hope to give the board an initial assessment at our next meeting, which will happen in about 90 days. 
I'm highly energized because I believe the steps that Teradata has taken affirm that the transformation, our technology and the talent that our team has are right to move us forward. We need to focus the process to ensure timely and positive results by leveraging Teradata's clear and continued technology leadership and the support of our talented team. We will evolve and optimize our go-to-market strategy to align the changes and how our customers are purchasing and deploying technology. 
We will create a hard-charging culture, and there is no time to waste. All actions are intended to provide a better value to our customers, which will naturally lead to increased shareholder value. Teradata has an obligation to do everything that we can to deliver greater returns to our shareholders, and that is both near term and long term as well, and we intend to do just that. I look forward to speaking to as many of you as possible in the coming weeks and months ahead. 
With that, we're here to talk about the first quarter earnings, so I'm going to turn the call back over to Steve for that discussion."
97999,331354466,974237,"Teradata Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Teradata Corporation","Executives","Victor, thank you, and good morning. Before I discuss the results of the quarter, I want to briefly summarize our pending sale of the Marketing Applications business. On April 22, we signed a definitive agreement to sell the business for approximately $90",1847,"Victor, thank you, and good morning. Before I discuss the results of the quarter, I want to briefly summarize our pending sale of the Marketing Applications business. On April 22, we signed a definitive agreement to sell the business for approximately $90 million, subject to customary adjustments. We expect the transaction to close around June 30. The agreed-upon price was the result of a very active process involving multiple bidders. Although price was below what we had earlier anticipated, agreeing to proceed at this price was our best option, given our overall objective to exit the business, so that we can focus solely on the transforming of the core Teradata business with all of our resources and talent.
We expect approximately $55 million to $60 million of net proceeds after adjustments, selling costs and taxes. To provide more transparency and to enable you to see the Marketing Applications business separately in 2016 since we no longer consider this business core to our ongoing operations, we've added the column on -- showing the Marketing Applications business in our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables that we provided on our website. As such, my comments regarding margins, expenses and EPS will reflect our non-GAAP results, excluding the Marketing Applications business in 2016 as well as stock-based compensation, third-party transformational costs and other special items, including the impairment of goodwill and other assets.
Now turning to the first quarter results. Teradata delivered total revenue in Q1 of $545 million, which was down 6% as reported and down 4% in constant currency. Excluding the Marketing Applications business, revenue was $511 million, which also was down 6% as reported and down 4% in constant currency. In total, product revenue was down 20% as reported, down 18% in constant currency, while services revenue was up 3% as reported, up 5% in constant currency.
Within services, consulting revenue was up 4% as reported, up 6% in constant currency, and maintenance revenue is up 2% as reported and up 4% in constant currency. 
Overall growth for consulting was driven by double-digit growth in international, 11%. During the quarter, we expanded our Think Big consulting unit into China, bringing new data consulting capabilities to the Chinese market. Overall, big data consulting grew double digits, and we also saw good growth in BI consulting in the Americas in the quarter. 
Turning to the regions. The Americas decreased 12% as reported, down 11% in constant currency. In Q1, as part of our cost rationalization initiatives, the Americas region underwent a substantial realignment of salespeople to new accounts, which caused a short-term, yet significant disruption to sales. Although it's difficult to quantify, this had a negative impact on America's revenue in Q1. However, we believe we should have this disruption behind us by midyear. 
Within customer accounts, we continue to see companies move away from large CapEx purchases. At the same time, there's increased interest in term-based pricing alternatives and cloud offerings, which we are addressing in our business transformation initiatives. Our international region performed better with Q1, increasing 4% as reported and 7% in constant currency. Within international, EMEA revenue increased 3% as reported and 6% in constant currency, while APJ revenue increased 8% as reported and 11% in constant currency. 
Product gross margin in the first quarter improved to 59.6% from 56.4% in the first quarter of 2015. The improvement in product gross margin was largely due to favorable deal mix and product mix. Services gross margin in the quarter was 46.1%, an increase from 44.3% in Q1 2015. Services margin improved due to improved consulting margins as well as the exclusion of Marketing Applications business in 2016. As a result, overall gross margin was 51.1% in the quarter in Q1, compared to 49.3% in the first quarter of 2015. 
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $131 million was $39 million or 23% lower than the first quarter of 2015 as reported, largely due to our cost reduction initiatives and the exclusion of the Marketing Applications business. Research and development expense in the quarter was $38 million, which was $18 million or 32% lower than the first quarter of 2015, about half the reduction was due to the exclusion of the Marketing Applications business. For the full year, we anticipate R&D expense to decrease approximately 10% to 15% on an as reported basis, even though we expect R&D expense to be down 25% in the first half as we begin to see R&D expense increase in the second half due to our transformational initiatives. 
As a result of the higher product and services gross margin, the lower SG&A and R&D expense and the exit of the Marketing Applications business, operating margin in the first quarter was 18% compared to 10.5% in Q1 2015. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 30.3% versus 27.9% in the same period in 2015. The higher tax rate was primarily driven by the timing of non-GAAP adjustments, which a higher proportion of call-out items falling in Q1 2016. 
On an annual basis, we expect our full year 2016 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27.5%. On a GAAP basis, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 34.5%, which includes the estimated discrete tax impact related to the sale of the Marketing Applications business. Both the effective tax rates are heavily dependent on our actual earnings mix for the full year. 
In terms of earnings per share, we reported GAAP EPS loss of $0.36 versus $0.15 of EPS in 2015. The large loss was largely due to the impairment charge. Adjusting for the impairment charge, stock-based comp and other special items, which equated to $108 million of net income or $0.83 per share in the first quarter of 2016, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.47 compared to $0.30 in Q1 2015. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $251 million in Q1 2016, which was $29 million or 13% higher than the $222 million generated in the first quarter of 2015. After $26 million of capital expenditures versus $32 million in the first quarter of 2015, we generated $225 million of free cash flow versus the $190 million of free cash flow generated in Q1 of 2015. The increase of free cash flow in the Q1 2016 versus Q1 2015 was primarily the result of the timing of working capital items. 
For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of equal to, to $50 million higher than GAAP net income, which includes the impact of cash flow from all anticipated cash severance payments required to be made in 2016 in connection with our transformation initiatives. During Q1, we repurchased 2 million shares for approximately $47 million. As of March 31, 2016, we had $528 million of remaining authorization in our open market share repurchase program. As of March 31, 2016, we had total debt of $673 million, $80 million on our revolver and $593 million on a term loan. In addition to the $47 million of cash used for share repurchases in Q1, we also used $100 million of the invested cash generation to pay down our revolver.
Now turning to guidance for the full year. In Q1, we generally saw revenue in line with Street expectations. However, we saw about one point less of currency headwind that we previously expected, and we continue to see some deals deferred in the first quarter due to customer budget issues. Although we expect Q1 deferrals to close in Q2, we also see a couple of larger transactions in Q2 that are likely to roll out in the quarter. As a result of these anticipated rolling deferrals, we feel it's prudent to adjust our full year revenue guidance range. 
We expect full year revenue, excluding the Marketing Applications business, may be down 2% to 5%, as reported. We no longer anticipate any currency impact in Q2 or for the full year. We continue to expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the $2.35 to $2.50 range. Specifically for Q2, we anticipate that revenue, excluding the Marketing Applications business, will be in the $550 million to $560 million range. We estimate that SG&A may be down approximately 22% and R&D may be down approximately 20% from Q2 2015 as reported. This could result in non-GAAP EPS, excluding the Marketing Applications business, being approximately $0.60 in Q2. 
Now let me briefly talk about our transformation that we are undertaking to evolve with the changing market environment. While the shifts in the market and the way that our customers buy and deploy technology have challenged our overall results, we are making progress in our business transformation. The need for Data and Analytics remains a top priority, and we are seeing that a majority of the companies wants a proven partner to help them, one who offers end-to-end solutions and delivers real business value in a seamless and pragmatic way. 
In Q1, we continue to execute against the transformation roadmap to address this need. And I also want to highlight 2 top priority areas of progress: our cloud-based analytical ecosystem and our analytics solutions initiatives. With our cloud initiative, we are delivering a high-grade analytical ecosystem, building on our strengths in on-premise analytical technology and consulting, and we are taking these superior capabilities into the cloud. This addresses customers' increasing requirements for computing environment that spans on-premise, managed cloud and public cloud solutions. Our overall objective with this initiative is to allow seamless integration across environments and to provide the expertise to help customers successfully architect, implement and manage their hybrid cloud analytical ecosystems. We believe this broadens our market opportunities. 
This cloud initiative is well under way. We have a vision, we are hiring strong cloud talent, and we continue to broaden our portfolio of cloud solutions. Concurrently, we are refining our go-to-market strategy, especially for the public cloud. 
Turning to our analytics solutions initiative. Here, we truly distinguish Teradata and become a dramatically different company in the eyes of our customers. Teradata is well-known for helping our customers derive significant value from their data. Our analytics solutions initiative will accelerate that value by providing a broader range of business users with pre-packaged solutions to leverage Data and Analytics to address their most pressing challenges. Through a more consulting-led approach, we are elevating our intellectual property into a more productized and repeatable solution. By combining multi-genre analytics with integrated data at scale, our solutions will focus on delivering new levels of business insights. For example, our new communications compliance analytics solution, developed in collaboration with a leading financial institution, we combined best practice compliance models and advanced analytics into an end-to-end solution that automatically detects suspect material in digital communications. 
Communications compliance is extremely important for financial services institutions, health care providers and government organizations. Our analytics solutions will broaden our market opportunity by more directly addressing the needs of our business units -- users. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Oliver, who will highlight progress from an R&D perspective."

Before I get into some of the great progress we've made this year, I would like to talk about how we are approaching our technology innovation.We work closely with our leading customers, top executives and their teams, both on th",640,"Good morning, everyone. Before I get into some of the great progress we've made this year, I would like to talk about how we are approaching our technology innovation.
We work closely with our leading customers, top executives and their teams, both on the IT and business sides. Through these relationships, we understand their business opportunities, the challenges they are facing and the key technologies they are exploring. By leveraging and expanding our top talent with relevant expertise in these technology areas and employing agile development methodologies, we deliver the right solutions to meet the needs of our customers. 
We have been able to and will continue to accelerate these solutions through increased focus in key investment areas as part of our transformation. Now I would like to highlight 3 major milestones in the last quarter. First, cloud; second, IntelliFlex; and third, Big Data services. 
First, let's talk about cloud. We delivered on our commitments to make Teradata available on AWS by the end of Q1. The initial offering includes the Teradata Database and associated tools. We also released a portfolio of public cloud consulting and managed services. The response has been very positive, especially when we demonstrated that using equivalent configurations, Teradata on AWS has 145x the throughput for mixed workload compared to the main competing cloud database. As another example, a product affinity query  runs in minutes on Teradata on AWS versus more than 24 hours for the alternative, which is a 123x improvement. Customers love that Teradata on AWS is not a slimmed down version for the cloud. It is the same powerful Teradata Database that is available on all platforms. This is a core element of our cloud differentiation. The solutions built on Teradata are fully portable across the entire range of architectural environments, public clouds, managed cloud and on-premises. 
Our Teradata on AWS launch is just the tip of the iceberg. We have accelerated our planned delivery of the MPP scale-out version of Teradata on public cloud, now targeted for year-end. 
Turning to our managed cloud offering. We are building upon our success in the Americas, and we recently announced European availability in the second half of the year, bringing greater choice to more customers worldwide. 
Next, I'd like to talk about our recent announcements of Teradata IntelliFlex, our next-generation platform for on-premises data warehousing. In the on-premises environment, just like in the cloud, customers are looking for more flexibility in how they can seamlessly grow their Teradata environments while maintaining mission-critical availability. IntelliFlex allows customers to add storage and processing power independently so they can scale their systems in smaller increments, which makes Teradata easier to purchase, in line with business needs. Important new features include up to 3x more memory and the ability to double the size in just 1 hour with a simple database restart. Early customer interest for IntelliFlex is strong, and it will be available for shipping in Q3. 
Finally, I'd like to talk about our new Big Data consulting announcements. To expand the ways we support our customers' analytical ecosystem environments, we announced new consulting services from Think Big for enterprise data-link design and deployment. These new services help customers accelerate time to value and remove risks from the data-link implementations. Additionally, many organizations are experimenting to leverage Spark as an engine for product recommendations, predictive analytics, central data analysis and graph analytics amongst others. To address this, we have introduced new consulting services to help customers incorporate apache spark into their big data environments. 
Let me wrap up by saying I'm truly excited by the progress we have made. With our renewed focus sharpened by our transformation and at the accelerated pace, we will rapidly advance Teradata's leadership position and the exceptional business value we bring to our customers. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Steve."

This is Vic, and I go by Vic, actually, but I put Victor because if I don't, I end up Richard or Dick or something like that. So that is a very good question. And so the first thing I would say to all of you, that I've been here 9 hours and actually, no longer, but on the board for a long time. So the details, exactly, what we're going to do haven't settled in on. But there's a lot of effort that's going to be put into the question you asked. I wouldn't say that, at this point in time, I think we have a need for a change in strategy. But I do think we have a need for a couple of things, and that, one, would be that we've got to move faster. As a board, we are enthusiastic about what our transformational process has brought there. But one of the things that we've learned in that is that we have a lot of siloed businesses. So for instance, we've got Think Big and then we've got Teradata Labs, and we're going with it, we  need to focus everything we learned from that to make sure we have a laser focus on what our customers want, how we can deliver it and make sure that the customer knows that there is one Teradata, and not 5. So I think the things that we have to work on are, clearly, we have to be more focused and more -- and we have to have a lot more speed in our strategy. And I'm thrilled with the people we've got. I'm thrilled with their enthusiasm, and so I think building momentum for the team, giving them some leadership, telling them we're going to move fast and go forward is going to be my primary objective. Now if we find something in that process, we are certainly going to change. But I have an old saying. I worked for a colonel in Vietnam, who's a great guy. And he had the saying, ""If you want it bad, that's mostly how you get it."" And we have to be thoughtful and careful about how we go about this, but we do not have to be slow, those 2 things don't necessarily go together. And so we will update you as time goes forward. I will be open and honest with you guys about what we see. But right now, I'm not here because we think we're on a crash course. I'm here because we want to get focused and we want to get faster. We have a great team here, and I'm enthusiastic about it. So I guess, that would be the best way I could answer that. We are, as a board, probably you should know how we got here. We've been through this process -- as you all know,  board has 2 primary responsibilities. One is to ensure proper leadership of a corporation, and the second one is the create shareholder value. And our board is totally focused on those things. We have been about this in the process. I think we have been a bit of a pusher and a shover in this transformational effort to see we get there. So I think the board is up to speed and tuned in. We want to make sure that the process on leadership is thoughtful and careful. As I said in my opening remarks, I'm going to take 90 days and figure that out, and then we'll start working down that process. It is going to take a bit of time to get that done. I can't tell you exactly how long, but we will get it done, and we will drive our transformation forward. I think it's important for you to know that I am not going to be a caretaker, I'm not a 68 -year-old guy getting sent here and look at the world go by. We're going to get after some stuff. I'm enthusiastic and passionate about where we are, and I have great confidence in the team at Teradata and what we're doing. So hopefully, that's an answer to your question."

One of the key obligations of the Board of Directors is to understand the creation of shareholder value. And in this process, we, as a board, are totally committed to seeing that we create value here. I've thought a lot about this. I knew this question was going to be asked. We have talked about it as a board, but we think there's a lot of opportunity here that can be generated near term and long term. And part the question is always every situation is unique, right? But to a certain degree, to think that you have to be private to do what you need to do means that, one, you either don't understand your issues, you're afraid to take them on, or you don't think you can create value for your shareholders. And I think where we are today, we believe we can do all of those things as a public company. So I guess the best answer is the board at the current time feels this is the best way to generate shareholder value. I'm enthusiastic about that. I believe we can do that. And so that's the best way I can answer that question. The board believes this is the best way to create shareholder value over the appropriate period of time for our shareholders. Obviously, I'm not entrenched, I'm not going to be here, I'm not trying to hold the job for 15 years, I'm not looking after self interest. But I want you to know that I really believe that we can create long-term and near-term shareholder value as we're going today."

You can stand up into our infrastructures in less than 30 minutes on cloud. And that really enables businesses to do things very differently. And having our technology, Teradata Database, the whole UDA ecosystem, as we call it, available in the cloud, I think is a great enabler. And the executives around the world, the CEOs that I talked to, they're just -- they all are excited about what that does to their business. And then there are things like sensorizing everything, right? IoT is obviously a big topic, and more and more data is being generated by devices around the world. And when you combine that with cloud and with scale-out models that a cloud enables us, there are very new ways of how industries are being reshaped, right?

I'm going to take 90 days and kind of figure out the organization here, and then we'll have a board meeting and we will start that process. Hopefully, at that point in time, it'll take -- however long it takes to get that going, we're going to look inside and outside, how we can do that. As it relates to my actual milestones, I've got a couple of things, and some are absolutely we can put numbers on and some we can't. But in -- just in the few days I've been around here and doing stuff, my #1 priority and hope, and I believe that it's going to be true, is I want to energize our base. Organizations, one of the things I've learned over my life, and when I was younger, it took me a while to believe this, but organizations love to be led, they love to have clarity and they love to have focus. And I think that unleashes more than anyone can imagine. And so the first thing I want to do is to energize this space, make sure that they all realize how great this company is and that they're pushing forward, they're supportive of where we're going, and they have a belief in our future. So that is the number one thing I'm going to do. Number two, I want to get our sales effort very focused in the near term. I want to make sure that we are organized with the right people in the right place to drive our near-term revenue. As great as our transformation is, and we want to look at that, as you're seeing everywhere, you can look at IBM, you can look at S&P, you can look at Oracle, when you undertake changes and you have been around a while, it takes a while to transform your revenue base. And so as important as our transformation is to us, our near-term success and future for our shareholders is based on who we are today, and I've got to make sure that's right, and I will make sure that's right. And so those are the 2 primary things I'm going to work on there. And then the third thing is just to make sure that we really truly assess what does this organization need as a leader going forward. I mean, what amount of tech, what amount of leadership skills, what amount of customer in-phase, how important are all of those things going forward? So as you all know, maybe you don't know, but as a board member, you get a perspective of an organization primarily from the Chief Executive Officer, right? And that's their view. We all have our biases, we have what we have. But my role here will be come in and to try and gain a fresh look at that and help our board understand what that looks like, so that we can go forward. So if I can accomplish those 3 things and make sure that our transformation gets the funding that it wants, that it needs and that the people that are leading the transformation know how important they are, and that they have license to get on and get it done. Those are the things I'm going to focus on. And they're all big issues, but I've got a lot of energy, I'm enthused about this, I believe in it, and so that's what I'm going to be focusing on. And next quarter, I will give you an update on all 4 of those things. I'll be honest with you about where we're going and how I feel about that. But those are the things I'm going to be focused on. The organization is going to be focused on all the things that Steve has been talking to you about, those are all important. We have a lot of good people running this business, and they don't need me to be down day-to-day, I'm not going to be around in what they're doing. But we will move forward. And actually, I think you will find that Teradata will actually become a tech company. We'll start acting like one, behaving like one. We'll have the speed of a tech company. We need to do all those things. And so that's what I'm going to be focusing on."

We do not see cannibalization in that. In fact, a lot of executives are very excited about the extra opportunities that cloud deployment models give them, right, because a lot of the executives around the world are facing new business challenges and need to react very quick and very -- in agile steps, right? And cloud gives them the ability to spin up new sandboxes, new capabilities very, very quickly even though they are not convinced in the long run that they want to use them, right? And so cloud takes that barrier away and allows companies to act in a much more agile, smaller steps, doing that. So it's very much a complementary thing that we are seeing. I think it broadens our customer base, it broadens our appeal to companies who want to use our technology, right? In fact, we're seeing, actually, the inverse, right? We're seeing companies that have accelerated some of their on-premises investments because we now have cloud and software options for them available. Because again, it makes it much more ubiquitous as an offering within these companies. And in regards to pricing, again, I challenge you, I mean, we have now Teradata pricing on AWS. It's public, out there on the marketplaces. It is priced right in line where we feel that the market is with that. I told you a little bit about the performance differentiation that we have, that ultimately blows total cost of ownership totally out of the ballpark, I think, for something like Teradata. And that's -- so we will focus on our core strengths. We will deliver performance, capability, concurrency even on cloud platforms, and we see that as great complements to our on-premises offerings."

Stepping in as CEO from Teradata's Board of Directors is Victor Lund. 
Before we discuss Teradata's first quarter results, Victor will offer a few thoughts on the leadership change as well as Teradata's future. Steve Scheppmann, Teradata's CFO, will then discuss our Q1 financial performance and our transformational initiatives.
Also joining our call today is Oliver Ratzesberger, President of Teradata Labs, who will provide more detail on some of our R&D advances. Our discussion today includes forecasts and other information that are considered forward-looking statements. While these statements reflect our current outlook, they are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially. These risk factors are described in Teradata's 10-K, 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.
On today's call, we will also be discussing certain non-GAAP financial information, which excludes such items as stock-based compensation expense, asset impairments, acquisition and reorganization costs, the results of the Marketing Applications business and other special items as well as other non-GAAP items such as free cash flow and constant currency revenue comparisons. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our reported GAAP results and other information concerning these measures is included in our earnings release and on the Investor page of Teradata's website. 
A replay of this conference call will also be available later today on our website.

Before Steve discusses our first quarter results, I want to take a few minutes to talk about today's announcement regarding my election as President and Chief Executive Officer of Teradata. The board felt that now is the right time for a change in leadership as we transform Teradata for long-term growth and shareholder value creation. I'm honored that the board has chosen me for this role. As you may know, I have been a member of Teradata's board since 2007, and during that time, I have gained an intimate knowledge of Teradata and how we will win in the marketplace. 
Throughout the course of my career, I have been involved in many successful organizations, and I plan to bring that experience to bear with me in this new role. Over the years, I've also developed a deep understanding of leadership, team building, business transformation and the importance of team commitment and success. Given my age, it's clear that I am not going to be the CEO of Teradata over the long run, but I want to assure you that I have no intention of being a caretaker either.
I plan to focus on the following key areas during my time here. First, we're going to continue and accelerate our transformation efforts. We are off to a great start, but I believe that our team is anxious to focus their efforts and to move faster. This will be my job to make sure that they get what they need to make this happen. 
Second, with our management team, I intend to focus on areas to improve our current operations. My belief is that we can maintain a proper cost focus, but we need to ensure that, that is not coming at the expense of profitable revenue growth. Further, as important as Teradata's transformation is to our long-term strategy, our current success is driven by who we are today, and we have to get that right. 
I will also focus on the change in our culture to instill a sense of urgency and accountability. We have great people, and we need to unleash their full potential. And finally and very importantly, I will lead the effort on behalf of the Board of Directors to ensure a strong leadership team. I expect to be fully engaged in this as soon as I, along with the board, have properly assessed the skills, personality and experience required to lead the company forward. While I don't have an exact time frame, I hope to give the board an initial assessment at our next meeting, which will happen in about 90 days. 
I'm highly energized because I believe the steps that Teradata has taken affirm that the transformation, our technology and the talent that our team has are right to move us forward. We need to focus the process to ensure timely and positive results by leveraging Teradata's clear and continued technology leadership and the support of our talented team. We will evolve and optimize our go-to-market strategy to align the changes and how our customers are purchasing and deploying technology. 
We will create a hard-charging culture, and there is no time to waste. All actions are intended to provide a better value to our customers, which will naturally lead to increased shareholder value. Teradata has an obligation to do everything that we can to deliver greater returns to our shareholders, and that is both near term and long term as well, and we intend to do just that. I look forward to speaking to as many of you as possible in the coming weeks and months ahead. 
With that, we're here to talk about the first quarter earnings, so I'm going to turn the call back over to Steve for that discussion."

Before I discuss the results of the quarter, I want to briefly summarize our pending sale of the Marketing Applications business. On April 22, we signed a definitive agreement to sell the business for approximately $90",1848,"Victor, thank you, and good morning. Before I discuss the results of the quarter, I want to briefly summarize our pending sale of the Marketing Applications business. On April 22, we signed a definitive agreement to sell the business for approximately $90 million, subject to customary adjustments. We expect the transaction to close around June 30. The agreed-upon price was the result of a very active process involving multiple bidders. Although price was below what we had earlier anticipated, agreeing to proceed at this price was our best option, given our overall objective to exit the business, so that we can focus solely on the transforming of the core Teradata business with all of our resources and talent.
We expect approximately $55 million to $60 million of net proceeds after adjustments, selling costs and taxes. To provide more transparency and to enable you to see the Marketing Applications business separately in 2016 since we no longer consider this business core to our ongoing operations, we've added the column on -- showing the Marketing Applications business in our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables that we provide on our website. As such, my comments regarding margins, expenses and EPS will reflect our non-GAAP results, excluding the Marketing Applications business in 2016 as well as stock-based compensation, third-party transformational costs and other special items, including the impairment of goodwill and other assets.
Now turning to the first quarter results. Teradata delivered total revenue in Q1 of $545 million, which was down 6% as reported and down 4% in constant currency. Excluding the Marketing Applications business, revenue was $511 million, which also was down 6% as reported and down 4% in constant currency. In total, product revenue was down 20% as reported, down 18% in constant currency, while services revenue was up 3% as reported, up 5% in constant currency.
Within services, consulting revenue was up 4% as reported, up 6% in constant currency, and maintenance revenue is up 2% as reported and up 4% in constant currency. 
Overall growth for consulting was driven by double-digit growth in international, 11%. During the quarter, we expanded our Think Big consulting unit into China, bringing new data consulting capabilities to the Chinese market. Overall, big data consulting grew double digits, and we also saw good growth in BI consulting in the Americas in the quarter. 
Turning to the regions. The Americas decreased 12% as reported, down 11% in constant currency. In Q1, as part of our cost rationalization initiatives, the Americas region underwent a substantial realignment of salespeople to new accounts, which caused a short-term, yet significant disruption to sales. Although it's difficult to quantify, this had a negative impact on America's revenue in Q1. However, we believe we should have this disruption behind us by midyear. 
Within customer accounts, we continue to see companies move away from large CapEx purchases. At the same time, there's increased interest in term-based pricing alternatives and cloud offerings, which we are addressing in our business transformation initiatives. Our international region performed better with Q1, increasing 4% as reported and 7% in constant currency. Within international, EMEA revenue increased 3% as reported and 6% in constant currency, while APJ revenue increased 8% as reported and 11% in constant currency. 
Product gross margin in the first quarter improved to 59.6% from 56.4% in the first quarter of 2015. The improvement in product gross margin was largely due to favorable deal mix and product mix. Services gross margin in the quarter was 46.1%, an increase from 44.3% in Q1 2015. Services margin improved due to improved consulting margins as well as the exclusion of Marketing Applications business in 2016. As a result, overall gross margin was 51.1% in the quarter in Q1, compared to 49.3% in the first quarter of 2015. 
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $131 million was $39 million or 23% lower than the first quarter of 2015 as reported, largely due to our cost reduction initiatives and the exclusion of the Marketing Applications business. Research and development expense in the quarter was $38 million, which was $18 million or 32% lower than the first quarter of 2015, about half the reduction was due to the exclusion of the Marketing Applications business. For the full year, we anticipate R&D expense to decrease approximately 10% to 15% on an as reported basis, even though we expect R&D expense to be down 25% in the first half as we begin to see R&D expense increase in the second half due to our transformational initiatives. 
As a result of the higher product and services gross margin, the lower SG&A and R&D expense and the exit of the Marketing Applications business, operating margin in the first quarter was 18% compared to 10.5% in Q1 2015. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 30.3% versus 27.9% in the same period in 2015. The higher tax rate was primarily driven by the timing of non-GAAP adjustments, which a higher proportion of call-out items falling in Q1 2016. 
On an annual basis, we expect our full year 2016 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27.5%. On a GAAP basis, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 34.5%, which includes the estimated discrete tax impact related to the sale of the Marketing Applications business. Both the effective tax rates are heavily dependent on our actual earnings mix for the full year. 
In terms of earnings per share, we reported GAAP EPS loss of $0.36 versus $0.15 of EPS in 2015. The large loss was largely due to the impairment charge. Adjusting for the impairment charge, stock-based comp and other special items, which equated to $108 million of net income or $0.83 per share in the first quarter of 2016, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.47 compared to $0.30 in Q1 2015. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $251 million in Q1 2016, which was $29 million or 13% higher than the $222 million generated in the first quarter of 2015. After $26 million of capital expenditures versus $32 million in the first quarter of 2015, we generated $225 million of free cash flow versus the $190 million of free cash flow generated in Q1 of 2015. The increase of free cash flow in the Q1 2016 versus Q1 2015 was primarily the result of the timing of working capital items. 
For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of equal to, to $50 million higher than GAAP net income, which includes the impact of cash flow from all anticipated cash severance payments required to be made in 2016 in connection with our transformation initiatives. During Q1, we repurchased 2 million shares for approximately $47 million. As of March 31, 2016, we had $528 million of remaining authorization in our open market share repurchase program. As of March 31, 2016, we had total debt of $673 million, $80 million on our revolver and $593 million on a term loan. In addition to the $47 million of cash used for share repurchases in Q1, we also used $100 million of the invested cash generation to pay down our revolver.
Now turning to guidance for the full year. In Q1, we generally saw revenue in line with Street expectations. However, we saw about one point less of currency headwind than we previously expected, and we continue to see some deals deferred in the first quarter due to customer budget issues. Although we expect Q1 deferrals to close in Q2, we also see a couple of larger transactions in Q2 that are likely to roll out of the quarter. As a result of these anticipated rolling deferrals, we feel it's prudent to adjust our full year revenue guidance range. 
We expect full year revenue, excluding the Marketing Applications business, may be down 2% to 5%, as reported. We no longer anticipate any currency impact in Q2 or for the full year. We continue to expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the $2.35 to $2.50 range. Specifically for Q2, we anticipate that revenue, excluding the Marketing Applications business, will be in the $550 million to the $560 million range. We estimate that SG&A may be down approximately 22% and R&D may be down approximately 20% from Q2 2015 as reported. This could result in non-GAAP EPS, excluding the Marketing Applications business, being approximately $0.60 in Q2. 
Now let me briefly talk about our transformation that we are undertaking to evolve with the changing market environment. While the shifts in the market and the way that our customers buy and deploy technology have challenged our overall results, we are making progress in our business transformation. The need for Data and Analytics remains a top priority, and we are seeing that a majority of the companies wants a proven partner to help them, one who offers end-to-end solutions and delivers real business value in a seamless and pragmatic way. 
In Q1, we continue to execute against our transformation roadmap to address this need. And I also want to highlight 2 top priority areas of progress: our cloud-based analytical ecosystem and our analytics solutions initiatives. With our cloud initiative, we are delivering a high-grade analytical ecosystem, building on our strengths in on-premise analytical technology and consulting, and we are taking these superior capabilities into the cloud. This addresses customers' increasing requirements for computing environment that spans on-premise, managed cloud and public cloud solutions. Our overall objective with this initiative is to allow seamless integration across environments and to provide the expertise to help customers successfully architect, implement and manage their hybrid cloud analytical ecosystems. We believe this broadens our market opportunities. 
This cloud initiative is well under way. We have the vision, we are hiring strong cloud talent, and we continue to broaden our portfolio of cloud solutions. Concurrently, we are refining our go-to-market strategy, especially for the public cloud. 
Turning to our analytics solutions initiative. Here, we truly distinguish Teradata and become a dramatically different company in the eyes of our customers. Teradata is well-known for helping our customers derive significant value from their data. Our analytics solutions initiative will accelerate that value by providing a broader range of business users with pre-packaged solutions to leverage Data and Analytics to address their most pressing challenges. Through a more consulting-led approach, we are elevating our intellectual property into a more productized and repeatable solution. By combining multi-genre analytics with integrated data at scale, our solutions will focus on delivering new levels of business insights. For example, our new communications compliance analytics solution, developed in collaboration with a leading financial institution, we combined best practice compliance models and advanced analytics into an end-to-end solution that automatically detects suspect material in digital communications. 
Communications compliance is extremely important for financial services institutions, health care providers and government organizations. Our analytics solutions will broaden our market opportunity by more directly addressing the needs of our business units -- users. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Oliver, who will highlight progress from an R&D perspective."

Before I get into some of the great progress we've made this year, I would like to talk about how we are approaching our technology innovation.We work closely with our leading customers, top executives and their teams, both on th",641,"Good morning, everyone. Before I get into some of the great progress we've made this year, I would like to talk about how we are approaching our technology innovation.
We work closely with our leading customers, top executives and their teams, both on the IT and business sides. Through these relationships, we understand their business opportunities, the challenges they are facing and the key technologies they are exploring. By leveraging and expanding our top talent with relevant expertise in these technology areas and employing agile development methodologies, we deliver the right solutions to meet the needs of our customers. 
We have been able to and will continue to accelerate these solutions through increased focus in key investment areas as part of our transformation. Now I would like to highlight 3 major milestones in the last quarter. First, cloud; second, IntelliFlex; and third, Big Data services. 
First, let's talk about cloud. We delivered on our commitments to make Teradata available on AWS by the end of Q1. The initial offering includes the Teradata Database and associated tools. We also released a portfolio of public cloud consulting and managed services. The response has been very positive, especially when we demonstrated that using equivalent configurations, Teradata on AWS has 145x the throughput for mixed workload compared to the main competing cloud database. As another example, a product affinity query runs in 12 minutes on Teradata on AWS versus more than 24 hours for the alternative, which is a 123x improvement. Customers love that Teradata on AWS is not a slimmed down version for the cloud. It is the same powerful Teradata Database that is available on all platforms. This is a core element of our cloud differentiation. The solutions built on Teradata are fully portable across the entire range of architectural environments, public cloud, managed cloud and on-premises. 
Our Teradata on AWS launch is just the tip of the iceberg. We have accelerated our planned delivery of the MPP scale-out version of Teradata on public cloud, now targeted for year-end. 
Turning to our managed cloud offering. We are building upon our success in the Americas, and we recently announced European availability in the second half of the year, bringing greater choice to more customers worldwide. 
Next, I'd like to talk about our recent announcement of Teradata IntelliFlex, our next-generation platform for on-premises data warehousing. In the on-premises environment, just like in the cloud, customers are looking for more flexibility in how they can seamlessly grow their Teradata environments while maintaining mission-critical availability. IntelliFlex allows customers to add storage and processing power independently so they can scale their systems in smaller increments, which makes Teradata easier to purchase, in line with business needs. Important new features include up to 3x more memory and the ability to double the size in just 1 hour with a simple database restart. Early customer interest for IntelliFlex is strong, and it will be available for shipping in Q3. 
Finally, I'd like to talk about our new Big Data consulting announcements. To expand the ways we support our customers' analytical ecosystem environments, we announced new consulting services from Think Big for enterprise data-link design and deployment. These new services help customers accelerate time to value and remove risks from the data-link implementations. Additionally, many organizations are experimenting to leverage Spark as an engine for product recommendations, predictive analytics, central data analysis and graph analytics amongst others. To address this, we have introduced new consulting services to help customers incorporate Apache Spark into their big data environments. 
Let me wrap up by saying I'm truly excited by the progress we have made. With our renewed focus sharpened by our transformation and at the accelerated pace, we will rapidly advance Teradata's leadership position and the exceptional business value we bring to our customers. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Steve."

This is Vic, and I go by Vic, actually, but I put Victor because if I don't, I end up Richard or Dick or something like that. So that is a very good question. And so the first thing I would say to all of you, that I've been here 9 hours",705,"Raimo, thank you. This is Vic, and I go by Vic, actually, but I put Victor because if I don't, I end up Richard or Dick or something like that. So that is a very good question. And so the first thing I would say to all of you, that I've been here 9 hours and actually, no longer, but on the board for a long time. So the details, exactly, what we're going to do, I haven't settled in on. But there is a lot of effort that's going to be put into the question you asked. I wouldn't say that, at this point in time, I think we have a need for a change in strategy. But I do think we have a need for a couple of things, and that, one, would be that we've got to move faster. As a board, we are enthusiastic about what our transformational process has brought to bear. But one of the things that we've learned in that is that we have a lot of siloed businesses. So for instance, we've got Think Big and then we've got Teradata Labs, and we're going where -- we need to focus everything we learned from that to make sure we have a laser focus on what our customers want, how we can deliver it and make sure that the customer knows that there is one Teradata, and not 5. So I think the things that we have to work on are, clearly, we have to be more focused and more -- and we have to have a lot more speed in our strategy. And I'm thrilled with the people we've got. I'm thrilled with their enthusiasm, and so I think building momentum for the team, giving them some leadership, telling them we're going to move fast and go forward is going to be my primary objective. Now if we find something in that process, we are certainly going to change. But I have an old saying. I worked for a colonel in Vietnam, who's a great guy. And he had a saying, ""If you want it bad, that's mostly how you get it."" And we have to be thoughtful and careful about how we go about this, but we do not have to be slow, those 2 things don't necessarily go together. And so we will update you as time goes forward. I will be open and honest with you guys about what we see. But right now, I'm not here because we think we're on a crash course. I'm here because we want to get focused and we want to get faster. We have a great team here, and I'm enthusiastic about it. So I guess, that would be the best way I could answer that. We are, as a board -- probably you should know how we got here. We've been through this process -- as you all know, a board has 2 primary responsibilities. One is to ensure proper leadership of a corporation, and the second one is to create shareholder value. And our board is totally focused on those things. We have been about this in the process. I think we have been a bit of a pusher and a shover in this transformational effort to see we get there. So I think the board is up to speed and tuned in. We want to make sure that the process on leadership is thoughtful and careful. As I said in my opening remarks, I'm going to take 90 days and figure that out, and then we'll start working down that process. It is going to take a bit of time to get that done. I can't tell you exactly how long, but we will get it done, and we will drive our transformation forward. I think it's important for you to know that I am not going to be a caretaker, I'm not a 68-year-old guy going to sit here and look at the world go by. We're going to get after some stuff. I'm enthusiastic and passionate about where we are, and I have great confidence in the team at Teradata and what we're doing. So hopefully, that's an answer to your question."

One of the key obligations of a Board of Directors is to understand the creation of shareholder value. And in this process, we, as a board, are totally committed to seeing that we create value here. I've thought a lot about this. I knew this question was going to be asked. We have talked about it as a board, but we think there's a lot of opportunity here that can be generated near term and long term. And part of the question is always every situation is unique, right? But to a certain degree, to think that you have to be private to do what you need to do means that, one, you either don't understand your issues, you're afraid to take them on, or you don't think you can create value for your shareholders. And I think where we are today, we believe we can do all of those things as a public company. So I guess the best answer is the board at the current time feels this is the best way to generate shareholder value. I'm enthusiastic about that. I believe we can do that. And so that's the best way I can answer that question. The board believes this is the best way to create shareholder value over the appropriate period of time for our shareholders. Obviously, I'm not entrenched, I'm not going to be here, I'm not trying to hold a job for 15 years, I'm not looking after self interest.

Cloud and the consumption models that cloud enables us to build on, right? And this is something that is not new to us, right? We have been on it for the last several quarters. With cloud, we have the ability to bring technology to use cases within minutes. What used to take days and weeks and months can now be done in minutes, right? You can stand up entire infrastructures in less than 30 minutes on cloud. And that really enables businesses to do things very differently. And having our technology, Teradata Database, the whole UDA ecosystem, as we call it, available in the cloud, I think is a great enabler. And the executives around the world, the CEOs that I talked to, they're just -- they all are excited about what that does to their business. And then there are things like sensorizing everything, right? IoT is obviously a big topic, and more and more data is being generated by devices around the world. And when you combine that with cloud and with scale-out models that a cloud enables us, there are very new ways of how industries are being reshaped, right?

Just to echo what Vic said, yes, we are very committed to that $70 million threshold that we've put out for 2016 and committed that total overall operating expense before incentive compensation and merit of that $80 million to $100 million. So that commitment is still very much alive and being driven through the organization. With that, if you -- we continue to look at where we need to invest to drive our transformational opportunities. So as Vic emphasized there, we do not want to shortchange our opportunities for revenue growth in the short term and the long term. So what we've been doing is working throughout the organization with all the business units and identifying the activities, the drivers of our costs, and looking at where we add value with those costs throughout the organization. And the costs are not just challenged within the silo, the cost reduction activities are all brought up to the leadership levels, so we understand the puts and the takes. We understand what could be at risk if we take these reductions or make these -- take these actions. So we're constantly balancing to drive -- the overall comment that Vic is making there, make sure we have the right structure, processes, activities to continue to drive short-term and long-term revenue, particularly being led by product. So we continue to look at internally, how we're going to take out additional costs to fund more investments in those transformational roadmaps. So again, we're committed to what we said publicly, but we're also driving, more internally, to fund those strong -- those key initiatives that drive current and future revenue growth."

And what we're seeing is, on the term models, what our -- it's a very small portion of our business from a product side is in, what I would say, a pure term subscription model at this point. What I see that growing over the next 3 years is as we go more towards cloud and we go more towards these analytical solutions, these are 2 good stronger growth areas in our business. Those would be predominantly, from my perspective, predominantly as we even go software-as-a-service or software-only, will be more predominantly in that services model. But we'll still have a very strong solid on-premise perpetual model. So yes, what we're looking at doing is to provide you more clarity, more transparency in that model as we go and bring an Analyst Day to you guys, to really give you clarity or transparency, Karl, into where we think that, that model will be in 3 years. But we're not looking for a significant revolution from the adoption of subscription model where you see some companies have gone out within 2.5 years and into entirely subscription. I do not see that in the Teradata model. I see it more coming from the new products offerings that we have in cloud and software-only and the analytical solutions."

I'm going to take 90 days and kind of figure out the organization here, and then we'll have a board meeting and we will start that process. Hopefully, at that point in time, it'll take however long it takes to get that going, we're going to look inside and outside, obviously, when we do that. As it relates to my actual milestones, I've got a couple of things, and some are absolutely we can put numbers on and some we can't. But in -- just in the few days I've been around here and doing stuff, my #1 priority and hope, and I believe that it's going to be true, is I want to energize our base. Organizations, one of the things I've learned over my life, and when I was younger, it took me a while to believe this, but organizations love to be led, they love to have clarity and they love to have focus. And I think that unleashes more than anyone can imagine. And so the first thing I want to do is to energize this space, make sure that they all realize how great this company is and that they're pushing forward, they're supportive of where we're going, and they have a belief in our future. So that is the number one thing I'm going to do. Number two, I want to get our sales effort very focused in the near term. I want to make sure that we are organized with the right people in the right place to drive our near-term revenue. As great as our transformation is, and we want to look at that, as you're seeing everywhere, you can look at IBM, you can look at S&P, you can look at Oracle, when you undertake changes and you have been around a while, it takes a while to transform your revenue base. And so as important as our transformation is to us, our near-term success and future for our shareholders is based on who we are today, and I've got to make sure that's right, and I will make sure that's right. And so those are the 2 primary things I'm going to work on there. And then the third thing is just to make sure that we really truly assess what does this organization need as a leader going forward. I mean, what amount of tech, what amount of leadership skills, what amount of customer in-face, how important are all of those things going forward? So as you all know, maybe you don't know, but as a board member, you get a perspective of an organization primarily from the Chief Executive Officer, right? And that's their view. We all have our biases, we have what we have. But my role here will be come in and to try and gain a fresh look at that and help our board understand what that looks like, so that we can go forward. So if I can accomplish those 3 things and make sure that our transformation gets the funding that it wants, that it needs and that the people that are leading the transformation know how important they are, and that they have license to get on and get it done. Those are the things I'm going to focus on. And they're all big issues, but I've got a lot of energy, I'm enthused about this, I believe in it, and so that's what I'm going to be focusing on. And next quarter, I will give you an update on all 4 of those things. I'll be honest with you about where we're going and how I feel about that. But those are the things I'm going to be focused on. The organization is going to be focused on all the things that Steve has been talking to you about, those are all important. We have a lot of good people running this business, and they don't need me to be down day-to-day, mucking around in what they're doing. But we will move forward. And actually, I think you will find that Teradata will actually become a tech company. We'll start acting like one, behaving like one. We'll have the speed of a tech company. We need to do all those things. And so that's what I'm going to be focusing on."

We do not see cannibalization in that. In fact, a lot of executives are very excited about the extra opportunities that cloud deployment models give them, right, because a lot of executives around the world are facing new business challenges and need to react very quick and very -- in agile steps, right? And cloud gives them the ability to spin up new sandboxes, new capabilities very, very quickly even though they're not convinced in the long run that they want to use them, right? And so cloud takes that barrier away and allows companies to act in a much more agile, smaller steps, doing that. So it's very much a complementary thing that we are seeing. I think it broadens our customer base, it broadens our appeal to companies who want to use our technology, right? And in fact, we're seeing, actually, the inverse, right? We're seeing companies that have accelerated some of their on-premises investments because we now have cloud and software options for them available. Because again, it makes it much more ubiquitous as an offering within these companies. And in regards to pricing, again, I challenge you, I mean, we have now Teradata pricing on AWS. It's public, out there on the marketplaces. It is priced right in line where we feel that the market is with that. I told you a little bit about the performance differentiation that we have, that ultimately blows total cost of ownership totally out of the ballpark, I think, for something like Teradata. And that's -- so we will focus on our core strengths. We will deliver performance, capability, concurrency even on cloud platforms, and we see that as a great complement to our on-premises offerings."

Stepping in as CEO from Teradata's Board of Directors is Victor Lund. 
Before we discuss Teradata's first quarter results, Victor will offer a few thoughts on the leadership change as well as Teradata's future. Steve Scheppmann, Teradata's CFO, will then discuss our Q1 financial performance and our transformational initiatives.
Also joining our call today is Oliver Ratzesberger, President of Teradata Labs, who will provide more detail on some of our R&D advances. Our discussion today includes forecasts and other information that are considered forward-looking statements. While these statements reflect our current outlook, they are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially. These risk factors are described in Teradata's 10-K, 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.
On today's call, we will also be discussing certain non-GAAP financial information, which excludes such items as stock-based compensation expense, asset impairments, acquisition and reorganization costs, the results of the Marketing Applications business and other special items as well as other non-GAAP items such as free cash flow and constant currency revenue comparisons. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our reported GAAP results and other information concerning these measures is included in our earnings release and on the Investor page of Teradata's website. 
A replay of this conference call will also be available later today on our website.

Before Steve discusses our first quarter results, I want to take a few minutes to talk about today's announcement regarding my election as President and Chief Executive Officer of Teradata. The board felt that now is the right time for a change in leadership as we transform Teradata for long-term growth and shareholder value creation. I'm honored that the board has chosen me for this role. As you may know, I have been a member of Teradata's board since 2007, and during that time, I have gained an intimate knowledge of Teradata and how we will win in the marketplace. 
Throughout the course of my career, I have been involved in many successful organizations, and I plan to bring that experience to bear with me in this new role. Over the years, I've also developed a deep understanding of leadership, team building, business transformation and the importance of team commitment and success. Given my age, it's clear that I am not going to be the CEO of Teradata over the long run, but I want to assure you that I have no intention of being a caretaker either.
I plan to focus on the following key areas during my time here. First, we're going to continue and accelerate our transformation efforts. We are off to a great start, but I believe that our team is anxious to focus their efforts and to move faster. This will be my job to make sure that they get what they need to make this happen. 
Second, with our management team, I intend to focus on areas to improve our current operations. My belief is that we can maintain a proper cost focus, but we need to ensure that, that is not coming at the expense of profitable revenue growth. Further, as important as Teradata's transformation is to our long-term strategy, our current success is driven by who we are today, and we have to get that right. 
I will also focus on the change in our culture to instill a sense of urgency and accountability. We have great people, and we need to unleash their full potential. And finally and very importantly, I will lead the effort on behalf of the Board of Directors to ensure a strong leadership team. I expect to be fully engaged in this as soon as I, along with the board, have properly assessed the skills, personality and experience required to lead the company forward. While I don't have an exact time frame, I hope to give the board an initial assessment at our next meeting, which will happen in about 90 days. 
I'm highly energized because I believe the steps that Teradata has taken affirm that the transformation, our technology and the talent that our team has are right to move us forward. We need to focus the process to ensure timely and positive results by leveraging Teradata's clear and continued technology leadership and the support of our talented team. We will evolve and optimize our go-to-market strategy to align the changes and how our customers are purchasing and deploying technology. 
We will create a hard-charging culture, and there is no time to waste. All actions are intended to provide a better value to our customers, which will naturally lead to increased shareholder value. Teradata has an obligation to do everything that we can to deliver greater returns to our shareholders, and that is both near term and long term as well, and we intend to do just that. I look forward to speaking to as many of you as possible in the coming weeks and months ahead. 
With that, we're here to talk about the first quarter earnings, so I'm going to turn the call back over to Steve for that discussion."

Before I discuss the results of the quarter, I want to briefly summarize our pending sale of the Marketing Applications business. On April 22, we signed a definitive agreement to sell the business for approximately $90",1848,"Victor, thank you, and good morning. Before I discuss the results of the quarter, I want to briefly summarize our pending sale of the Marketing Applications business. On April 22, we signed a definitive agreement to sell the business for approximately $90 million, subject to customary adjustments. We expect the transaction to close around June 30. The agreed-upon price was the result of a very active process involving multiple bidders. Although price was below what we had earlier anticipated, agreeing to proceed at this price was our best option, given our overall objective to exit the business, so that we can focus solely on the transforming of the core Teradata business with all of our resources and talent.
We expect approximately $55 million to $60 million of net proceeds after adjustments, selling costs and taxes. To provide more transparency and to enable you to see the Marketing Applications business separately in 2016 since we no longer consider this business core to our ongoing operations, we've added the column on -- showing the Marketing Applications business in our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables that we provide on our website. As such, my comments regarding margins, expenses and EPS will reflect our non-GAAP results, excluding the Marketing Applications business in 2016 as well as stock-based compensation, third-party transformational costs and other special items, including the impairment of goodwill and other assets.
Now turning to the first quarter results. Teradata delivered total revenue in Q1 of $545 million, which was down 6% as reported and down 4% in constant currency. Excluding the Marketing Applications business, revenue was $511 million, which also was down 6% as reported and down 4% in constant currency. In total, product revenue was down 20% as reported, down 18% in constant currency, while services revenue was up 3% as reported, up 5% in constant currency.
Within services, consulting revenue was up 4% as reported, up 6% in constant currency, and maintenance revenue is up 2% as reported and up 4% in constant currency. 
Overall growth for consulting was driven by double-digit growth in international, 11%. During the quarter, we expanded our Think Big consulting unit into China, bringing new data consulting capabilities to the Chinese market. Overall, big data consulting grew double digits, and we also saw good growth in BI consulting in the Americas in the quarter. 
Turning to the regions. The Americas decreased 12% as reported, down 11% in constant currency. In Q1, as part of our cost rationalization initiatives, the Americas region underwent a substantial realignment of salespeople to new accounts, which caused a short-term, yet significant disruption to sales. Although it's difficult to quantify, this had a negative impact on America's revenue in Q1. However, we believe we should have this disruption behind us by midyear. 
Within customer accounts, we continue to see companies move away from large CapEx purchases. At the same time, there's increased interest in term-based pricing alternatives and cloud offerings, which we are addressing in our business transformation initiatives. Our international region performed better with Q1, increasing 4% as reported and 7% in constant currency. Within international, EMEA revenue increased 3% as reported and 6% in constant currency, while APJ revenue increased 8% as reported and 11% in constant currency. 
Product gross margin in the first quarter improved to 59.6% from 56.4% in the first quarter of 2015. The improvement in product gross margin was largely due to favorable deal mix and product mix. Services gross margin in the quarter was 46.1%, an increase from 44.3% in Q1 2015. Services margin improved due to improved consulting margins as well as the exclusion of Marketing Applications business in 2016. As a result, overall gross margin was 51.1% in the quarter in Q1, compared to 49.3% in the first quarter of 2015. 
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $131 million was $39 million or 23% lower than the first quarter of 2015 as reported, largely due to our cost reduction initiatives and the exclusion of the Marketing Applications business. Research and development expense in the quarter was $38 million, which was $18 million or 32% lower than the first quarter of 2015, about half the reduction was due to the exclusion of the Marketing Applications business. For the full year, we anticipate R&D expense to decrease approximately 10% to 15% on an as reported basis, even though we expect R&D expense to be down 25% in the first half as we begin to see R&D expense increase in the second half due to our transformational initiatives. 
As a result of the higher product and services gross margin, the lower SG&A and R&D expense and the exit of the Marketing Applications business, operating margin in the first quarter was 18% compared to 10.5% in Q1 2015. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 30.3% versus 27.9% in the same period in 2015. The higher tax rate was primarily driven by the timing of non-GAAP adjustments, which a higher proportion of call-out items falling in Q1 2016. 
On an annual basis, we expect our full year 2016 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27.5%. On a GAAP basis, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 34.5%, which includes the estimated discrete tax impact related to the sale of the Marketing Applications business. Both the effective tax rates are heavily dependent on our actual earnings mix for the full year. 
In terms of earnings per share, we reported GAAP EPS loss of $0.36 versus $0.15 of EPS in 2015. The large loss was largely due to the impairment charge. Adjusting for the impairment charge, stock-based comp and other special items, which equated to $108 million of net income or $0.83 per share in the first quarter of 2016, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.47 compared to $0.30 in Q1 2015. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $251 million in Q1 2016, which was $29 million or 13% higher than the $222 million generated in the first quarter of 2015. After $26 million of capital expenditures versus $32 million in the first quarter of 2015, we generated $225 million of free cash flow versus the $190 million of free cash flow generated in Q1 of 2015. The increase of free cash flow in the Q1 2016 versus Q1 2015 was primarily the result of the timing of working capital items. 
For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of equal to, to $50 million higher than GAAP net income, which includes the impact of cash flow from all anticipated cash severance payments required to be made in 2016 in connection with our transformation initiatives. During Q1, we repurchased 2 million shares for approximately $47 million. As of March 31, 2016, we had $528 million of remaining authorization in our open market share repurchase program. As of March 31, 2016, we had total debt of $673 million, $80 million on our revolver and $593 million on a term loan. In addition to the $47 million of cash used for share repurchases in Q1, we also used $100 million of the invested cash generation to pay down our revolver.
Now turning to guidance for the full year. In Q1, we generally saw revenue in line with Street expectations. However, we saw about one point less of currency headwind than we previously expected, and we continue to see some deals deferred in the first quarter due to customer budget issues. Although we expect Q1 deferrals to close in Q2, we also see a couple of larger transactions in Q2 that are likely to roll out of the quarter. As a result of these anticipated rolling deferrals, we feel it's prudent to adjust our full year revenue guidance range. 
We expect full year revenue, excluding the Marketing Applications business, may be down 2% to 5%, as reported. We no longer anticipate any currency impact in Q2 or for the full year. We continue to expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the $2.35 to $2.50 range. Specifically for Q2, we anticipate that revenue, excluding the Marketing Applications business, will be in the $550 million to the $560 million range. We estimate that SG&A may be down approximately 22% and R&D may be down approximately 20% from Q2 2015 as reported. This could result in non-GAAP EPS, excluding the Marketing Applications business, being approximately $0.60 in Q2. 
Now let me briefly talk about our transformation that we are undertaking to evolve with the changing market environment. While the shifts in the market and the way that our customers buy and deploy technology have challenged our overall results, we are making progress in our business transformation. The need for Data and Analytics remains a top priority, and we are seeing that a majority of the companies wants a proven partner to help them, one who offers end-to-end solutions and delivers real business value in a seamless and pragmatic way. 
In Q1, we continue to execute against our transformation roadmap to address this need. And I also want to highlight 2 top priority areas of progress: our cloud-based analytical ecosystem and our analytics solutions initiatives. With our cloud initiative, we are delivering a high-grade analytical ecosystem, building on our strengths in on-premise analytical technology and consulting, and we are taking these superior capabilities into the cloud. This addresses customers' increasing requirements for computing environment that spans on-premise, managed cloud and public cloud solutions. Our overall objective with this initiative is to allow seamless integration across environments and to provide the expertise to help customers successfully architect, implement and manage their hybrid cloud analytical ecosystems. We believe this broadens our market opportunities. 
This cloud initiative is well under way. We have the vision, we are hiring strong cloud talent, and we continue to broaden our portfolio of cloud solutions. Concurrently, we are refining our go-to-market strategy, especially for the public cloud. 
Turning to our analytics solutions initiative. Here, we truly distinguish Teradata and become a dramatically different company in the eyes of our customers. Teradata is well-known for helping our customers derive significant value from their data. Our analytics solutions initiative will accelerate that value by providing a broader range of business users with pre-packaged solutions to leverage Data and Analytics to address their most pressing challenges. Through a more consulting-led approach, we are elevating our intellectual property into a more productized and repeatable solution. By combining multi-genre analytics with integrated data at scale, our solutions will focus on delivering new levels of business insights. For example, our new communications compliance analytics solution, developed in collaboration with a leading financial institution, we combined best practice compliance models and advanced analytics into an end-to-end solution that automatically detects suspect material in digital communications. 
Communications compliance is extremely important for financial services institutions, health care providers and government organizations. Our analytics solutions will broaden our market opportunity by more directly addressing the needs of our business units -- users. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Oliver, who will highlight progress from an R&D perspective."

Before I get into some of the great progress we've made this year, I would like to talk about how we are approaching our technology innovation.We work closely with our leading customers, top executives and their teams, both on th",641,"Good morning, everyone. Before I get into some of the great progress we've made this year, I would like to talk about how we are approaching our technology innovation.
We work closely with our leading customers, top executives and their teams, both on the IT and business sides. Through these relationships, we understand their business opportunities, the challenges they are facing and the key technologies they are exploring. By leveraging and expanding our top talent with relevant expertise in these technology areas and employing agile development methodologies, we deliver the right solutions to meet the needs of our customers. 
We have been able to and will continue to accelerate these solutions through increased focus in key investment areas as part of our transformation. Now I would like to highlight 3 major milestones in the last quarter. First, cloud; second, IntelliFlex; and third, Big Data services. 
First, let's talk about cloud. We delivered on our commitments to make Teradata available on AWS by the end of Q1. The initial offering includes the Teradata Database and associated tools. We also released a portfolio of public cloud consulting and managed services. The response has been very positive, especially when we demonstrated that using equivalent configurations, Teradata on AWS has 145x the throughput for mixed workload compared to the main competing cloud database. As another example, a product affinity query runs in 12 minutes on Teradata on AWS versus more than 24 hours for the alternative, which is a 123x improvement. Customers love that Teradata on AWS is not a slimmed down version for the cloud. It is the same powerful Teradata Database that is available on all platforms. This is a core element of our cloud differentiation. The solutions built on Teradata are fully portable across the entire range of architectural environments, public cloud, managed cloud and on-premises. 
Our Teradata on AWS launch is just the tip of the iceberg. We have accelerated our planned delivery of the MPP scale-out version of Teradata on public cloud, now targeted for year-end. 
Turning to our managed cloud offering. We are building upon our success in the Americas, and we recently announced European availability in the second half of the year, bringing greater choice to more customers worldwide. 
Next, I'd like to talk about our recent announcement of Teradata IntelliFlex, our next-generation platform for on-premises data warehousing. In the on-premises environment, just like in the cloud, customers are looking for more flexibility in how they can seamlessly grow their Teradata environments while maintaining mission-critical availability. IntelliFlex allows customers to add storage and processing power independently so they can scale their systems in smaller increments, which makes Teradata easier to purchase, in line with business needs. Important new features include up to 3x more memory and the ability to double the size in just 1 hour with a simple database restart. Early customer interest for IntelliFlex is strong, and it will be available for shipping in Q3. 
Finally, I'd like to talk about our new Big Data consulting announcements. To expand the ways we support our customers' analytical ecosystem environments, we announced new consulting services from Think Big for enterprise data-link design and deployment. These new services help customers accelerate time to value and remove risks from the data-link implementations. Additionally, many organizations are experimenting to leverage Spark as an engine for product recommendations, predictive analytics, central data analysis and graph analytics amongst others. To address this, we have introduced new consulting services to help customers incorporate Apache Spark into their big data environments. 
Let me wrap up by saying I'm truly excited by the progress we have made. With our renewed focus sharpened by our transformation and at the accelerated pace, we will rapidly advance Teradata's leadership position and the exceptional business value we bring to our customers. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Steve."

This is Vic, and I go by Vic, actually, but I put Victor because if I don't, I end up Richard or Dick or something like that. So that is a very good question. And so the first thing I would say to all of you, that I've been here 9 hours and actually, no longer, but on the board for a long time. So the details, exactly, what we're going to do, I haven't settled in on. But there is a lot of effort that's going to be put into the question you asked. I wouldn't say that, at this point in time, I think we have a need for a change in strategy. But I do think we have a need for a couple of things, and that, one, would be that we've got to move faster. As a board, we are enthusiastic about what our transformational process has brought to bear. But one of the things that we've learned in that is that we have a lot of siloed businesses. So for instance, we've got Think Big and then we've got Teradata Labs, and we're going where -- we need to focus everything we learned from that to make sure we have a laser focus on what our customers want, how we can deliver it and make sure that the customer knows that there is one Teradata, and not 5. So I think the things that we have to work on are, clearly, we have to be more focused and more -- and we have to have a lot more speed in our strategy. And I'm thrilled with the people we've got. I'm thrilled with their enthusiasm, and so I think building momentum for the team, giving them some leadership, telling them we're going to move fast and go forward is going to be my primary objective. Now if we find something in that process, we are certainly going to change. But I have an old saying. I worked for a colonel in Vietnam, who's a great guy. And he had a saying, ""If you want it bad, that's mostly how you get it."" And we have to be thoughtful and careful about how we go about this, but we do not have to be slow, those 2 things don't necessarily go together. And so we will update you as time goes forward. I will be open and honest with you guys about what we see. But right now, I'm not here because we think we're on a crash course. I'm here because we want to get focused and we want to get faster. We have a great team here, and I'm enthusiastic about it. So I guess, that would be the best way I could answer that. We are, as a board -- probably you should know how we got here. We've been through this process -- as you all know, a board has 2 primary responsibilities. One is to ensure proper leadership of a corporation, and the second one is to create shareholder value. And our board is totally focused on those things. We have been about this in the process. I think we have been a bit of a pusher and a shover in this transformational effort to see we get there. So I think the board is up to speed and tuned in. We want to make sure that the process on leadership is thoughtful and careful. As I said in my opening remarks, I'm going to take 90 days and figure that out, and then we'll start working down that process. It is going to take a bit of time to get that done. I can't tell you exactly how long, but we will get it done, and we will drive our transformation forward. I think it's important for you to know that I am not going to be a caretaker, I'm not a 68-year-old guy going to sit here and look at the world go by. We're going to get after some stuff. I'm enthusiastic and passionate about where we are, and I have great confidence in the team at Teradata and what we're doing. So hopefully, that's an answer to your question."

What I'm seeing here is that we should be through that by midyear and then start coming out of it in the second half of the year. So I'm still looking forward to that, and you can see it in the numbers that I shared for Q2 on the revenue side, between $550 million and $560 million. Still looking at some of that constructive disruption in there as we continue to work through, but then coming out stronger in that second half of the year."

One of the key obligations of a Board of Directors is to understand the creation of shareholder value. And in this process, we, as a board, are totally committed to seeing that we create value here. I've thought a lot about this. I knew this question was going to be asked. We have talked about it as a board, but we think there's a lot of opportunity here that can be generated near term and long term. And part of the question is always every situation is unique, right? But to a certain degree, to think that you have to be private to do what you need to do means that, one, you either don't understand your issues, you're afraid to take them on, or you don't think you can create value for your shareholders. And I think where we are today, we believe we can do all of those things as a public company. So I guess the best answer is the board at the current time feels this is the best way to generate shareholder value. I'm enthusiastic about that. I believe we can do that. And so that's the best way I can answer that question. The board believes this is the best way to create shareholder value over the appropriate period of time for our shareholders. Obviously, I'm not entrenched, I'm not going to be here, I'm not trying to hold a job for 15 years, I'm not looking after self interest.

So near term, for me, the #1 issue is to make sure that our customer focus, with all of the offerings we have, are more carefully coordinated and directed, and that we bring all of the strength and talent we have in Teradata to bear on our customers, so they know everything we have to offer and they think about calling us instead of us calling them, you know what I mean?

You can stand up entire infrastructures in less than 30 minutes on cloud. And that really enables businesses to do things very differently. And having our technology, Teradata Database, the whole UDA ecosystem, as we call it, available in the cloud, I think is a great enabler. And the executives around the world, the CEOs that I talked to, they're just -- they all are excited about what that does to their business. And then there are things like sensorizing everything, right? IoT is obviously a big topic, and more and more data is being generated by devices around the world.

But on a broader scale, that customers still want to consume Teradata, but they're very open to the other type of offerings that we have with respect to -- on a smaller-scale purchases or even on the subscription type of models, on the rental type of models or term type of models. But saying that, we still see that large capital transactions have a very difficult time getting through an organization. Now the ones that we saw in Q1 that deferred rollover into Q2, we anticipate that those will close in Q2. Now we're also being very sensitive on the larger transactions that we have in Q2 and maybe the possibility of them rolling or deferring into outside of Q2. So again, we're still being very -- we're still very sensitive within our business model, particularly on our revenue with respect to large transactions. That phenomenon, that new normal continues. But what I'm encouraged about is that these larger customers that drive these larger transactions continue to buy, and the larger transactions continue to funnel up or bubble up into the funnel."

So what we've been doing is working throughout the organization with all the business units and identifying the activities, the drivers of our costs, and looking at where we add value with those costs throughout the organization. And the costs are not just challenged within the silo, the cost reduction activities are all brought up to the leadership levels, so we understand the puts and the takes. We understand what could be at risk if we take these reductions or make these -- take these actions. So we're constantly balancing to drive -- the overall comment that Vic is making there, make sure we have the right structure, processes, activities to continue to drive short-term and long-term revenue, particularly being led by product. So we continue to look at internally, how we're going to take out additional costs to fund more investments in those transformational roadmaps.

Those would be predominantly, from my perspective, predominantly as we even go software-as-a-service or software-only, will be more predominantly in that services model. But we'll still have a very strong solid on-premise perpetual model. So yes, what we're looking at doing is to provide you more clarity, more transparency in that model as we go and bring an Analyst Day to you guys, to really give you clarity or transparency, Karl, into where we think that, that model will be in 3 years.

Hopefully, at that point in time, it'll take however long it takes to get that going, we're going to look inside and outside, obviously, when we do that. As it relates to my actual milestones, I've got a couple of things, and some are absolutely we can put numbers on and some we can't. But in -- just in the few days I've been around here and doing stuff, my #1 priority and hope, and I believe that it's going to be true, is I want to energize our base. Organizations, one of the things I've learned over my life, and when I was younger, it took me a while to believe this, but organizations love to be led, they love to have clarity and they love to have focus. And I think that unleashes more than anyone can imagine. And so the first thing I want to do is to energize this space, make sure that they all realize how great this company is and that they're pushing forward, they're supportive of where we're going, and they have a belief in our future. So that is the number one thing I'm going to do. Number two, I want to get our sales effort very focused in the near term. I want to make sure that we are organized with the right people in the right place to drive our near-term revenue. As great as our transformation is, and we want to look at that, as you're seeing everywhere, you can look at IBM, you can look at S&P, you can look at Oracle, when you undertake changes and you have been around a while, it takes a while to transform your revenue base. And so as important as our transformation is to us, our near-term success and future for our shareholders is based on who we are today, and I've got to make sure that's right, and I will make sure that's right. And so those are the 2 primary things I'm going to work on there. And then the third thing is just to make sure that we really truly assess what does this organization need as a leader going forward. I mean, what amount of tech, what amount of leadership skills, what amount of customer in-face, how important are all of those things going forward? So as you all know, maybe you don't know, but as a board member, you get a perspective of an organization primarily from the Chief Executive Officer, right? And that's their view. We all have our biases, we have what we have. But my role here will be come in and to try and gain a fresh look at that and help our board understand what that looks like, so that we can go forward. So if I can accomplish those 3 things and make sure that our transformation gets the funding that it wants, that it needs and that the people that are leading the transformation know how important they are, and that they have license to get on and get it done. Those are the things I'm going to focus on. And they're all big issues, but I've got a lot of energy, I'm enthused about this, I believe in it, and so that's what I'm going to be focusing on. And next quarter, I will give you an update on all 4 of those things. I'll be honest with you about where we're going and how I feel about that. But those are the things I'm going to be focused on. The organization is going to be focused on all the things that Steve has been talking to you about, those are all important. We have a lot of good people running this business, and they don't need me to be down day-to-day, mucking around in what they're doing. But we will move forward. And actually, I think you will find that Teradata will actually become a tech company. We'll start acting like one, behaving like one. We'll have the speed of a tech company. We need to do all those things. And so that's what I'm going to be focusing on."

We do not see cannibalization in that. In fact, a lot of executives are very excited about the extra opportunities that cloud deployment models give them, right, because a lot of executives around the world are facing new business challenges and need to react very quick and very -- in agile steps, right? And cloud gives them the ability to spin up new sandboxes, new capabilities very, very quickly even though they're not convinced in the long run that they want to use them, right? And so cloud takes that barrier away and allows companies to act in a much more agile, smaller steps, doing that. So it's very much a complementary thing that we are seeing. I think it broadens our customer base, it broadens our appeal to companies who want to use our technology, right? And in fact, we're seeing, actually, the inverse, right? We're seeing companies that have accelerated some of their on-premises investments because we now have cloud and software options for them available. Because again, it makes it much more ubiquitous as an offering within these companies. And in regards to pricing, again, I challenge you, I mean, we have now Teradata pricing on AWS. It's public, out there on the marketplaces. It is priced right in line where we feel that the market is with that. I told you a little bit about the performance differentiation that we have, that ultimately blows total cost of ownership totally out of the ballpark, I think, for something like Teradata. And that's -- so we will focus on our core strengths. We will deliver performance, capability, concurrency even on cloud platforms, and we see that as a great complement to our on-premises offerings."

Excluding the Marketing Applications business, which we sold on July 1, 2016, Q2 revenue was $564 million, which was down 3% in constant currency on a comparable basis from Q2 2015.
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.71, a meaningful increase from the $0.53 in Q2 2015 due to the higher than expected revenue and the benefit of our cost management initiatives.
My comments today reflects Teradata going forward business on a non-GAAP basis, which includes the Marketing Applications business in 2016, stock-based comp and other special items as identified in our earnings release.
Just as we did last quarter on our website, we have provided a 2016 non-GAAP view of our result without the Marketing Applications business.
Turning to revenue by region. Excluding the Marketing Applications business in both 2015 and '16, revenues in the Americas region in -- decreased 6% in constant currency. We continue to see headwinds in regard to large capital expenditures being approved particularly in the U.S., although we are working hard in our transformation, particularly on our hybrid cloud offerings and how we interface with and provide value to business users, we expect this headwind related to large IT capital expenditure projects to continue.
Our international region increased 2% in constant currency. Within international, EMEA revenue was down 3% in constant currency, while APJ [ph] revenue increased 10% in constant currency.
There's been a lot of attention on the impact of Brexit. I will provide a few specifics about our U.K. business. 
Revenue in the U.K. was up 3% in constant currency in the second quarter. We have good performance in the U.K. in Q2, however, we expect headwind in the second half of the year in the U.K. due to the devaluation of the British pound. To provide context in 2015, U.K. contributed less than 5% of Teradata's total revenue.
Turning to gross margins. Product gross margin in the second quarter was 60%, in line with our expectations, but down from the 65.6% in Q2 2015 due to deal mix.
Services gross margin in the quarter was 48.5%, up from 46.3% in Q2 2015. Services margin improved due to better consulting margins as well as the exit of the Marketing Applications business. Overall gross margin was 53% in the second quarter, compared to 54.3% in Q2 2015.
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $132 million was down 26% from Q2 last year, the decrease was primarily due to our cost management actions as well as the exit of the Marketing Applications business.
Research and develop expense of $36 million in the quarter was down 31% from the prior period. The decrease was largely due to the cost management actions we commenced in Teradata Labs last year as well as the exit of the marketing apps business this year.
We continue to expect our R&D expense for the full year to be down 10% to 15% as reported, however, due to the investments associated with our strategic growth initiatives, we expect R&D expense will increase on a comparative basis, excluding marketing apps, as we move into the second half of the year as well as into 2017.
As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 23.2%, a strong increase from the 17.2% in Q2 2015. The improvement in operating margin was due to our cost management actions and higher services gross margin as well as the exit of the Marketing Applications business.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 27.1%, comparable with the 27.6% in Q2 2015.
Looking forward, we expect our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27%, with the actual tax rate being primarily dependent upon the ultimate at earnings mix.
GAAP EPS was $0.49 in Q2. This compared to a GAAP EPS loss of $1.87 in Q2 2015, which was driven by the goodwill impairment charge relating to the Marketing Applications business. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 compared to $0.53 in Q2 2015.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $99 million in Q2 2016 versus $80 million in the second quarter of 2015,  due to a net favorable year-over-year changing working capital.
In the second quarter, we had $27 million of capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software, the same as in the second quarter of 2015, resulting in free cash flow of $72 million versus $53 million in Q2 2015.
We continue to expect full year free cash flow to be equal to GAAP net income, excluding the impairment charges or up to $50 million higher, which at the high end of our range would be approximately $270 million.
Moving now to the balance sheet. We had $909 million of cash as of June 30, 2016, of which more than 98% is held outside the U.S.  This is down slightly down from the $917 million as of March 31, 2016, as we used $80 million of cash in Q2 to completely pay off our revolving credit facility.
We moderated our repurchase activity in the second quarter as we have been quite active in Q1 as well as in 2015, which enabled us to get to the shares repurchase that we had planned for. During the first half of the year, we bought approximately 2.6 million shares of -- for a total cost of approximately $62 million.
As of June 30, we had approximately $528 million of share repurchase authorization available.
Before I turn to guidance, I want to provide a little colored commentary on what we see in the market. 
Our revenues has been impacted by our customers' focused on less capital intensive options like clouds and other alternatives, including other purchasing options such as subscriptions, rental and other usage-based models. Many customers have delayed or reduced on premise purchases and in order to evaluate Teradata's cloud -- public cloud and other consumption options. Our current outlook for Q3 and the remainder of the year includes new cloud opportunities with the vast majority with current -- with the vast majority with current Teradata, as they desire to start building out their hybrid cloud environments.
This is a good start to our initiatives associated with different solutions and usage-based a solution offerings that make it easier for our customers to consume Teradata.
To provide more color, we are seeing interest in our term rental or usage-based utility offers. For example, in Q2, we signed $11 million contract with a well-known airline, utilizing our rental term offering, that resulted in revenue being recognized ratably. In July, we closed a significant transaction with a large known -- well known health care company using the utility based model and which revenue will be recognized based on usage.
In addition, we have many other customers evaluating these usage-based pricing alternatives. This is not unexpected, and is aligned with our transformation. But as the likely understand, this will begin to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons as some of the revenue would have normally recognized in the given quarter will now be spread over a number of periods.
That said, we are pleased with our Q2 results and expect Q3 revenue in the $550 million to $560 million range. We expect non-GAAP EPS to approximate $0.60 in Q3 as the benefits of our cost-reduction continue but we will see the increased investment for our new initiatives reflected in our operating results, beginning in the third quarter.
We expect product gross margin Q3 to be approximately 60%, and services margin in the mid-40s [ph] .
We expect as reported total operating expenses to decrease approximately $20 million year-over-year in Q3, with reported R&D expense being up slightly year-over-year and up sequentially from Q2.
For the full year, we continue to expect revenue, excluding Marketing Applications business, to be in the $2.25 billion to $2.32 billion range.
Although we had a good first half in the terms of EPS improvement, our full-year expectation for non-GAAP EPS remains in the -- same at 235 [ph] to 250 [ph] since we will begin to see the impact of our increased investments in our operating results in the second half of the year.
We've made good progress in our cost-reduction initiatives as you can see from our results. And are now shifting from a cost-reduction based on more responsive cost management base. As we properly investment future to better align with the changing marketplace.
Our future investments, which we will provide greater details on during our Analyst Day in November, will support our cloud offerings, our analytical solutions and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our infrastructure and support functions.
Although these planned investments will begin to impact our results in the second half of 2016, they will become more meaningful in 2017.
In closing, market changes disrupted business as usual for many companies, and the company such as Teradata that flourished in the past must adapt. The good news is Teradata's best-in-class technology, smart and talented and customer respected people and outstanding customers tell us they are going to continue to expand expanding their on premise data environments, while also leveraging the cloud.
They're looking for us to deliver smarter, more flexible and easier to use options to consume Teradata. 
We are on it, and fully intend to deliver both for our customers and our shareholders. Now I'll turn it back over to Vic."

And now I'd like to provide an overview of our business at the level I am comfortable sharing at this point in time. First, our technology is strong and our customers want and need it. Our customers are among some of the largest and mo",1937,"Thank you, Steve. And now I'd like to provide an overview of our business at the level I am comfortable sharing at this point in time. 
First, our technology is strong and our customers want and need it. Our customers are among some of the largest and most aggressive users of analytics in the world, and they believe our offerings are a key part of their long-term strategy.
They see us as a trusted adviser to help them sort out the best ways to deal with the explosion of data. They trust us because we bring scalable solutions that work. 
Second, I've seen firsthand that Teradata has very talented people, who are the best at what they do, and they are hungry for change. They are passionate about our new direction, our technology and what we can do for our customers. And they know they are the best at bringing analytics and data together for the customers' advantage.
This isn't just my view, but the view of the customers I've had face-to-face meetings with.
So if this is true, why is our revenue been challenged? Our product has remained product-centric and our sales approach too IT focused. This is inconsistent with where the market is going. Some of our customers believe that we are unreceptive to the new ways they want to buy, consume and deploy technology. This is absolutely not true, and we're going to change this misconception.
We have made dealing with us harder than it should be. We need to update our infrastructure so that we can be more efficient and more responsive in serving our customers. 
So the question is, what are we doing differently? We have refined our strategy to be even more customer-centric, giving customers what they want and how they want it. We will become more focused on business outcomes and be more consultative in our approach.
We will be riveted on helping business users solve their challenges rather than leading with technology. This approach has been very well received by my initial customer visits, and will position us as a trusted adviser, with both the business and technical leaders in our customers' organizations.
Our strategy is based around the core belief that analytics and data unleash the potential of great companies. To empower companies to achieve higher impact business outcomes, we will be providing differentiated business solutions and analytical architecture expertise that pull through our technology solutions. Our core database technology remains the key element of our strategy, and we will continue to deliver our best-in-class data analytics at scale.
Since business users are now a key buyer of analytics, we are shifting our emphasis towards delivering high-impact business solutions for our customers. In doing so, we will leverage a more consultive, solution-selling approach to identify and deliver value to business buyers, supported by our business and industry consulting.
In the Americas, we have restructured our business and industry consulting practice into a more centralized organization so we can leverage these resources across industries and deliver a consistent message to our customers.
We see growing demand from business buyers for one-stop shop for analytics that can create high-value business outcomes and many of our customers look to Teradata for this.
We will focus our analytic consulting on solving customer challenges where we have expertise and assets. By capturing the IT from these engagements, we will be able to leverage these use cases with other companies. Our opportunity lies in our ability to scale and monetize the solutions.
As more companies begin to explore various open source, cloud and deployment alternatives, they need a partner that can help navigate and optimize their analytical architectures. Our years of implementation experience in enterprise-class analytic infrastructures and data integration, along with open source experience brought by Think Big, enable us to help customers achieve their analytical business objectives.
We will provide broad technology architectural consulting and migration services to guide their data strategies by objectively discussing the benefits of open source, cloud and on premise deployment options, along with the optimal placement of data across the ecosystem, we can make their architecture easier to use and deliver solid benefits, thus, giving them high returns on their investments in technology and related solutions.
While having a flexible analytical ecosystem is increasingly important, our customers tell us they want to continue to rely on Teradata for sophisticated workloads, and our solutions including on-premise systems, will continue to be a major component of their ecosystem.
In addition, the continuing to improve the performance and value of our market-leading database, we are aggressively extending our portfolio of technology solutions to deliver an end-to-end analytical ecosystem across hybrid cloud architecture to accommodate our customer shifts and buying preferences towards the cloud.
Our cloud strategy is focused on delivering 3 types of offers. First, we have the Teradata software only available in the public cloud for the do-it-yourself segments that want to purchase Teradata software and deploy it on the public cloud.
We have further accelerated our release of the Teradata Data Warehouse on AWS running MPP [ph] and expect it to be available on AWS later this quarter. 
This is not a scaled-down version of Teradata. It has the same performance benefits of our Teradata MPP on-premise system, rooted in our superior processing engine, shared nothing architecture and best-in-class performance optimizer, and in test of real world consumer queries, there proves much more powerful than any major competing cloud database today.
Additionally, we are planning to release Teradata database on Microsoft Azure [ph] running MPP in Q4, and we will soon have after available on AWS.
Second, we have a hybrid cloud solution, which meets the needs of company -- companies who have hybrid, on premise and cloud environments either as an end state goal or as an interim path towards 100% cloud deployment. 
Third, we are operating Teradata managed cloud solutions for the do-it-for-me segment of the market. This is the most strategic opportunity for Teradata in the cloud, where we are not just selling our technology but rather providing a full managed solution. 
We will leverage not only our own data centers as hosting options but also the public clouds to provide infrastructure as a service capabilities to achieve broader reach and align with customer cloud preference.
We will extend our managed cloud business with new entry level and higher performance/service-level options. We're also on track to launch Teradata managed cloud in Europe later this quarter, thus, expanding our reach globally. 
To accelerate our cloud strategy, we have fundamentally changed our development and engineering processing to provide our customers with the rapid releases of functionality required to meet their business growth. Additionally, we have recruited top cloud talent to augment our team.
As we are creating more flexible options to better align with how customers want to buy and deploy Teradata, we are also realigning our direct sales force with the biggest revenue opportunities and highest probabilities of success. These efforts will give our team more time with our customers, support better coordination and improve productivity.
Further, we're going to see that our sales teams are properly supported, with the tools they need to properly explain our strategy to their customers. 
The largest companies in the world remain the best revenue opportunity for us, as they have the most complex analytical requirements and the need to scale. Further, they drive the vast majority of global IT spending. This is Teradata's sweet spot where we can provide differential capabilities to solve a broad range of problems and where our value proposition is most compelling.
But we haven't done a great job of capitalizing on our revenue opportunities here. For example, we have less than 40% of the Global 500 as our customers and our share wallet in these customers is smaller than it should be.
Concentrating on these larger revenue opportunities, with a solution-oriented focus will require a very different sales approach and how we build the count class and how we market to our customers. Evolving our go-to-market approach will better position Teradata with both business buyers and IT buyers and increase wallet share with our existing customers as well as add new ones. Business buyers will look to Teradata for analytic solutions tailored to their industry and business problems. Our new hybrid cloud will allow IT buyers to have the highest performance possible, deployed the most agile way and at the lowest cost of total ownership.
As we execute our strategy and ramp our business solutions and hybrid cloud offerings, we intend to make it easier for customers to procure and deploy Teradata by offering multiple and flexible consumption and pricing options.
This is an area where we have more work to do to ensure that we deliver fair value to our customers, while at the same time seeing that Teradata is properly rewarded for the value we would deliver. We will provide more information in this area on our Analyst Day.
During the presentation, we will be able to demonstrate in our initiatives in both near-term and long-term returns. And while this is true that our complete strategy implementation will take time, it will not take long before you start to see the results of these implementations.
Steve pointed out that we have made good progress in our cost-reduction efforts and are now shifting to a responsive cost management process. We need to make sure our initiatives get the funding they require to better align with the changing marketplace. However, these investments will only be made if they accelerate the return of revenue growth or reduce our cost footprint going forward.
To support our successful transformation, we are also making organizational changes to ensure that we have the right talent and the right positions, and we will continue to provide you with more information on these changes as well as our go-to-market approach.
I am well aware that simply creating plans does not make them happen. Rest assured, we have identified tests with clear owners and are defining measurable objectives to drive our long term success, while still focusing on short-term results. In order to provide more transparency to our transformation roadmap and success, we will provide actions, metrics and a multiyear financial model at our Analyst Day.
Last quarter, I told you I'd take the first 90 days to evaluate the business. As you've heard today, that's well underway. Our top priority now is driving our business forward, executing on our transformation and returning greater shareholder value.
Given this focus, the board and I have determined that it is premature to initiate the CEO search at this time. We will let you know when we begin that process, and when we do, the board will be deliberate in its actions.
In closing, the new Teradata will empower companies to achieve high impact business outcomes to analytics of scale on agile data foundations. We will be business outcome focused and consultative in our approach, serving as trusted advisers throughout the organization.
As we look forward, we will develop world-class cloud capabilities and services to make Teradata available no matter where or how our customers want.
We find and execute our go-to-market strategy to optimize our revenue opportunity, provide analytical business solutions that deliver high impact business outcomes, create an environment and culture that supports a nimble and effective organization driving innovation; and finally, and very importantly, ensure our strategy delivers long-term revenue and earnings growth. 
I can assure you that we are advancing on all fronts, and are underway executing against our transformation. And with that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

So the initial thing of what we're doing is just simply getting back to real basic blocking and tackling from a go-to-market perspective. Looking at our accounts and how we align, where we are. And going at it, so that near-term, it's that longer term obviously, we have to build out these capabilities, and this is investment we have to make going forward is to get a back end support for all of that. I think, the second part of your question revolved around what is our targeted market. And I think, I said in my opening comments and so just to be clear, we believe that in the top 400 or 500 accounts worldwide, is our sweet spot. That's driven because of two reasons. One they account for a huge percentage of the relevant technology spend for us. They also appreciate and want to help in very complicated analytic solutions, and we're capable of delivering that. And our share of wallet in those accounts is not just a number, but in the accounts we have, because we have been so resistant to change, they haven't look for us to expand our presence there. And I've got to tell you from my visits with early customers, just simply the fact that we admit that open sourcing this and Hadoops there and where they are and that the cloud is coming has made them much more receptive to doing business with Teradata. So at all fronts, I think, we are added. It's a little what I said, some up it will come earlier, some up it will come a little longer. But I really am quite enthused about what I found in our people, our technology and our customers perception into it. So I hope that answers that. We obviously, owe you some more detail around this at the Analyst Meeting, and we'll do that. By nature, I only want to tell you what I know to be true, but I'll tell you that I know to be true to our customers like us that we had the capabilities, and I really am quite thrilled. I told a lot of the folks around here, the worst in that could happen for mice perspective is that I want to walk and impound everything perfect because they would have been hard to figure out where we were going to go, we have a lot of near and long term opportunities to return Teradata to where it should be and our people are enthusiastic about it as well."

That's previously would have taken them months or longer to go through capital requests, to install the system, to load that data, to set everything up, right? So cloud brings a lot of opportunities to our technology, and we are very excited. And we're using it even internally, we've gone to set up where we instantiate these kinds of technologies on a moments notice, low data from customers and then interact with the data within a matter of hours and days with what previously taken a much longer time. So that is a big enabler for us to take our technology into new use cases said that previously we weren't agile enough to deploy that."

The beautiful story for us is that we have been in this transitional or transformation to go to a software-only platform, really over the last several quarters. And the software that we actually run, MPP on AWS and soon on Azure, is actually the exact same software that we run IntelliFlex platform in the data center.

We are seeing that the advantage that we have with the Teradata software, especially with the optimizer, scales extremely well in the cloud. We have seen that linear scale that we have in our on-premises solutions, it's just that the units in the cloud are usually smaller. You add more small units together to get to the same performance and footprint that you have in a data center, but when we compare it note for note, compared to other technologies that wanted to cloud, we see phenomenal performance. And in fact, we just took some of the industry analysts through it 2 months ago, and the feedback from them was just they were in all, what kind of performance Teradata can produce in something like the AWS cloud. And we are seeing very similar performance on Azure. And yes, there's differences between AWS and Azure in terms of whether back and is. And that is reflected in the performance, but whatever the performance is that we see in the cloud, we can leverage it to its maximum."

But -- and figure out we do whatever makes sense, but remembering now we are trusted adviser one of the key things we had to do when we engage with a large company is that we have to make sure that we deliver what we say we will deliver and be able to deliver it scale. So we will do nothing that will compromise that. It is one of the key tenets we're going after. The most recent acquisition we did in Big Data is that jump to our Think Big. Both of these companies, and they are ours, our open source focus. And we are doing that to expand our footprint. As you know -- all know, these very bright people are hard to find in the world, and we've had the good luck of being able to acquire some of them through acquisitions. There are smaller companies, very smart, aggressive and prone earlier people, and it also helps us increase the last increase our footprint in thus and internationally. So we are open to whatever from our partner -- what partners we work with, but we are -- we want partners, a want that are consistent with our strategy. and I get back to that -- the key tenet for us is simply that we have to be able to deliver what we say we can at scale without any hiccups. And so we'll do whatever makes sense, but right now that's where we are. And then, is just because we're doing with the customers and that's what they all like about us. When I'm out talking to them, they all say well you guys do whatever you say you're going to do and it's scalable. And I think, a lot of our customers are starting to find out that Open Source and Hadoop are great, but that requires smart people on top of them to make them work and in some cases, there are people promising things that when they get in, they are just simply aren't scalable. They can do it in a small-scale but they got to get them up work. And so this is one of our key differentiating point in the market. And so we are not going to sacrifice that."

Steve Scheppman, Teradata's CFO will then discuss our Q2 financial performance as well as our guidance. Also joining our call today is Oliver Ratzesberger, President of Teradata Labs, who will be available during our Q&A session.
Our discussion today includes forecasts and other information that are considered forward-looking statements. While these statements reflect our current outlook, they are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially. These risk factors are described in Teradata's 10-K, 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.
On today's call, we will also be discussing certain non-GAAP financial information, which excludes such items as stock-based compensation expense; asset impairments; acquisition and reorganization cost; the marketing applications business, which was sold on July 1st of this year; and other special items; as well as other non-GAAP items, such as free cash flow and constant currency revenue comparisons. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our reported GAAP results and other information concerning these measures is included in our earnings release and on the Investor page of Teradata's website.
We will host an Analyst Day on November 17 at our R&D facility, which is located near San Diego. We will be providing more information regarding this meeting in the next few weeks. A replay of this conference call will be available later today on our website, and Teradata assumes no obligation to update or revise the information included in this call, whether as a result of new information or future results.

But I guess in short, I would say that I'm enthusiastic about what I found. 
I spent a great deal of time analyzing the data around our business and the transformation. I've been on the road meeting with Teradata employees at town halls, with sales team and with every functional organization within Teradata. I've met with customers in the Americas and internationally. I've also met with more than 50 industry analysts, who firmly believe that Teradata still has the most sophisticated and powerful analytic capabilities in the market. They also believe that we are in the right path with our cloud deployment options to assist our customers that want to leverage the cloud. I have reviewed our strategic direction with the board, and they concur with our strategy. We are now moving forward to execute our plan.
I'll come back with a little more of the silhouette after Steve covers the financial results. As you can understand, I've only been at this 90 days. And it would be presumptive of me to go too deep right now. 
But as we said last quarter, we will have a full presentation ready for our analyst meeting. And we are on track to do that. Steve?"

Teradata generated results better than our guided expectations in the second quarter. Excluding the Marketing Applications business, which we sold on July 1, 2016, Q2 revenue was $564 million, which was down 3% in constant currency on a comparable basis from Q2 2015.  Non-GAAP EPS was $0.71, a meaningful increase from the $0.53 in Q2 2015 due to the higher-than-expected revenue and the benefit of our cost management initiatives.
My comments today reflects Teradata's going forward business on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the Marketing Applications business in 2016, stock-based comp and other special items as identified in our earnings release. Just as we did last quarter on our website, we have provided a 2016 non-GAAP view of our result without the Marketing Applications business.
Turning to revenue by region. Excluding the Marketing Applications business in both 2015 and '16, revenues in the Americas region decreased 6% in constant currency. We continue to see headwinds in regard to large capital expenditures being approved, particularly in the U.S. Although we are working hard in our transformation, particularly on our hybrid cloud offerings and how we interface with and provide value to business users, we expect this headwind related to large IT capital expenditure projects to continue.
Our international region increased 2% in constant currency. Within international, EMEA revenue was down 3% in constant currency, while APJ revenue increased 10% in constant currency.
There's been a lot of attention on the impact of Brexit. I will provide a few specifics about our U.K. business. Revenue in the U.K. was up 3% in constant currency in the second quarter. We had good performance in the U.K. in Q2. However, we expect headwind in the second half of the year in the U.K. due to the devaluation of the British pound. To provide context in 2015, U.K. contributed less than 5% of Teradata's total revenue.
Turning to gross margins. Product gross margin in the second quarter was 60%, in line with our expectations, but down from the 65.6% in Q2 2015 due to deal mix. Services gross margin in the quarter was 48.5%, up from 46.3% in Q2 2015. Services margin improved due to better consulting margins as well as the exit of the Marketing Applications business. Overall gross margin was 53% in the second quarter compared to 54.3% in Q2 2015.
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $132 million was down 26% from Q2 last year, the decrease was primarily due to our cost management actions as well as the exit of the Marketing Applications business.
Research and development expense of $36 million in the quarter was down 31% from the prior period. The decrease was largely due to the cost management actions we commenced in Teradata Labs last year as well as the exit of the Marketing Apps business this year.
We continue to expect our R&D expense for the full year to be down 10% to 15% as reported. However, due to the investments associated with our strategic growth initiatives, we expect R&D expense will increase on a comparative basis, excluding marketing apps as we move into the second half of the year as well as into 2017.
As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 23.2%, a strong increase from the 17.2% in Q2 2015. The improvement in operating margin was due to our cost management actions and higher services gross margin as well as the exit of the Marketing Applications business. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 27.1% comparable with the 27.6% in Q2 2015.
Looking forward, we expect our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27% with the actual tax rate being primarily dependent upon the ultimate earnings mix. GAAP EPS was $0.49 in Q2. This compared to a GAAP EPS loss of $1.87 in Q2 2015, which was driven by the goodwill impairment charge relating to the Marketing Applications business. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 compared to $0.53 in Q2 2015.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $99 million in Q2 2016 versus $80 million in the second quarter of 2015,  due to a net favorable year-over-year changing working capital. In the second quarter, we had $27 million of capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software, the same as in the second quarter of 2015, resulting in free cash flow of $72 million versus $53 million in Q2 2015.
We continue to expect full year free cash flow to be equal to GAAP net income, excluding the impairment charges or up to $50 million higher, which at the high end of our range would approximate $270 million.
Moving now to the balance sheet. We had $909 million of cash as of June 30, 2016, of which more than 98% is held outside the U.S. This is down, slightly down from the $917 million as of March 31, 2016, as we used $80 million of cash in Q2 to completely pay off our revolving credit facility.
We moderated our repurchase activity in the second quarter as we have been quite active in Q1 as well as in 2015, which enabled us to get to the shares repurchase that we had planned for. During the first half of the year, we bought approximately 2.6 million shares of -- for a total cost of approximately $62 million. As of June 30, we had approximately $528 million of share repurchase authorization available.
Before I turn to guidance, I want to provide a little colored commentary on what we see in the market. Our revenue has been impacted by our customers' focus on less capital-intensive options, like cloud and other alternatives, including other purchasing options, such as subscriptions, rental and other usage-based models. Many customers have delayed or reduced on-premise purchases and in order to evaluate Teradata's cloud -- public cloud and other consumption options. Our current outlook for Q3 and the remainder of the year includes new cloud opportunities with the vast majority with current -- with the vast majority with current Teradata users as they desire to start building out their hybrid cloud environments. This is a good start to our initiatives associated with different solutions and usage-based subscription offerings that make it easier for our customers to consume Teradata.
To provide more color, we are seeing an interest in our term rental or usage-based utility offers. For example, in Q2, we signed an $11 million contract with a well-known airline, utilizing our rental term offering that resulted in revenue being recognized ratably. In July, we closed a significant transaction with a large known -- well-known health care company using the utility based model in which revenue will be recognized based on usage. In addition, we have many other customers evaluating these usage-based pricing alternatives. This is not unexpected and is aligned with our transformation. But as you'll likely understand, this will begin to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons, as some of the revenue we would have normally recognized in a given quarter will now be spread over a number of periods.
That said, we were pleased with our Q2 results and expect Q3 revenue in the $550 million to $560 million range. We expect non-GAAP EPS to approximate $0.60 in Q3 as the benefits of our cost-reduction continue, but we will see the increased investment for our new initiatives reflected in our operating results beginning in the third quarter.
We expect product gross margin Q3 to be approximately 60%, and services margin in the mid-40s. We expect as reported total operating expenses to decrease approximately $20 million year-over-year in Q3 with reported R&D expense being up slightly year-over-year and up sequentially from Q2.
For the full year, we continue to expect revenue, excluding Marketing Applications business, to be in the $2.25 billion to $2.32 billion range. Although we had a good first half in the terms of EPS improvement, our full year expectation for non-GAAP EPS remains in the -- the same at $2.35 to $2.50 since we will begin to see the impact of our increased investments in our operating results in the second half of the year.
We have made good progress in our cost-reduction initiatives as you can see from our results and are now shifting from a cost-reduction phase to a more responsive cost-management phase as we properly invest for Teradata's future to better align with the changing marketplace.
Our future investments, which we will provide greater details on during our Analyst Day in November, will support our cloud offerings, our analytical solutions and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our infrastructure and support functions. Although these planned investments will begin to impact our results in the second half of 2016, they will become more meaningful in 2017.
In closing, market changes at disrupted business as usual for many companies. And the company, such as Teradata that have flourished in the past, must adapt. The good news is Teradata has best-in-class technology, smart and talented and customer-respected people, and outstanding customers tell us they are going to continue to expand expanding their on-premise data environments, while also leveraging the cloud.  They're looking for us to deliver smarter, more flexible and easier to use options to consume Teradata. 
We are on it and fully intend to deliver both for our customers and our shareholders. Now I'll turn it back over to Vic."

I'd now like to provide an overview of our business at a level I am comfortable sharing at this point in time. First, our technology is strong and our customers want and need it. Our customers are among some of the largest and most agg",1934,"Thank you, Steve. I'd now like to provide an overview of our business at a level I am comfortable sharing at this point in time. 
First, our technology is strong and our customers want and need it. Our customers are among some of the largest and most aggressive users of analytics in the world. And they believe our offerings are a key part of their long-term strategy. They see us as a trusted adviser to help them sort out the best ways to deal with the explosion of data. They trust us because we bring scalable solutions that work. 
Second, I've seen firsthand that Teradata has very talented people, who are the best at what they do. And they are hungry for change. They are passionate about our new direction, our technology and what we can do for our customers. And they know they are the best at bringing analytics and data together for the customers' advantage.
This isn't just my view, but the view of the customers I've had face-to-face meetings with.
So if this is true, why has our revenue been challenged? Our product has remained product-centric; and our sales approach, too IT focused. This is inconsistent with where the market is going. Some of our customers believe that we are unreceptive to the new ways they want to buy, consume and deploy technology. This is absolutely not true. And we are going to change this misconception. We have made dealing with us harder than it should be. We need to update our infrastructure so that we can be more efficient and more responsive in serving our customers. 
So the question is, what are we doing differently? We have refined our strategy to be even more customer-centric, giving customers what they want and how they want it. We will become more focused on business outcomes and be more consultative in our approach. We will be riveted on helping business users solve their challenges rather than leading with technology. This approach has been very well received by my initial customer visits, and Will positioned us, as a trusted adviser, with both the business and technical leaders in our customers' organizations.
Our strategy is based around the core belief that analytics and data unleash the potential of great companies. To empower companies to achieve higher impact business outcomes, we will be providing differentiated business solutions and analytical architecture expertise that pull through our technology solutions. Our core database technology remains the key element of our strategy. And we will continue to deliver our best-in-class data analytics at scale.
Since business users are now a key buyer of analytics, we are shifting our emphasis towards delivering high-impact business solutions for our customers. In doing so, we will leverage a more consultive, solution-selling approach to identify and deliver value to business buyers, supported by our business and industry consulting.
In the Americas, we have restructured our business and industry-consulting practice into a more centralized organization, so we can leverage these resources across industries and deliver a consistent message to our customers. 
We see growing demand from business buyers for one-stop shop for analytics that can create high-value business outcomes. And many of our customers look to Teradata for this. We will focus our analytic consulting on solving customer challenges where we have expertise and assets. By capturing the IT from these engagements, we will be able to leverage these use cases with other companies. Our opportunity lies in our ability to scale and monetize these solutions.
As more companies begin to explore various open source, cloud and deployment alternatives, they need a partner that can help navigate and optimize their analytical architectures. Our years of implementation experience in enterprise-class analytic infrastructures and data integration, along with open-source experience brought by Think Big, enable us to help customers achieve their analytical business objectives.
We will provide broad technology architectural consulting and migration services to guide their data strategies by objectively discussing the benefits of open source, cloud and on-premise deployment options. Along with the optimal placement of data across the ecosystem, we can make their architecture easier to use and deliver solid benefits, thus giving them higher returns on their investments in technology and related solutions.
While having a flexible analytical ecosystem is increasingly important, our customers tell us they want to continue to rely on Teradata for sophisticated workloads. And our solutions, including on-prem systems, will continue to be a major component of their ecosystem.
In addition, in continuing to improve the performance and value of our market-leading database, we are aggressively extending our portfolio of technology solutions to deliver an end-to-end analytical ecosystem across the hybrid cloud architecture to accommodate our customer shifts and buying preferences towards the cloud.
Our cloud strategy is focused on delivering 3 types of offers. First, we have the Teradata software only available in the public cloud for the do-it-yourself segments that want to purchase Teradata software and deploy it on the public cloud. We have further accelerated our release of the Teradata Data Warehouse on AWS running MPP and expect it to be available on AWS later this quarter. 
This is not a scaled-down version of Teradata. It has the same performance benefits of our Teradata MPP on-prem system, rooted in our superior processing engine, shared nothing architecture and best-in-class performance optimizer. And in test of real world consumer queries, it proves much more powerful than any other major competing cloud database today.
Additionally, we are planning to release Teradata database on Microsoft Azure running MPP in Q4. And we will soon have Aster available on AWS.
Second, we have a hybrid cloud solution, which meets the needs of company -- companies who have hybrid, on premise and cloud environments either as an end-state goal or as an interim path towards 100% cloud deployment. 
Third, we are operating Teradata managed cloud solutions for the do-it-for-me segment of the market. This is the most strategic opportunity for Teradata in the cloud, where we are not just selling our technology, but rather providing a full managed solution. We will leverage not only our own data centers as hosting options, but also the public clouds to provide infrastructure-as-a-service capabilities to achieve broader reach and align with customer cloud preferences.
We will extend our managed cloud business with new entry level and higher performance/service level options. We are also on track to launch Teradata managed cloud in Europe later this quarter, thus expanding our reach globally. 
To accelerate our cloud strategy, we have fundamentally changed our development and engineering process to provide our customers with the rapid releases of functionality required to meet their business growth. Additionally, we have recruited top cloud talent to augment our team. As we are creating more flexible options to better align with how customers want to buy and deploy Teradata, we are also realigning our direct sales force with the biggest revenue opportunities and highest probabilities of success. These efforts will give our team more time with our customers, support better coordination and improve productivity. Further, we are going to see that our sales teams are properly supported, with the tools they need to properly explain our strategy to their customers. 
The largest companies in the world remain the best revenue opportunity for us, as they have the most complex analytical requirements and the need to scale. Further, they drive the vast majority of global IT spending. This is Teradata's sweet spot where we can provide differential capabilities to solve a broad range of problems and where our value's proposition is most compelling.
But we haven't done a great job of capitalizing on the revenue opportunities here. For example, we have less than 40% of the Global 500 as our customers. And our share of wallet in these customers is smaller than it should be.
Concentrating on these larger revenue opportunities with a solution-oriented focus will require a very different sales approach and how we build the count plans and how we market to our customers. Evolving our go-to-market approach will better position Teradata with both business buyers and IT buyers and increase wallet share with our existing customers as well as add new ones. Business buyers will look to Teradata for analytic solutions tailored to their industry and business problems. Our new hybrid cloud will allow IT buyers to have a highest performance possible, deployed the most agile way and at the lowest cost of total ownership.
As we execute our strategy and ramp our business solutions in hybrid cloud offerings, we intend to make it easier for customers to procure and deploy Teradata by offering multiple and flexible consumption and pricing options. This is an area where we have more work to do to ensure that we deliver fair value to our customers, while at the same time, seeing that Teradata is properly rewarded for the value we would deliver. We will provide more information in this area on our Analyst Day.
During the presentation, we will be able to demonstrate that our initiatives have both near term and long-term returns. And while it is true that our complete strategy implementation will take time, it will not take long before you start to see the results of these implementations.
Steve pointed out that we have made good progress on our cost-reduction efforts and are now shifting to a responsive cost management process. We need to make sure our initiatives get the funding they require to better align with the changing marketplace. However, these investments will only be made if they accelerate the return of our revenue growth or reduce our cost footprint going forward.
To support our successful transformation, we are also making organizational changes to ensure that we have the right talent and the right positions, and we will continue to provide you with more information on these changes as well as our go-to-market approach.
I am well aware that simply creating plans does not make them happen. Rest assured, we have identified tests with clear owners and are defining measurable objectives to drive our long term success, while still focusing on short-term results. In order to provide more transparency to our transformation roadmap and success, we will provide actions, metrics and a multiyear financial model at our Analyst Day.
Last quarter, I told you I'd take the first 90 days to evaluate the business. As you've heard today, that's well underway. Our top priority now is driving our business forward, executing on our transformation and returning greater shareholder value.
Given this focus, the board and I have determined that it is premature to initiate a CEO search at this time. We will let you know when we begin that process. And when we do, the board will be deliberate in its actions.
In closing, the new Teradata will empower companies to achieve high-impact business outcomes to analytics of scale on agile data foundations. We will be business outcome focused and consultative in our approach, serving as trusted advisers throughout the organization. As we look forward, we will develop world-class cloud capabilities and services to make Teradata available no matter where or how our customers want.
We find and execute our go-to-market strategy to optimize our revenue opportunity; provide analytical business solutions that deliver high-impact business outcomes; create an environment and culture that supports a nimble and effective organization driving innovation; and finally and very importantly, ensure our strategy delivers long-term revenue and earnings growth. 
I can assure you that we are advancing on all fronts and are underway executing against our transformation. And with that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

So on our go-to-market, we got in and I -- how do I say this, I don't have the whole half an hour to go through this. But I guess our go-to-market, one of the biggest eye-opening things I found was that we basically didn't support our field from a corporate perspective in terms of education or about where we were going in strategy. Our go-to-market approach, we didn't have any central approach or anything like that. So the initial thing of what we're doing is just simply getting back to real basic blocking and tackling from a go-to-market perspective, looking at our accounts and how we align, where we are and going at it. So that near term, it's that longer term. Obviously, we have to build out these capabilities. And this is one of the investments we have to make going forward is to get a back-end support for all of that. I think the second part of your question revolved around what is our targeted market. And I think I said in my opening comments and so just to be clear, we believe that in the top 400 or 500 accounts worldwide is our sweet spot. That's driven because of 2 reasons: One, they account for a huge percentage of the relevant technology spend for us. They also appreciate and want to help in very complicated analytic solutions, and we're capable of delivering that. And our share of wallet in those accounts, it's not just a number. But in the accounts we have, because we have been so resistant to change, they haven't looked for us to expand our presence. And I've got to tell you from my visits with early customers, just simply the fact that we admit that open sourcing this and Hadoop's there and where they are and that the cloud is coming has made them much more receptive to doing business with Teradata. So on all fronts, I think we're at it. It's a little what I said, some of it will come earlier, some of it will take a little longer. But I really am quite enthused about what I found about our people, our technology and our customers' reception to it. So I hope that answers that. We obviously owe you some more detail around this at the Analyst Meeting, and we'll do that. By nature, I only want to tell you what I know to be true, but I'd tell you that I know to be true that our customers, like us, that we have the capabilities. And I really am quite, quite thrilled. I told a lot of the folks around here, the worst thing that could happen from my perspective is that I would have walked in and found everything perfect, because they would have been hard to figure out where we were going to go. But we have a lot of near and long-term opportunities to return Teradata to where it should be, and our people are enthusiastic about it as well."

Yes, I'm going to take the question. Absolutely. In fact, when you look at how we look at cloud and our cloud-first strategy of how we develop technology and have been so for the last couple of quarters, it is not just that we run Tera technology in the cloud. It is really about the deployment options, DevOps, the agility that comes with that. We are now able to instantiate an entire ecosystem of multiple Teradata systems, Hadoop, Aster, QueryGrid, other technologies in as little as 25 minutes in a cloud. And what that allows us to do is if a business has an idea, wants to try something out, they can stand up an entire ecosystem within minutes in less than an hour. That previously would have taken them months or longer to go through capital requests, to install the systems, to load that data, to set everything up, right? So cloud brings a lot of opportunities to our technology. And they're very excited. And we're using it even internally. We have gone to a quarterly hackathon setup where we instantiate these kinds of technologies on a moments' notice, note data from customers and then interact with that data within a matter of hours and days, what would previously have taken a much longer time. So that is a big enabler for us to take our technology into new use cases said that previously we weren't agile enough to deploy that."

In fact, for the last several quarters, we have been testing very heavily MPP on the various cloud platforms. We are actually quite happy with the performance that we are seeing in the cloud.

We are seeing that the advantage that we have with the Teradata software, especially with the optimizer, scales extremely well in the cloud. We have seen that linear scale that we have in our on-premises solutions. It's just that the units in the cloud are usually smaller. You add more small units together to get to the same performance -- footprint that you have in a data center. But when we compare it note for note, compare to other technologies that are running the cloud, we see phenomenal performance. And in fact, we just took some of the industry analysts through it 2 months ago. And the feedback from them was just they were in awe, what kind of performance Teradata can produce in something like the AWS cloud. And we are seeing very similar performance on Azure. And yes, there's differences between AWS and Azure in terms of what their back end is. And that is reflected in the performance in there.

But remembering that we are a trusted adviser, one of the key things we had to do when we engage with a large company is that we have to make sure that we deliver what we say we will deliver and be able to deliver its scale. So we will do nothing that will compromise that. It is one of the key tenants we are going after. The most recent acquisition we did in Big Data is that jump to our Think Big, both of these companies. And they are -- ours are a open-source focus. And we are doing that to expand our footprint. As you know, all know that these very bright people are hard to find in the world. And we've had the good luck of being able to acquire some of them through acquisitions. There are smaller companies, very smart, aggressive, entrepreneurial people. And it also helps us increase -- the last one was to increase our footprint internationally. So we are open to whatever from our partner -- what partners we work with, but we are -- we want partners. And we want them that are consistent with our strategy.

But right now that's where we are. And then -- it's just because we're dealing with big customers, and that's what they all like about us. When I'm out talking to them, they all say, ""Well, you guys do what you say you're going to do, and it's scalable."" And I think a lot of our customers are starting to find out that Open Source and Hadoop are great. But that it requires smart people on top of them to make them work. And in some cases, there are people promising things that when they get in, they just simply aren't scalable. They can do them at a small scale, but when you got to get them up, they just don't work.

It is really reducing friction in installing Teradata systems. It is very much bringing cloud best practices into the data center, growing storage and compute independently. It also helps us internally simplify our development roadmaps and collapse various different product lines into IntelliFlex, which makes us more nimble, faster time to market. And it allows our customers to more precisely implement what they need and do that much, much faster. So the hardware business for Teradata, by the way, is not going away, right? The hybrid cloud, a strong back end is the on-premises solution. And we have enough indications from our large customers that they have no intention of moving everything into the cloud, right? And as such, they appreciate what we're doing with IntelliFlex. What we will be showing with IntelliFlex for the upcoming quarters is new technologies that we can implement with that. And we can bring those to market in a much, much faster way than we have done before. So a lot of excitement in the company around IntelliFlex. It allows us also with our managed cloud to bring IntelliFlex into there and have the same performance footprint that we have and on-premises solution. And that really opens up a lot of possibilities for us as a company."

I'm being cautious on that working capital number or that free cash flow number in the second half. So again, you'll see more details at the Analyst Day. And when -- on the back-office infrastructure side, it's really getting back to those comments Vic made on the sales support side. We need to become more efficient on having our account execs address the business solutions on a customer not spending time configuring hardware-type sales or product sales and getting that through the system. Again, this is getting more infrastructure support on the sales side to make them more efficient on the field. And we're also upfront making that support investment for the cloud business. So again, that revenue will be ramping up on predominantly, the subscription model. The upfront we call scaffolding or the infrastructure around that cloud will be growing in front of that revenue, so that we're not mitigating that or adversely impacting that revenue growth trajectory."

Teradata generated results better than our guided expectations in the second quarter. Excluding the Marketing Applications business, which we sold on July 1, 2016, Q2 revenue was $564 million, which was down 3% in constant currency on a comparable basis from Q2 2015.  Non-GAAP EPS was $0.71, a meaningful increase from the $0.53 in Q2 2015 due to the higher-than-expected revenue and the benefit of our cost management initiatives.
My comments today reflect Teradata's going forward business on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the Marketing Applications business in 2016, stock-based comp and other special items as identified in our earnings release. Just as we did last quarter on our website, we have provided a 2016 non-GAAP view of our result without the Marketing Applications business.
Turning to revenue by region. Excluding the Marketing Applications business in both 2015 and '16, revenues in the Americas region decreased 6% in constant currency. We continue to see headwinds in regard to large capital expenditures being approved, particularly in the U.S. Although we are working hard in our transformation, particularly on our hybrid cloud offerings and how we interface with and provide value to business users, we expect this headwind related to large IT capital expenditure projects to continue.
Our international region increased 2% in constant currency. Within international, EMEA revenue was down 3% in constant currency, while APJ revenue increased 10% in constant currency.
There's been a lot of attention on the impact of Brexit. I will provide a few specifics about our U.K. business. Revenue in the U.K. was up 3% in constant currency in the second quarter. We had good performance in the U.K. in Q2. However, we expect headwind in the second half of the year in the U.K. due to the devaluation of the British pound. To provide context in 2015, U.K. contributed less than 5% of Teradata's total revenue.
Turning to gross margins. Product gross margin in the second quarter was 60%, in line with our expectations, but down from the 65.6% in Q2 2015 due to deal mix. Services gross margin in the quarter was 48.5%, up from 46.3% in Q2 2015. Services margin improved due to better consulting margins as well as the exit of the Marketing Applications business. Overall gross margin was 53% in the second quarter compared to 54.3% in Q2 2015.
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $132 million was down 26% from Q2 last year. The decrease was primarily due to our cost management actions as well as the exit of the Marketing Applications business.
Research and development expense of $36 million in the quarter was down 31% from the prior period. The decrease was largely due to the cost management actions we commenced in Teradata Labs last year as well as the exit of the Marketing Apps business this year.
We continue to expect R&D expense for the full year to be down 10% to 15% as reported. However, due to the investments associated with our strategic growth initiatives, we expect R&D expense will increase on a comparative basis, excluding marketing apps as we move into the second half of the year as well as into 2017.
As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 23.2%, a strong increase from the 17.2% in Q2 2015. The improvement in operating margin was due to our cost management actions and higher services gross margin as well as the exit of the Marketing Applications business. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 27.1% comparable with the 27.6% in Q2 2015.
Looking forward, we expect our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27% with the actual tax rate being primarily dependent upon the ultimate earnings mix. GAAP EPS was $0.49 in Q2. This compared to a GAAP EPS loss of $1.87 in Q2 2015, which was driven by the goodwill impairment charge relating to the Marketing Applications business. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 compared to $0.53 in Q2 2015.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $99 million in Q2 2016 versus $80 million in the second quarter of 2015, due to a net favorable year-over-year changing working capital. In the second quarter, we had $27 million of capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software, the same as in the second quarter of 2015, resulting in free cash flow of $72 million versus $53 million in Q2 2015.
We continue to expect full year free cash flow to be equal to GAAP net income, excluding the impairment charges or up to $50 million higher, which at the high end of our range would approximate $270 million.
Moving now to the balance sheet. We had $909 million of cash as of June 30, 2016, of which more than 98% is held outside the U.S. This is down, slightly down from the $917 million as of March 31, 2016, as we used $80 million of cash in Q2 to completely pay off our revolving credit facility.
We moderated our repurchase activity in the second quarter as we had been quite active in Q1 as well as in 2015, which enabled us to get to the shares repurchase that we had planned for. During the first half of the year, we bought approximately 2.6 million shares of -- for a total cost of approximately $62 million. As of June 30, we had approximately $528 million of share repurchase authorization available.
Before I turn to guidance, I want to provide a little color commentary on what we see in the market. Our revenue has been impacted by our customers' focus on less capital-intensive options, like cloud and other alternatives, including other purchasing options, such as subscriptions, rental and other usage-based models. Many customers have delayed or reduced on-premise purchases and in order to evaluate Teradata's cloud -- public cloud and other consumption options. Our current outlook for Q3 and the remainder of the year includes new cloud opportunities with the vast majority with current -- with the vast majority with current Teradata users as they desire to start building out their hybrid cloud environments. This is a good start to our initiatives associated with different solutions and usage-based subscription offerings that make it easier for our customers to consume Teradata.
To provide more color, we are seeing an interest in our term rental or usage-based utility offers. For example, in Q2, we signed an $11 million contract with a well-known airline, utilizing our rental term offering that resulted in revenue being recognized ratably. In July, we closed a significant transaction with a large known -- well-known health care company using the utility based model in which revenue will be recognized based on usage. In addition, we have many other customers evaluating these usage-based pricing alternatives. This is not unexpected and is aligned with our transformation. But as you'll likely understand, this will begin to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons, as some of the revenue we would have normally recognized in a given quarter will now be spread over a number of periods.
That said, we were pleased with our Q2 results and expect Q3 revenue in the $550 million to $560 million range. We expect non-GAAP EPS to approximate $0.60 in Q3 as the benefits of our cost-reduction continue, but we will see the increased investment for our new initiatives reflected in our operating results beginning in the third quarter.
We expect product gross margin Q3 to be approximately 60%, and services margin in the mid-40s. We expect as reported total operating expenses to decrease approximately $20 million year-over-year in Q3 with reported R&D expense being up slightly year-over-year and up sequentially from Q2.
For the full year, we continue to expect revenue, excluding Marketing Applications business, to be in the $2.25 billion to $2.32 billion range. Although we had a good first half in the terms of EPS improvement, our full year expectation for non-GAAP EPS remains in the -- the same at $2.35 to $2.50 since we will begin to see the impact of our increased investments in our operating results in the second half of the year.
We have made good progress in our cost-reduction initiatives as you can see from our results and are now shifting from a cost-reduction phase to a more responsive cost-management phase as we properly invest for Teradata's future to better align with the changing marketplace.
Our future investments, which we will provide greater details on during our Analyst Day in November, will support our cloud offerings, our analytical solutions and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our infrastructure and support functions. Although these planned investments will begin to impact our results in the second half of 2016, they will become more meaningful in 2017.
In closing, market changes have disrupted business as usual for many companies. And the companies such as Teradata that have flourished in the past, must adapt. The good news is Teradata has best-in-class technology, smart and talented and customer-respected people, and outstanding customers tell us they are going to continue expanding their on-premise data environments, while also leveraging the cloud.  They're looking for us to deliver smarter, more flexible and easier to use options to consume Teradata. 
We are on it and fully intend to deliver both for our customers and our shareholders. Now I'll turn it back over to Vic."

I'd now like to provide an overview of our business at a level I am comfortable sharing at this point in time. First, our technology is strong and our customers want and need it. Our customers are among some of the largest and most agg",1931,"Thank you, Steve. I'd now like to provide an overview of our business at a level I am comfortable sharing at this point in time. 
First, our technology is strong and our customers want and need it. Our customers are among some of the largest and most aggressive users of analytics in the world. And they believe our offerings are a key part of their long-term strategy. They see us as a trusted adviser to help them sort out the best ways to deal with the explosion of data. They trust us because we bring scalable solutions that work. 
Second, I've seen firsthand that Teradata has very talented people who are the best at what they do. And they are hungry for change. They are passionate about our new direction, our technology and what we can do for our customers. And they know they are the best at bringing analytics and data together for the customers' advantage.
This isn't just my view, but the view of the customers I've had face-to-face meetings with.
So if this is true, why has our revenue been challenged? Our product has remained product-centric; and our sales approach, too IT focused. This is inconsistent with where the market is going. Some of our customers believe that we are unreceptive to the new ways they want to buy, consume and deploy technology. This is absolutely not true. And we are going to change this misconception. We have made dealing with us harder than it should be. We need to update our infrastructure so that we can be more efficient and more responsive in serving our customers. 
So the question is, what are we doing differently? We have refined our strategy to be even more customer-centric, giving customers what they want and how they want it. We will become more focused on business outcomes and be more consultative in our approach. We will be riveted on helping business users solve their challenges rather than leading with technology. This approach has been very well received by my initial customer visits, and will position us as a trusted adviser with both the business and technical leaders in our customers' organizations.
Our strategy is based around a core belief that analytics and data unleash the potential of great companies. To empower companies to achieve higher impact business outcomes, we will be providing differentiated business solutions and analytical architecture expertise that pull through our technology solutions. Our core database technology remains the key element of our strategy. And we will continue to deliver our best-in-class data analytics at scale.
Since business users are now a key buyer of analytics, we are shifting our emphasis towards delivering high-impact business solutions for our customers. In doing so, we will leverage a more consultive, solution-selling approach to identify and deliver value to business buyers, supported by our business and industry consulting.
In the Americas, we have restructured our business and industry-consulting practice into a more centralized organization, so we can leverage these resources across industries and deliver a consistent message to our customers. 
We see growing demand from business buyers for one-stop shop for analytics that can create high-value business outcomes. And many of our customers look to Teradata for this. We will focus our analytic consulting on solving customer challenges where we have expertise and assets. By capturing the IT from these engagements, we will be able to leverage these use cases with other companies. Our opportunity lies in our ability to scale and monetize these solutions.
As more companies begin to explore various open source, cloud and deployment alternatives, they need a partner that can help navigate and optimize their analytical architectures. Our years of implementation experience in enterprise-class analytic infrastructures and data integration, along with open-source experience brought by Think Big, enable us to help customers achieve their analytical business objectives.
We will provide broad technology architectural consulting and migration services to guide their data strategies by objectively discussing the benefits of open source, cloud and on-premise deployment options. Along with the optimal placement of data across the ecosystem, we can make their architecture easier to use and deliver solid benefits, thus giving them higher returns on their investments in technology and related solutions.
While having a flexible analytical ecosystem is increasingly important, our customers tell us they want to continue to rely on Teradata for sophisticated workloads. And our solutions, including on-prem systems, will continue to be a major component of their ecosystem.
In addition, in continuing to improve the performance and value of our market-leading database, we are aggressively extending our portfolio of technology solutions to deliver an end-to-end analytical ecosystem across the hybrid cloud architecture to accommodate our customer shifts and buying preferences towards the cloud.
Our cloud strategy is focused on delivering 3 types of offers. First, we have the Teradata software only available in the public cloud for the do-it-yourself segments that want to purchase Teradata software and deploy it on the public cloud. We have further accelerated our release of the Teradata Data Warehouse on AWS running MPP and expect it to be available on AWS later this quarter. 
This is not a scaled-down version of Teradata. It has the same performance benefits of our Teradata MPP on-prem system, rooted in our superior processing engine, shared nothing architecture and best-in-class performance optimizer. And in test of real world consumer queries, it proves much more powerful than any other major competing cloud database today.
Additionally, we are planning to release Teradata database on Microsoft Azure running MPP in Q4. And we will soon have Aster available on AWS.
Second, we have our hybrid cloud solution, which meets the needs of company -- companies who have hybrid, on premise and cloud environments either as an end-state goal or as an interim path towards 100% cloud deployment. 
Third, we are offering Teradata managed cloud solutions for the do-it-for-me segment of the market. This is the most strategic opportunity for Teradata in the cloud, where we are not just selling our technology, but rather providing a full managed solution. We will leverage not only our own data centers as hosting options, but also the public clouds to provide infrastructure-as-a-service capabilities to achieve broader reach and align with customer cloud preferences.
We will extend our managed cloud business with new entry level and higher performance/service level options. We are also on track to launch Teradata managed cloud in Europe later this quarter, thus expanding our reach globally. 
To accelerate our cloud strategy, we have fundamentally changed our development and engineering process to provide our customers with the rapid releases of functionality required to meet their business growth. Additionally, we have recruited top cloud talent to augment our team. As we are creating more flexible options to better align with how customers want to buy and deploy Teradata, we are also realigning our direct sales force with the biggest revenue opportunities and highest probabilities of success. These efforts will give our team more time with our customers, support better coordination and improve productivity. Further, we are going to see that our sales teams are properly supported, with the tools they need to properly explain our strategy to their customers. 
The largest companies in the world remain the best revenue opportunity for us, as they have the most complex analytical requirements and the need to scale. Further, they drive the vast majority of global IT spending. This is Teradata's sweet spot where we can provide differential capabilities to solve a broad range of problems and where our value proposition is most compelling.
But we haven't done a great job of capitalizing on the revenue opportunities here. For example, we have less than 40% of the Global 500 as our customers. And our share of wallet in these customers is smaller than it should be.
Concentrating on these larger revenue opportunities with a solution-oriented focus will require a very different sales approach in how we build the count plans and how we market to our customers. Evolving our go-to-market approach will better position Teradata with both business buyers and IT buyers and increase wallet share with our existing customers as well as add new ones. Business buyers will look to Teradata for analytic solutions tailored to their industry and business problems. Our new hybrid cloud will allow IT buyers to have the highest performance possible, deployed the most agile way and at the lowest cost of total ownership.
As we execute our strategy and ramp our business solutions in hybrid cloud offerings, we intend to make it easier for customers to procure and deploy Teradata by offering multiple and flexible consumption and pricing options. This is an area where we have more work to do to ensure that we deliver fair value to our customers, while at the same time, seeing that Teradata is properly rewarded for the value we would deliver. We will provide more information in this area on our Analyst Day.
During the presentation, we will be able to demonstrate that our initiatives have both near term and long-term returns. And while it is true that our complete strategy implementation will take time, it will not take long before you start to see the results of these implementations.
Steve pointed out that we have made good progress on our cost-reduction efforts and are now shifting to a responsive cost management process. We need to make sure our initiatives get the funding they require to better align with the changing marketplace. However, these investments will only be made if they accelerate the return of our revenue growth or reduce our cost footprint going forward.
To support our successful transformation, we are also making organizational changes to ensure that we have the right talent in the right positions, and we will continue to provide you with more information on these changes as well as our go-to-market approach.
I am well aware that simply creating plans does not make them happen. Rest assured, we have identified tests with clear owners and are defining measurable objectives to drive our long term success, while still focusing on short-term results. In order to provide more transparency to our transformation roadmap and success, we will provide actions, metrics and a multiyear financial model at our Analyst Day.
Last quarter, I told you I'd take the first 90 days to evaluate the business. As you've heard today, that's well underway. Our top priority now is driving our business forward, executing on our transformation and returning greater shareholder value.
Given this focus, the board and I have determined that it is premature to initiate a CEO search at this time. We will let you know when we begin that process. And when we do, the board will be deliberate in its actions.
In closing, the new Teradata will empower companies to achieve high-impact business outcomes through analytics of scale on agile data foundations. We will be business-outcome-focused and consultative in our approach, serving as trusted advisers throughout the organization. As we look forward, we will develop world-class cloud capabilities and services to make Teradata available no matter where or how our customers want.
Refine and execute our go-to-market strategy to optimize our revenue opportunity; provide analytical business solutions that deliver high-impact business outcomes; create an environment and culture that supports a nimble and effective organization driving innovation; and finally and very importantly, ensure our strategy delivers long-term revenue and earnings growth. 
I can assure you that we are advancing on all fronts and are underway executing against our transformation. And with that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

So on our go-to-market, we got in and I -- how do I say this, I don't have the whole half an hour to go through this. But I guess our go-to-market, one of the biggest eye-opening things I found was that we basically didn't support our field from a corporate perspective in terms of education or about where we were going in strategy. Our go-to-market approach, we didn't have any central approach or anything like that. So the initial thing of what we're doing is just simply getting back to real basic blocking and tackling from a go-to-market perspective, looking at our accounts and how we align, where we are and going at it. So that near term, it's that longer term. Obviously, we have to build out these capabilities. And this is one of the investments we have to make going forward is to get a back-end support for all of that. I think the second part of your question revolved around what is our targeted market. And I think I said in my opening comments and so just to be clear, we believe that in the top 400 or 500 accounts worldwide is our sweet spot. That's driven because of 2 reasons: One, they account for a huge percentage of the relevant technology spend for us. They also appreciate and want to help in very complicated analytic solutions, and we're capable of delivering that. And our share of wallet in those accounts, it's not just a number. But in the accounts we have, because we have been so resistant to change, they haven't looked for us to expand our presence. And I've got to tell you from my visits with early customers, just simply the fact that we admit that open source exists and Hadoop's there and where they are and that the cloud is coming has made them much more receptive to doing business with Teradata. So on all fronts, I think we're at it. It's a little what I said, some of it will come earlier, some of it will take a little longer. But I really am quite enthused about what I found about our people, our technology and our customers' reception to it. So I hope that answers that. We obviously owe you some more detail around this at the Analyst Meeting, and we'll do that. By nature, I only want to tell you what I know to be true, but I'd tell you that I know to be true that our customers like us that we have the capabilities. And I really am quite, quite thrilled. I told a lot of the folks around here, the worst thing that could happen from my perspective is that I would have walked in and found everything perfect, because then it would have been hard to figure out where we were going to go. But we have a lot of near and long-term opportunities to return Teradata to where it should be, and our people are enthusiastic about it as well."

Yes, I'm going to take the question. Absolutely. In fact, when you look at how we look at cloud and our cloud-first strategy of how we develop technology and have been so for the last couple of quarters, it is not just that we run Tera technology in the cloud. It is really about the deployment options, DevOps, the agility that comes with that. We are now able to instantiate an entire ecosystem of multiple Teradata systems, Hadoop, Aster, QueryGrid, other technologies in as little as 25 minutes in a cloud. And what that allows us to do is if a business has an idea, wants to try something out, they can stand up an entire ecosystem within minutes in less than an hour. That previously would have taken them months or longer to go through capital requests, to install the systems, to load that data, to set everything up, right? So cloud brings a lot of opportunities to our technology. And they're very excited. And we're using it even internally. We have gone to a quarterly hackathon setup where we instantiate these kinds of technologies on a moments' notice, note data from customers and then interact with that data within a matter of hours and days, what would previously have taken a much longer time. So that is a big enabler for us to take our technology into new use cases that previously we weren't agile enough to deploy that."

We are seeing that the advantage that we have with the Teradata software, especially with the optimizer, scales extremely well in the cloud. We have seen that linear scale that we have in our on-premises solutions. It's just that the units in the cloud are usually smaller. You add more small units together to get to the same performance footprint that you have in a data center. But when we compare it note for note, compare to other technologies that are running the cloud, we see phenomenal performance. And in fact, we just took some of the industry analysts through it 2 months ago. And the feedback from them was just they were in awe, what kind of performance Teradata can produce in something like the AWS cloud. And we are seeing very similar performance on Azure.

But right now that's where we are. And then -- it's just because we're dealing with big customers, and that's what they all like about us. When I'm out talking to them, they all say, ""Well, you guys do what you say you're going to do, and it's scalable."" And I think a lot of our customers are starting to find out that Open Source and Hadoop are great. But that it requires smart people on top of them to make them work. And in some cases, there are people promising things that when they get in, they just simply aren't scalable. They can do them at a small scale, but when you got to get them up, they just don't work. And so this is one of our key differentiating points in the market. And so we are not going to sacrifice that."

I know it seems hard at times to believe, and it was hard for me a little bit at first when I got out. But I -- the 2 key issues I heard from customers when it came down was one, ""So you guys are going to go to the cloud. You understand that there's new things coming. You're going to help us work with that."" And I said, ""Yes, we're going to."" The amount of uncertainty there was about that in the marketplace surprised me. And I think a lot of our customers actually were worried about that. And I think the second issue that came down and it's -- they were thrilled to hear and that is that we are committed to driving this business forward. Teradata's going to be around for a long time. We are going to be their partner and be there to help them. And I think just hearing that has made them more receptive and it's been easier for our folks to get in. So when I say I'm enthusiastic about it, I really am. I mean it's not that -- we've got to perform. We've got to do what we say we can do. We've got to do all this stuff we're talking about, right? But we have the capability and the people already inside the business to execute this strategy. And are we going to need more of them going forward? Sure. But that more will be when we leverage and grow revenues. We're just going to have them in the field. So I'm really enthusiastic. Our -- the guys we get in with Open Source, from Think Big are great. They're smart, they're fast. People love them. So people are viewing us because we are coming with real offerings that demonstrate a different Teradata. And so I think that's helped us a lot."

It is really reducing friction in installing Teradata systems. It is very much bringing cloud best practices into the data center, growing storage and compute independently. It also helps us internally simplify our development roadmaps and collapse various different product lines into IntelliFlex, which makes us more nimble, faster time to market. And it allows our customers to more precisely implement what they need and do that much, much faster. So the hardware business for Teradata, by the way, is not going away, right? The hybrid cloud, a strong back end is the on-premises solution. And we have enough indications from our large customers that they have no intention of moving everything into the cloud, right? And as such, they appreciate what we're doing with IntelliFlex. And what we will be showing with IntelliFlex for the upcoming quarters is new technologies that we can implement with that. And we can bring those to market in a much, much faster way than we have done before. So a lot of excitement in the company around IntelliFlex.

Teradata generated results better than our guided expectations in the second quarter. Excluding the Marketing Applications business, which we sold on July 1, 2016, Q2 revenue was $564 million, which was down 3% in constant currency on a comparable basis from Q2 2015.  Non-GAAP EPS was $0.71, a meaningful increase from the $0.53 in Q2 2015 due to the higher-than-expected revenue and the benefit of our cost management initiatives.
My comments today reflect Teradata's going forward business on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the Marketing Applications business in 2016, stock-based comp and other special items as identified in our earnings release. Just as we did last quarter on our website, we have provided a 2016 non-GAAP view of our result without the Marketing Applications business.
Turning to revenue by region. Excluding the Marketing Applications business in both 2015 and '16, revenues in the Americas region decreased 6% in constant currency. We continue to see headwinds in regard to large capital expenditures being approved, particularly in the U.S. Although we are working hard in our transformation, particularly on our hybrid cloud offerings and how we interface with and provide value to business users, we expect this headwind related to large IT capital expenditure projects to continue.
Our international region increased 2% in constant currency. Within international, EMEA revenue was down 3% in constant currency, while APJ revenue increased 10% in constant currency.
There's been a lot of attention on the impact of Brexit. I will provide a few specifics about our U.K. business. Revenue in the U.K. was up 3% in constant currency in the second quarter. We had good performance in the U.K. in Q2. However, we expect headwind in the second half of the year in the U.K. due to the devaluation of the British pound. To provide context in 2015, U.K. contributed less than 5% of Teradata's total revenue.
Turning to gross margins. Product gross margin in the second quarter was 60%, in line with our expectations, but down from the 65.6% in Q2 2015 due to deal mix. Services gross margin in the quarter was 48.5%, up from 46.3% in Q2 2015. Services margin improved due to better consulting margins as well as the exit of the Marketing Applications business. Overall gross margin was 53% in the second quarter compared to 54.3% in Q2 2015.
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $132 million was down 26% from Q2 last year. The decrease was primarily due to our cost management actions as well as the exit of the Marketing Applications business.
Research and development expense of $36 million in the quarter was down 31% from the prior period. The decrease was largely due to the cost management actions we commenced in Teradata Labs last year as well as the exit of the Marketing Apps business this year.
We continue to expect R&D expense for the full year to be down 10% to 15% as reported. However, due to the investments associated with our strategic growth initiatives, we expect R&D expense will increase on a comparative basis, excluding marketing apps as we move into the second half of the year as well as into 2017.
As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 23.2%, a strong increase from the 17.2% in Q2 2015. The improvement in operating margin was due to our cost management actions and higher services gross margin as well as the exit of the Marketing Applications business. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 27.1% comparable with the 27.6% in Q2 2015.
Looking forward, we expect our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27% with the actual tax rate being primarily dependent upon the ultimate earnings mix. GAAP EPS was $0.49 in Q2. This compared to a GAAP EPS loss of $1.87 in Q2 2015, which was driven by the goodwill impairment charge relating to the Marketing Applications business. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 compared to $0.53 in Q2 2015.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $99 million in Q2 2016 versus $80 million in the second quarter of 2015, due to a net favorable year-over-year changing working capital. In the second quarter, we had $27 million of capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software, the same as in the second quarter of 2015, resulting in free cash flow of $72 million versus $53 million in Q2 2015.
We continue to expect full year free cash flow to be equal to GAAP net income, excluding the impairment charges or up to $50 million higher, which at the high end of our range would approximate $270 million.
Moving now to the balance sheet. We had $909 million of cash as of June 30, 2016, of which more than 98% is held outside the U.S. This is down, slightly down from the $917 million as of March 31, 2016, as we used $80 million of cash in Q2 to completely pay off our revolving credit facility.
We moderated our repurchase activity in the second quarter as we had been quite active in Q1 as well as in 2015, which enabled us to get to the shares repurchase that we had planned for. During the first half of the year, we bought approximately 2.6 million shares of -- for a total cost of approximately $62 million. As of June 30, we had approximately $528 million of share repurchase authorization available.
Before I turn to guidance, I want to provide a little color commentary on what we see in the market. Our revenue has been impacted by our customers' focus on less capital-intensive options, like cloud and other alternatives, including other purchasing options, such as subscriptions, rental and other usage-based models. Many customers have delayed or reduced on-premise purchases and in order to evaluate Teradata's cloud -- public cloud and other consumption options. Our current outlook for Q3 and the remainder of the year includes new cloud opportunities with the vast majority with current -- with the vast majority with current Teradata users as they desire to start building out their hybrid cloud environments. This is a good start to our initiatives associated with different solutions and usage-based subscription offerings that make it easier for our customers to consume Teradata.
To provide more color, we are seeing an interest in our term rental or usage-based utility offers. For example, in Q2, we signed an $11 million contract with a well-known airline, utilizing our rental term offering that resulted in revenue being recognized ratably. In July, we closed a significant transaction with a large known -- well-known health care company using the utility based model in which revenue will be recognized based on usage. In addition, we have many other customers evaluating these usage-based pricing alternatives. This is not unexpected and is aligned with our transformation. But as you'll likely understand, this will begin to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons, as some of the revenue we would have normally recognized in a given quarter will now be spread over a number of periods.
That said, we were pleased with our Q2 results and expect Q3 revenue in the $550 million to $560 million range. We expect non-GAAP EPS to approximate $0.60 in Q3 as the benefits of our cost-reduction continue, but we will see the increased investment for our new initiatives reflected in our operating results beginning in the third quarter.
We expect product gross margin Q3 to be approximately 60%, and services margin in the mid-40s. We expect as reported total operating expenses to decrease approximately $20 million year-over-year in Q3 with reported R&D expense being up slightly year-over-year and up sequentially from Q2.
For the full year, we continue to expect revenue, excluding Marketing Applications business, to be in the $2.25 billion to $2.32 billion range. Although we had a good first half in the terms of EPS improvement, our full year expectation for non-GAAP EPS remains in the -- the same at $2.35 to $2.50 since we will begin to see the impact of our increased investments in our operating results in the second half of the year.
We have made good progress in our cost-reduction initiatives as you can see from our results and are now shifting from a cost-reduction phase to a more responsive cost-management phase as we properly invest for Teradata's future to better align with the changing marketplace.
Our future investments, which we will provide greater details on during our Analyst Day in November, will support our cloud offerings, our analytical solutions and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our infrastructure and support functions. Although these planned investments will begin to impact our results in the second half of 2016, they will become more meaningful in 2017.
In closing, market changes have disrupted business as usual for many companies. And the companies such as Teradata that have flourished in the past, must adapt. The good news is Teradata has best-in-class technology, smart and talented and customer-respected people, and outstanding customers tell us they are going to continue expanding their on-premise data environments, while also leveraging the cloud.  They're looking for us to deliver smarter, more flexible and easier to use options to consume Teradata. 
We are on it and fully intend to deliver both for our customers and our shareholders. Now I'll turn it back over to Vic."

And they believe our offerings are a key part of their long-term strategy. They see us as a trusted adviser to help them sort out the best ways to deal with the explosion of data. They trust us because we bring scalable solutions that work. 
Second, I've seen firsthand that Teradata has very talented people who are the best at what they do. And they are hungry for change. They are passionate about our new direction, our technology and what we can do for our customers. And they know they are the best at bringing analytics and data together for the customers' advantage.
This isn't just my view, but the view of the customers I've had face-to-face meetings with.
So if this is true, why has our revenue been challenged? Our product has remained product-centric; and our sales approach, too IT focused. This is inconsistent with where the market is going. Some of our customers believe that we are unreceptive to the new ways they want to buy, consume and deploy technology. This is absolutely not true. And we are going to change this misconception. We have made dealing with us harder than it should be. We need to update our infrastructure so that we can be more efficient and more responsive in serving our customers. 
So the question is, what are we doing differently? We have refined our strategy to be even more customer-centric, giving customers what they want and how they want it. We will become more focused on business outcomes and be more consultative in our approach. We will be riveted on helping business users solve their challenges rather than leading with technology. This approach has been very well received by my initial customer visits, and will position us as a trusted adviser with both the business and technical leaders in our customers' organizations.
Our strategy is based around a core belief that analytics and data unleash the potential of great companies. To empower companies to achieve higher impact business outcomes, we will be providing differentiated business solutions and analytical architecture expertise that pull through our technology solutions. Our core database technology remains the key element of our strategy. And we will continue to deliver our best-in-class data analytics at scale.
Since business users are now a key buyer of analytics, we are shifting our emphasis towards delivering high-impact business solutions for our customers. In doing so, we will leverage a more consultive, solution-selling approach to identify and deliver value to business buyers, supported by our business and industry consulting.
In the Americas, we have restructured our business and industry-consulting practice into a more centralized organization, so we can leverage these resources across industries and deliver a consistent message to our customers. 
We see growing demand from business buyers for one-stop shop for analytics that can create high-value business outcomes. And many of our customers look to Teradata for this. We will focus our analytic consulting on solving customer challenges where we have expertise and assets. By capturing the IT from these engagements, we will be able to leverage these use cases with other companies. Our opportunity lies in our ability to scale and monetize these solutions.
As more companies begin to explore various open source, cloud and deployment alternatives, they need a partner that can help navigate and optimize their analytical architectures. Our years of implementation experience in enterprise-class analytic infrastructures and data integration, along with open-source experience brought by Think Big, enable us to help customers achieve their analytical business objectives.
We will provide broad technology architectural consulting and migration services to guide their data strategies by objectively discussing the benefits of open source, cloud and on-premise deployment options. Along with the optimal placement of data across the ecosystem, we can make their architecture easier to use and deliver solid benefits, thus giving them higher returns on their investments in technology and related solutions.
While having a flexible analytical ecosystem is increasingly important, our customers tell us they want to continue to rely on Teradata for sophisticated workloads. And our solutions, including on-prem systems, will continue to be a major component of their ecosystem.
In addition, in continuing to improve the performance and value of our market-leading database, we are aggressively extending our portfolio of technology solutions to deliver an end-to-end analytical ecosystem across the hybrid cloud architecture to accommodate our customer shifts and buying preferences towards the cloud.
Our cloud strategy is focused on delivering 3 types of offers. First, we have the Teradata software only available in the public cloud for the do-it-yourself segments that want to purchase Teradata software and deploy it on the public cloud. We have further accelerated our release of the Teradata Data Warehouse on AWS running MPP and expect it to be available on AWS later this quarter. 
This is not a scaled-down version of Teradata. It has the same performance benefits of our Teradata MPP on-prem system, rooted in our superior processing engine, shared nothing architecture and best-in-class performance optimizer. And in test of real world consumer queries, it proves much more powerful than any other major competing cloud database today.
Additionally, we are planning to release Teradata database on Microsoft Azure running MPP in Q4. And we will soon have Aster available on AWS.
Second, we have our hybrid cloud solution, which meets the needs of company -- companies who have hybrid, on premise and cloud environments either as an end-state goal or as an interim path towards 100% cloud deployment. 
Third, we are offering Teradata managed cloud solutions for the do-it-for-me segment of the market. This is the most strategic opportunity for Teradata in the cloud, where we are not just selling our technology, but rather providing a full managed solution. We will leverage not only our own data centers as hosting options, but also the public clouds to provide infrastructure-as-a-service capabilities to achieve broader reach and align with customer cloud preferences.
We will extend our managed cloud business with new entry level and higher performance/service level options. We are also on track to launch Teradata managed cloud in Europe later this quarter, thus expanding our reach globally. 
To accelerate our cloud strategy, we have fundamentally changed our development and engineering process to provide our customers with the rapid releases of functionality required to meet their business growth. Additionally, we have recruited top cloud talent to augment our team. As we are creating more flexible options to better align with how customers want to buy and deploy Teradata, we are also realigning our direct sales force with the biggest revenue opportunities and highest probabilities of success. These efforts will give our team more time with our customers, support better coordination and improve productivity. Further, we are going to see that our sales teams are properly supported, with the tools they need to properly explain our strategy to their customers. 
The largest companies in the world remain the best revenue opportunity for us, as they have the most complex analytical requirements and the need to scale. Further, they drive the vast majority of global IT spending. This is Teradata's sweet spot where we can provide differential capabilities to solve a broad range of problems and where our value proposition is most compelling.
But we haven't done a great job of capitalizing on the revenue opportunities here. For example, we have less than 40% of the Global 500 as our customers. And our share of wallet in these customers is smaller than it should be.
Concentrating on these larger revenue opportunities with a solution-oriented focus will require a very different sales approach in how we build the count plans and how we market to our customers. Evolving our go-to-market approach will better position Teradata with both business buyers and IT buyers and increase wallet share with our existing customers as well as add new ones. Business buyers will look to Teradata for analytic solutions tailored to their industry and business problems. Our new hybrid cloud will allow IT buyers to have the highest performance possible, deployed the most agile way and at the lowest cost of total ownership.
As we execute our strategy and ramp our business solutions in hybrid cloud offerings, we intend to make it easier for customers to procure and deploy Teradata by offering multiple and flexible consumption and pricing options. This is an area where we have more work to do to ensure that we deliver fair value to our customers, while at the same time, seeing that Teradata is properly rewarded for the value we would deliver. We will provide more information in this area on our Analyst Day.
During the presentation, we will be able to demonstrate that our initiatives have both near term and long-term returns. And while it is true that our complete strategy implementation will take time, it will not take long before you start to see the results of these implementations.
Steve pointed out that we have made good progress on our cost-reduction efforts and are now shifting to a responsive cost management process. We need to make sure our initiatives get the funding they require to better align with the changing marketplace. However, these investments will only be made if they accelerate the return of our revenue growth or reduce our cost footprint going forward.
To support our successful transformation, we are also making organizational changes to ensure that we have the right talent in the right positions, and we will continue to provide you with more information on these changes as well as our go-to-market approach.
I am well aware that simply creating plans does not make them happen. Rest assured, we have identified tests with clear owners and are defining measurable objectives to drive our long term success, while still focusing on short-term results. In order to provide more transparency to our transformation roadmap and success, we will provide actions, metrics and a multiyear financial model at our Analyst Day.
Last quarter, I told you I'd take the first 90 days to evaluate the business. As you've heard today, that's well underway. Our top priority now is driving our business forward, executing on our transformation and returning greater shareholder value.
Given this focus, the board and I have determined that it is premature to initiate a CEO search at this time. We will let you know when we begin that process. And when we do, the board will be deliberate in its actions.
In closing, the new Teradata will empower companies to achieve high-impact business outcomes through analytics of scale on agile data foundations. We will be business-outcome-focused and consultative in our approach, serving as trusted advisers throughout the organization. As we look forward, we will develop world-class cloud capabilities and services to make Teradata available no matter where or how our customers want.
Refine and execute our go-to-market strategy to optimize our revenue opportunity; provide analytical business solutions that deliver high-impact business outcomes; create an environment and culture that supports a nimble and effective organization driving innovation; and finally and very importantly, ensure our strategy delivers long-term revenue and earnings growth. 
I can assure you that we are advancing on all fronts and are underway executing against our transformation. And with that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

So on our go-to-market, we got in and I -- how do I say this, I don't have the whole half an hour to go through this. But I guess our go-to-market, one of the biggest eye-opening things I found was that we basically didn't support our field from a corporate perspective in terms of education or about where we were going in strategy. Our go-to-market approach, we didn't have any central approach or anything like that. So the initial thing of what we're doing is just simply getting back to real basic blocking and tackling from a go-to-market perspective, looking at our accounts and how we align, where we are and going at it. So that near term, it's that longer term. Obviously, we have to build out these capabilities. And this is one of the investments we have to make going forward is to get a back-end support for all of that. I think the second part of your question revolved around what is our targeted market. And I think I said in my opening comments and so just to be clear, we believe that in the top 400 or 500 accounts worldwide is our sweet spot. That's driven because of 2 reasons: One, they account for a huge percentage of the relevant technology spend for us. They also appreciate and want to help in very complicated analytic solutions, and we're capable of delivering that. And our share of wallet in those accounts, it's not just a number. But in the accounts we have, because we have been so resistant to change, they haven't looked for us to expand our presence. And I've got to tell you from my visits with early customers, just simply the fact that we admit that open source exists and Hadoop's there and where they are and that the cloud is coming has made them much more receptive to doing business with Teradata. So on all fronts, I think we're at it. It's a little what I said, some of it will come earlier, some of it will take a little longer. But I really am quite enthused about what I found about our people, our technology and our customers' reception to it. So I hope that answers that. We obviously owe you some more detail around this at the Analyst Meeting, and we'll do that. By nature, I only want to tell you what I know to be true, but I'd tell you that I know to be true that our customers like us that we have the capabilities. And I really am quite, quite thrilled. I told a lot of the folks around here, the worst thing that could happen from my perspective is that I would have walked in and found everything perfect, because then it would have been hard to figure out where we were going to go. But we have a lot of near and long-term opportunities to return Teradata to where it should be, and our people are enthusiastic about it as well."

In fact, when you look at how we look at cloud and our cloud-first strategy of how we develop technology and have been so for the last couple of quarters, it is not just that we run Tera technology in the cloud. It is really about the deployment options, DevOps, the agility that comes with that. We are now able to instantiate an entire ecosystem of multiple Teradata systems, Hadoop, Aster, QueryGrid, other technologies in as little as 25 minutes in a cloud. And what that allows us to do is if a business has an idea, wants to try something out, they can stand up an entire ecosystem within minutes in less than an hour. That previously would have taken them months or longer to go through capital requests, to install the systems, to load that data, to set everything up, right? So cloud brings a lot of opportunities to our technology. And they're very excited. And we're using it even internally. We have gone to a quarterly hackathon setup where we instantiate these kinds of technologies on a moments' notice, note data from customers and then interact with that data within a matter of hours and days, what would previously have taken a much longer time. So that is a big enabler for us to take our technology into new use cases that previously we weren't agile enough to deploy that."

I -- we need to work down this, figure out where it is and then figure out exactly what -- when is the right time to start that CEO search and when we should do. I will reiterate that when we do that, there are internal candidates. And then the board will be deliberate in what they do. Obviously, they have what they have to go through. But I guess, just we have a lot going on right now. And it's making progress, we are getting traction. And the board ask and I agree that we will think about that when the time is right. But we don't want to lose focus on the traction we've got going and the progress we're making. I still remain enthused about this and excited to go forward. So when the time comes, we'll make that announcement and go forward. But for right now, that's where we are. And when the time's right, we'll do it.

In fact, for the last several quarters, we have been testing very heavily MPP on the various cloud platforms. We are actually quite happy with the performance that we are seeing in the cloud. In fact, we have done benchmarks where we compare against other leading offerings in the cloud. And we see that we consistently outperform the other offerings by orders of magnitudes. We are seeing that the advantage that we have with the Teradata software, especially with the optimizer, scales extremely well in the cloud. We have seen that linear scale that we have in our on-premises solutions. It's just that the units in the cloud are usually smaller. You add more small units together to get to the same performance footprint that you have in a data center. But when we compare it note for note, compare to other technologies that are running the cloud, we see phenomenal performance. And in fact, we just took some of the industry analysts through it 2 months ago. And the feedback from them was just they were in awe, what kind of performance Teradata can produce in something like the AWS cloud. And we are seeing very similar performance on Azure. And yes, there's differences between AWS and Azure in terms of what their back end is. And that is reflected in the performance in there. But whatever the performance is that we see in the cloud, we can leverage it to its maximum."

So yes, we have done a broad -- most of our service implementationers have. We've used others. The answer to the question, and I'm not trying to be cute about this, is that we have to look at it business case by business case. But -- and figure out what we do, we'll do whatever makes sense. But remembering that we are a trusted adviser, one of the key things we have to do when we engage with a large company is that we have to make sure that we deliver what we say we will deliver and be able to deliver it at scale. So we will do nothing that will compromise that. It is one of the key tenants we are going after. The most recent acquisition we did in big data is that jump to our Think Big, both of these companies. And they are -- ours are open-source focused. And we are doing that to expand our footprint. As you know, all know that these very bright people are hard to find in the world. And we've had the good luck of being able to acquire some of them through acquisitions. There are smaller companies, very smart, aggressive, entrepreneurial people. And it also helps us increase -- the last one was just to increase our footprint internationally. So we are open to whatever from our partner -- what partners we work with, but we are -- we want partners. And we want them that are consistent with our strategy. And I get back to that, the key tenant for us is simply that we have to be able to deliver what we say we can at scale without any hiccups. And so we'll do whatever makes sense. But right now that's where we are. And then -- it's just because we're dealing with big customers, and that's what they all like about us. When I'm out talking to them, they all say, ""Well, you guys do what you say you're going to do, and it's scalable."" And I think a lot of our customers are starting to find out that Open Source and Hadoop are great. But that it requires smart people on top of them to make them work. And in some cases, there are people promising things that when they get in, they just simply aren't scalable. They can do them at a small scale, but when you got to get them up, they just don't work. And so this is one of our key differentiating points in the market. And so we are not going to sacrifice that."

I know it seems hard at times to believe, and it was hard for me a little bit at first when I got out.

You're going to help us work with that."" And I said, ""Yes, we're going to."" The amount of uncertainty there was about that in the marketplace surprised me.

We are going to be their partner and be there to help them. And I think just hearing that has made them more receptive and it's been easier for our folks to get in.

It also helps us internally simplify our development roadmaps and collapse various different product lines into IntelliFlex, which makes us more nimble, faster time to market. And it allows our customers to more precisely implement what they need and do that much, much faster. So the hardware business for Teradata, by the way, is not going away, right? The hybrid cloud, a strong back end is the on-premises solution. And we have enough indications from our large customers that they have no intention of moving everything into the cloud, right? And as such, they appreciate what we're doing with IntelliFlex. And what we will be showing with IntelliFlex for the upcoming quarters is new technologies that we can implement with that.

These risk factors are described in Teradata's 10-K, 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.

So I'd like to thank all of the Teradata folks for the great efforts you put forth, and look forward to you doing the same in the fourth quarter. 
Our team, as you all know, is engaged, and we are riveted on getting our strategy fully implemented and executing it starting at the beginning of the year. Our 3 major tenants have not changed, we continue to focus on business analytics, ecosystem architecture consulting and hybrid cloud solutions. This leverages our strong technology foundation that our customers rely on today. 
We are transforming our go-to-market approach, focusing more on our largest opportunities and concentrating primarily on driving business value for our business users. That is important for us as we look to the new Teradata because our customers are becoming increasingly interested in business outcomes supported by strong technology as opposed to starting with technology and trying to find business outcomes that support those. 
We have been successful, obviously, in managing our cost. As you can tell from our better-than-expected non-GAAP EPS for the last quarter. This will help us pay for some of the investments that we are going to make as we go forward to build and support the new Teradata. 
As you know, I'm not on the call today, my portion is being prerecorded. I am in San Diego with our team working on the operational factors that are necessary to make sure our strategy is successful. I thought given that we are going to be get together soon, my time would be better spent here driving our strategy and our operational impacts forward than they would be on the call.

It was encouraging that our team delivered a solid quarter with revenue in line with our guidance range and EPS better-than-expected while our team is embracing and executing the significant changes we are making at Teradata. My comments today regarding our operating results reflect Teradata's going forward business on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the Marketing Applications business for both 2016 and 2015.  Stock-based compensation and other special items as identified in our earnings release are also excluded. 
We have provided a non-GAAP year-over-year results in our website, which reconciles to our reported GAAP results. We've also provided a new multi-period historical schedule on our website which provides our non-GAAP results, excluding the Marketing Applications business reconcile to the GAAP results for each period. 
We reported revenue of $552 million in the third quarter, which on a comparable basis was down 3% from Q3 2015. 
During Q3, we began to see increased activity associated with those subscription pricing programs. Specifically, estimating the perpetually equivalent of the subscription-based transactions in Q3, 2016's Q3 revenue would have been slightly higher than last year's Q3. 
Compared to Q3 2015, product revenue was down 10% in both reported and constant currency. Consulting revenue was flat or up 1% in constant currency and maintenance revenue was up 5%, up 4% in constant currency. 
Revenues in the Americas region decreased 9% as reported, 8% in constant currency as customers continue to evaluate lower cost but lower-performing alternatives as well as Teradata's new deployment options. 
Revenue from our international region increased 6% in both reported and constant currency. Within international, EMEA revenue increased 16% as reported, 20% in constant currency, led by solid growth in Eastern Europe while APJ revenue decreased 5% as reported, 10% in constant currency, primarily in Japan and China. 
Product gross margin in the third quarter was 65.4%, a 510 basis point increase from 60.3% in Q3 2015. The increase in product gross margin was primarily due to favorable product and deal mix as well as less amortization of capitalized software development costs. 
Services gross margin recorded was a solid 47.1% compared to 47.9% in Q3 2015. Overall, gross margin was 54% in the third quarter and increased from the 53% in the third quarter of 2015. 
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $134 million was down $14 million or 9% from $148 million of the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to our cost management actions to align the investments to the areas that will drive sustainable revenue and profitable growth lin the future and help fund the investments we're making to support our transformation. 
Research and development expense, on the other hand, was up 17% to $42 million versus the $36 million in the third quarter of 2015. We are increasing and will continue to increase our investments in R&D to enhance Teradata's future profitability. 
In Q3, we began to compare with prior year periods when we started to rationalize R&D spend. So although year-to-date, R&D expense was down $10 million or 8%, we expect a meaningful increase in R&D expense in Q4, largely due to the effects of capitalized software, which will result in a slight increase in full year R&D expense year-over-year. 
Total R&D spend for the third quarter, which includes R&D expense plus the additions to capitalized software, development cost from the cash flow statement, less capitalization of internally-developed software, was $58 million versus $55 million in 2015. 
Total expenses in the third quarter was $176 million, down 4%, even with the 17% increase in R&D expense. 
As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 22.1%, a good improvement from the 20.6% operating margin in Q3 2015. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 24%, lower than the 26% non-GAAP tax rate in Q3 of 2015. The reduction in the effective tax rate year-over-year is a result of an increase in forecasted foreign earnings mix period over period. 
On a year-to-date basis, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 27% or flat compared to the same period in 2015. 
We continue to expect our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to approximate 27%, with the XO tax rate being dependent upon the ultimate earnings mix. 
Non-GAAP EPS is $0.69 was a meaningful increase from the $0.60 in Q3 2015, which was primarily due to our ongoing cost management initiatives. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $45 million in Q3 2016 versus $68 million in the third quarter of 2015. 
Year-to-date, cash from operating activities was $395 million versus $370 million generated during the same period in 2015. The fluctuation in cash from operating activities on a comparable basis, both for the quarter and year-to-date was a result of timing differences relating to net working capital period-over-period. 
In the third quarter, we had $33 million of capital expenditures, including capitalized software versus $35 million in the third quarter of 2015, resulting in free cash flow of $12 million versus the $33 million generated in Q3 of 2015. 
Free cash flow for the 9 months was $309 million versus the $276 million generated in the same period of 2015. 
Keep in mind, our investments to support our transformation will increase in the fourth quarter and more meaningfully in 2017. As a result, we are likely to have a negative free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2016.  We expect full year free cash flow to approximate $290 million. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We had $988 million of cash as of September 30, 2016. This is up from the $909 million at the end of the second quarter of 2016 and up from the $874 million from September 30, 2015.  Of the $988 million of cash, substantially all was held outside the United States. 
At the end of the third quarter, we had term debt of $578 million. We had no outstanding borrowings on our $400 million revolving credit facility, which gives us short term borrowing flexibility. 
Turning to guidance. And this will be sensitive to the rate of customers' adoption to our new subscription pricing programs and cloud. We expect Q4 revenue in the $620 million to $640 million range. 
As we saw in Q3, some of our larger customers have started to move to our subscription pricing programs and our cloud offerings, evidence that these programs and product solutions are resonating in the market. 
Although this is a welcome change and at the core of our transformational strategy to drive more consumption of Teradata, this type of shift in purchasing option results in our expected revenue for the quarter to now be approximately $40 million less than previously anticipated. 
We expect non-GAAP EPS to be approximately in the $0.57 to $0.62 range in Q4, which will include the impact of our increased investments for our transformational initiatives. We expect operating expenses to decrease approximately $10 million year-over-year in Q4, with R&D expense anticipated to be up $15 million or 37% year-over-year and up sequentially $12 million or about 30% from Q3, with software capitalization as the larger -- largest driver of the expected increase. 
Although year-to-date, we have performed very well in terms of EPS improvement and our full year expectation for non-GAAP EPS is now at the higher end of our previous guidance range of $2.35 to $2.50. 
Although we will begin to see the financial impact of the increased investments for our transformational initiatives in the fourth quarter, and again, in a more meaningful way in 2017. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take any questions related to our Q3 financial performance."

There's no one inflection point that we're focusing across the board, it's very specific to what the customer wants and what the customer needs, and giving us the flexibility with a lot of different options to meet those needs, to we meet those customer needs. And what we saw in Q3, yes, the number was closer to the high teens for the quarter that would have put us slightly above the 568 last year on revenue. And that number encompasses and same with the $40 million in Q4, encompasses both customers going from a perpetual pricing strategy model to the subscription model and also customers moving to the cloud. So it's made of both of those which are more usage-based or time-based pricing models."

But that Q4 number being little lower than 60% is really relating to the traditional deal mixes that we have in our funnel.

You'll hear more on our assumptions behind those conversions at the Analyst Day and how that would impact our long-term financial model. 
So thank you. Although the last few years, I just want to share a couple of words here in closing. Although the last few years have been challenging for Teradata from a revenue growth perspective, our technology, again, remains unchallenged in the market and highly regarded by our customers. 
The key element of our future success is to drive more consumption of Teradata no matter where or how deployed, in a public cloud, in our managed cloud or as a subscription or on premise. 
We are also emphasizing our ability to generate quantifiable business value for business users at our customers. This is something that has become less of a focus in the last few years. 
Going forward, we plan to become more business outcome led and technology-enabled. 
We have great foundation in our technology, our customers, and most importantly, our people to support our strategy and everyone is passionate on our renewed focus of winning. 
At the center of this focus is alignment and execution. Our long-term strategy, which you'll year on our Analyst Day, aligns with our clear vision. Our current year operational imperatives are aligned with our long-term strategy, all of which will be measured by actionable metrics to drive consistent execution and accountability across the organization and drive business value for our customers. Again, we'll provide more information on all these actions at our Analyst Day in November 17, and I look forward to seeing you there. Thank you."

These risk factors are described in Teradata's 10-K, 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.

I'm particularly proud of these results given that our team is undertaking a huge amount of change as you can imagine as we focus on our new strategy going forward. So I'd like to thank all of the Teradata folks for the great efforts you put forth, and look forward to you doing the same in the fourth quarter. 
Our team, as you all know, is engaged, and we are riveted on getting our strategy fully implemented and executing it starting at the beginning of the year. Our 3 major tenants have not changed, we continue to focus on business analytics, ecosystem architecture consulting and hybrid cloud solutions. This leverages our strong technology foundation that our customers rely on today. 
We are transforming our go-to-market approach, focusing more on our largest opportunities and concentrating primarily on driving business value for our business users. That is important for us as we look to the new Teradata because our customers are becoming increasingly interested in business outcomes supported by strong technology as opposed to starting with technology and trying to find business outcomes that support those. 
We have been successful, obviously, in managing our cost. As you can tell from our better-than-expected non-GAAP EPS for the last quarter. This will help us pay for some of the investments that we are going to make as we go forward to build and support the new Teradata. 
As you know, I'm not on the call today, my portion is being prerecorded. I am in San Diego with our team working on the operational factors that are necessary to make sure our strategy is successful. I felt given that we are going to be get together soon, my time would be better spent here driving our strategy and our operational impacts forward than they would be on the call. I will be with you all in 2 weeks and be prepared to take any and all questions, along with our team.

It's an exciting time at Teradata, but also a very busy time as we are working diligently to transform Teradata for a stronger future. Vic is leading our transformation and is spending his time with the team making major changes, including how we go-to-market, pricing and deployment of our offerings. But most importantly, the focus on our customers who rely on Teradata to help them achieve quantifiable business value from analytics. 
We will provide you with a comprehensive description of our strategic transformational growth imperatives and respond to your questions at our Analyst Day. So today, we'll limit this discussion to our Q3 financial results. 
It was encouraging that our team delivered a solid quarter with revenue in line with our guidance range and EPS better-than-expected, while our team is embracing and executing the significant changes we are making at Teradata. My comments today regarding our operating results reflect Teradata's going forward business on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the Marketing Applications business for both 2016 and 2015.  Stock-based compensation and other special items as identified in our earnings release are also excluded. 
We have provided a non-GAAP year-over-year results in our website, which reconciles to our reported GAAP results. We've also provided a new multi-period historical schedule on our website which provides our non-GAAP results, excluding the Marketing Applications business reconciled to the GAAP results for each period. 
We reported revenue of $552 million in the third quarter, which on a comparable basis was down 3% from Q3 2015. 
During Q3, we began to see increased activity associated with those subscription pricing programs. Specifically, estimating the perpetual equivalent of the subscription-based transactions in Q3, 2016's Q3 revenue would have been slightly higher than last year's Q3. 
Compared to Q3 2015, product revenue was down 10% in both reported and constant currency. Consulting revenue was flat or up 1% in constant currency and maintenance revenue was up 5%, up 4% in constant currency. 
Revenues in the Americas region decreased 9% as reported, 8% in constant currency as customers continue to evaluate lower cost but lower-performing alternatives as well as Teradata's new deployment options. 
Revenue from our international region increased 6% in both reported and constant currency. Within international, EMEA revenue increased 16% as reported, 20% in constant currency, led by solid growth in Eastern Europe while APJ revenue decreased 5% as reported, 10% in constant currency, primarily in Japan and China. 
Product gross margin in the third quarter was 65.4%, a 510 basis point increase from 60.3% in Q3 2015. The increase in product gross margin was primarily due to favorable product and deal mix as well as less amortization of capitalized software development costs. 
Services gross margin recorded was a solid 47.1% compared to 47.9% in Q3 2015. Overall, gross margin was 54% in the third quarter and increased from the 53% in the third quarter of 2015. 
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $134 million was down $14 million or 9% from $148 million of the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to our cost management actions to align the investments to the areas that will drive sustainable revenue and profitable growth the future and help fund the investments we are making to support our transformation. 
Research and development expense, on the other hand, was up 17% to $42 million versus the $36 million in the third quarter of 2015. We are increasing and will continue to increase our investments in R&D to enhance Teradata's future profitability. 
In Q3, we began to compare with prior year periods when we started to rationalize our R&D spend. So although year-to-date, R&D expense was down $10 million or 8%, we expect a meaningful increase in R&D expense in Q4, largely due to the effects of capitalized software, which will result in a slight increase in full year R&D expense year-over-year. 
Total R&D spend for the third quarter, which includes R&D expense plus the additions to capitalized software, development cost from the cash flow statement, less capitalization of internally-developed software, was $58 million versus $55 million in 2015. 
Total expenses in the third quarter was $176 million, down 4%, even with the 17% increase in R&D expense. 
As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 22.1%, a good improvement from the 20.6% operating margin in Q3 2015. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 24%, lower than the 26% non-GAAP tax rate in Q3 of 2015. The reduction in the effective tax rate year-over-year is a result of an increase in forecasted foreign earnings mix period over period. 
On a year-to-date basis, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 27% or flat compared to the same period in 2015. 
We continue to expect our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to approximate 27%, with the actual tax rate being dependent upon the ultimate earnings mix. 
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 was a meaningful increase from the $0.60 in Q3 2015, which was primarily due to our ongoing cost management initiatives. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $45 million in Q3 2016 versus $68 million in the third quarter of 2015. 
Year-to-date cash from operating activities was $395 million versus $370 million generated during the same period in 2015. The fluctuation in cash from operating activities on a comparable basis, both for the quarter and year-to-date was a result of timing differences relating to net working capital period-over-period. 
In the third quarter, we had $33 million of capital expenditures, including capitalized software versus $35 million in the third quarter of 2015, resulting in free cash flow of $12 million versus the $33 million generated in Q3 of 2015. 
Free cash flow for the 9 months was $309 million versus the $276 million generated during the same period of 2015. 
Keep in mind, our investments to support our transformation will increase in the fourth quarter and more meaningfully in 2017. As a result, we are likely to have a negative free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect full year free cash flow to approximate $290 million. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We had $988 million of cash as of September 30, 2016. This is up from the $909 million at the end of the second quarter of 2016 and up from the $874 million from September 30, 2015. Of the $988 million of cash, substantially all was held outside the United States. 
At the end of the third quarter, we had term debt of $578 million. We had no outstanding borrowings on our $400 million revolving credit facility, which gives us short term borrowing flexibility. 
Turning to guidance. And this will be sensitive to the rate of customers' adoption to our new subscription pricing programs and cloud. We expect Q4 revenue in the $620 million to $640 million range. 
As we saw in Q3, some of our larger customers have started to move to our subscription pricing programs and our cloud offerings, evidence that these programs and product solutions are resonating in the market. 
Although this is a welcome change and at the core of our transformational strategy to drive more consumption of Teradata, this type of shift in purchasing option results in our expected revenue for the quarter to now be approximately $40 million less than previously anticipated. 
We expect non-GAAP EPS to be approximately in the $0.57 to $0.62 range in Q4, which will include the impact of our increased investments for our transformational initiatives. We expect operating expenses to decrease approximately $10 million year-over-year in Q4, with R&D expense anticipated to be up $15 million or 37% year-over-year and up sequentially $12 million or about 30% from Q3, with software capitalization as the larger -- largest driver of the expected increase. 
Although year-to-date, we have performed very well in terms of EPS improvement and our full year expectation for non-GAAP EPS is now at the higher end of our previous guidance range of $2.35 to $2.50. 
Although we will begin to see the financial impact of the increased investments for our transformational initiatives in the fourth quarter, and again, in a more meaningful way in 2017. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take any questions related to our Q3 financial performance."

And our pricing strategy is really focused on enabling our customers to quickly and easily deploy Teradata across the platforms. So we really wanted to address this based on their evolving hybrid cloud analytical environment or needs. And the most important part of our strategy is we want to maintain the integrity of our gross margins. So we'll walk through at our Analyst Day, how these models will impact our future view of Teradata's financial business model.

So thank you. Although the last few years -- I just want to share a couple of words here in closing. Although the last few years have been challenging for Teradata from a revenue growth perspective, our technology, again, remains unchallenged in the market and highly regarded by our customers. 
The key element of our future success is to drive more consumption of Teradata no matter where or how deployed, in the public cloud, in our managed cloud or as a subscription or on-premise. 
We are also emphasizing our ability to generate quantifiable business value for business users at our customers. This is something that has become less of a focus in the last few years. 
Going forward, we plan to become more business outcome led and technology-enabled. 
We have a great foundation in our technology, our customers, and most importantly, our people to support our strategy and everyone is passionate on our renewed focus of winning. 
At the center of this focus is alignment and execution. Our long-term strategy, which you'll year on our Analyst Day, aligns with our clear vision. Our current year operational imperatives are aligned with our long-term strategy, all of which will be measured by actionable metrics to drive consistent execution and accountability across the organization and drive business value for our customers. Again, we'll provide more information on all these actions at our Analyst Day on November 17, and I look forward to seeing you there. Thank you."

Victor Lund, Teradata's CEO, is not on the call today, but has prerecorded some comments, which we will hear before Steve begins. We will not be addressing our strategy on this abbreviated call this morning in order to more properly describe our transformation in detail at our upcoming Analyst Day, which will be held on November 17 at our R&D facility, which is located just north of San Diego. If you have not yet registered for our Analyst Day, you can find information regarding that event on the investor page of our website. 
Our discussion today includes forecasts and other information that are considered forward-looking statements. While these statements reflect our current outlook, they are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially. These risk factors are described in Teradata's 10-K, 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. 
On today's call, we will also be discussing certain non-GAAP financial information, which excludes such items as stock-based compensation expense; asset impairments; acquisition and reorganization costs; the Marketing Applications business, which was sold on July 1; and other special items. 
We will also be discussing other non-GAAP items such as free cash flow and constant currency revenue comparisons. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our reported GAAP results and other information concerning these measures is included in our earnings release and on the Investor page of Teradata's website. A replay of this conference call will be available later today on that site. Teradata assumes no obligation to update or revise the information included in this conference call, whether as a result of new information or future results. 
And now, we will hear from Vic."

Our revenues were in line with our expectations and our non-GAAP EPS were better than we expected. 
I'm particularly proud of these results given that our team is undertaking a huge amount of change as you can imagine as we focus on our new strategy going forward. So I'd like to thank all of the Teradata folks for the great efforts you put forth, and look forward to you doing the same in the fourth quarter. 
Our team, as you all know, is engaged, and we are riveted on getting our strategy fully implemented and executing it starting at the beginning of the year. Our 3 major tenants have not changed, we continue to focus on business analytics, ecosystem architecture consulting and hybrid cloud solutions. This leverages our strong technology foundation that our customers rely on today. 
We are transforming our go-to-market approach, focusing more on our largest opportunities and concentrating primarily on driving business value for our business users. That is important for us as we look to the new Teradata because our customers are becoming increasingly interested in business outcomes supported by strong technology, as opposed to starting with technology and trying to find business outcomes that support those. 
We have been successful, obviously, in managing our cost. As you can tell from our better-than-expected non-GAAP EPS for the last quarter. This will help us pay for some of the investments that we are going to make as we go forward to build and support the new Teradata. 
As you know, I'm not on the call today, my portion is being prerecorded. I am in San Diego with our team working on the operational factors that are necessary to make sure our strategy is successful. I felt given that we are going to be together soon, my time would be better spent here driving our strategy and our operational impacts forward than they would be on the call. I will be with you all in 2 weeks and be prepared to take any and all questions, along with our team. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Steve. Steve, up to you now. Thanks."

It's an exciting time at Teradata, but also a very busy time as we are working diligently to transform Teradata for a stronger future.

It's an exciting time at Teradata, but also a very busy time as we are working diligently to transform Teradata for a stronger future. Vic is leading our transformation and is spending his time with the team making major changes, including how we go-to-market, pricing and deployment of our offerings. But most importantly, the focus on our customers who rely on Teradata to help them achieve quantifiable business value from analytics. 
We will provide you with a comprehensive description of our strategic transformational growth imperatives and respond to your questions at our Analyst Day. So today, we'll limit this discussion to our Q3 financial results. 
It was encouraging that our team delivered a solid quarter with revenue in line with our guidance range and EPS better-than-expected, while our team is embracing and executing the significant changes we are making at Teradata. My comments today regarding our operating results reflect Teradata's going forward business on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the Marketing Applications business for both 2016 and 2015.  Stock-based compensation and other special items as identified in our earnings release are also excluded. 
We have provided a non-GAAP year-over-year results in our website, which reconciles to our reported GAAP results. We've also provided a new multi-period historical schedule on our website which provides our non-GAAP results, excluding the Marketing Applications business reconciled to the GAAP results for each period. 
We reported revenue of $552 million in the third quarter, which on a comparable basis was down 3% from Q3 2015. 
During Q3, we began to see increased activity associated with our subscription pricing programs. Specifically, estimating the perpetual equivalent of the subscription-based transactions in Q3, 2016's Q3 revenue would have been slightly higher than last year's Q3. 
Compared to Q3 2015, product revenue was down 10% in both reported and constant currency. Consulting revenue was flat or up 1% in constant currency and maintenance revenue was up 5%, up 4% in constant currency. 
Revenues in the Americas region decreased 9% as reported, 8% in constant currency as customers continue to evaluate lower cost but lower-performing alternatives as well as Teradata's new deployment options. 
Revenue from our international region increased 6% in both reported and constant currency. Within international, EMEA revenue increased 16% as reported, 20% in constant currency, led by solid growth in Eastern Europe while APJ revenue decreased 5% as reported, 10% in constant currency, primarily in Japan and China. 
Product gross margin in the third quarter was 65.4%, a 510 basis point increase from 60.3% in Q3 2015. The increase in product gross margin was primarily due to favorable product and deal mix as well as less amortization of capitalized software development costs. 
Services gross margin recorded was a solid 47.1% compared to 47.9% in Q3 2015. Overall, gross margin was 54% in the third quarter, an increase from the 53% in the third quarter of 2015. 
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $134 million was down $14 million or 9% from $148 million of the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to our cost management actions to align the investments to the areas that will drive sustainable revenue and profitable growth in the future and help fund the investments we are making to support our transformation. 
Research and Development expense, on the other hand, was up 17% to $42 million versus the $36 million in the third quarter of 2015. We are increasing and will continue to increase our investments in R&D to enhance Teradata's future profitability. 
In Q3, we began to compare with prior year periods when we started to rationalize our R&D spend. So although year-to-date, R&D expense was down $10 million or 8%, we expect a meaningful increase in R&D expense in Q4, largely due to the effects of capitalized software, which will result in a slight increase in full year R&D expense year-over-year. 
Total R&D spend for the third quarter, which includes R&D expense plus the additions to capitalized software, development cost from the cash flow statement, less capitalization of internally-developed software, was $58 million versus $55 million in 2015. 
Total expenses in the third quarter was $176 million, down 4%, even with the 17% increase in R&D expense. 
As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 22.1%, a good improvement from the 20.6% operating margin in Q3 2015. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 24%, lower than the 26% non-GAAP tax rate in Q3 of 2015. The reduction in the effective tax rate year-over-year is a result of an increase in forecasted foreign earnings mix period over period. 
On a year-to-date basis, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 27% or flat compared to the same period in 2015. 
We continue to expect our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to approximate 27%, with the actual tax rate being dependent upon the ultimate earnings mix. 
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 was a meaningful increase from the $0.60 in Q3 2015, which was primarily due to our ongoing cost management initiatives. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $45 million in Q3 2016 versus $68 million in the third quarter of 2015. 
Year-to-date cash from operating activities was $395 million versus $370 million generated during the same period in 2015. The fluctuation in cash from operating activities on a comparable basis, both for the quarter and year-to-date was a result of timing differences relating to net working capital period-over-period. 
In the third quarter, we had $33 million of capital expenditures, including capitalized software versus $35 million in the third quarter of 2015, resulting in free cash flow of $12 million versus the $33 million generated in Q3 of 2015. 
Free cash flow for the 9 months was $309 million versus the $276 million generated during the same period of 2015.
 
Keep in mind, our investments to support our transformation will increase in the fourth quarter and more meaningfully in 2017. As a result, we are likely to have a negative free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect full year free cash flow to approximate $290 million. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We had $988 million of cash as of September 30, 2016. This is up from the $909 million at the end of the second quarter of 2016 and up from the $874 million from September 30, 2015. Of the $988 million of cash, substantially all was held outside the United States. 
At the end of the third quarter, we had term debt of $578 million. We had no outstanding borrowings on our $400 million revolving credit facility, which gives us short-term borrowing flexibility. 
Turning to guidance. And this will be sensitive to the rate of customers' adoption to our new subscription pricing programs and cloud. We expect Q4 revenue in the $620 million to $640 million range. 
As we saw in Q3, some of our larger customers have started to move to our subscription pricing programs and our cloud offerings, evidence that these programs and product solutions are resonating in the market. 
Although this is a welcome change and at the core of our transformational strategy to drive more consumption of Teradata, this type of shift in purchasing option results in our expected revenue for the quarter to now be approximately $40 million less than previously anticipated. 
We expect non-GAAP EPS to be approximately in the $0.57 to $0.62 range in Q4, which will include the impact of our increased investments for our transformational initiatives. We expect operating expenses to decrease approximately $10 million year-over-year in Q4, with R&D expense anticipated to be up $15 million or 37% year-over-year and up sequentially $12 million or about 30% from Q3, with software capitalization as the larger -- largest driver of the expected increase. 
Although year-to-date, we have performed very well in terms of EPS improvement and our full year expectation for non-GAAP EPS is now at the higher end of our previous guidance range of $2.35 to $2.50. 
Although we will begin to see the financial impact of increased investments for our transformational initiatives in the fourth quarter, and again, in a more meaningful way in 2017. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take any questions related to our Q3 financial performance."

And what we saw in Q3, yes, the number was closer to the high teens for the quarter that would have put us slightly above the $568 million last year on revenue.

What we're looking at as on the strategy on that is when we give you the key metrics at the Analyst Day, we're looking forward and kicking around this deferred revenue and unbilled revenue associated that'd be basically the unbilled contractual revenue to really give you a complete view. Because right now, again, with the limited number of transactions that have gone to the subscription, again, it's more unique to the customer, so it could be billed on an annual basis, it could be billed on a quarterly basis. And so it's really not driving any significant changes in that in our deferred revenue. But I want to -- Jesse I wanted to have you keep in mind that the change in deferred revenue this year, you have to factor out the TMA effect, and that was $30 million in deferred revenue, I believe, in the quarter. I mean, not the quarter, the year-over-year in balance sheet. But again, to your earlier point, this is what -- this is a key metric that we're kicking around, this deferred revenue plus this unbilled to give you that total picture of that backlog revenue on the balance sheet and off the balance sheet.

So thank you. Although the last few years -- I just want to share a couple of words here in closing. Although the last few years have been challenging for Teradata from a revenue growth perspective, our technology, again, remains unchallenged in the market and highly regarded by our customers. 
The key element of our future success is to drive more consumption of Teradata no matter where or how deployed, in the public cloud, in our managed cloud or as a subscription or on-premise. 
We are also emphasizing our ability to generate quantifiable business value for business users at our customers. This is something that has become less of a focus in the last few years. 
Going forward, we plan to become more business outcome led and technology-enabled. 
We have a great foundation in our technology, our customers, and most importantly, our people to support our strategy and everyone is passionate on our renewed focus of winning. 
At the center of this focus is alignment and execution. Our long-term strategy, which you'll hear on our Analyst Day, aligns with our clear vision. Our current year operational imperatives are aligned with our long-term strategy, all of which will be measured by actionable metrics to drive consistent execution and accountability across the organization and drive business value for our customers.

I'm particularly proud of these results given that our team is undertaking a huge amount of change as you can imagine as we focus on our new strategy going forward. So I'd like to thank all of the Teradata folks for the great efforts you put forth, and look forward to you doing the same in the fourth quarter. 
Our team, as you all know, is engaged, and we are riveted on getting our strategy fully implemented and executing it starting at the beginning of the year. Our 3 major tenants have not changed, we continue to focus on business analytics, ecosystem architecture consulting and hybrid cloud solutions. This leverages our strong technology foundation that our customers rely on today. 
We are transforming our go-to-market approach, focusing more on our largest opportunities and concentrating primarily on driving business value for our business users. That is important for us as we look to the new Teradata because our customers are becoming increasingly interested in business outcomes supported by strong technology, as opposed to starting with technology and trying to find business outcomes that support those. 
We have been successful, obviously, in managing our cost. As you can tell from our better-than-expected non-GAAP EPS for the last quarter. This will help us pay for some of the investments that we are going to make as we go forward to build and support the new Teradata. 
As you know, I'm not on the call today, my portion is being prerecorded. I am in San Diego with our team working on the operational factors that are necessary to make sure our strategy is successful. I felt given that we are going to be together soon, my time would be better spent here driving our strategy and our operational impacts forward than they would be on the call.

It's an exciting time at Teradata, but also a very busy time as we are working diligently to transform Teradata for a stronger future. Vic is leading our transformation and is spending his time with the team making major changes, including how we go-to-market, pricing and deployment of our offerings. But most importantly, the focus on our customers who rely on Teradata to help them achieve quantifiable business value from analytics. 
We will provide you with a comprehensive description of our strategic transformational growth imperatives and respond to your questions at our Analyst Day. So today, we'll limit this discussion to our Q3 financial results. 
It was encouraging that our team delivered a solid quarter with revenue in line with our guidance range and EPS better-than-expected, while our team is embracing and executing the significant changes we are making at Teradata. My comments today regarding our operating results reflect Teradata's going forward business on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the Marketing Applications business for both 2016 and 2015. Stock-based compensation and other special items as identified in our earnings release are also excluded. 
We have provided a non-GAAP year-over-year results in our website, which reconciles to our reported GAAP results. We've also provided a new multi-period historical schedule on our website which provides our non-GAAP results, excluding the Marketing Applications business reconciled to the GAAP results for each period. 
We reported revenue of $552 million in the third quarter, which on a comparable basis was down 3% from Q3 2015. 
During Q3, we began to see increased activity associated with our subscription pricing programs. Specifically, estimating the perpetual equivalent of the subscription-based transactions in Q3, 2016's Q3 revenue would have been slightly higher than last year's Q3. 
Compared to Q3 2015, product revenue was down 10% in both reported and constant currency. Consulting revenue was flat or up 1% in constant currency and maintenance revenue was up 5%, up 4% in constant currency. 
Revenues in the Americas region decreased 9% as reported, 8% in constant currency as customers continue to evaluate lower cost but lower-performing alternatives as well as Teradata's new deployment options. 
Revenue from our international region increased 6% in both reported and constant currency. Within international, EMEA revenue increased 16% as reported, 20% in constant currency, led by solid growth in Eastern Europe while APJ revenue decreased 5% as reported, 10% in constant currency, primarily in Japan and China. 
Product gross margin in the third quarter was 65.4%, a 510 basis point increase from 60.3% in Q3 2015. The increase in product gross margin was primarily due to favorable product and deal mix as well as less amortization of capitalized software development costs. 
Services gross margin recorded was a solid 47.1% compared to 47.9% in Q3 2015. Overall, gross margin was 54% in the third quarter, an increase from the 53% in the third quarter of 2015. 
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $134 million was down $14 million or 9% from $148 million of the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to our cost management actions to align the investments to the areas that will drive sustainable revenue and profitable growth in the future and help fund the investments we are making to support our transformation. 
Research and Development expense, on the other hand, was up 17% to $42 million versus the $36 million in the third quarter of 2015. We are increasing and will continue to increase our investments in R&D to enhance Teradata's future profitability. 
In Q3, we began to compare with prior year periods when we started to rationalize our R&D spend. So although year-to-date, R&D expense was down $10 million or 8%, we expect a meaningful increase in R&D expense in Q4, largely due to the effects of capitalized software, which will result in a slight increase in full year R&D expense year-over-year. 
Total R&D spend for the third quarter, which includes R&D expense plus the additions to capitalized software, development cost from the cash flow statement, less capitalization of internally-developed software, was $58 million versus $55 million in 2015. 
Total expenses in the third quarter was $176 million, down 4%, even with the 17% increase in R&D expense. 
As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 22.1%, a good improvement from the 20.6% operating margin in Q3 2015. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 24%, lower than the 26% non-GAAP tax rate in Q3 of 2015. The reduction in the effective tax rate year-over-year is a result of an increase in forecasted foreign earnings mix period over period. 
On a year-to-date basis, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 27% or flat compared to the same period in 2015. 
We continue to expect our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to approximate 27%, with the actual tax rate being dependent upon the ultimate earnings mix. 
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 was a meaningful increase from the $0.60 in Q3 2015, which was primarily due to our ongoing cost management initiatives. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $45 million in Q3 2016 versus $68 million in the third quarter of 2015. 
Year-to-date cash from operating activities was $395 million versus $370 million generated during the same period in 2015. The fluctuation in cash from operating activities on a comparable basis, both for the quarter and year-to-date was a result of timing differences relating to net working capital period-over-period. 
In the third quarter, we had $33 million of capital expenditures, including capitalized software versus $35 million in the third quarter of 2015, resulting in free cash flow of $12 million versus the $33 million generated in Q3 of 2015. 
Free cash flow for the 9 months was $309 million versus the $276 million generated during the same period of 2015.
 
Keep in mind, our investments to support our transformation will increase in the fourth quarter and more meaningfully in 2017. As a result, we are likely to have a negative free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect full year free cash flow to approximate $290 million. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We had $988 million of cash as of September 30, 2016. This is up from the $909 million at the end of the second quarter of 2016 and up from the $874 million from September 30, 2015. Of the $988 million of cash, substantially all was held outside the United States. 
At the end of the third quarter, we had term debt of $578 million. We had no outstanding borrowings on our $400 million revolving credit facility, which gives us short-term borrowing flexibility. 
Turning to guidance. And this will be sensitive to the rate of customers' adoption to our new subscription pricing programs and cloud. We expect Q4 revenue in the $620 million to $640 million range. 
As we saw in Q3, some of our larger customers have started to move to our subscription pricing programs and our cloud offerings, evidence that these programs and product solutions are resonating in the market. 
Although this is a welcome change and at the core of our transformational strategy to drive more consumption of Teradata, this type of shift in purchasing option results in our expected revenue for the quarter to now be approximately $40 million less than previously anticipated. 
We expect non-GAAP EPS to be approximately in the $0.57 to $0.62 range in Q4, which will include the impact of our increased investments for our transformational initiatives. We expect operating expenses to decrease approximately $10 million year-over-year in Q4, with R&D expense anticipated to be up $15 million or 37% year-over-year and up sequentially $12 million or about 30% from Q3, with software capitalization as the larger -- largest driver of the expected increase. 
Although year-to-date, we have performed very well in terms of EPS improvement and our full year expectation for non-GAAP EPS is now at the higher end of our previous guidance range of $2.35 to $2.50. 
Although we will begin to see the financial impact of increased investments for our transformational initiatives in the fourth quarter, and again, in a more meaningful way in 2017. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take any questions related to our Q3 financial performance."

And what we saw in Q3, yes, the number was closer to the high teens for the quarter that would have put us slightly above the $568 million last year on revenue. And that number encompasses and same with the $40 million in Q4, encompasses both customers going from a perpetual pricing strategy model to a subscription model and also customers moving to the cloud.

But our objective in 2016 was to really keep it comp neutral to the salesperson to drive the right solution for the customer. So again, out there, our salespeople know that they'll be treated fairly with the compensation strategy driving the right solution for the customer. And we are -- we're working on our comp programs to really align them entirely to our strategy effective 1/1/17. And it'll continuing to be an evolving process. And so -- but again, we have had these offerings in the past. They were more unique to a particular sets of customers, so we understood the economic dynamics of those transactions for our customer and for our sales teams. And we kept it to be very comp neutral to them to drive the right solution for the customer. So again, you'll be -- we'll be continuing to refine those and rolling those out in a more specific way 1/1 -- start of '17."

That was a very significant realignment, and that was completed and put into place at the beginning of this year. We're not anticipating any other significant realignments going forward. We are working within that geographical structure. But what you'll see is we continue to evolve in our go-to-market, we will align existing resources, and we're looking at hiring additional resources in the cloud area. And again, we're aligning our resources -- continuing to align and refine our resources back to that geographical model that we put in place at the start of '16. So no significant realignments in '16, and I'm not factoring in any, again, because there's no significant realignments, there's no unusual activity that I am forecasting or outlooking in the Q4 of '16. Again, on our Analyst Day, you'll hear more information on our go-to-market strategy."

But again, we're not restricting these type of solutions just to the U.S. customers, it's on a global basis. So again, very early stages. You'll hear more on our assumptions behind those conversions at the Analyst Day and how that would impact our long-term financial model. 
So thank you. Although the last few years -- I just want to share a couple of words here in closing. Although the last few years have been challenging for Teradata from a revenue growth perspective, our technology, again, remains unchallenged in the market and highly regarded by our customers. 
The key element of our future success is to drive more consumption of Teradata no matter where or how deployed, in the public cloud, in our managed cloud or as a subscription or on-premise. 
We are also emphasizing our ability to generate quantifiable business value for business users at our customers. This is something that has become less of a focus in the last few years. 
Going forward, we plan to become more business outcome led and technology-enabled. 
We have a great foundation in our technology, our customers, and most importantly, our people to support our strategy and everyone is passionate on our renewed focus of winning. 
At the center of this focus is alignment and execution. Our long-term strategy, which you'll hear on our Analyst Day, aligns with our clear vision. Our current year operational imperatives are aligned with our long-term strategy, all of which will be measured by actionable metrics to drive consistent execution and accountability across the organization and drive business value for our customers. Again, we'll provide more information on all these actions at our Analyst Day on November 17, and I look forward to seeing you there. Thank you."
