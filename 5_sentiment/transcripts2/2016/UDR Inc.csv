On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A. During this call, we will present our updated 2-year strategic outlook as we have done in the last 3 years. In 2015, we again met or exceeded all primary objectives of our strategic plan and they have meaningfully outperformed each of our prior plan. Tom will adjust this outperformance and the next 2 years strategic outlook in detail later in the call.
Turning to 2015, was another great year for UDR and we continue to see strength in all aspects of our business. A quick recap of the team's accomplishments during the year. 
First, our operations continue to run on all cylinders and delivered strong state same-store results across-the-board with same-store NOI growth of 6.7%, a full 220 basis points ahead of our initial expectations. 
Second, we delivered over $300 million of developments which leased up well and we expect to hit our targeted returns of 6.2% or better at stabilization. 
Third, we entered into 2 accretive problem-solving transactions, mainly the $559 million West Coast development joint venture and the $901 million Washington, D.C. acquisition, in which we kept our principles of self-funding, accretive to cash flow growth and continued strengthening of our balance sheet. 
Last, we grew AFFO per share by 12%, a strong rate, which resulted in a 7% dividend increase and meaningful consensus NAV per share growth of 15%. We continue to believe that growth in these 2 metrics translates into strong total shareholder return overtime.
Looking towards the future, we feel very positive about our business and our prospects. Multifamily fundamentals remained extraordinarily strong. The positive demographic trends amongst our private renters, the 22 to 35-year-old population cohort, is expected to grow through 2030 and is not reversible. This, coupled with a steady job growth, leaves us confident that our operating platform which is our primary driver very cash flow growth, should continue to generate impressive results in the future.
Our self-funded development pipeline is expected to generate the incremental cash flow and value creation we originally forecasted. Expected additions to the pipeline in 2016 will maintain our targeted size at $900 million tough $1.4 billion and are forecasted to be highly accretive. Our ability to fund this pipeline with asset sales largely reduces our dependency on capital markets. And as we've said in prior years, we will continue to focus on improving our debt metrics.
In summary, there remains a long runway for growth that UDR and we have the right plan and team in place to capitalize on the opportunity. 
With that, I'd like to express my sincere thanks to all my fellow UDR associates for their hard work and producing another strong year of results. We look forward to a great 2016, and now I will turn the call over to Tom."

For full year 2015 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $1.66, $1.67 and $1.51, respectively. Full year same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth of 5.6%, 3.0% and 6.7% exhibited continued strong demand for apartments and were above our initial expectations provided last February. 
At year-end, our liquidity as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, was $987 million. The financial leverage on an underappreciated counts basis was 34.6%. Based on our current market cap, it was approximately 26% and inclusive of JVs, was approximately 30%. Our net debt to EBITDA was 5.7x and inclusive of JVs was 6.7x. All balance sheet metric improvements were ahead of plan.
On to first quarter and full year 2016 guidance. Full year 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share is forecasted at $1.75 to $1.81, $1.75 to $1.81 and $1.59 to $1.65, respectively. For same-store, our full year 2016 revenue growth guidance is 5.5% to 6.0%; expense, 3.0% to 3.5%; and NOI, 6.5% to 7.0%. Average 2016 occupancy is forecasted at 96.6%.

In my remarks I'll cover the following topics: First, our fourth quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the continued success we realized runaway growth again this quarter and into January; second, the performance of our primary markets during the quarter and expectations for 2016; and last, a brief update on our lease-up developments and the Washington, D.C. acquisition.
We're pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. Our fourth quarter same-store revenue growth of 6.2% was driven by an increase in revenue per occupied home of 6.5% year-over-year to $1,794 per month, while same-store occupancy of 96.5% was 30 basis points lower versus the prior year period. Our fourth quarter strategy of holding rate high, along with aggressive rate increases throughout 2015, benefits us in 2016 as we enter the year with almost 2.75% of our revenue growth already baked into our run roll. [ph] Our robust full year same-store revenue growth of 5.6% was driven by a 5.5% increase in revenue per occupied home and flat occupancy. We see strong rate growth continuing in 2016.
Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth, which is detailed on Attachment 8G of our supplement, we continue to push rate in the fourth quarter. New lease growth totaled 3.8% or 170 basis points ahead of the fourth quarter of 2014. Renewal growth remained resilient, improving 170 basis points year-over-year to 7%. This year-over-year acceleration was accomplished with only a 40 basis point increase in fourth quarter turnover. 
Next, move-outs to home purchase were up 120 basis points year-over-year at 14%, in line with our long-term average. Importantly, our full year 2015 turnover rate increased by just 20 basis points versus full year 2014. Even with renewal increases had a seasonally strong 7% -- of only 7% of our move-outs get rate increases as they [indiscernible] for leaving in the fourth quarter. However, we expect turnover to increase roughly 100 basis points in 2016 as our revenue growth is heavily predicated on the rate growth and not year-over-year occupancy gains. 
Moving on to quarterly performance on our primary markets, which represent 69% of our same-store NOI and 75% of our total NOI. Metro D.C., which represents 18% of our total NOI, posted positive full year revenue growth of 1.7%. We expect improving full year revenue growth in 2016 of around 2.5% as we continue to benefit from our diverse exposure of 50% B assets and 50% A assets located both inside and outside the Beltway. 
Orange County and Los Angeles combined represents 15.4% of our total NOI. Orange County posted sequential revenue growth of 160 basis points and continues to outperform our budgeted expectations early in 2016. L.A. is materially stronger due to our heavy concentration in the Marina del Rey submarket as new jobs have continued to migrate to this highly desirable submarket. Fourth quarter revenue in LA was an impressive 10.2%. Our current expectation is that both of these markets will generate revenue growth in the 7% range in 2016.
New York City, which represents 12% of our total NOI, posted full year revenue growth of 5.6%. We saw a seasonal weakness of the fourth quarter and early January but future trends are pointing to strength within our submarkets. We continue to expect new jobs from technology, finance and media which will benefit our lower Manhattan properties. Our 2016 forecasted revenue growth of 6% is above 2015. I would remind everyone that View 34 is our same-store pool beginning in first quarter of 2016.
San Francisco and San Jose, which represent 11% of our total NOI, posted full year revenue growth of 9.7%. Although we saw weakness in the fourth quarter, is indicative of the first and fourth quarter seasonality that we have seen in this market in the past. With that said, we believe this weakness is possibly more than just seasonal, and we do not expect this market to posted double-digit revenue growth that it has in recent years and we have forecast that a deceleration in 2016 to revenue growth of 8% or so. Future trends are slowly improving from what we saw in the fourth quarter but we are keeping a close eye on the job growth and absorption levels within our submarkets. Keep in mind, San Francisco job growth has been above 4.5% for the past few years. AXIO Metric's current forecast calls for job growth to decelerate to 2.5% to 3% but still well above the national average of 1.75% to 2%.
Seattle, which represents 6% of our total NOI, benefited from strong growth in suburban B assets for less exposed to new supplied and A assets downtown. Although new supply will challenge someone in Downtown Seattle and to a lesser degree in Bellevue, we expect 2016 to be slightly below our 2015 numbers or roughly 7% growth.
Boston, which represents 7% of our total NOI, should continue to see new supply pressure Downtown, but our suburban assets in the north and south shores should fair relatively better in 2016. Long term, we like downtown submarket and look to continue to grow through development in this submarket. Most recently GE announced the relocation of their global headquarters to the Seaport district. This will bring another 800 jobs into the submarket which should directly benefit our 369-home, 100 Pier 4 community and our future 345 Harrison development in Boston Southend. Our forecast calls for revenue growth to accelerate slightly from the 5.5% growth posted in 2015.
Last, Dallas, which represents 5% of our total NOI, posted 5.1% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. We expect new supply pressure in Uptown and Plano in 2016. January results indicate that these submarkets are performing slightly better than initial budgeted expectations and 2016 revenue growth is projected to improve to roughly 5.5% from 5% in 2015.
As you can see on Attachment 7B of our supplement, our 320-home Los Alisos community located in Orange County, our 196-home Waterscape community located in Seattle and our 740-home View 34 community located in New York City will join the same-store pool in the first quarter of 2016.
Turning to our in-lease up developments. Katella Grand 1, our 399-home, $138 million lease up in Anaheim, California, in the West Coast development JV, was 16% occupied at quarter-end and as of today is 20% occupied and 27% leased. We are currently offering less than 1 month of concession with this community and leasing has been very strong in January with 25 applications.
CityLine, our 244-home, $80 million lease up in Seattle Washington, was 9% occupied at quarter-end. We are on budget and meeting our lease-up expectations. 
Finally, 399 Fremont, our 447-home, $318 million lease up in San Francisco began leasing during the fourth quarter. At quarter-end, we were just 2% leased and today, we are over 10% leased with rents exceeding pro forma. We will have our first move-ins in March 2016. 
Now a quick update on the Washington, D.C. acquisition. We're 3 months into owning these communities and everything is going as according to plan. Currently, we're making CapEx improvement to 2 of the properties to either cure deferred maintenance or drive a higher return to revenue-enhancing improvements. We still expect these committees to perform in line with our D.C. portfolio this year with revenue growth right around 2.5%. Currently we would expect 5 of the 6 communities in this portfolio to enter our same-store pool in the first quarter of 2017. 
With that, I will remind those listening that there is a link to our updated 2-year strategic outlook document on the Investor relations page of our website. We will pause for a moment so that everyone can gather the 2-year outlook materials.
I will now turn the call back over to Tom Toomey."

First, we view this year's update as continuation of last 3 plans. We believe this continues to be the right path for UDR, here's why. The plan's primary objective is to drive high-quality cash flow growth while incrementally improving our balance sheet and portfolio. In other words, consistent, sustainable growth that is funded in a safe, low-risk manner. We believe that successful execution of these objectives will drive strong total shareholder return. 
There are 4 key points I'd like to highlight while we think there's a long runway of accretive growth ahead. First, fundamentals. You have seen plenty of published data on this and, clearly, demographics, supply demand characteristics, are in our favor and any good business that is going to grow for a number of years need solid fundamentals. The second is strategic position. Where do we start? Well, we're in 20 markets, 50% A-B quality mix. We like this position. We think it solves for the #1 critical element of any future growth, which is the positioning of our portfolio such that our residents will continue to be able to grow and pay higher rents. The third is the team and the skills. It's operationally, we'll continue to innovate, invest in technology and training programs, all of which are designed to increase our margins which now stand above 70% of the NOI line, extraordinary for any business. On the development side, we'll remain focused on looking at our risk-adjusted returns and staying disciplined. Fourth is problem-solving. Clearly, we operate in a cyclical economy. And along that line, there will be challenges and opportunities. We have a team that is very experienced of managing through these cycles, if not anticipate these cycles and these opportunities. Certainly I feel confident that the team has the ability to capitalize on these opportunities as they become available. And lastly and just as important is managing risk. And we see ourselves managing this through first, our diversity of our market mix, our discipline around our development and certainly our continued improving balance sheet set of metrics and lastly, our transparency and disclosure and communication style.
We believe these main objectives can continue our cash flow growth in optimizing our total shareholder return. We remain fully focused on executing them. 
With that, I will turn over to Tom to discuss in detail the updated outlook."

As Tom mentioned earlier, we have met or exceeded all of our primary financial and operational objectives to date as set forth in our prior 3-year plans published in 2013, 2014 and 2015.

As Tom mentioned earlier, we have met or exceeded all of our primary financial and operational objectives to date as set forth in our prior 3-year plans published in 2013, 2014 and 2015. In particular, our same-store growth and development deliveries have outperformed over the past 3 years and has served us primary drivers in our better-than-expected cash flow growth and improvements in balance sheet metrics.
Turning to Page 5. Perhaps the most critical driver of UDR's value-creation strategy is our best-in-class operations. We are continuously implementing new revenue growth and cost efficiency initiatives throughout the organization to improve how we do buys. As noted on this page, we have consistently produced better overall top line growth versus peers and the U.S. average since the initiation our 3-year plan in 2013. During this time we have grown our total revenue per occupied home by 26%, increased occupancy by 100 basis points, reduced turnover by 310 basis points and improved our margins by 220 basis points. So how will we maintain our operational advantage and how do you intend to keep it in the future? Please turn to Page 6.
Many who listen to this call are familiar with the primary revenue generation expense control initiatives that are underway. These, along with potential future initiatives, are presented in the table of this page. Importantly, all of our growth and efficiency initiatives have one thing in common, they either provide our customer wanted service or allow our associates to do their jobs better. Current initiatives should continue to drive our bottom line and our list of potential future initiatives is extensive.
Please turn to Page 7. This page lists some of our operational projects that have been implemented over the past couple of years and their impact on our NOI. As is evident, we have made solid progress on each initiative to date and our bottom line has benefited greatly. We will continue to capture additional NOI efficiencies from these initiatives. Operations has been and will continue to be significant limited of advantage for us. This is not just because of our superior blocking and tackling in the field, but also because of the creativity our operations team employs to continuously improve the business.
Turning now to capital allocation and development on Page 8. Development remains a vital component of our value creation strategy. While management [indiscernible] deals [indiscernible] in today's environment, [indiscernible] remains accretive and will continue to be a primary mean in which we continuously improve our portfolio. At year-end, our underway development totaled 670 million towards the equity requirement of 55% funded. Additionally, our share of the West Coast development joint venture going in value was $271 million towards 100% of the equity has been funded. This pipeline is concentrated in our primary coastal markets. Inclusive of the West Coast development JV, we expect to deliver $375 million and $220 million of projects in 2016 and 2017, respectively. 
Our annual targeted spend of $400 million to $500 million per year and our targeted trended spread versus cap rates in 150 to 200 basis points have not changed. While construction costs continue to increase, so do rents. To mitigate my good risk around new development projects, we employed the following disciplines: first, prior to a development commencing, we generally seek entitled land, demand full drawings and a GMAX contract thereby locking in cost and reducing risk. 
Second, we diversify our geographic exposure. Our goal is to commence a new development in a target market as the previous development's leasing up. 
Third, we utilize conservative top line growth assumptions to underwrite our projects. 
And lastly, we employ our self-funded strategy to fund our development pipeline and reduce the penalty on capital markets.
To our free cash flow and non-core asset sales, we can fully fund our annual development spend. In other words, we are match-funding our risk as we recycle older, non-core assets to develop new core assets in our primary markets.
In 2016 and 2017, we will continue to mine our current land bank as well as add new land sites. We are planning to 2 to 3 search in 2016 which include one large wholly-owned project, 345 Harrison in Boston, and 1 to 2 smaller 50-50 JVs with MetLife. As of year-end 2015, our shadow pipeline was approximately $900 million at our pro rata ownership and represented $425 million to $475 million evaluation, assuming current spreads. Please turn to Page 9.
We anticipate that upon full stabilization, which occurs at different periods for each project, our pipeline of underway and completed developments is expected to generate accretion of $0.07 per share, with growth thereafter. On an NAV basis, we expect our pipeline to generate $1.75 per share at stabilization or approximately 35% to 40% value creation of our cost. Page 10 exhibits some of our recent developments.
Please turn to Page 11. As focused as we are on operations and development, maintaining the strong balance sheet, along with a self-funded plan are just as important. We have seen the balance sheet metric goals provided in our 2013, 2014 and 2015 strategic plans, we expect further improvements from 2016 and 2017. This has also been acknowledged by the rating agencies. In 2014, we received a credit upgrade from Moody's to Baa1. And in 2015, we received an upgrade from S&P to BBB+. 
On the capital markets front, our 2016 and 2017 capital needs will be funded through a combination of asset sales and new equity and debt, of which we'll utilize the most advantageous source depending on our strategic objectives, market conditions and pricing at the time the capital is needed. 
Please turn to Page 12. In 2015, our AFFO per share of it was a strong 11%. In 2016, AFFO per share growth is expected to average in the 6% to 9% range. This growth will continue to be driven primarily by favorable same-store growth and development therein. And these will be partially offset by fewer items including non-core dispositions, higher expected interest rate and 421-a and g property tax impact. 
In 2017, AFFO per share growth is expected to be in the 5% to 8% range. This 100 basis point delta is primarily due to lower same-store assumptions. As in our prior strategic plans, we rely on third-party data providers for our future growth expectations in the out years. And of note, these estimates have proven conservative in the last several years and our team has been able to outperform.
We expect the business to 9% to 11% NAV growth in 2016 and 8% to 10% NAV growth in 2017. Please turn to Page 13.
This page provides our 2016 guidance, initial 2017 expectations and detailed modeling assumptions. In 2017, we are expecting solid same-store and cash flow growth based on still strong third-party job growth expectations against moderating new multifamily supply growth in our markets. In addition, our expected asset sales and entrance to our same-store pool in 2016 and 2017 will enhance our same-store mix toward higher growth markets.
And finally, Page 14. Our 2016 top line growth assumptions for our markets are presented on the map. We expect the West Coast and Southeast to grow at a rate above the portfolio average. The Mid-Atlantic will continue to perform below the portfolio average but will improve slightly, and we still expect to outperform relative to our peers due to our 50-50 mix of As and Bs in D.C. and less direct risk exposure to new supply inside the Beltway. 
With that I will turn it open to Q&A. Operator."

So that lowered the development by a bit from what we had seen in 2015. Some of the items that would've leaned against FFO growth relative to the NOI, it would have been -- floating interest rates are up about 40 basis points, in our model that's $0.01. The average revolver balance is going to be down some, call it $150 million or so, that's $0.015 and was also due to the timing of mid-September debt issuance. The tax benefit goes from $3.9 million to $1.5 million, that's $0.01. [indiscernible] 31 exchanges picks up another $0.01. And then to your point earlier, that is partially offset by the accretive West Coast JV and some accretion on the home transaction, and those are all the moving parts. So this is as we would've expected, our core and base growth going forward it's just as strong but we just had a few items that caused -- that to come a little bit lower relative to the same-store."

We did see [indiscernible] occupancy and pricing power hit pressures in the fourth quarter, but as we've rolled into January we started to see signs of improvement. New lease rate growth in the fourth quarter was 5.2%, renewal growth 9 3. As we look at January, our January new leases are up 4.2% in San Francisco, San Jose and that compares to 3 3 in December, so it is improving. And our January renewals are still well above 8% at 8.4% our occupancy's at 97 so it has strengthened. Now as we look at good job, which is the primary concern in those markets right now, it's been running about 4.5% for the past couple of years. And when we have talked to AXIO Metrics, they're forecasting for job growth to decelerate to 2.5% to 3%. And while that's about 150 to 200 basis point deceleration, it's still well above the national average of job growth of 1.75% to 2%. So we'd like to think it's all seasonal. We're going to know in the next 60 days if it is. And over the last 3 to 5 years, there's probably 2 or 3x in the first quarter when that group concerned about the strength in San Francisco only to see things turn around as we got into the month of March and April so it's a subtle bit early to tell. But on the ground, we're not seeing any significant job loss from many single employers. And as I've said as we've come out of the fourth quarter and answered the first quarter, we have seen fundamental start to strengthen again."

Once again this is probably going to be the third or fourth straight year that it's been negative to positive -- either negative or up 1%.

So if we choose to we can fund the entire development spend on a self-funded basis and our debt maturities through refis.

One, we spread the lease expirations throughout the month instead of having them all occur at the same time. Some -- it's much easier just to say leases expire at the end of the month, but when you do that, you have 30 people move out at a 600-unit property. Your maintenance team can't get to the 30th apartment to turn it until day 22. By spreading it throughout the month, you're able to do a little bit better. The other things you do is you try to entice people to push up your move-in date. If you know an apartment is going to be market-ready on the 26th of the month and somebody comes in and says, hey, I want to move in at the end of the month or the beginning of the month, you basically tell them when they will be moving in. So you push them closer to the 26 instead of automatically just putting them in as a move-in on the 30th and that could cut off 3 days. So some of it's strategic, some of it is putting in more demanding metrics in our maintenance team for expectations of when apartments need to be turned. Old-school way of doing it, you wouldn't go turn a  unit until it was leased. The way we try to do it is turn as quickly as you can from when someone moves out so you have ready inventory.

It doesn't really have refunds calculated in, and I'm confident we're going to get some of those. The other expense categories we're looking that we've build in the second largest component of our expense stack is personnel which is about 1/4 of our total expenses. We expect that to go up to 24 -- 4.25% higher than it has of the last several years as we had more competitive pressures to attract and retain our associates. All of the other categories, marketing we expect to go down. Our marketing team's done a great job both with our website, as well as working with the ISLs to -- or ILSs to bring down our cost. Repairs and maintenance, I don't see that going up dramatically. I think we have that locked down pretty well. Some of the expense side, I think it's not overly risky. The revenue side, there's always risk and probably the 2 markets that we're keeping our eyes on the most would be San Francisco because we hear all those same information you guys here. New York, we're watching that closely too and as I've said earlier about both of those markets, they both today, it's not apparent to us whether it's seasonal issues that created weakness in the fourth quarter because we're starting to strengthen [indiscernible] something more. But as I look at it there's really 3 markets that today you would say are kind of risky, and it'd those 2, as well as Austin. But what I would also say is, those constitute 25% of UDR's total NOI. When you look at all of the other markets combined, which make up 75%, we see strength. We see strength in Southern California, the entire Sunbelt with the exception of Austin is extremely strong today. D.C., while it's  still going to be a laggard by comparison, it's improving and we think Boston's improving. So while there may be risk in a market or two, the benefit of having a geographically dispersed and asset class differentiation between the As and Bs I think this is pretty good protection."

The other thing I'd mention is when we look at our current leverage levels with the rating agencies and we have studies done by 3 different banks as to where we're rated at the BBB+, Baa1 and what the sweet spot has been determined is at the leverage level that we're, at the BBB+, Baa1. So to go through unnatural means to further improve that leverage and do so on a [indiscernible] basis is not something that's all that enticing as we think we could continue to improve it over time in the ways I just described."

On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A.
During this call, we will present our updated 2-year strategic outlook as we have done in the last 3 years. In 2015, we again met or exceeded all primary objectives of our strategic plan and to date have meaningfully outperformed each of our prior plans. Tom will address this outperformance and the next 2-year strategic outlook in detail later in the call.
Turning to 2015, was another great year for UDR, and we continue to see strength in all aspects of our business. A quick recap of the team's accomplishments during the year.
First, our operations continued to run on all cylinders and delivered strong same-store results across the board, with same-store NOI growth of 6.7%, a full 220 basis points ahead of our initial expectations.
Second, we delivered over $300 million of developments, which leased up well, and we expect to hit our targeted returns of 6.2% or better at stabilization.
Third, we entered into 2 accretive problem-solving transactions, mainly the $559 million West Coast development joint venture and the $901 million Washington, D.C. acquisition, in which we kept to our principles of self-funding, accretive to cash flow growth and continued strengthening of our balance sheet.
Last, we grew AFFO per share by 12%, a strong rate, which resulted in a 7% dividend increase and meaningful consensus NAV per share growth of 15%.
We continue to believe that growth in these 2 metrics translates into strong total shareholder return over time.
Looking towards the future, we feel very positive about our business and our prospects. Multifamily fundamentals remain extraordinarily strong. The positive demographic trends amongst our prime renters, the 22- to 35-year-old population cohort, is expected to grow through 2030 and is not reversible. This, coupled with steady job growth, leaves us confident that our operating platform, which is our primary driver of our cash flow growth, should continue to generate impressive results in the future.
Our self-funded development pipeline is expected to generate the incremental cash flow and value creation we originally forecasted. Expected additions to the pipeline in 2016 will maintain our targeted size at $900 million to $1.4 billion and are forecasted to be highly accretive. Our ability to fund this pipeline with asset sales largely reduces our dependency on capital markets. And as we've said in prior years, we will continue to focus on improving our debt metrics.
In summary, there remains a long runway for growth at UDR, and we have the right plan and team in place to capitalize on the opportunity.
With that, I'd like to express my sincere thanks to all my fellow UDR associates for their hard work and producing another strong year of results. We look forward to a great 2016, and now I will turn the call over to Tom."

For full year 2015, FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $1.66, $1.67 and $1.51, respectively. Full year same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth of 5.6%, 3.0% and 6.7% exhibited continued strong demand for apartments and were above our initial expectations provided last February.
At year-end, our liquidity, as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, was $987 million. Our financial leverage on an undepreciated cost basis was 34.6%. Based on our current market cap, it was approximately 26%. And inclusive of JVs, it was approximately 30%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.7x and inclusive of JVs was 6.7x. All balance sheet metric improvements were ahead of plan.
On to first quarter and full year 2016 guidance. Full year 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share is forecasted at $1.75 to $1.81, $1.75 to $1.81 and $1.59 to $1.65, respectively. For same-store, our full year 2016 revenue growth guidance is 5.5% to 6.0%; expense, 3.0% to 3.5%; and NOI, 6.5% to 7.0%. Average 2016 occupancy is forecasted at 96.6%.

310667,321466083,926037,"UDR, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","UDR, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks I'll cover the following topics: First, our fourth quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the continued success we realized in pushing rental rate growth again this quarter and into January;",1304,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks I'll cover the following topics: First, our fourth quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the continued success we realized in pushing rental rate growth again this quarter and into January; second, the performance of our primary markets during the quarter and expectations for 2016; and last, a brief update on our lease-up developments and the Washington, D.C. acquisition.
We're pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. Our fourth quarter same-store revenue growth of 6.2% was driven by an increase in revenue per occupied home of 6.5% year-over-year to $1,794 per month, while same-store occupancy of 96.5% was 30 basis points lower versus the prior year period. Our fourth quarter strategy of holding rate high, along with aggressive rate increases throughout 2015, benefits us in 2016 as we enter the year with almost 2.75% of our revenue growth already baked into our rent roll. Our robust full year same-store revenue growth of 5.6% was driven by a 5.5% increase in revenue per occupied home and flat occupancy. We see strong rate growth continuing in 2016.
Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth, which is detailed on Attachment 8G of our supplement, we continue to push rate in the fourth quarter. New lease growth totaled 3.8% or 170 basis points ahead of the fourth quarter of 2014. Renewal growth remained resilient, improving 170 basis points year-over-year to 7%. This year-over-year acceleration was accomplished with only a 40 basis point increase in fourth quarter turnover.
Next, move-outs to home purchase were up 120 basis points year-over-year at 14%, in line with our long-term average. Importantly, our full year 2015 turnover rate increased by just 20 basis points versus full year 2014. Even with renewal increases at a seasonally strong 7% -- only 7% of our move-outs gave rent increase as the reason for leaving in the fourth quarter. However, we expect turnover to increase roughly 100 basis points in 2016, as our revenue growth is highly predicated on the rate growth and not year-over-year occupancy gains.
Moving on to quarterly performance on our primary markets, which represent 69% of our same-store NOI and 75% of our total NOI. Metro D.C., which represents 18% of our total NOI, posted positive full year revenue growth of 1.7%. We expect improving full year revenue growth in 2016 of around 2.5% as we continue to benefit from our diverse exposure of 50% B assets and 50% A assets located both inside and outside the Beltway. 
Orange County and Los Angeles combined represents 15.4% of our total NOI. Orange County posted sequential revenue growth of 160 basis points and continues to outperform our budgeted expectations early in 2016. L.A. is materially stronger due to our heavy concentration in the Marina del Rey submarket as new jobs have continued to migrate to this highly desirable submarket. Fourth quarter revenue growth in L.A. was an impressive 10.2%. Our current expectation is that both of these markets will generate revenue growth in the 7% range in 2016.
New York City, which represents 12% of our total NOI, posted full year revenue growth of 5.6%. We saw a seasonal weakness in the fourth quarter and early January, but future trends are pointing to strength within our submarkets. We continue to expect new jobs from technology, finance and media, which will benefit our lower Manhattan properties. Our 2016 forecasted revenue growth of 6% is above 2015. I would remind everyone that View 34 is in our same-store pool beginning in the first quarter of 2016.
San Francisco and San Jose, which represent 11% of our total NOI, posted full year revenue growth of 9.7%. Although we saw weakness in the fourth quarter, it is indicative of the first and fourth quarter seasonality that we've seen in this market in the past. With that said, we believe this weakness is possibly more than just seasonal and do not expect this market to post the double-digit revenue growth that it has in recent years and we have forecast that a deceleration in 2016 to revenue growth of 8% or so. Future trends are slowly improving from what we saw in the fourth quarter, but we are keeping a close eye on the job growth and absorption levels within our submarkets. Keep in mind, San Francisco job growth has been above 4.5% for the past few years. Axiometrics' current forecast calls for job growth to decelerate to 2.5% to 3% but still well above the national average of 1.75% to 2%.
Seattle, which represents 6% of our total NOI, benefited from strong growth in suburban B assets that are less exposed to new supply than A assets downtown. Although new supply will challenge us somewhat in Downtown Seattle and, to a lesser degree, in Bellevue, we expect 2016 to be slightly below our 2015 numbers or roughly 7% growth.
Boston, which represents 7% of our total NOI, should continue to see new supply pressure downtown, but our suburban assets in the north and south shores should fare relatively better in 2016. Long term, we like the downtown submarket and look to continue to grow through development in this submarket. Most recently GE announced the relocation of their global headquarters to the Seaport district. This will bring another 800 jobs into the submarket, which should directly benefit our 369-home, 100 Pier 4 community and our future 345 Harrison development in Boston Southend. Our forecast calls for revenue growth to accelerate slightly from the 5.5% growth posted in 2015.
Last, Dallas, which represents 5% of our total NOI, posted 5.1% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. We expect new supply pressure in uptown and Plano in 2016. January results indicate that these submarkets are performing slightly better than initial budgeted expectations, and 2016 revenue growth is projected to improve to roughly 5.5% from 5% in 2015.
As you can see on Attachment 7B of our supplement, our 320-home Los Alisos community located in Orange County, our 196-home Waterscape community located in Seattle and our 740-home View 34 community located in New York City will join the same-store pool in the first quarter of 2016.
Turning to our in-lease-up developments. Katella Grand I, our 399-home, $138 million lease-up in Anaheim, California in the West Coast development JV, was 16% occupied at quarter end and as of today is 20% occupied and 27% leased. We are currently offering less than 1 month of concession at this community, and leasing has been very strong in January with 25 applications.
CityLine, our 244-home, $80 million lease-up in Seattle, Washington, was 9% occupied at quarter end. We are on budget and meeting our lease-up expectations.
Finally, 399 Fremont, our 447-home, $318 million lease-up in San Francisco, began leasing during the fourth quarter. At quarter end, we were just 2% leased. And today, we're over 10% leased with rents exceeding pro forma. We will have our first move-ins in March of 2016.
Now a quick update on the Washington, D.C. acquisition. We're 3 months into owning these communities, and everything is going as according to plan. Currently, we're making CapEx improvements at 2 of the properties to either cure deferred maintenance or drive a higher return to revenue-enhancing improvements. And we still expect these communities to perform in line with our D.C. portfolio this year, with revenue growth right around 2.5%. Currently we would expect 5 of the 6 communities in this portfolio to enter our same-store pool in the first quarter of 2017.
With that, I will remind those listening that there's a link to our updated 2-year strategic outlook document on the Investor Relations page of our website. We will pause for a moment so that everyone can gather the 2-year outlook materials.
I will now turn the call back over to Tom Toomey."

First, we view this year's update as a continuation of the last 3 plans. We believe this continues to be the right path for UDR. Here's why. The plan's primary objective is to drive high-quality cash flow growth while incrementally improving our balance sheet and portfolio. In other words, consistent, sustainable growth that is funded in a safe, low-risk manner. We believe that successful execution of these objectives will drive strong total shareholder return.
There are 4 key points I'd like to highlight why we think there's a long runway of accretive growth ahead.
First, fundamentals. You have seen plenty of published data on this. And clearly, demographics, supply-demand characteristics are in our favor, and any good business that is going to grow for a number of years needs solid fundamentals.
The second is strategic position. Where do we start? Well, we're in 20 markets, 50% A, B quality mix. We like this position. We think it solves for the #1 critical element of any future growth, which is the positioning of our portfolio such that our residents will continue to be able to grow to pay higher rents.
The third is the team and the skills. Operationally, we'll continue to innovate, invest in technology and training programs, all of which are designed to increase our margins, which now stand above 70% at the NOI line, extraordinary for any business. On the development side, we'll remain focused on looking at our risk-adjusted returns and staying disciplined. 
Third is problem solving. Clearly, we operate in a cyclical economy. And along that line, there will be challenges and opportunities. We have a team that is very experienced of managing through these cycles, if not anticipating these cycles and these opportunities. Certainly, I feel confident that the team has the ability to capitalize on these opportunities as they become available. 
And lastly and just as important is managing risk. And we see ourselves managing this through, first, our diversity of our market mix; our discipline around our development; and certainly our continued improving balance sheet set of metrics; and lastly, our transparency in disclosure and communication style.
We believe these main objectives can continue our cash flow growth in optimizing our total shareholder return. We remain fully focused on executing them.
With that, I will turn over to Tom to discuss in detail the updated outlook."

As Tom mentioned earlier, we have met or exceeded all of our primary financial and operational objectives to date, as set forth in our prior 3-year plans published in 2013, 2014 and 2015.

As Tom mentioned earlier, we have met or exceeded all of our primary financial and operational objectives to date, as set forth in our prior 3-year plans published in 2013, 2014 and 2015. In particular, our same-store growth and development deliveries have outperformed over the past 3 years and has served as primary drivers of our better-than-expected cash flow growth and improvements in balance sheet metrics.
Turning to Page 5. Perhaps the most critical driver of UDR's value-creation strategy is our best-in-class operations. We are continuously implementing new revenue growth and cost efficiency initiatives throughout the organization to improve how we do business. As noted on this page, we have consistently produced better overall top line growth versus peers and the U.S. average since the initiation of our 3-year plan in 2013. During this time, we have grown our total revenue per occupied home by 26%, increased occupancy by 100 basis points, reduced turnover by 310 basis points and improved our margins by 220 basis points.
So how will we maintain our operational advantage and how do we intend to keep it in the future? Please turn to Page 6.
Many who listen to this call are familiar with the primary revenue generation, expense control initiatives that are underway. These, along with potential future initiatives, are presented in the table on this page. Importantly, all of our growth and efficiency initiatives have one thing in common: they either provide our customer wanted service or allow our associates to do their jobs better. Current initiatives should continue to drive our bottom line, and our list of potential future initiatives is extensive.
Please turn to Page 7. This page lists some of our operational projects that have been implemented over the past couple of years and their impact on our NOI. As is evident, we have made solid progress on each initiative to date, and our bottom line has benefited greatly. We will continue to capture additional NOI efficiencies from these initiatives. Operation has been and will continue to be a significant competitive advantage for us. This is not just because of our superior blocking and tackling in the field, but also because of the creativity our operations team employs to continuously improve the business.
Turning now to capital allocation and development on Page 8. Development remains a vital component of our value-creation strategy. While management of deals is painful in today's environment, development remains accretive and will continue to be a primary mean through which we continuously improve our portfolio. At year-end, our underway development totaled $670 million, for which the equity requirement was 55% funded. Additionally, our share of the West Coast development joint venture going-in value was $271 million, for which 100% of the equity has been funded. This pipeline is concentrated in our primary coastal markets. Inclusive of the West Coast development JV, we expect to deliver $375 million and $220 million of projects in 2016 and 2017, respectively.
Our annual targeted spend of $400 million to $500 million per year and our targeted trended spread versus cap rates of 150 to 200 basis points have not changed. While construction costs continue to increase, so do rents.
To mitigate market risk around new development projects, we employ the following disciplines: First, prior to a development commencing, we generally seek entitled land, demand full drawings and a GMAX contract, thereby locking in cost and reducing risk. 
Second, we diversify our geographic exposure. Our goal is to commence a new development in a target market as the previous development's leasing up.
Third, we utilize conservative top line growth assumptions to underwrite our projects.
And lastly, we employ our self-funded strategy to fund our development pipeline and reduce dependency on capital markets.
To our free cash flow and noncore asset sales, we can fully fund our annual development spend. In other words, we are match-funding our risk as we recycle older noncore assets to develop new core assets in our primary markets.
In 2016 and 2017, we will continue to mine our current land bank as well as add new land sites. We are planning 2 to 3 search in 2016, which include one large wholly owned project, 345 Harrison in Boston; and 1 to 2 smaller 50-50 JVs with MetLife. As of year-end 2015, our shadow pipeline was approximately $900 million at our pro rata ownership and represented $425 million to $475 million of value creation, assuming current spreads. 
Please turn to Page 9.
We anticipate that upon full stabilization, which occurs at different periods for each project, our pipeline of underway and completed developments is expected to generate accretion of $0.07 per share with growth thereafter. On an NAV basis, we expect our pipeline to generate $1.75 per share at stabilization or approximately 35% to 40% value creation over cost.
Page 10 exhibits some of our recent developments.
Please turn to Page 11. As focused as we are on operations and development, maintaining a strong balance sheet along with a self-funded plan are just as important. We exceeded the balance sheet metric goals provided in our 2013, 2014 and 2015 strategic plans. We expect further improvements in 2016 and 2017. This has also been acknowledged by the rating agencies. In 2014, we received a credit upgrade from Moody's to Baa1. And in 2015, we received an upgrade from S&P to BBB+.
On the capital markets front, our 2016 and 2017 capital needs will be funded through a combination of asset sales and new equity and debt, of which we'll utilize the most advantageous source depending on our strategic objectives, market conditions and pricing at the time the capital is needed.
Please turn to Page 12. In 2015, our AFFO per share growth was a strong 11%. In 2016, AFFO per share growth is expected to average in the 6% to 9% range. This growth will continue to be driven primarily by favorable same-store growth and development earn-in. And these will be partially offset by a few items, including noncore dispositions, higher expected interest rates and 421-a and g property tax impacts.
In 2017, AFFO per share growth is expected to be in the 5% to 8% range. This 100 basis point delta is primarily due to lower same-store assumptions. As in our prior strategic plans, we rely on third-party data providers for our future growth expectations in the out-years. And of note, these estimates have proven conservative in the last several years, and our team has been able to outperform.
We expect the business to drive 9% to 11% NAV growth in 2016 and 8% to 10% NAV growth in 2017.
Please turn to Page 13.
This page provides our 2016 guidance, initial 2017 expectations and detailed modeling assumptions. In 2017, we are expecting solid same-store and cash flow growth based on still strong third-party job growth expectations against moderating new multifamily supply growth in our markets. In addition, our expected asset sales and entrants to our same-store pool in 2016 and 2017 will enhance our same-store mix toward higher growth markets.
And finally, Page 14. Our 2016 top line growth assumptions for our markets are presented on the map. We expect the West Coast and Southeast to grow at a rate above the portfolio average. The Mid-Atlantic will continue to perform below the portfolio average but will improve slightly and still expect to outperform relative to our peers due to our 50-50 mix of As and Bs in D.C. and less direct exposure to new supply inside the Beltway.

What they're forecasting is continuation of job growth, not too far off from what it was in 2015, call it a little over 200,000 per month. Supply is going to impact us this year, probably a little more than it did last year. And then in '17, there's a drop-off. So we look at the macro data. And then we start looking at specific submarkets where we operate and take into account how directly we're going to be affected by that. In addition, when you really go through it -- so there's a few other things to consider. We will continue to spend about $35 million to probably low to $40 millions in revenue-enhancing improvements to our properties. So it will add probably between 50 and 25 basis points into 2017 and probably about that much in 2016. And as we look further out into 2017, there's probably only a couple of markets that look to us like they would be decelerating from the growth rates that we anticipate in 2016. Those are Northern California, Seattle for the most part. And then we see some that we think are going to be improving, and that would be the Mid-Atlantic. We also see Boston most likely improving for us. And then the rest of our portfolio, whether it's SoCal or the Sunbelt, we would expect to be modestly down. And when you blend all that together, it takes you from our midpoint this year of about a  5 7 5 growth down to that 5. So again, we don't really anticipate a recession. We don't claim to be economists. We subscribe to what they say, but that's how we're looking at the business."

All great projects, but at this point, there's some drag. So that lowered the development by a bit from what we had seen in 2015. As to some of the items that would have leaned against the FFO growth relative to the NOI, it would have been -- floating interest rates are up about 40 basis points. In our model, that's $0.01. The average revolver balance is going to be down some, call it $150 million or so. That's $0.015, and that was just due to the timing of that mid-September debt issuance. The tax benefit goes from $3.9 million to $1.5 million. That's $0.01. Non-1031 exchanges picks up another $0.01. And then to your point earlier, that is partially offset by the accretive West Coast JV and some accretion on the home transaction, and those are all the moving parts. So this is -- as we would have expected, our core and base growth going forward is just as strong, but we just had a few items that caused FFO to come in a little bit lower relative to the same-store."

But as we've rolled into January, we started to see signs of improvement. Now new lease rate growth in the fourth quarter was 5.2%. Renewal growth was 9.3%. As we look at January, our January new leases are up 4.2% in San Francisco, San Jose, and that compares to 3.3% in December. So it is improving. And our January renewals are still well above 8% at 8.4%. Our occupancy is at 97%. So it has strengthened. Now as we look at job growth, which is the primary concern in those markets right now, it's been running about 4.5% for the past couple of years. And when we have talked to Axiometrics, they're forecasting for job growth to decelerate to 2.5% to 3%. And while that's about 150 to 200 basis point deceleration, it's still well above the national average of job growth of 1.75% to 2%. So we'd like to think it's all seasonal. We're going to know in the next 60 days if it is. And over the last 3 to 5 years, there's probably been 2 or 3x in the first quarter when I grew concern about the strength in San Francisco, only to see things turn around as we got into the month of March and April. So it's just a little bit early to tell. But on the ground, we're not seeing any significant job loss from any single employers. And as I've said, as we've come out of the fourth quarter and entered the first quarter, we have seen fundamentals start to strengthen again."

So we'll let that vacant day stay about where it is. On the staffing efficiency, I think we can continue to drive that metric even better. There's a few things technologically. We're working with our property management software provider to help us go to the next step on. But I would tell you, as we created our expense budgets for 2016, we do have our repairs and maintenance coming in at flat. Once again, this is probably going to be the third or fourth straight year that it's been negative to positive -- either negative or up 1%. So we've kept that in pretty good control, while we've been able to achieve turnover that remained flat.

So if we choose to we can fund the entire development spend on a self-funded basis and our debt maturities through refis. In the meantime, we have $1 billion of capacity right now on our revolver and cash. So again, back to the point of our business being quite self-funded.

One of the thing I would have you note though that might get missed is that we have the transitional plan in place moving from the old LTI program to the new where we now have a 3-year cliff vest on the TSR portion and we didn't use to have that.

Some -- it's much easier just to say leases expire at the end of the month, but when you do that, you have 30 people move out at a 600-unit property. Your maintenance team can't get to the 30th apartment to turn it until day 22. By spreading it throughout the month, you're able to do a little bit better. The other things you do is you try to entice people to push up their move-in date. If you know an apartment is going to be market-ready on the 26th of the month and somebody comes in and says, ""Hey, I want to move in at the end of the month or the beginning of the month."" You basically tell them when they will be moving in. So you push them closer to the 26 instead of automatically just putting them in as they move in on the 30th and that could cut off 3 days. So some of it's strategic, some of it is putting in more demanding metrics on our maintenance team for expectations of when apartments need to be turned. Old-school way of doing it, you wouldn't go turn a unit until it was leased. The way we try to do it is turn it as quickly as you can from when somebody moves out so you have ready inventory.

I don't have the exact number off the top of my head. I will tell you my expectations this year for '16 is my turnover's going to go up to about 100 basis points because we're going to continue to try to drive rate. So I don't think you're going to see it continue to come down. We're not seeing an increase in move-outs to homeownership. We're not seeing it for money problems. The one metric that is tending to migrate up a little bit is move-outs due to rent increase but it still has not got into a level that I see is pushing an inordinate number of people out the door. And if you look at that schedule that's in our supp,  which shows the turnover metrics comparing this year to last year attachment 8(G), there's really only one market where you see a significant increase and that's our Monterey County, which went probably from 49% to almost 57%. That's also a market where we have revenue growth this past year in the low to mid-teens, so we would do it all again. In places like San Francisco and areas like that, it's going up 100, 150 bps and I'll take that too as long as I'm getting renewal growth that's approaching double-digit."

When you have a margin like us, what really moves the business most is the revenue. I already told you what we have in our model currently for real estate tax is at 7%. It really doesn't have refunds calculated in, and I'm confident we're going to get some of those. The other expense categories we're looking at and then we built in the second largest component of our expense stack is personnel, which is about 1/4 of our total expenses. We expect that to go up to 24.25% higher than it has the last several years as we have more competitive pressures to attract and retain our associates. All of the other categories, marketing we expect to go down. Our marketing team's done a great job both with our website, as well as working with the ISLs to -- or ILSs to bring down our cost. Repairs and maintenance, I don't see that going up dramatically. I think we have that locked down pretty well. So on the expense side, I think it's not overly risky. The revenue side, there's always risk and probably the 2 markets that we're keeping our eyes on the most would be San Francisco because we hear all those same information you guys hear. New York, we're watching that closely too and as I've said earlier about both of those markets, they both today, it's not apparent to us whether it's seasonal issues that created weakness in the fourth quarter because we're starting to strengthen if it's something more. But as I look at it there's really 3 markets that today you would say are kind of risky, and it'd be those 2, as well as Austin. But what I would also say is those constitute 25% of UDR's total NOI. When you look at all of the other markets combined, which make up 75%, we see strength. We see strength in Southern California, the entire Sunbelt with the exception of Austin is extremely strong today. D.C., while it's still going to be a laggard by comparison, it's improving and we think Boston's improving. So while there may be risk in a market or 2, the benefit of having a geographically dispersed and asset class differentiation between the As and Bs, I think, give us pretty good protection."

One of the things you have to take into account is that when you look back at what's taken place in the company over the last number of years we have dramatically reduced leverage. But over the last few years it's been purely or substantially organic way. And so you've got the organic improvements that will occur, but also as we had an opportunity to do a Home or a West Coast development JV, if we were trading at a place where we could issue stock at a premium, that does give us an opportunity to further delever the enterprise by acquiring assets on an accretive basis at a premium and that lowers the leverage of the enterprise. The other thing I'd mention is when we look at our current leverage levels with the rating agencies and we have -- had studies done by 3 different banks as to where we're rated at the BBB+, Baa1 and what the sweet spot has been determined is at the leverage level that we're at, at the BBB+, Baa1. So to go through unnatural means to further improve that leverage and do so on a diluted basis is not something that's all that enticing as we think we can continue to improve it over time in the ways that I just described."

On the call with me today are Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A.
During this call, we will present our updated 2-year strategic outlook as we have done in the last 3 years. In 2015, we again met or exceeded all primary objectives of our strategic plan and to date have meaningfully outperformed each of our prior plans. Tom will address this outperformance and the next 2-year's strategic outlook in detail later in the call.
Turning to 2015, was another great year for UDR, and we continue to see strength in all aspects of our business. A quick recap of the team's accomplishments during the year.
First, our operations continued to run on all cylinders and delivered strong same-store results across the board, with same-store NOI growth of 6.7%, a full 220 basis points ahead of our initial expectations.
Second, we delivered over $300 million of developments, which leased up well, and we expect to hit our targeted returns of 6.2% or better at stabilization.
Third, we entered into 2 accretive problem-solving transactions, mainly the $559 million West Coast development joint venture and the $901 million Washington, D.C. acquisition, in which we kept to our principles of self-funding, accretive-to-cash-flow growth and continued strengthening of our balance sheet.
Last, we grew AFFO per share by 12%; a strong rate, which resulted in a 7% dividend increase and meaningful consensus NAV per share growth of 15%.
We continue to believe that growth in these 2 metrics translates into strong total shareholder return over time.
Looking towards the future, we feel very positive about our business and our prospects. Multifamily fundamentals remain extraordinarily strong. The positive demographic trends amongst our prime renters, the 22- to 35-year-old population cohort, is expected to grow through 2030 and is not reversible. This, coupled with steady job growth, leaves us confident that our operating platform, which is our primary driver of our cash flow growth, should continue to generate impressive results in the future.
Our self-funded development pipeline is expected to generate the incremental cash flow and value creation we originally forecasted. Expected additions to the pipeline in 2016 will maintain our targeted size at $900 million to $1.4 billion and are forecasted to be highly accretive. Our ability to fund this pipeline with asset sales largely reduces our dependency on capital markets. And as we've said in prior years, we will continue to focus on improving our debt metrics.
In summary, there remains a long runway for growth at UDR, and we have the right plan and team in place to capitalize on the opportunity.
With that, I'd like to express my sincere thanks to all my fellow UDR associates for their hard work and producing another strong year of results. We look forward to a great 2016, and now I will turn the call over to Tom."

FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.41, $0.42 and $0.37, respectively. Fourth quarter same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth remained strong at 6.2%, 5.2% and 6.6%, respectively.
For full year 2015, FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $1.66, $1.67 and $1.51, respectively. Full year same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth of 5.6%, 3.0% and 6.7% exhibited continued strong demand for apartments and were above our initial expectations provided last February.
At year-end, our liquidity, as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, was $987 million. Our financial leverage on an undepreciated cost basis was 34.6%. Based on our current market cap, it was approximately 26%. And inclusive of JVs, it was approximately 30%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.7x and inclusive of JVs was 6.7x. All balance sheet metric improvements were ahead of plan.
Onto first quarter and full year 2016 guidance. Full year 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share is forecasted at $1.75 to $1.81, $1.75 to $1.81 and $1.59 to $1.65, respectively. For same-store, our full year 2016 revenue growth guidance is 5.5% to 6.0%; expense, 3.0% to 3.5%; and NOI, 6.5% to 7.0%. Average 2016 occupancy is forecasted at 96.6%. Other primary full year guidance assumptions can be found on Attachment 15 or Page 28 of our supplement.
First quarter 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance is $0.42 to $0.44, $0.42 to $0.44 and $0.40 to $0.42, respectively.
Finally, with our release today, we have increased our 2016 annualized dividend to $1.18 per share, a 6% increase from 2015 and represented a yield of approximately 3.25%.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry."
310667,321466083,926099,"UDR, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","UDR, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks I'll cover the following topics: First, our fourth quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the continued success we realized in pushing rental rate growth again this quarter and into January;",1303,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks I'll cover the following topics: First, our fourth quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the continued success we realized in pushing rental rate growth again this quarter and into January; second, the performance of our primary markets during the quarter and expectations for 2016; and last, a brief update on our lease-up developments and the Washington, D.C. acquisition.
We're pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. Our fourth quarter same-store revenue growth of 6.2% was driven by an increase in revenue per occupied home of 6.5% year-over-year to $1,794 per month, while same-store occupancy of 96.5% was 30 basis points lower versus the prior year period. Our fourth quarter strategy of holding rate high, along with aggressive rate increases throughout 2015, benefits us in 2016 as we entered the year with almost 2.75% of our revenue growth already baked into our rent roll. Our robust full year same-store revenue growth of 5.6% was driven by a 5.5% increase in revenue per occupied home and flat occupancy. We see strong rate growth continuing in 2016.
Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth, which is detailed on Attachment 8G of our supplement, we continue to push rate in the fourth quarter. New lease growth totaled 3.8% or 170 basis points ahead of the fourth quarter of 2014. Renewal growth remained resilient, improving 170 basis points year-over-year to 7%. This year-over-year acceleration was accomplished with only a 40 basis point increase in fourth quarter turnover.
Next, move-outs to home purchase were up 120 basis points year-over-year at 14%, in line with our long-term average. Importantly, our full year 2015 turnover rate increased by just 20 basis points versus full year 2014. Even with renewal increases at a seasonally strong 7% -- only 7% of our move-outs gave rent increase as the reason for leaving in the fourth quarter. However, we expect turnover to increase roughly 100 basis points in 2016, as our revenue growth is highly predicated on the rate growth and not year-over-year occupancy gains.
Moving on to quarterly performance on our primary markets, which represent 69% of our same-store NOI and 75% of our total NOI. Metro D.C., which represents 18% of our total NOI, posted positive full year revenue growth of 1.7%. We expect improving full year revenue growth in 2016 of around 2.5% as we continue to benefit from our diverse exposure of 50% B assets and 50% A assets located both inside and outside the Beltway. 
Orange County and Los Angeles combined represent 15.4% of our total NOI. Orange County posted sequential revenue growth of 160 basis points and continues to outperform our budgeted expectations early in 2016. L.A. is materially stronger due to our heavy concentration in the Marina del Rey submarket as new jobs have continued to migrate to this highly desirable submarket. Fourth quarter revenue growth in L.A. was an impressive 10.2%. Our current expectation is that both of these markets will generate revenue growth in the 7% range in 2016.
New York City, which represents 12% of our total NOI, posted full year revenue growth of 5.6%. We saw a seasonal weakness in the fourth quarter and early January, but future trends are pointing to strength within our submarkets. We continue to expect new jobs from technology, finance and media, which will benefit our lower Manhattan properties. Our 2016 forecasted revenue growth of 6% is above 2015. I would remind everyone that View 34 is in our same-store pool beginning in the first quarter of 2016.
San Francisco and San Jose, which represent 11% of our total NOI, posted full year revenue growth of 9.7%. Although we saw weakness in the fourth quarter, it is indicative of the first and fourth quarter seasonality that we've seen in this market in the past. With that said, we believe this weakness is possibly more than just seasonal and do not expect this market to post the double-digit revenue growth that it has in recent years and we have forecasted a deceleration in 2016 to revenue growth of 8% or so. Future trends are slowly improving from what we saw in the fourth quarter, but we are keeping a close eye on the job growth and absorption levels within our submarkets. Keep in mind, San Francisco job growth has been above 4.5% for the past few years. Axiometrics' current forecast calls for job growth to decelerate to 2.5% to 3% but still well above the national average of 1.75% to 2%.
Seattle, which represents 6% of our total NOI, benefited from strong growth in suburban B assets that are less exposed to new supply than A assets downtown. Although new supply will challenge us somewhat in Downtown Seattle and, to a lesser degree, in Bellevue, we expect 2016 to be slightly below our 2015 numbers or roughly 7% growth.
Boston, which represents 7% of our total NOI, should continue to see new supply pressure downtown, but our suburban assets in the north and south shores should fare relatively better in 2016. Long term, we like the downtown submarket and look to continue to grow through development in this submarket. Most recently GE announced the relocation of their global headquarters to the Seaport district. This will bring another 800 jobs into the submarket, which should directly benefit our 369-home, 100 Pier 4 community and our future 345 Harrison development in Boston's Southend. Our forecast calls for revenue growth to accelerate slightly from the 5.5% growth posted in 2015.
Last, Dallas, which represents 5% of our total NOI, posted 5.1% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. We expect new supply pressure in uptown and Plano in 2016. January results indicate that these submarkets are performing slightly better than initial budgeted expectations, and 2016 revenue growth is projected to improve to roughly 5.5% from 5% in 2015.
As you can see on Attachment 7B of our supplement, our 320-home Los Alisos community located in Orange County, our 196-home Waterscape community located in Seattle and our 740-home View 34 community located in New York City will join the same-store pool in the first quarter of 2016.
Turning to our in-lease-up developments. Katella Grand I, our 399-home, $138 million lease-up in Anaheim, California in the West Coast development JV, was 16% occupied at quarter end and as of today is 20% occupied and 27% leased. We are currently offering less than 1 month of concession at this community, and leasing has been very strong in January with 25 applications.
CityLine, our 244-home, $80 million lease-up in Seattle, Washington, was 9% occupied at quarter end. We are on budget and meeting our lease-up expectations.
Finally, 399 Fremont, our 447-home, $318 million lease-up in San Francisco, began leasing during the fourth quarter. At quarter end, we were just 2% leased. And today, we're over 10% leased with rents exceeding pro forma. We will have our first move-ins in March of 2016.
Now a quick update on the Washington, D.C. acquisition. We're 3 months into owning these communities, and everything is going as according to plan. Currently, we're making CapEx improvements at 2 of the properties to either cure deferred maintenance or drive a higher return through revenue-enhancing improvements. And we still expect these communities to perform in line with our D.C. portfolio this year, with revenue growth right around 2.5%. Currently we would expect 5 of the 6 communities in this portfolio to enter our same-store pool in the first quarter of 2017.
With that, I will remind those listening that there's a link to our updated 2-year strategic outlook document on the Investor Relations page of our website. We will pause for a moment so that everyone can gather the 2-year outlook materials.
I will now turn the call back over to Tom Toomey."

First, we view this year's update as a continuation of the last 3 plans. We believe this continues to be the right path for UDR. Here's why. The plan's primary objective is to drive high-quality cash flow growth while incrementally improving our balance sheet and portfolio. In other words, consistent, sustainable growth that is funded in a safe, low-risk manner. We believe that successful execution of these objectives will drive strong total shareholder return.
There are 4 key points I'd like to highlight why we think there's a long runway of accretive growth ahead.
First, fundamentals. You have seen plenty of published data on this. And clearly, demographics, supply/demand characteristics are in our favor, and any good business that is going to grow for a number of years needs solid fundamentals.
The second is strategic position. Where do we start? Well, we're in 20 markets, 50% A, B quality mix. We like this position. We think it solves for the #1 critical element of any future growth, which is the positioning of our portfolio such that our residents will continue to be able to grow to pay higher rents.
The third is the team and the skills. Operationally, we'll continue to innovate, invest in technology and training programs, all of which are designed to increase our margins, which now stand above 70% at the NOI line, extraordinary for any business. On the development side, we'll remain focused on looking at our risk-adjusted returns and staying disciplined. 
Third is problem solving. Clearly, we operate in a cyclical economy. And along that line, there will be challenges and opportunities. We have a team that is very experienced of managing through these cycles, if not anticipating these cycles and these opportunities. Certainly, I feel confident that the team has the ability to capitalize on these opportunities as they become available. 
And lastly and just as important is managing risk. And we see ourselves managing this through, first, our diversity of our market mix; our discipline around our development; and certainly our continued improving balance sheet set of metrics; and lastly, our transparency in disclosure and communication style.
We believe these main objectives can continue our cash flow growth in optimizing our total shareholder return. We remain fully focused on executing them.
With that, I will turn over to Tom to discuss in detail the updated outlook."

As Tom mentioned earlier, we have met or exceeded all of our primary financial and operational objectives to date, as set forth in our prior 3-year plans published in 2013, 2014 and 2015.

As Tom mentioned earlier, we have met or exceeded all of our primary financial and operational objectives to date, as set forth in our prior 3-year plans published in 2013, 2014 and 2015. In particular, our same-store growth and development deliveries have outperformed over the past 3 years and have served as primary drivers of our better-than-expected cash flow growth and improvements in balance sheet metrics.
Turning to Page 5. Perhaps the most critical driver of UDR's value-creation strategy is our best-in-class operations. We are continuously implementing new revenue growth and cost efficiency initiatives throughout the organization to improve how we do business. As noted on this page, we have consistently produced better overall top line growth versus peers and the U.S. average since the initiation of our 3-year plan in 2013. During this time, we have grown our total revenue per occupied home by 26%, increased occupancy by 100 basis points, reduced turnover by 310 basis points and improved our margins by 220 basis points.
So how will we maintain our operational advantage and how do we intend to keep it in the future? Please turn to Page 6.
Many who listen to this call are familiar with the primary revenue generation, expense control initiatives that are underway. These, along with potential future initiatives, are presented in the table on this page. Importantly, all of our growth and efficiency initiatives have one thing in common: they either provide our customer a wanted service or allow our associates to do their jobs better. Current initiatives should continue to drive our bottom line, and our list of potential future initiatives is extensive.
Please turn to Page 7. This page lists some of our operational projects that have been implemented over the past couple of years and their impact on our NOI. As is evident, we have made solid progress on each initiative to date, and our bottom line has benefited greatly. We will continue to capture additional NOI efficiencies from these initiatives. Operations has been and will continue to be a significant competitive advantage for us. This is not just because of our superior blocking and tackling in the field, but also because of the creativity our operations team employs to continuously improve the business.
Turning now to capital allocation and development on Page 8. Development remains a vital component of our value-creation strategy. While not as many deals [indiscernible] in today's environment, development remains accretive and will continue to be a primary mean through which we continuously improve our portfolio. At year-end, our underway development totaled $670 million, for which the equity requirement was 55% funded. Additionally, our share of the West Coast development joint venture going-in value was $271 million, for which 100% of the equity has been funded. This pipeline is concentrated in our primary coastal markets. Inclusive of the West Coast development JV, we expect to deliver $375 million and $220 million of projects in 2016 and 2017, respectively.
Our annual targeted spend of $400 million to $500 million per year and our targeted trended spread versus cap rates of 150 to 200 basis points have not changed. While construction costs continue to increase, so do rents.
To mitigate market risk around new development projects, we employ the following disciplines: First, prior to a development commencing, we generally seek entitled land, demand full drawings and a GMAX contract, thereby locking in costs and reducing risk. 
Second, we diversify our geographic exposure. Our goal is to commence a new development in a target market as the previous development is leasing up.
Third, we utilize conservative top line growth assumptions to underwrite our projects.
And lastly, we employ a self-funded strategy to fund our development pipeline and reduce dependency on capital markets.
Through our free cash flow and noncore asset sales, we can fully fund our annual development spend. In other words, we are match-funding our risk as we recycle older noncore assets to develop new core assets in our primary markets.
In 2016 and 2017, we will continue to mine our current land bank as well as add new land sites. We are planning 2 to 3 starts in 2016, which include one large wholly owned project, 345 Harrison in Boston; and 1 to 2 smaller 50-50 JVs with MetLife. As of year-end 2015, our shadow pipeline was approximately $900 million at our pro rata ownership and represented $425 million to $475 million of value creation, assuming current spreads. 
Please turn to Page 9.
We anticipate that upon full stabilization, which occurs at different periods for each project, our pipeline of underway and completed developments is expected to generate accretion of $0.07 per share with growth thereafter. On an NAV basis, we expect our pipeline to generate $1.75 per share at stabilization or approximately 35% to 40% value creation over cost.
Page 10 exhibits some of our recent developments.
Please turn to Page 11. As focused as we are on operations and development, maintaining a strong balance sheet along with a self-funded plan are just as important. We exceeded the balance sheet metric goals provided in our 2013, 2014 and 2015 strategic plans. We expect further improvements in 2016 and 2017. This has also been acknowledged by the rating agencies. In 2014, we received a credit upgrade from Moody's to Baa1. And in 2015, we received an upgrade from S&P to BBB+.
On the capital markets front, our 2016 and 2017 capital needs will be funded through a combination of asset sales and new equity and debt, of which we'll utilize the most advantageous source, depending on our strategic objectives, market conditions and pricing at the time the capital is needed.
Please turn to Page 12. In 2015, our AFFO per share growth was a strong 11%. In 2016, AFFO per share growth is expected to average in the 6% to 9% range. This growth will continue to be driven primarily by favorable same-store growth and development earn-in. And these will be partially offset by a few items, including noncore dispositions, higher expected interest rates and 421-a and g property tax impact.
In 2017, AFFO per share growth is expected to be in the 5% to 8% range. This 100 basis point delta is primarily due to lower same-store assumptions. As in our prior strategic plans, we rely on third-party data providers for our future growth expectations in the out-years. And of note, these estimates have proven conservative in the last several years, and our team has been able to outperform.
We expect the business to drive 9% to 11% NAV growth in 2016 and 8% to 10% NAV growth in 2017.
Please turn to Page 13.
This page provides our 2016 guidance, initial 2017 expectations and detailed modeling assumptions. In 2017, we are expecting solid same-store and cash flow growth based on still strong third-party job growth expectations against moderating new multifamily supply growth in our markets. In addition, our expected asset sales and entrants to our same-store pool in 2016 and 2017 will enhance our same-store mix toward higher growth markets.
And finally, Page 14. Our 2016 top line growth assumptions for our markets are presented on the map. We expect the West Coast and Southeast to grow at a rate above the portfolio average. The Mid-Atlantic will continue to perform below the portfolio average but will improve slightly and still expect to outperform relative to our peers due to our 50-50 mix of As and Bs in D.C. and less direct exposure to new supply inside the Beltway.

What they're forecasting is continuation of job growth, not too far off from what it was in 2015, call it a little over 200,000 per month. Supply is going to impact us this year, probably a little more than it did last year. And then in '17, there's a drop-off. So we look at the macro data. And then we start looking at specific submarkets where we operate and take into account how directly we're going to be affected by that. In addition, when you really go through it -- so there's a few other things to consider. We will continue to spend about $35 million to probably low to $40 million in revenue-enhancing improvements to our properties. So it will add probably between 50 and 25 basis points into 2017 and probably about that much in 2016. And as we look further out into 2017, there's probably only a couple of markets that look to us like they would be decelerating from the growth rates that we anticipate in 2016. Those are Northern California, Seattle for the most part. And then we see some that we think are going to be improving, and that would be the Mid-Atlantic. We also see Boston most likely improving for us. And then the rest of our portfolio, whether it's SoCal or the Sunbelt, we would expect to be modestly down. And when you blend all that together, it takes you from our midpoint this year of about a  5 7 5 growth down to that 5. [ph] So again, we don't really anticipate a recession.

Yes, to your point, the same-store comes in with a $0.12 positive number.

In 2015, you had Channel, View 34, 27 Seventy Five. 2016, you're looking at Pier 4, Beach & Ocean. But you've got some drag from 399, Pac City, Jamboree, 3033 and Domain Mountain View. All great projects, but at this point, there's some drag. So that lowered the development by a bit from what we had seen in 2015. As to some of the items that would have leaned against the FFO growth relative to the NOI, it would have been -- floating interest rates are up about 40 basis points. In our model, that's $0.01. The average revolver balance is going to be down some, call it $150 million or so. That's $0.015, and that was just due to the timing of that mid-September debt issuance. The tax benefit goes from $3.9 million to $1.5 million. That's $0.01. Non-1031 exchanges picks up another $0.01. And then to your point earlier, that is partially offset by the accretive West Coast JV and some accretion on the home transaction, and those are all the moving parts. So this is -- as we would have expected, our core and base growth going forward is just as strong, but we just had a few items that caused FFO to come in a little bit lower relative to the same-store."

But as we've rolled into January, we've started to see signs of improvement. New lease rate growth in the fourth quarter was 5.2%. Renewal growth was 9.3%. As we look at January, our January new leases are up 4.2% in San Francisco, San Jose, and that compares to 3.3% in December. So it is improving. And our January renewals are still well above 8% at 8.4%. Our occupancy is at 97%. So it has strengthened. Now as we look at job growth, which is the primary concern in those markets right now, it's been running about 4.5% for the past couple of years. And when we have talked to Axiometrics, they're forecasting for job growth to decelerate to 2.5% to 3%. And while that's about 150 to 200 basis point deceleration, it's still well above the national average of job growth of 1.75% to 2%. So we'd like to think it's all seasonal. We're going to know in the next 60 days if it is. And over the last 3 to 5 years, there's probably been 2 or 3x in the first quarter when I grew concerned about the strength in San Francisco, only to see things turn around as we got into the month of March and April. So it's just a little bit early to tell. But on the ground, we're not seeing any significant job loss from any single employers. And as I've said, as we've come out of the fourth quarter and entered the first quarter, we have seen fundamentals start to strengthen again."

On the staffing efficiency, I think we can continue to drive that metric even better. There's a few things technologically. We're working with our property management software provider to help us go to the next step on. But I would tell you, as we created our expense budgets for 2016, we do have our repairs and maintenance coming in at flat. Once again, this is probably going to be the third or fourth straight year that it's been negative to positive -- either negative or up 1%. So we've kept that in pretty good control, while we've been able to achieve turnover that remained flat. So we use those guides at times not just to push price down, but to enhance service which helps us maintain a steady turnover."

Equity, I'm going to look at an AFFO yield on a current year basis and just based off of AFFO projected toward at the midpoint today's share price, that comes in at about a 4.5% current. Of course, we're going to add growth to that so I have to look at it in a cost of equity basis, and that's probably going to be somewhere just shy of probably 8% or something like that on a cost of equity basis. And then you move to sales of assets, and again on our current yield, it depends on what cap rate of assets that we're selling. I think our sales for 2015 came in at a 5.8% cap rate.

So if we choose to we can fund the entire development spend on a self-funded basis and our debt maturities through refis. In the meantime, we have $1 billion of capacity right now on our revolver and cash. So again, back to the point of our business being quite self-funded.

And so we hit on all of our metrics in 2015 without exception and it did result in to the metrics that we had set forth higher than average LTI payouts and STI payouts. One of the thing I would have you note though that might get missed is that we have the transitional plan in place moving from the old LTI program to the new -- or we now have a 3-year cliff vest on the TSR portion and we didn't use to have that.

One, we spread the lease expirations throughout the month instead of having them all occur at the same time. Some -- it's much easier just to say leases expire at the end of the month, but when you do that, you have 30 people move out at a 600-unit property. Your maintenance team can't get to the 30th apartment to turn it until day 22. By spreading it throughout the month, you're able to do a little bit better. The other things you do is you try to entice people to push up their move-in date. If you know an apartment is going to be market-ready on the 26th of the month and somebody comes in and says, ""Hey, I want to move in at the end of the month or the beginning of the month."" You basically tell them when they will be moving in. So you push them closer to the 26 instead of automatically just putting them in as they move in on the 30th and that could cut off 3 days. So some of it's strategic, some of it is putting in more demanding metrics on our maintenance team for expectations of when apartments need to be turned. Old-school way of doing it, you wouldn't go turn a unit until it was leased. The way we try to do it is turn it as quickly as you can from when somebody moves out so you have ready inventory.

When you have a margin like us, what really moves the business most is the revenue. I already told you what we have in our model currently for real estate tax is at 7%. It really doesn't have refunds calculated in, and I'm confident we're going to get some of those. The other expense categories we're looking at and then we built in the second largest component of our expense stack is personnel, which is about 1/4 of our total expenses. We expect that to go up to 24.25% higher than it has the last several years as we have more competitive pressures to attract and retain our associates. All of the other categories -- marketing we expect to go down. Our marketing team's done a great job both with our website, as well as working with the ISLs to -- or ILSs to bring down our cost. Repairs and maintenance, I don't see that going up dramatically. I think we have that locked down pretty well. So on the expense side, I think it's not overly risky. The revenue side, there's always risk and probably the 2 markets that we're keeping our eyes on the most would be San Francisco because we hear all that same information you guys hear. New York, we're watching that closely too and as I've said earlier about both of those markets, they both today, it's not apparent to us whether it's seasonal issues that created weakness in the fourth quarter because we're starting to strengthen if it's something more. But as I look at it there's really 3 markets that today you would say are kind of risky, and it'd be those 2, as well as Austin. But what I would also say is those constitute 25% of UDR's total NOI. When you look at all of the other markets combined, which make up 75%, we see strength. We see strength in Southern California, the entire Sunbelt with the exception of Austin is extremely strong today. D.C., while it's still going to be a laggard by comparison, it's improving and we think Boston's improving. So while there may be risk in a market or 2, the benefit of having a geographically dispersed and asset class differentiation between the As and Bs, I think, give us pretty good protection."

But over the last few years it's been purely or substantially organically. And so you've got the organic improvements that will occur, but also as we had an opportunity to do a Home or a West Coast development JV, if we were trading at a place where we could issue stock at a premium, that does give us an opportunity to further delever the enterprise by acquiring assets on an accretive basis at a premium and that lowers the leverage of the enterprise. The other thing I'd mention is when we look at our current leverage levels with the rating agencies and we have -- had studies done by 3 different banks as to where we're rated at the BBB+, Baa1 and what the sweet spot has been determined is at the leverage level that we're at, at the BBB+, Baa1. So to go through unnatural means to further improve that leverage and do so on a diluted basis is not something that's all that enticing as we think we can continue to improve it over time in the ways that I just described."

When I look down at Southern California, I just read the other day, there was more job growth there in 2015 than there has been since, I think, the late 1999 levels, so it's picked up. You don't have any one large employer. You don't really have significant supply issues in Orange County. And in LA, most of the new supplies coming downtown where we're not located. So I would say, at this point I don't see a significant differentiation between how the 2 are going to perform next year.

The first quarter of 2016 was another great quarter for UDR, with strong same-store results and development lease-up continuing to perform well. As you have come to expect from UDR, we remain focused on executing on our previously communicated 2-year strategic plan, which is still the right plan given the long-term strength of the apartment business. 
From a big picture point of view, we are now in our sixth year of achieving 5% plus NOI growth. Over the past 2 years, most our markets have seen accelerating growth trends due to supply demand and balance. And while our overall 2016 same-store operating trends continue to improve year-over-year in a few markets as anticipated, we have started to feel the impact of concentrated new supply. We believe apartment growth is sustainable and supply can be absorbed with steady job growth and household formations. Deliveries of middle apartment homes are projected to peak in the cycle in 2016 at around 380,000 units and will subsequently drop in 2017 to 300,000 units, while job growth is forecast to be in the 2 to 2.5 million range in both years. In this environment, market mix and price points will be key, and this plays well to our overall strategy that centers around our diverse portfolio of mix of 20 markets with A and B quality communities in urban and suburban locations, which, over the long term, we expect to continue to perform well through the cycles and provide consistent cash flow growth. 
Our 2-year strategic plan issued in February showed strong expected 2016 revenue and NOI growth of 5.75% and 6.75% at the midpoints. And we spoke to an anticipated solid but slightly deaccelerating 2017 operating environment with revenue and NOI growth of 5% and 5.5% at the midpoints. Since then, there have been a number of publications speaking to flowing revenue trends in certain markets and, as such, I'd ask Jerry to provide an update on our market expectations for the balance of 2016 and how we currently see 2017 stacking up. I hope you find this useful and that you reach the same conclusion as the UDR team. It's a great time to be in the apartment business. And therefore, we are reaffirming our full year guidance provided in the initial outlook and we'll provide an update during the second quarter earnings call. 
Also let me take a moment to mention that we were pleased that in early March, we were added to the S&P 500 index, which is a credit to our investors and the entire UDR team who made this possible. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."
310667,329707889,963108,"UDR, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","UDR, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom.

Our first quarter earnings resu",679,"Thanks, Tom. The topics I'll cover today include our first quarter results, our balance sheet and capital markets update, a cash update, a development and transactions update and our second quarter and full year guidance. 
Our first quarter earnings results were in line with our previously provided guidance. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.43, $0.43 and $0.41, respectively. First quarter same-store revenue expense and NOI growth remained strong at 6.4%, 2.7% and 8.0%, respectively. 
Next, the balance sheet. At year-end, our liquidity, as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, was $1.1 billion. Our financial leverage on underappreciated [ph] cost basis was 33.0%. Based on today's market cap, it was 23.8%, and inclusive of JVs, it was 28.2%. Our net debt to EBITDA was 5.4x and inclusive of JVs was 6.5x. All balance sheet metric improvements were ahead of plan. 
During the quarter, we issued 174 million of common equity at a net price of $34.73 per share in conjunction with our inclusion in the S&P 500. In addition, in January, we paid $83.3 million of 5.25% medium-term notes.
On to casualty [ph] losses. In conjunction with the previously announced damage to our 151-home 717 Olympic community located in Los Angeles, we recorded a casualty loss of $1.1 million during the quarter attributable to business interruption and temporary housing for our residents. This resulted in a charge of approximately $0.50 [ph] FFO but was added back to FFO as adjusted. We expect to recover significant portion of this charge from the insurance providers and any subsequent recoveries will be included in FFO but deducted from FFO as adjusted. As a reminder, 717 Olympic is owned by the MetLife II JV, it has no impact on our same-store results. As of today, all damage has been fixed, the community is fully operational and we are over 88% leased.
Turning to development. We commenced construction on our 585-home $367 million 345 Harrison Street development in Boston South End, which we intend to fund with noncore asset sales. We've identified a number of assets that we will be marketing to satisfy the funding needs for the year, with a significant portion of the sales coming from the Mid-Atlantic markets. 
At the end of the first quarter, the company had an underconstruction development pipeline for its pro rata share totaled $1 billion. The development pipeline is currently expected to produce a weighted average spread between estimated stabilize yields and current market cap rates above the upper end of the company's 150 to 200 basis point targeted range.
Next, transactions completed in the quarter. During the first quarter, we sold our 95% ownership interest in 2 land parcels located in Santa Monica, California, for $24 million. This resulted in a gain to FFO of $1.7 million, which was backed out of FFO as adjusted.
On to the second quarter and full year 2016 guidance. Second quarter 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance is $0.43 to $0.45, $0.43 to $0.45 and $0.39 to $0.41, respectively. At this time, we are maintaining our full year guidance ranges for both earnings and same-store metrics. 
Full year 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share is forecasted at $1.75 to $1.81, $1.75 to $1.81 and $1.59 to $1.65, respectively. 
For same-store, our full year 2016 guidance remains unchanged with revenue growth of 5.5% to 6%, expense 3.0% to 3.5% and NOI 6.5% to 7.0%. Average 2016 occupancy remains forecasted at 96.6%.
Due to the $174 million equity issuance in the quarter, we no longer anticipate a bond issuance later this year and are updating our full year interest expense guidance to $121 million to $125 million from $128 million to $132 million. 
Other primary full year guidance assumptions can be found on Attachment 15 or Page 26 of our supplement. 
Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.295 in the first quarter or $1.18 per share when annualized, 6% above 2015's level and represented a yield of approximately 3.3%. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry."

First, our first quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the rental rate growth we realized this quarter nearly results for the second quarter. Second, how our primary markets performed during the quarter with a high-level update for 2016 and 2017. And last, a brief update on our development lease-ups. 
We are pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the first quarter, same-store net operating income grew 8.0%, our highest growth rate since the first quarter of 2012. These results were driven by a very strong 6.4% year-over-year increase in revenue against a 2.7% increase in expenses. Our same-store revenue per occupied home increased by 6.7% year-over-year to $1,897 per month. Our same-store occupancy of 96.5% was down 20 basis points versus the prior-year period. 
Total portfolio revenue per occupied home was $1,995 per month, including pro rata JVs. Stable job growth, limited impact from new multifamily supply, rental preference from both new millennial households, empty-nesters and everyone in between are all driving this continued growth.
Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth, which is detailed on attachment 8E of our supplement. We grew new lease rates by 3.7% in the first quarter, 50 basis points below the first quarter of 2015. Renewal growth remained robust at 6.9% in the first quarter or 120 basis points ahead of last year. On a blended rate basis, we averaged 5.3% during the first quarter, an improvement of 40 basis points versus the same period in 2015. 
In April, these trends continued with new lease and renewal rate growth of 4.2% and 6.8%, respectively, and our current physical occupancy is 96.5%. 
Our leasing success and stable occupancy gives us confidence that demand is more than sufficient to continue pushing rate higher throughout the upcoming prime leasing season in the majority of our markets. 
Next, move-outs to home purchase were flat year-over-year at 13%, in line with our long-term average. Even with our strong renewal increases in the first quarter, less than 9% of our moveouts gave rent increases the reason for leaving. 
Before I move on to the quarterly performance in our primary markets, I'd like to give a general update on our entire portfolio. First, third-party data indicates that in every one of our markets, we expect supply to peak this year, with the exception being New York City. Second, job growth remains robust, and we continue to have strong pricing power in the majority of our markets. The overall economic environment we see today is very similar to what we provided in our 2-year outlook.
Now moving onto the quarterly performance in our primary markets, which represent 70% of our same-store NOI and 75% of our total NOI. Metro D.C., which represents 18% of our total NOI, posted year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 2.1% compared to 1.9% in the first quarter of '15. We are forecasting the market to generate top line growth in 2016 between 2% and 3% as we will continue to benefit from our diverse 50-50 mix of A and B assets located both inside and outside the Beltway. In the first quarter, our As and Bs had very similar growth rates. Apartment supply in 2016 is expected to increase by 13,600 homes and then fall to 9,000 homes in 2017, while job growth in 2017 is expected to increase by 1.9%, up from 1.6% in 2016. Our current forecast is that D.C. will have modestly accelerating revenue growth in 2017 compared to 2016.
Orange County and Los Angeles combined represents 16% of our total NOI. Orange County posted year-over-year revenue growth of 8.4%. We continue to remain very optimistic on Orange County as the market is only expected to see 5,000 units of new supply and nearly 35,000 jobs, implying a 7:1 ratio, which is roughly 2x the long-term historical average. Revenue growth in L.A. was 8.8% during the quarter, continuation of very strong results in the back half of 2015 due to job growth and supply absorption in our Marina del Rey concentrated submarket. Lease-up pressure from almost 2,000 recently delivered apartment homes in the neighboring Playa Vista market began negatively impacting our pricing power in the middle of the first quarter, and we think this competition will continue to affect us through the end of the third quarter. Fortunately, tech-related jobs continue to come to this part of Silicon Beach. 
Overall, L.A. will see over 12,000 apartment homes delivered in 2016 or about 1% of supply, and the market is projected to create 88,000 new jobs. Again, a 7:2 ration. 2017 and 2018 are each projected currently to see deliveries slow [ph] 7,000 to 8,000 homes per year, with job growth only slowing slightly.
L.A. looks does the strong market over the next several years and after we get past the short-term lease up pressures in our Marina del Rey Playa Vista submarket, we will get back on track to above-average growth. We still anticipate full year 2016 revenue growth in L.A. to be in the 6% range and would expect 2017 to also be in that range. 
New York City represents 12% of our total NOI and posted 5.8% revenue growth in the quarter. While our Same Store Properties are not directly affected by any new developments, we are beginning to feel the impact from the new supply in the Manhattan market. New Yorkers typically have been loyal to their preferred neighborhoods or beginning to be enticed by pricing and incentives in places like Midtown West. 2016 deliveries of 25,000 apartment homes are adding 1% to existing supply. 2017 is expected that deliveries even higher at 30,000 apartment homes, but still right around 1% of existing supply. The higher deliveries in these years are directly related to the expiring 4 21 tax abatement program. Once we get through this multi-year elevated supply levels, new development should decrease significantly. Job growth in 2016 and 2017 is expected to be right around 1.3% each year. For full year 2016, we've revised our revenue growth expectations down to about 5% in our New York portfolio, which is 50 to 60 basis points below our original business plan. Because of the continuing pressures of new supply, we currently would project 2017 revenue growth in New York to be modestly lower than it will be in 2016 .
San Francisco, which represents 11% of our total NOI is feeling the effects of new supply in several submarkets, including South market. However, we still expect the Bay Area to be one of our best-performing markets this year with revenue growth of 7% to 8%. Same-store revenue growth in the first quarter was 9.6% due to the extremely strong blended rate growth we achieved in the second and third quarters of 2015. The good news is that 2016 it would be the peak of deliveries this cycle at 12,600 apartments or roughly 3% of existing stock and the number gets cut roughly in half to 6,800 homes in 2017, representing approximately 1.6% of existing stock. And job growth in 2016 and 2017 is expected to average about 2.5% each year. Although the Bay area is slowing, we still expect it to be an above-average market this year and next.
Boston, which represents 7% of our total NOI, produced a strong 6% revenue growth during the first quarter. A 1 same-store property in the Back Bay neighborhood had revenue growth of 5%. Our suburban assets in the North Shore were our strongest performers with growth of 7.5%. The Freeport District, home to our 2015 completion 100 Pier 4, continues to see more growth with additional office tenants in the submarket, including the first quarter announcement that GE will be relocating to the Seaport, about 1/2 mile from our property. We started an additional project this quarter in Boston's South end, the 585 home $367 million project, 345 Harrison Street. New supply in Boston is projected at 6,100 homes in 2016, with slight deceleration in 2017 to 5,500 homes. Both years represent less than 1.5% of existing stock. Job growth is currently forecast to be about 1.5% both years. We expect revenue growth in 2017 to be comparable to this year.
Seattle, which represents 6% of our total NOI and posted 8.4% revenue growth, continued to benefit from the strong growth in Harrington, our suburban, which are located in submarkets that are less exposed to new supply. Long term, we continue to like the Downtown Seattle submarket and believe that the ongoing creation of new jobs by companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and Expedia will continue to drive demand in Seattle's urban core. The Bellevue submarket is in the midst of fairly heavy new multifamily development but has not yet put up significant pressure on our portfolio as evidenced by our 7.7% revenue growth in Bellevue this quarter. Deliveries in Metro Seattle are expected to peak in 2016 at 9,800 apartment homes before falling to 6,200 homes in 2017, while job growth continues at more than 2%. We expect revenue growth in 2017 to be comparable to this year.
Last, Dallas, which represents just over 4.5% of our NOI, posted 5.8% year-over-year same-store revenue growth in the first quarter. Our B properties have revenue growth that was 400 basis points higher than our As as heavy new supply in uptown and along the toll ways impacting rent growth in those submarkets. New supply in Dallas is projected to peak in 2016 at 18,000 new units and then drop to 12,700 in 2017. Job growth in the Dallas market should remain strong both years, above 2.4%. 
Outside of our primary markets such as Portland, Monterey Peninsula, the Sunbelt, Nashville and Austin, which comprise roughly 20% of our portfolio, we are above our initial expectations provided in our 2-year outlook and we continue to have strong pricing power due to limited amounts of new supply and robust job growth. Our expectation is that these markets have a long runway of growth due to favorable economics.
April's results came in, in line with our plan. And as we look ahead in the next 3 [ph] months, we see improving pricing power along with stable occupancy. Our 50-50 A B portfolio located throughout 20 markets has enabled outperformance in our Sunbelt markets, Orange County, Portland and Monterey Peninsula to offset markets that are being impacted by new supply in San Francisco, New York and L.A. 
On a national basis, and within our core markets, apartment deliveries are expected to peak in 2016. Current projections from actual metrics have 2017 deliveries coming down over 25%. New York is the only market that we operate in that would experience a higher number of deliveries in 2017 than it had in 2016. 
Remember, that earlier this year, in our 2-year outlook, we indicated a 75 basis point deceleration in 2017, with a revenue growth guidance midpoint of 5%. Our overall view has not changed.
I'll turn now to our 4 in lease up developments, which you can find on Attachment 9A and B or Pages 19 and 20 of our supplement. Our share of these 4 properties represent $316 million or roughly 23% of our pipeline, inclusive of the West Coast development JV. In total, these properties are performing ahead of plan. 
399 Fremont, our 447-home, $318 million lease up in San Francisco, California, took first move-ins in mid-March and was 26% leased and 15% occupied at quarter end. Today, we are 29% leased and 24% occupied, with rents exceeding pro forma. We are currently operating a concession business as planned at this community, noting we will see increased competition further lease ups in the submarket in the near future. 
Katella Grand 1, our 399-home $138 million lease-up in Anaheim, California in the West Coast development JV was 37% leased and 29% occupied at quarter end. And as of today, it's 47% leased and 37% occupied. We are currently offering less than 1 month of concessions at this community and leasing has been very strong in April with 41 applications. 
CityLine, our 244-home, $80 million lease-up in the Columbia City submarket of Seattle was 47% leased and 34% occupied at quarter end. Today, the property is 66% leased and 52% physically occupied.
April Republican, our 211-home $97 million lease up in the South Lake Union submarket of Seattle was 8% leased and 0% occupied at quarter end. And today, it is 16% leased and 6% occupied. First units were available for move in, in mid-April. 
All in, we had a great first quarter and we remain very positive on the outlook for multifamily fundamentals and our ability to execute during the peak leasing season and throughout the remainder of 2016. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Tom."

D.C., again, we continue to think it bottomed about a year and a half ago, late 2014. But we continue to see supply pressures in various submarkets throughout the Metro D.C. area such as Arlington and Alexandria. What's interesting is we've seen the compression between what As and Bs are doing. Currently, it's probably less than 100 basis points. Our properties in that 14th and Street neighborhood, including Capital View, View 14, Hanover place and Thomas Circle, those deals are all putting up probably about 3% revenue growth. And then a couple of the places over our Columbia Pike and Arlington are negative revenue growth right now. Now when you get outside the Beltway, even though outside tends to do a little bit better than inside the Beltway, we have a couple of properties out there in Woodbridge that are flat to slightly negative. So the A B mix has benefited us in the past where B has significantly outperformed, but we are seeing neighborhoods in DC where supply has subsided, react very well and starting to see good rent growth. All in, D.C.'s performing about where we expected. I'll touch on the Home portfolio that we bought back in October. It's performing pretty much within plan, in accordance with the plan that we had. We found a few opportunities to write expenses down. We're in the process of spending coming close to $20 million on some initial capital expenditures, some on unit interior, some on the exteriors of the properties. But as we chug through that, we're seeing occupancy which when we bought the portfolio, I think, was down around 92%. Today, occupancy in that portfolio has risen to between 95% and 96%. So D.C. I would tell you is going according to plan, our expectation this year, like I said in my prepared remarks, is that revenue to be between 2% and 3%. And then our expectation going further out is supply continues to be absorbed that '17 is better than '16."

So it wasn't purely that we were retaining more people, it was more that we had fewer expirations in the first quarter. So we are definitely feeling the effects of the supply pressures, whether it's Midtown, West, Brooklyn, they're starting to have an effect to our Financial District properties. And if you really stratify what we did in the first quarter, our 2 Don Financial District popped revenue growth of about 4.5% and our Chelsea and Marie Hill [ph] properties came in north of 7%. So we're feeling it a little bit more in the Financial District. And then if you go up to our MetLife JV property in the upper West Side, Columbus Square, that one is definitely feeling the effects of new supply in the upper West Side and had revenue growth of about 1%, 1.5%.

Overall, and maybe this hopefully this answer your question, overall, first quarter came in where we thought it would. So far in April, we are right on track also. Always going to have some markets that perform a little bit better than expectations, some that are below. And obviously, the 3 that we spoke to in the prepared remarks that are currently under are San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles. And the reason for their underperformance is really the effect of new supply. We've talked for years that continuing to get 10% revenue growth in San Francisco wasn't long-term sustainable. And I guess the developers and the city officials also took notice of this, and this previously undersupplied market is getting a slug of new supply right now. Fortunately for us, it's going to peak this year and start to decelerate next year. But what we noticed, too, and I had this in our remarks, is the success of new lease up properties that are putting some of those pressure on us, that our 399 Fremont lease up is well ahead of leasing velocity. We're getting rental rates that are above pro forma rents, which were $6 a foot, and we're given away 1 month free. So what really shows up is there is demand and there is traffic for apartments. We have a lease up property that's basically getting discounted down 8% because of 1 month free. Going to find it harder to push rate on Same Store Properties. But yes, those -- we do have the 3 underperformers. We also, as I stated earlier, we got about 1/3 of the company that is exceeding expectations. And those are Orange County, which is I would say significantly, but it's ahead of where we expected. Our 2 markets in Florida, Orlando and Tampa are significantly add to what would have expected we did our business plan, as is Nashville, Portland and Monterey. And I think the big difference between the ones that are underperforming and those that are outperforming, it's which ones are being affected by new supply. Those that I just said that are outperforming tend to be B product, which doesn't compete as much against new supply. And they're in markets that really are not getting heavy doses of supply."

The price is similar to what we were asking them to pay. So we are able to trade up, if you will, into a brand new community, but it's at the same rate. So I don't think it's price fatigue it.

I'll talk about the neighborhood first and then the economics. This is a new location within the South End, which is one of the Boston's most desirable neighborhood. It's primarily a residential district with old 19th century brown stones. But this particular location is only a 10-minute walk to Financial District, the Back Bay. And GE's new headquarters will bring 800 new employees to Boston. There's tons of restaurants, bars, galleries and boutiques along Fremont Street. Our site is located directly across The Street from new Wholefoods Market that opened last year. There's been some recently built apartment projects, Inkblot and the [indiscernible] more than 800 units that are nearly fully leased up. The first condo building across The Street sold out and prior to completion [indiscernible] more than $1,000 a foot. They just started construction on a second condo building related companies purchased the site, Kitty Corner from ours and us into the city for approval of 175 apartments and 100 condos. In terms of economics, the yield based on today's rents is about 5.5%. We get 3% revenue and expense growth for 3 plus years the yield will grow to above 6 and more than 200 basis points above today's cap rates. Rents today are more than $400 below our Pier  4 deal that leased up in 7 months last year when you're comparing similar unit types. And like similar assets in Boston, the cap rate for this asset would be very low, like we said [ph] 4% cap rate. We believe, in fact, that this location could outperform Boston overall, which according to actual averages nearly 4% per annum through 2019. In addition to Wholefoods and the retail and residential construction, our units in our 40,000 square feet of retail will help complete the transition of this new location within a very established and desirable overall neighborhood. Downtown Boston expects to average less than 1,500 unit deliveries per year through 2020, so we also believe supply is manageable."

And because last year, the second and third quarter were extremely strong, and as we go into this year's second and third quarter, the rate growth is going to be less than it was last year, you're having natural deceleration. Now I guess you could say accurately that it is primarily coming from new supply deceleration that is predominantly occurring in those 3 markets I talked about earlier because they have a heavier weighting on our total revenue growth. But I guess long story short, I think you kind of hit it on the head, but I just wanted to make sure people really understand what the components are that really drive the rate growth.

Those 5 properties make up 41% of the total NOI of the MetLife JV, and they have revenue growth of 0.6%, so under 1%, because they are going head-to-head against so much new supply.

Really, should think about it, the sites that we're looking at, these are going to be sort of late '17 into 2018 starts, and so when we're looking at the fundamentals of these markets where we have declining supply, really, in '17 and '18, these are going to be '19 and '20 deliveries. But to answer your question specifically, it is somewhat more challenging. Clearly, the number of percentage of the projects that pencil today is much lower than it had been historically. But we expect to continue to find enough projects both externally and within our MetLife JV using consistent underwriting standards without any type of aggressive rent growth assumptions that will continue to maintain similar development pipeline as we have historically and fit within our $900 million to $1.4 billion type target."

A very good question. And one thing that we alluded to a couple of years ago when we saw the banking industry becoming further and further consolidated and regulated is we realized the impact would be is the feds would have the ability to choke off construction loans. And what was currently seen in the marketplace and if you talk to private developers is securing a loan for new development in the multifamily space is getting very, very difficult. And you're going to see them do less in deal, because it's going to require more equity, there's going to be less proceeds out of construction and tougher underwriting. I think that, combined with the transparency of operating environments and cities difficulty around zoning and entitlement processes, is going to slow it down a great deal. And I didn't hear any development in the last 3 months talking with a lot of private guys that said, hey, we think we're going to do more business in '17 than we're doing right now. Everybody looks at it and says, we are pulling back. We are being forced to pull back. And we'll have to relook at our numbers and come up with more equity. So I think that's going to be the biggest chokepoint about new supply. Certainly, not the demand side of the equation, it is certainly there and will persist for many more years. It's the supply is going to get choked down."

The first quarter of 2016 was another great quarter for UDR with strong same-store results and developmental lease-ups continuing to perform well. As you have come to expect from UDR, we remain focused on executing on our previously communicated 2-year strategic plan, which is still the right plan given the long-term strength of the apartment business. 
From a big picture point of view, we are now in our sixth year of achieving 5%-plus NOI growth. Over the past 2 years, most our markets have seen accelerating growth trends due to supply-demand imbalance. And while our overall 2016 same-store operating trends continue to improve year-over-year, in a few markets, as anticipated, we have started to feel the impact of concentrated new supply. We believe apartment growth is sustainable and supply could be absorbed with steady job growth and household formations. 
Deliveries of new apartment homes are projected to peak in the cycle in 2016 at around 380,000 units and will subsequently drop in 2017 to 300,000 units, while job growth is forecast to be in the 2 to 2.5 million range in both years. In this environment, market mix and price points will be key and this plays well to our overall strategy that centers around our diverse portfolio mix of 20 markets with A- and B-quality communities in urban and suburban locations, which, over the long term, we expect to continue to perform well through the cycles and provide consistent cash flow growth. 
Our 2-year strategic plan issued in February showed strong expected 2016 revenue and NOI growth of 5.75% and 6.75% at the midpoints and we spoke to an anticipated solid, but slightly deaccelerating 2017 operating environment with revenue and NOI growth of 5% and 5.5% at the midpoints. Since then, there have been a number of publications speaking to slowing revenue trends in certain markets, and as such, I've asked Jerry to provide an update on our market expectations for the balance of 2016 and how we currently see 2017 stacking up. I hope you find this useful and that you reach the same conclusion as the UDR team. It's a great time to be in the apartment business and therefore we are reaffirming our full year guidance provided in the initial outlook and we'll provide an update during the second quarter earnings call. 
Also let me take a moment to mention that we were pleased that in early March, we were added to the S&P 500 index, which is a credit to our investors and the entire UDR team who made this possible. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Our first quarter earnin",681,"Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include our first quarter results, our balance sheet and capital markets update, a cash loss update, a development and transactions update and our second quarter and full year guidance. 
Our first quarter earnings results were in line with our previously provided guidance. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.43, $0.43 and $0.41, respectively. First quarter same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth remained strong at 6.4%, 2.7% and 8.0%, respectively. 
Next, the balance sheet. At year-end, our liquidity, as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, was $1.1 billion. Our financial leverage on undepreciated cost basis was 33.0%. Based on today's market cap, it was 23.8%, and inclusive of JVs, it was 28.2%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.4x, and inclusive of JVs, was 6.5x. All balance sheet metric improvements were ahead of plan. 
During the quarter, we issued $174 million of common equity at a net price of $34.73 per share in conjunction with our inclusion in the S&P 500. In addition, in January, we paid $83.3 million of 5 1/4% medium-term notes.
On to casualty losses. In conjunction with the previously announced damage to our 151-home 717 Olympic community located in Los Angeles, we recorded a casualty loss of $1.1 million during the quarter attributable to business interruption and temporary housing for our residents. This resulted in a charge of approximately $0.005 to FFO, but was added back to FFO as adjusted. We expect to recover a significant portion of this charge from the insurance providers and any subsequent recoveries will be included in FFO, but deducted from FFO as adjusted. As a reminder, 717 Olympic is owned by the MetLife II JV. It has no impact on our same-store results. As of today, all damage has been fixed, the community is fully operational and we are over 88% leased.
Turning to development. We commenced construction on our 585-home, $367 million 345 Harrison Street development in Boston South End, which we intend to fund with noncore asset sales. We have identified a number of assets that we will be marketing to satisfy our funding needs for the year with a significant portion of these sales coming from the Mid-Atlantic markets. 
At the end of the first quarter, the company had an under construction development pipeline for its pro rata share totaled $1 billion. The development pipeline is currently expected to produce a weighted average spread between estimated stabilized yields and current market cap rates above the upper end of the company's 150 to 200 basis point targeted range.
Next, transactions completed in the quarter. During the first quarter, we sold our 95% ownership interest in 2 land parcels located in Santa Monica, California for $24 million. This resulted in a gain to FFO of $1.7 million, which was backed out of FFO as adjusted.
On to the second quarter and full year 2016 guidance. Second quarter 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance is $0.43 to $0.45, $0.43 to $0.45 and $0.39 to $0.41, respectively. At this time, we are maintaining our full year guidance ranges for both earnings and same-store metrics. 
Full year 2016 AFFO, AFFO as adjusted and AFFO per share is forecasted at $1.75 to $1.81, $1.75 to $1.81 and $1.59 to $1.65, respectively. For same-store, our full year 2016 guidance remains unchanged with revenue growth of 5.5% to 6%, expense 3.0% to 3.5% and NOI 6.5% to 7.0%. Average 2016 occupancy remains forecasted at 96.6%.
Due to the $174 million equity issuance in the quarter, we no longer anticipate a bond issuance later this year and are updating our full year interest expense guidance to $121 million to $125 million from $128 million to $132 million. 
Other primary full year guidance assumptions can be found on Attachment 15 or Page 26 of our supplement. 
Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.295 in the first quarter or $1.18 per share when annualized, 6% above 2015's level and representing a yield of approximately 3.3%. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry."

In my remarks, I'll cover the following topics: first, our first quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the rental rate growth we realized this quarter, early results for the second quarter; second, how our primary markets performed during the quarter with a high-level update for 2016 and 2017; and last, a brief update on our development lease-ups. 
We are pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the first quarter, same-store net operating income grew 8.0%, our highest growth rate since the first quarter of 2012. These results were driven by a very strong 6.4% year-over-year increase in revenue against a 2.7% increase in expenses. Our same-store revenue per occupied home increased by 6.7% year-over-year to $1,897 per month. Our same-store occupancy of 96.5% was down 20 basis points versus the prior year period. 
Total portfolio revenue per occupied home was $1,995 per month including pro rata JVs. Stable job growth, limited impact from new multifamily supply, rental preference from both new millennial households, empty nesters and everyone in between are all driving this continued growth.
Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth, which is detailed on Attachment 8(E) of our supplement. We grew new lease rates by 3.7% in the first quarter, 50 basis points below the first quarter of 2015. Renewal growth remained robust at 6.9% in the first quarter or 120 basis points ahead of last year. On a blended rate basis, we averaged 5.3% during the first quarter, an improvement of 40 basis points versus the same period in 2015. 
In April, these trends continued with new lease and renewal rate growth of 4.2% and 6.8%, respectively, and our current physical occupancy is 96.5%. Our leasing success and stable occupancy gives us confidence that demand is more than sufficient to continue pushing rate higher throughout the upcoming prime leasing season in the majority of our markets. 
Next, move-outs to home purchase were flat year-over-year at 13%, in line with our long-term average. Even with our strong renewal increases in the first quarter, less than 9% of our move-outs gave rent increases the reason for leaving. 
Before I move on to the quarterly performance in our primary markets, I'd like to give a general update on our entire portfolio. First, third-party data indicates that in every one of our markets, we expect supply to peak this year with the exception being New York City. Second, job growth remains robust and we continue to have strong pricing power in the majority of our markets. The overall economic environment we see today is very similar to what we provided in our 2-year outlook.
Now moving on to the quarterly performance in our primary markets, which represent 70% of our same-store NOI and 75% of our total NOI. Metro D.C., which represents 18% of our total NOI, posted year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 2.1% compared to 1.9% in the first quarter of '15. We are forecasting the market to generate top line growth in 2016 between 2% and 3% as we will continue to benefit from our diverse 50-50 mix of A and B assets located both inside and outside the Beltway. In the first quarter, our As and Bs had very similar growth rates. Apartment supply in 2016 is expected to increase by 13,600 homes and then fall to 9,000 homes in 2017 while job growth in 2017 is expected to increase by 1.9%, up from 1.6% in 2016. Our current forecast is that D.C. will have modestly accelerating revenue growth in 2017 compared to 2016.
Orange County and Los Angeles combined represent 16% of our total NOI. Orange County posted year-over-year revenue growth of 8.4%. We continue to remain very optimistic on Orange County as the market is only expected to see 5,000 units of new supply and nearly 35,000 jobs, implying a 7:1 ratio, which is roughly 2x the long-term historical average. 
Revenue growth in L.A. was 8.8% during the quarter, a continuation of very strong results in the back half of 2015 due to job growth and supply absorption in our Marina del Rey concentrated submarket. Lease-up pressure from almost 2,000 recently delivered apartment homes in the neighboring Playa Vista market began negatively impacting our pricing power in the middle of the first quarter and we think this competition will continue to affect us through the end of the third quarter. Fortunately, tech-related jobs continue to come to this part of Silicon Beach. Overall, L.A. will see over 12,000 apartment homes delivered in 2016 or about 1% of supply and the market is projected to create 88,000 new jobs, again a 7:2 ratio. 2017 and 2018 are each projected currently to see deliveries slow 7,000 to 8,000 homes per year with job growth only slowing slightly.
L.A. looks best, the strong market over the next several years, and after we get past the short-term lease-up pressures in our Marina del Rey Playa Vista submarket, we will get back on track to above-average growth. We still anticipate full year 2016 revenue growth in L.A. to be in the 6% range and would expect 2017 to also be in that range. 
New York City represents 12% of our total NOI and posted 5.8% revenue growth in the quarter. While our same-store Properties are not directly affected by any new developments, we are beginning to feel the impact from the new supply in the Manhattan market. New Yorkers who typically have been loyal to their preferred neighborhoods are beginning to be enticed by pricing and incentives in places like Midtown West. 2016 deliveries of 25,000 apartment homes are adding 1% to existing supply. 2017 is expected that delivery's even higher at 30,000 apartment homes, but still right around 1% of existing supply. The higher deliveries in these years are directly related to the expiring 421 tax abatement program. Once we get through this multiyear elevated supply levels, new development should decrease significantly. Job growth in 2016 and 2017 is expected to be right around 1.3% each year. For full year 2016, we have revised our revenue growth expectations down to about 5% in our New York portfolio, which is 50 to 60 basis points below our original business plan. Because of the continuing pressures of new supply, we currently would project 2017 revenue growth in New York to be modestly lower than it will be in 2016.
San Francisco, which represents 11% of our total NOI is feeling the effects of new supply in several submarkets, including South of Market. However, we still expect the Bay Area to be one of our best-performing markets this year with revenue growth of 7% to 8%. Same-store revenue growth in the first quarter was 9.6% due to the extremely strong blended rate growth we achieved in the second and third quarters of 2015. The good news is that 2016  will be the peak of deliveries this cycle at 12,600 apartments or roughly 3% of existing stock and the number gets cut roughly in half to 6,800 homes in 2017, representing approximately 1.6% of existing stock. Annual job growth in 2016 and 2017 is expected to average about 2.5% each year. Although the Bay area is slowing, we still expect it to be an above-average market this year and next.
Boston, which represents 7% of our total NOI, produced a strong 6% revenue growth during the first quarter. One same-store property in the Back Bay neighborhood had revenue growth of 5%. Our suburban assets in the North Shore were our strongest performers with growth of 7.5%. The Seaport District, home to our 2015 completion of 100 Pier 4, continues to see more growth with additional office tenants in the submarket including the first quarter announcement that GE will be relocating to Seaport, about 0.5 mile from our property. We started an additional project this quarter in Boston's South end, the 585-home, $367 million project, 345 Harrison Street. New supply in Boston is projected at 6,100 homes in 2016 with slight deceleration in 2017 to 5,500 homes. Both years represent less than 1.5% of existing stock. Job growth is currently forecasted to be about 1.5% both years. We expect revenue growth in 2017 to be comparable to this year.
Seattle, which represents 6% of our total NOI and posted 8.4% revenue growth, continued to benefit from the strong growth inherent in our suburban B assets, which are located in submarkets that are less exposed to new supply. Long term, we continue to like the downtown Seattle submarket and believe that the ongoing creation of new jobs by companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and Expedia will continue to drive demand in Seattle's urban core. 
The Bellevue submarket is in the midst of fairly heavy new multifamily development, but has not yet put up significant pressure on our portfolio as evidenced by our 7.7% revenue growth in Bellevue this quarter. 
Deliveries in Metro Seattle are expected to peak in 2016 at 9,800 apartment homes before falling to 6,200 homes in 2017 while job growth continues at more than 2%. We expect revenue growth in 2017 to be comparable to this year.
Last, Dallas, which represents just over 4.5% of our NOI, posted 5.8% year-over-year same-store revenue growth in the first quarter. Our B properties have revenue growth that was 400 basis points higher than our As as heavy new supply in uptown and along the tollway is impacting rent growth in those submarkets. New supply in Dallas is projected to peak in 2016 at 18,000 new units and then drop to 12,700 in 2017. Job growth in the Dallas market should remain strong both years, above 2.4%. 
Outside of our primary markets such as Portland, Monterey Peninsula, the Sun Belt, Nashville and Austin, which comprise roughly 20% of our portfolio, we are above our initial expectations provided in our 2-year outlook and we continue to have strong pricing power due to limited amounts of new supply and robust job growth. Our expectation is that these markets have a long runway of growth due to favorable economics.
April results came in, in line with our plan, and as we look ahead in the next 2 months, we see improving pricing power along with stable occupancy. Our 50-50 A-B portfolio located throughout 20 markets has enabled outperformance in our Sun Belt markets, Orange County, Portland and Monterey Peninsula to offset markets that are being impacted by new supply in San Francisco, New York and L.A. 
On a national basis and within our core markets, apartment deliveries are expected to peak in 2016. Current projections from AXIO metrics have 2017 deliveries coming down over 25%. New York is the only market that we operate in that will experience a higher number of deliveries in 2017 than it had in 2016. Remember that earlier this year, in our 2-year outlook, we indicated a 75 basis point deceleration in 2017 with a revenue growth guidance midpoint of 5%. Our overall view has not changed.
I'll turn now to our 4 in lease-up developments, which you can find on Attachment 9(A) and B or Pages 19 and 20 of our supplement. Our share of these 4 properties represent $316 million or roughly 23% of our pipeline, inclusive of the West Coast development JV. In total, these properties are performing ahead of plan. 
399 Fremont, our 447-home, $318 million lease-up in San Francisco, California, took first move-ins in mid-March and was 26% leased and 15% occupied at quarter end. Today, we are 29% leased and 24% occupied with rents exceeding pro forma. We are currently operating a month concession as planned at this community, noting we will see increased competition further lease-ups in the submarket in the near future. 
Katella Grand 1, our 399-home, $138 million lease-up in Anaheim, California in the West Coast development JV was 37% leased and 29% occupied at quarter end, and as of today, is 47% leased and 37% occupied. We are currently offering less than 1 month of concessions at this community and leasing has been very strong in April with 41 applications. 
CityLine, our 244-home, $80 million lease-up in the Columbia City submarket of Seattle was 47% leased and 34% occupied at quarter end. Today, the property is 66% leased and 52% physically occupied.
8th & Republican, our 211-home, $97 million lease-up in the South Lake Union submarket of Seattle was 8% leased and 0% occupied at quarter end, and today, it is 16% leased and 6% occupied. First units were available for move in, in mid-April. 
All in, we had a great first quarter and we remain very positive on the outlook for multifamily fundamentals and our ability to execute during the peak leasing season and throughout the remainder of 2016. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Tom."

This is a testament to our overall strategy and market mix, which is less volatile and more predictable on average throughout the cycles. We feel good about 2016 and '17 and remain on target.

D.C., again we continue to think it bottomed about 1.5 years ago, late 2014. But we continue to see supply pressures in various submarkets throughout the Metro D.C. area such as Arlington and Alexandria. What's interesting is we've seen the compression between what As and Bs are doing occur. Currently, it's probably less than 100 basis points. Our properties in that 14th and U Street neighborhood including Capital View, View 14, Andover Place and Thomas Circle, those deals are all putting up probably about 3% revenue growth. And then a couple of the places over off Columbia Pike in Arlington are negative revenue growth right now. Then when you get outside the Beltway, even though outside tends to do a little bit better than inside the Beltway, we have a couple of properties out there in Woodbridge that are flat to slightly negative. So the A-B mix has benefited us in the past where Bs have significantly outperformed, but we are seeing neighborhoods in D.C., where supply has subsided, react very well and starting to see good rent growth. All in, D.C.'s performing about where we expected. I'll touch on the Home portfolio that we bought back in October. It's performing pretty much within plan in accordance with the plan that we had. We found a few opportunities to write expenses down. We're in the process of spending  coming close to $20 million on some initial capital expenditures, some on unit interior, some on the exteriors of the properties. But as we chug through that, we're seeing occupancy, which when we bought the portfolio, I think, was down around 92%. Today, occupancy in that portfolio has risen to between 95% and 96%. So D.C. I would tell you is going according to plan. Our expectation this year, like I said in my prepared remarks, is that revenue will be between 2% and 3% and then our expectation going further out is supply continues to be absorbed that '17 is better than '16."

The reason turnover was down really in the first quarter is we moved more of our expirations into the more seasonally high demand second, third quarter. So it wasn't purely that we were retaining more people, it was more that we had fewer expirations in the first quarter. So we are definitely feeling the effects of the supply pressures. Whether it's Midtown, West to Brooklyn, they're starting to have an effect to our Financial District properties. And if you really stratify what we did in the city in the first quarter, our 2 down in the Financial District popped revenue growth of about 4.5% and our Chelsea and Murray Hill properties came in north of 7%. So we're feeling it a little bit more in the Financial District. And then if you go up to our MetLife JV property in the Upper West Side, Columbus Square, that one is definitely feeling the effects of new supply in the upper West Side and had revenue growth of about 1%, 1.5%. So I don't think you'll see us --  the slowdown that I talked about in '17, I think, is going to be more rate-driven than occupancy."

Overall, first quarter came in where we thought it would. So far in April, we're right on track also. We're always going to have some markets that perform a little bit better than expectations, some that are below. And obviously, the 3 that we spoke to in the prepared remarks that are currently under are San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles and the reason for their underperformance really is the effects of new supply. We've talked for years that continuing to get 10% revenue growth in San Francisco wasn't long term sustainable. And I guess the developers and the city officials also took notice of this and this previously undersupplied market is getting a slug of new supply right now. Fortunately, for us, it's going to peak this year and start to decelerate next year. But what we noticed, too, and I had this in our remarks, is the success of new lease-up properties that are putting some of those pressure on us, that our 399 Fremont lease-up is well ahead of leasing velocity. We're getting rental rates that are above pro forma rents, which were $6 a foot, and we're giving away 1 month free. So what really shows up is there is demand and there is traffic for apartments. But when you have a lease-up property that's basically getting discounted down 8% because of 1-month free, you're going to find it harder to push rate on same-store properties. But yes, those -- we do have the 3 underperformers. We also, as I stated earlier, we've got about 1/3 of the company that is exceeding expectations and those are Orange County, which is I will say significantly, but it's ahead of where we expected. Our 2 markets in Florida, Orlando and Tampa, are significantly ahead of what we would have expected when we did our business plan as is Nashville, Portland and Monterey. And I think the big difference between the ones that are underperforming and those that are outperforming, it's which ones are being affected by new supply. Those that I just said that are outperforming tend to be B product, which doesn't compete as much against new supply, and they're in markets that really are not getting heavy doses of supply."

And even though you could sit there and think maybe it's because of they're getting priced out of the market, when we really see forwarding addresses on where these people move to, they're frequently moving to that brand new supply down the street that's offering the 1-month free, or in the case of Marina del Rey, 1.5 to 2 months free. The price is then similar to what we were asking them to pay. So we're able to trade up, if you will, into a brand new community, but it's at the same rate. So I don't think it's price fatigue. There's probably a little bit of that inching in there, but I think it's predominantly supply."

Nick, this is Harry, I'll talk about this for a couple of minutes. First, we're building a project in a location that will appeal to a broad range of renters. I'll talk about the neighborhood first and then the economics. This is a new location within the South End, which is one of Boston's most desirable neighborhood. It's primarily a residential district with old 19th century brownstones. But this particular location is only a 10-minute walk to the Financial District, the Back Bay and GE's new headquarters that'll bring 800 new employees to Boston. There's tons of restaurants, bars, galleries and boutiques along Fremont Street. Our site is located directly across the street from new Whole Foods Market that opened last year. There's been some recently built apartment projects, Ink block and the Troy totaling more than 800 units that are nearly fully leased up. The first condo building across the street sold out and prior to completion at more than $1,000 a foot. They've just started construction on a second condo building. Related companies purchased the site kitty-corner from ours and is into the city for approval of 175 apartments and 100 condos. In terms of economics, the yield based on today's rents is about 5.5%. If we get 3% revenue and expense growth for 3-plus years, the yield will grow to above 6% and more than 200 basis points above today's cap rates. Rents today are more than $400 below our Pier  4 deal that leased up in 7 months last year when you're comparing similar unit types. And like similar assets in Boston, the cap rate for this asset would be very low, likely sub-4% cap rate. We believe, in fact, that this location could outperform Boston overall, which according to AXIO averages nearly 4% per annum through 2019. In addition to Whole Foods and the retail and residential construction, our units and our 40,000 square feet of retail will help complete the transition of this new location within a very established and desirable overall neighborhood. Downtown Boston expects to average less than 1,500 unit deliveries per year through 2020, so we also believe supply is manageable."

Really, when you think about what makes up your revenue growth, it's really the -- it's any change in your occupancy year-over-year and then it's really the weighted blended average of increases for renewals and new leases over the proceeding 12-month period. So when you really look at how the revenue growth will decelerate over the years, you really haven't looked, for example, in the second quarter. What did we do in the second quarter last year on blended growth and what do we expect to do this year in second quarter on blended growth. And because last year, the second and third quarter were extremely strong, and as we go into this year's second and third quarter, the rate growth is going to be less than it was last year, you have a natural deceleration. Now I guess, you could say accurately that it is primarily coming from new supply deceleration that is predominantly occurring in those 3 markets that I talked about earlier because they have the heavier weighting on our total revenue growth. But I guess, long story short, I think you kind of hit it on the head, but I just wanted to make sure people really understand what the components are that really drive the rate growth. And for example, in the first quarter of this year, what we achieved in the third quarter of 2015 had a more of an impact on first quarter revenue growth than what we achieved as far as rate growth in the first quarter."

I still think even with the wage growth that we've been having over the last several years, we've seen and growing along with the rent growth we've had, we still have rent-to-income level that's pretty consistent with where it has been at about 23%. And we haven't seen a huge spike in turnover. So we're not driving many more people out because of rent growth. But I think any time you can see some wage growth improvement, it's helpful. I'd say a couple of things that have helped somewhat is, for our suburban, especially B renters, lower gas prices have kind of supplemented their wage growth. And I think when you look at the more urban dwellers, I don't think, again, it's so much wage growth that's affecting us there. It's their ability to jump to new lease-up. But I'm never going to argue against wage growth. When you see indications that whether it's California or different cities in California or if Seattle has done rates in the minimum wage to $15 even though it'll put a little bit of expense pressure maybe on operators like us because it'll drive, even though we don't have many people that make below $15 an hour for unskilled job, when you have skills that'll drive that gap up that I think overall, I think wage growth like that is going to be good for our sector and would help us to continue to drive rate."

A very good question. And one thing that we alluded to a couple of years ago when we saw the banking industry becoming further and further consolidated and regulated is we realized the impact would be is the Feds would have the ability to choke off construction loans. And what was currently seen in the marketplace, and if you talk to private developers, is securing a loan for new development in the multifamily space is getting very, very difficult. And you're going to see them do less in deals because it's going to require more equity, there's going to be less proceeds out of construction and tougher underwriting. I think that, combined with the transparency of operating environments and city's difficulty around zoning and entitlement processes, is going to slow it down a great deal. And I didn't hear any development in the last 3 months talking with a lot of private guys that said, hey, we think we're going to do more business in '17 than we're doing right now. Everybody looks at it and says, we're pulling back, we're being forced to pull back and we'll have to relook at our numbers and come up with more equity. So I think that's going to be the biggest chokepoint about new supply. It's certainly not the demand side of the equation. It is certainly there and will persist for many more years. It's the supply is going to get choked down."

The first quarter of 2016 was another great quarter for UDR with strong same-store results and developmental lease-ups continuing to perform well. As you have come to expect from UDR, we remain focused on executing on our previously communicated 2-year strategic plan, which is still the right plan given the long-term strength of the apartment business. 
From a big picture point of view, we are now in our sixth year of achieving 5%-plus NOI growth. Over the past 2 years, most our markets have seen accelerating growth trends due to supply-demand imbalance. And while our overall 2016 same-store operating trends continue to improve year-over-year, in a few markets, as anticipated, we have started to feel the impact of concentrated new supply. We believe apartment growth is sustainable and supply could be absorbed with steady job growth and household formations. 
Deliveries of new apartment homes are projected to peak in the cycle in 2016 at around 380,000 units and will subsequently drop in 2017 to 300,000 units, while job growth is forecast to be in the 2 to 2.5 million range in both years. In this environment, market mix and price points will be key and this plays well to our overall strategy that centers around our diverse portfolio mix of 20 markets with A- and B-quality communities in urban and suburban locations, which, over the long term, we expect to continue to perform well through the cycles and provide consistent cash flow growth. 
Our 2-year strategic plan issued in February showed strong expected 2016 revenue and NOI growth of 5.75% and 6.75% at the midpoints and we spoke to an anticipated solid, but slightly de-accelerating 2017 operating environment with revenue and NOI growth of 5% and 5.5% at the midpoints. Since then, there have been a number of publications speaking to slowing revenue trends in certain markets, and as such, I've asked Jerry to provide an update on our market expectations for the balance of 2016 and how we currently see 2017 stacking up. I hope you find this useful and that you reach the same conclusion as the UDR team. It's a great time to be in the apartment business and therefore we are reaffirming our full year guidance provided in the initial outlook and we'll provide an update during the second quarter earnings call. 
Also let me take a moment to mention that we were pleased that in early March, we were added to the S&P 500 index, which is a credit to our investors and the entire UDR team who made this possible. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."
310667,329707889,963604,"UDR, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","UDR, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include our first quarter results, our balance sheet and capital markets update, a cash loss update, a development and transactions update and our second quarter and full year guidance. Our first quarter earnin",681,"Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include our first quarter results, our balance sheet and capital markets update, a cash loss update, a development and transactions update and our second quarter and full year guidance. 
Our first quarter earnings results were in line with our previously provided guidance. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.43, $0.43 and $0.41, respectively. First quarter same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth remained strong at 6.4%, 2.7% and 8.0%, respectively. 
Next, the balance sheet. At year-end, our liquidity, as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, was $1.1 billion. Our financial leverage on undepreciated cost basis was 33.0%. Based on today's market cap, it was 23.8%, and inclusive of JVs, it was 28.2%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.4x, and inclusive of JVs, was 6.5x. All balance sheet metric improvements were ahead of plan. 
During the quarter, we issued $174 million of common equity at a net price of $34.73 per share in conjunction with our inclusion in the S&P 500. In addition, in January, we paid $83.3 million of 5 1/4% medium-term notes.
On to casualty losses. In conjunction with the previously announced damage to our 151-home 717 Olympic community located in Los Angeles, we recorded a casualty loss of $1.1 million during the quarter attributable to business interruption and temporary housing for our residents. This resulted in a charge of approximately $0.005 to FFO, but was added back to FFO as adjusted. We expect to recover a significant portion of this charge from the insurance providers and any subsequent recoveries will be included in FFO, but deducted from FFO as adjusted. As a reminder, 717 Olympic is owned by the MetLife II JV. It has no impact on our same-store results. As of today, all damage has been fixed, the community is fully operational and we are over 88% leased.
Turning to development. We commenced construction on our 585-home, $367 million 345 Harrison Street development in Boston South End, which we intend to fund with non-core asset sales. We have identified a number of assets that we will be marketing to satisfy our funding needs for the year with a significant portion of these sales coming from the Mid-Atlantic markets. 
At the end of the first quarter, the company had an under construction development pipeline for its pro rata share totaled $1 billion. The development pipeline is currently expected to produce a weighted average spread between estimated stabilized yields and current market cap rates above the upper end of the company's 150 to 200 basis point targeted range.
Next, transactions completed in the quarter. During the first quarter, we sold our 95% ownership interest in 2 land parcels located in Santa Monica, California for $24 million. This resulted in a gain to FFO of $1.7 million, which was backed out of FFO as adjusted.
On to the second quarter and full year 2016 guidance. Second quarter 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance is $0.43 to $0.45, $0.43 to $0.45 and $0.39 to $0.41, respectively. At this time, we are maintaining our full year guidance ranges for both earnings and same-store metrics. 
Full year 2016 AFFO, AFFO as adjusted and AFFO per share is forecasted at $1.75 to $1.81, $1.75 to $1.81 and $1.59 to $1.65, respectively. For same-store, our full year 2016 guidance remains unchanged with revenue growth of 5.5% to 6%, expense 3.0% to 3.5% and NOI 6.5% to 7.0%. Average 2016 occupancy remains forecasted at 96.6%.
Due to the $174 million equity issuance in the quarter, we no longer anticipate a bond issuance later this year and are updating our full year interest expense guidance to $121 million to $125 million from $128 million to $132 million. 
Other primary full year guidance assumptions can be found on Attachment 15 or Page 26 of our supplement. 
Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.295 in the first quarter or $1.18 per share when annualized, 6% above 2015's level and representing a yield of approximately 3.3%. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry."

In my remarks, I'll cover the following topics: first, our first quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the rental rate growth we realized this quarter, early results for the second quarter; second, how our primary markets performed during the quarter with a high-level update for 2016 and 2017; and last, a brief update on our development lease-ups. 
We are pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the first quarter, same-store net operating income grew 8.0%, our highest growth rate since the first quarter of 2012. These results were driven by a very strong 6.4% year-over-year increase in revenue against a 2.7% increase in expenses. Our same-store revenue per occupied home increased by 6.7% year-over-year to $1,897 per month. Our same-store occupancy of 96.5% was down 20 basis points versus the prior year period. 
Total portfolio revenue per occupied home was $1,995 per month including pro rata JVs. Stable job growth, limited impact from new multifamily supply, rental preference from both new millennial households, empty nesters and everyone in between are all driving this continued growth.
Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth, which is detailed on Attachment 8(E) of our supplement. We grew new lease rates by 3.7% in the first quarter, 50 basis points below the first quarter of 2015. Renewal growth remained robust at 6.9% in the first quarter or 120 basis points ahead of last year. On a blended rate basis, we averaged 5.3% during the first quarter, an improvement of 40 basis points versus the same period in 2015. 
In April, these trends continued with new lease and renewal rate growth of 4.2% and 6.8%, respectively, and our current physical occupancy is 96.5%. Our leasing success and stable occupancy gives us confidence that demand is more than sufficient to continue pushing rate higher throughout the upcoming prime leasing season in the majority of our markets. 
Next, move-outs to home purchase were flat year-over-year at 13%, in line with our long-term average. Even with our strong renewal increases in the first quarter, less than 9% of our move-outs gave rent increases the reason for leaving. 
Before I move on to the quarterly performance in our primary markets, I'd like to give a general update on our entire portfolio. First, third-party data indicates that in every one of our markets, we expect supply to peak this year with the exception being New York City. Second, job growth remains robust and we continue to have strong pricing power in the majority of our markets. The overall economic environment we see today is very similar to what we provided in our 2-year outlook.
Now moving on to the quarterly performance in our primary markets, which represent 70% of our same-store NOI and 75% of our total NOI. Metro D.C., which represents 18% of our total NOI, posted year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 2.1% compared to 1.9% in the first quarter of '15. We are forecasting the market to generate top line growth in 2016 between 2% and 3% as we will continue to benefit from our diverse 50-50 mix of A and B assets located both inside and outside the Beltway. In the first quarter, our As and Bs had very similar growth rates. Apartment supply in 2016 is expected to increase by 13,600 homes and then fall to 9,000 homes in 2017 while job growth in 2017 is expected to increase by 1.9%, up from 1.6% in 2016. Our current forecast is that D.C. will have modestly accelerating revenue growth in 2017 compared to 2016.
Orange County and Los Angeles combined represent 16% of our total NOI. Orange County posted year-over-year revenue growth of 8.4%. We continue to remain very optimistic on Orange County as the market is only expected to see 5,000 units of new supply and nearly 35,000 jobs, implying a 7:1 ratio, which is roughly 2x the long-term historical average. 
Revenue growth in L.A. was 8.8% during the quarter, a continuation of very strong results in the back half of 2015 due to job growth and supply absorption in our Marina del Rey concentrated submarket. Lease-up pressure from almost 2,000 recently delivered apartment homes in the neighboring Playa Vista market began negatively impacting our pricing power in the middle of the first quarter and we think this competition will continue to affect us through the end of the third quarter. Fortunately, tech-related jobs continue to come to this part of Silicon Beach. Overall, L.A. will see over 12,000 apartment homes delivered in 2016 or about 1% of supply and the market is projected to create 88,000 new jobs, again a 7:2 ratio. 2017 and 2018 are each projected currently to see deliveries slow 7,000 to 8,000 homes per year with job growth only slowing slightly.
L.A. looks best, the strong market over the next several years, and after we get past the short-term lease-up pressures in our Marina del Rey Playa Vista submarket, we will get back on track to above-average growth. We still anticipate full year 2016 revenue growth in L.A. to be in the 6% range and would expect 2017 to also be in that range. 
New York City represents 12% of our total NOI and posted 5.8% revenue growth in the quarter. While our same-store Properties are not directly affected by any new developments, we are beginning to feel the impact from the new supply in the Manhattan market. New Yorkers who typically have been loyal to their preferred neighborhoods are beginning to be enticed by pricing and incentives in places like Midtown West. 2016 deliveries of 25,000 apartment homes are adding 1% to existing supply. 2017 is expected that delivery's even higher at 30,000 apartment homes, but still right around 1% of existing supply. The higher deliveries in these years are directly related to the expiring 421 tax abatement program. Once we get through this multiyear elevated supply levels, new development should decrease significantly. Job growth in 2016 and 2017 is expected to be right around 1.3% each year. For full year 2016, we have revised our revenue growth expectations down to about 5% in our New York portfolio, which is 50 to 60 basis points below our original business plan. Because of the continuing pressures of new supply, we currently would project 2017 revenue growth in New York to be modestly lower than it will be in 2016.
San Francisco, which represents 11% of our total NOI is feeling the effects of new supply in several submarkets, including South of Market. However, we still expect the Bay Area to be one of our best-performing markets this year with revenue growth of 7% to 8%. Same-store revenue growth in the first quarter was 9.6% due to the extremely strong blended rate growth we achieved in the second and third quarters of 2015. The good news is that 2016  will be the peak of deliveries this cycle at 12,600 apartments or roughly 3% of existing stock and the number gets cut roughly in half to 6,800 homes in 2017, representing approximately 1.6% of existing stock. Annual job growth in 2016 and 2017 is expected to average about 2.5% each year. Although the Bay area is slowing, we still expect it to be an above-average market this year and next.
Boston, which represents 7% of our total NOI, produced a strong 6% revenue growth during the first quarter. One same-store property in the Back Bay neighborhood had revenue growth of 5%. Our suburban assets in the North Shore were our strongest performers with growth of 7.5%. The Seaport District, home to our 2015 completion of 100 Pier 4, continues to see more growth with additional office tenants in the submarket including the first quarter announcement that GE will be relocating to Seaport, about 0.5 mile from our property. We started an additional project this quarter in Boston's South end, the 585-home, $367 million project, 345 Harrison Street. New supply in Boston is projected at 6,100 homes in 2016 with slight deceleration in 2017 to 5,500 homes. Both years represent less than 1.5% of existing stock. Job growth is currently forecasted to be about 1.5% both years. We expect revenue growth in 2017 to be comparable to this year.
Seattle, which represents 6% of our total NOI and posted 8.4% revenue growth, continued to benefit from the strong growth inherent in our suburban B assets, which are located in submarkets that are less exposed to new supply. Long term, we continue to like the downtown Seattle submarket and believe that the ongoing creation of new jobs by companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and Expedia will continue to drive demand in Seattle's urban core. 
The Bellevue submarket is in the midst of fairly heavy new multifamily development, but has not yet put up significant pressure on our portfolio as evidenced by our 7.7% revenue growth in Bellevue this quarter. 
Deliveries in Metro Seattle are expected to peak in 2016 at 9,800 apartment homes before falling to 6,200 homes in 2017 while job growth continues at more than 2%. We expect revenue growth in 2017 to be comparable to this year.
Last, Dallas, which represents just over 4.5% of our NOI, posted 5.8% year-over-year same-store revenue growth in the first quarter. Our B properties have revenue growth that was 400 basis points higher than our As as heavy new supply in uptown and along the tollway is impacting rent growth in those submarkets. New supply in Dallas is projected to peak in 2016 at 18,000 new units and then drop to 12,700 in 2017. Job growth in the Dallas market should remain strong both years, above 2.4%. 
Outside of our primary markets such as Portland, Monterey Peninsula, the Sun Belt, Nashville and Austin, which comprise roughly 20% of our portfolio, we are above our initial expectations provided in our 2-year outlook and we continue to have strong pricing power due to limited amounts of new supply and robust job growth. Our expectation is that these markets have a long runway of growth due to favorable economics.
April results came in, in line with our plan, and as we look ahead in the next 2 months, we see improving pricing power along with stable occupancy. Our 50-50 A-B portfolio located throughout 20 markets has enabled out-performance in our Sun Belt markets, Orange County, Portland and Monterey Peninsula to offset markets that are being impacted by new supply in San Francisco, New York and L.A. 
On a national basis and within our core markets, apartment deliveries are expected to peak in 2016. Current projections from AXIO metrics have 2017 deliveries coming down over 25%. New York is the only market that we operate in that will experience a higher number of deliveries in 2017 than it had in 2016. Remember that earlier this year, in our 2-year outlook, we indicated a 75 basis point deceleration in 2017 with a revenue growth guidance midpoint of 5%. Our overall view has not changed.
I'll turn now to our 4 in lease-up developments, which you can find on Attachment 9A and B or Pages 19 and 20 of our supplement. Our share of these 4 properties represent $316 million or roughly 23% of our pipeline, inclusive of the West Coast development JV. In total, these properties are performing ahead of plan. 
399 Fremont, our 447-home, $318 million lease-up in San Francisco, California, took first move-ins in mid-March and was 26% leased and 15% occupied at quarter end. Today, we are 29% leased and 24% occupied with rents exceeding pro forma. We are currently operating a month concession as planned at this community, noting we will see increased competition further lease-ups in the submarket in the near future. 
Katella Grand 1, our 399-home, $138 million lease-up in Anaheim, California in the West Coast development JV was 37% leased and 29% occupied at quarter end, and as of today, is 47% leased and 37% occupied. We are currently offering less than 1 month of concessions at this community and leasing has been very strong in April with 41 applications. 
CityLine, our 244-home, $80 million lease-up in the Columbia City submarket of Seattle was 47% leased and 34% occupied at quarter end. Today, the property is 66% leased and 52% physically occupied.
8th & Republican, our 211-home, $97 million lease-up in the South Lake Union submarket of Seattle was 8% leased and 0% occupied at quarter end, and today, it is 16% leased and 6% occupied. First units were available for move in, in mid-April. 
All in, we had a great first quarter and we remain very positive on the outlook for multifamily fundamentals and our ability to execute during the peak leasing season and throughout the remainder of 2016. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Tom."

D.C., again we continue to think it bottomed about 1.5 years ago, late 2014. But we continue to see supply pressures in various submarkets throughout the Metro D.C. area, such as Arlington and Alexandria. What's interesting is we've seen the compression between what As and Bs are doing occur. Currently, it's probably less than 100 basis points. Our properties in that 14th and U Street neighborhood including Capital View, View 14, Andover Place and Thomas Circle, those deals are all putting up probably about 3% revenue growth. And then a couple of the places over off Columbia Pike in Arlington are negative revenue growth right now. Then when you get outside the Beltway, even though outside tends to do a little bit better than inside the Beltway, we have a couple of properties out there in Woodbridge that are flat to slightly negative. So the A-B mix has benefited us in the past where Bs have significantly outperformed, but we are seeing neighborhoods in D.C., where supply has subsided, react very well and starting to see good rent growth. All in, D.C.'s performing about where we expected. I'll touch on the Home portfolio that we bought back in October. It's performing pretty much within plan in accordance with the plan that we had. We found a few opportunities to write expenses down. We're in the process of spending  coming close to $20 million on some initial capital expenditures, some on unit interior, some on the exteriors of the properties. But as we chug through that, we're seeing occupancy, which when we bought the portfolio, I think, was down around 92%. Today, occupancy in that portfolio has risen to between 95% and 96%. So D.C. I would tell you is going according to plan. Our expectation this year, like I said in my prepared remarks, is that revenue will be between 2% and 3% and then our expectation going further out is supply continues to be absorbed that '17 is better than '16."

So it wasn't purely that we were retaining more people, it was more that we had fewer expirations in the first quarter. So we are definitely feeling the effects of the supply pressures. Whether it's Midtown, West to Brooklyn, they're starting to have an effect to our Financial District properties. And if you really stratify what we did in the city in the first quarter, our 2 down in the Financial District popped revenue growth of about 4.5% and our Chelsea and Murray Hill properties came in north of 7%. So we're feeling it a little bit more in the Financial District. And then if you go up to our MetLife JV property in the Upper West Side, Columbus Square, that one is definitely feeling the effects of new supply in the upper West Side and had revenue growth of about 1%, 1.5%.

Overall, first quarter came in where we thought it would. So far in April, we're right on track also. We're always going to have some markets that perform a little bit better than expectations, some that are below. And obviously, the 3 that we spoke to in the prepared remarks that are currently under are San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles and the reason for their underperformance really is the effects of new supply. We've talked for years that continuing to get 10% revenue growth in San Francisco wasn't long term sustainable. And I guess the developers and the city officials also took notice of this and this previously undersupplied market is getting a slug of new supply right now. Fortunately, for us, it's going to peak this year and start to decelerate next year. But what we noticed, too, and I had this in our remarks, is the success of new lease-up properties that are putting some of those pressure on us, that our 399 Fremont lease-up is well ahead of leasing velocity. We're getting rental rates that are above pro forma rents, which were $6 a foot, and we're giving away 1 month free. So what really shows up is there is demand and there is traffic for apartments. But when you have a lease-up property that's basically getting discounted down 8% because of 1-month free, you're going to find it harder to push rate on same-store properties. But yes, those -- we do have the 3 underperformers. We also, as I stated earlier, we've got about 1/3 of the company that is exceeding expectations. And those are: Orange County, which is I will say significantly, but it's ahead of where we expected; our 2 markets in Florida, Orlando and Tampa, are significantly ahead of what we would have expected when we did our business plan; as is Nashville, Portland and Monterey. And I think the big difference between the ones that are underperforming and those that are outperforming, it's which ones are being affected by new supply. Those that I just said that are outperforming tend to be B product, which doesn't compete as much against new supply, and they're in markets that really are not getting heavy doses of supply."

And even though you could sit there and think maybe it's because of -- that they're getting priced out of the market, when we really see forwarding addresses on where these people move to, they're frequently moving to that brand new supply down the street that's offering the 1-month free, or in the case of Marina del Rey, 1.5 to 2 months free. The price is then similar to what we were asking them to pay. So we're able to trade up, if you will, into a brand new community, but it's at the same rate. So I don't think it's price fatigue. There's probably a little bit of that inching in there, but I think it's predominantly supply."

Nick, this is Harry, I'll talk about this for a couple of minutes. First, we're building a project in a location that will appeal to a broad range of renters. I'll talk about the neighborhood first and then the economics. This is a new location within the South End, which is one of Boston's most desirable neighborhood. It's primarily a residential district with old 19th century brownstones. But this particular location is only a 10-minute walk to the Financial District, the Back Bay and GE's new headquarters that will bring 800 new employees to Boston. There's tons of restaurants, bars, galleries and boutiques along Fremont Street. Our site is located directly across the street from new Whole Foods Market that opened last year. There's been some recently built apartment projects, Ink block and the Troy totaling more than 800 units that are nearly fully leased up. The first condo building across the street sold out and prior to completion at more than $1,000 a foot. They've just started construction on a second condo building. Related companies purchased the site kitty-corner from ours and is into the city for approval of 175 apartments and 100 condos. In terms of economics, the yield based on today's rents is about 5.5%. If we get 3% revenue and expense growth for 3-plus years, the yield will grow to above 6% and more than 200 basis points above today's cap rates. Rents today are more than $400 below our Pier 4 deal that leased up in 7 months last year when you're comparing similar unit types. And like similar assets in Boston, the cap rate for this asset would be very low, likely sub-4% cap rate. We believe, in fact, that this location could outperform Boston overall, which according to AXIO averages nearly 4% per annum through 2019. In addition to Whole Foods and the retail and residential construction, our units and our 40,000 square feet of retail will help complete the transition of this new location within a very established and desirable overall neighborhood. Downtown Boston expects to average less than 1,500 unit deliveries per year through 2020, so we also believe supply is manageable."

Really, when you think about what makes up your revenue growth, it's really the -- it's any change in your occupancy year-over-year and then it's really the weighted blended average of increases for renewals and new leases over the proceeding 12-month period. So when you really look at how the revenue growth will decelerate over the years, you really haven't looked, for example, in the second quarter. What did we do in the second quarter last year on blended growth and what do we expect to do this year in second quarter on blended growth. And because last year, the second and third quarter were extremely strong, and as we go into this year's second and third quarter, the rate growth is going to be less than it was last year, you have a natural deceleration. Now I guess you could say, accurately, that it is primarily coming from new supply deceleration that is predominantly occurring in those 3 markets that I talked about earlier because they have the heavier weighting on our total revenue growth. But I guess, long story short, I think you kind of hit it on the head, but I just wanted to make sure people really understand what the components are that really drive the rate growth.

What are you seeing in these A markets and in CBDs in terms of who's looking at assets? Are you receiving any interest externally from any of the larger private equity players? Or is there appetite kind of more geared towards stable -- more stable assets with theoretically higher yield?"

I think on the -- yes, but, sort of by and large, it's bifurcated buyer class between the main and main Class A assets, which are going to be pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and we're starting to see an influx of foreign investment from Canada, from the Middle East and Asia, and perhaps to a lesser degree, the private equity funds who typically have slightly higher IRR hurdles than the these others. And therefore, while they do have buckets of money that would lend itself to buying A properties, they tend to buy kind of A-minus and B properties primarily. At least that's what you've seen historically, that's what we're seeing now. There's both asset classes we're seeing very deep buyer pools, which has obviously positively impacted asset pricing. In terms of others sort of reaching out to us, that's something that happens routinely whether it's from private equity firms or sovereign wealth firms or other buyers and that happens routinely at really at all points in the cycle."

And we haven't seen a huge spike in turnover. So we're not driving many more people out because of rent growth. But I think any time you can see some wage growth improvement, it's helpful. I'd say a couple of things that have helped somewhat is, for our suburban, especially B renters, lower gas prices have kind of supplemented their wage growth. And I think when you look at the more urban dwellers, I don't think, again, it's so much wage growth that's affecting us there. It's their ability to jump to new lease-up. But I'm never going to argue against wage growth. When you see indications that whether it's California or different cities in California or if Seattle has done rates in the minimum wage to $15 even though it'll put a little bit of expense pressure maybe on operators like us because it'll drive, even though we don't have many people that make below $15 an hour for unskilled job, when you have skills that will drive that gap up that I think overall, I think wage growth like that is going to be good for our sector and would help us to continue to drive rate."

A very good question. And one thing that we alluded to a couple of years ago when we saw the banking industry becoming further and further consolidated and regulated is, we realized the impact would be is the Feds would have the ability to choke off construction loans. And what was currently seen in the marketplace, and if you talk to private developers, is securing a loan for new development in the multifamily space is getting very, very difficult. And you're going to see them do less in deals because it's going to require more equity, there's going to be less proceeds out of construction and tougher underwriting. I think that, combined with the transparency of operating environments and city's difficulty around zoning and entitlement processes, is going to slow it down a great deal. And I didn't hear any development in the last 3 months talking with a lot of private guys that said, hey, we think we're going to do more business in '17 than we're doing right now. Everybody looks at it and says, we're pulling back, we're being forced to pull back and we'll have to relook at our numbers and come up with more equity. So I think that's going to be the biggest chokepoint about new supply. It's certainly not the demand side of the equation. It is certainly there and will persist for many more years. It's the supply is going to get choked down."

And really, we're focused on the long-term aspects of the business, which do not remain anything but positive. The demographics are on our side, the supply demand curve is on our supply -- side to be able to execute our strategy, deliver solid, growing cash flow and paying dividends. And so I think the construct of the business is great, where we are from a strategic standpoint of being in the markets we're in, the mix of portfolios and the management team to execute on that. And so we think the future is very bright. We think, just as we've always tried to be, very transparent about the operations of the business. But when you back up and you look at the end result of the cash flow growth, the prospects for the balance of the year, in '17 as well, we're very excited about those prospects and eager to just keep working on those. And so with that, I'll close and we thank you and look forward to seeing many of you in the next conferences over the next couple of months. Take care."

On the call with me today are Shawn Johnston, Interim Principal Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.
The second quarter of 2016 was another great quarter for UDR, with 8% AFFO growth, driven by strong revenue growth of 5.7% and continued leasing strength in the 400 million developments in lease-up. This is a direct reflection of the continued execution of our strategic plan.
At the core of our strategic plan are 4 elements: First, a focus on cash flow growth for our shareholders through operational excellence, which Jerry will touch on later. Second, an accretive development pipeline that can be fully self-funded. Third, our diversed portfolio mix of 20 markets with A and B communities in urban and suburban locations. And lastly, a safe, low levered balance sheet.
Combined, these 4 elements are designed to provide the greatest predictability of cash flow growth through a variety of economic cycles. This is reflected in our updated guidance range for the full year, with the midpoint resulting in 8% AFFO growth per share, which Shawn will touch on his remarks. 
Before I turn the call over to Shawn, I want to add a couple of comments on the recent departure of Tom Herzog, our former CFO. While Tom was an exceptional CFO, he left UDR with an impressive bench, and I feel confident in the skills of those in the finance and accounting team to be more than adequate to handle his absence. At this time, Shawn Johnston, our Chief Accounting Officer, is serving as our Interim Principal Financial Officer, while we evaluate both internal and external candidates. Shawn is an exceptional candidate for the role, and we're glad to have him serving in his interim capacity now.
With that, I will turn the call over to Shawn for additional comments on the quarter."
310667,370255179,1013787,"UDR, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","UDR, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include our second quarter results, a balance sheet update, and our third quarter and full year guidance update. Our second quarter earnings results were at the top end of our previously provided guidance. FFO,",801,"Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include our second quarter results, a balance sheet update, and our third quarter and full year guidance update. 
Our second quarter earnings results were at the top end of our previously provided guidance. FFO, FFO as adjusted, and AFFO per share were $0.44, $0.45 and $0.41, respectively. Second quarter same-store revenue expense and NOI growth were 5.7%, 5.5% and 5.7%, respectively. Second quarter expense growth was elevated due to a higher-than-expected property tax assessment on our 2014 development completion in San Francisco.
Historically, San Francisco is value developments for tax purposes by using a mix of cost to construct and income capitalization. While we budgeted for a mix that was weighted more towards the income method and President would indicate, a 100% of the valuation was eventually based on income capitalization.
This unexpected assessment resulted in a charge of $2.2 million during the quarter. $1.1 million of this was attributable to the period that the community was included in our same-store population, and was recognized as additional same-store expense during the quarter. The remaining portion of the charge is for real estate taxes, while the community was in lease-up, which can be found in Attachment 5. 
Excluding this negative tax variance, quarterly same-store expense growth for the portfolio in the San Francisco Bay Area would have been 3.4% and 9.9%, respectively, versus the 5.5% and 33.1% realized.
Next, the balance sheet. At quarter end, our liquidity, as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, was $876 million. Our financial leverage, on an underappreciated cost basis, was 33.2%. 
Based on quarter end market cap, it was 23.6%, and inclusive of JVs, it was 28.1%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.3x, and inclusive of JVs, was 6.3x. All balance sheet metric improvements were ahead of our strategic plan.
I would like to point out a few changes to our supplemental package. First, you'll note that we have provided additional GAAP metrics in both our release and supplement, in response of the recent SEC interpretation regarding GAAP and non-GAAP metrics.
I'd also like to direct you to Attachment 15, or Page 28 of our supplement, where we have updated our full year guidance. We're now providing both our previous and updated guidance for ease of comparison. With that, we have tightened our full year 2016 AFFO per share guidance range to $1.76 to $1.80, and tightened and increased our FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance ranges to $1.77 to $1.80, and $1.61 to $1.64 respectively.
A few key items have impacted our original guidance. First, our same-store portfolio is performing in line with original guidance, but our MetLife properties, which are primarily urban A, have underperformed our expectations. This underperformance has been offset by the outperformance of our development lease ups.
Second, the S&P 500 inclusion trade resulted in some deletion. However, this issuance gave us the flexibility to change the timing of other plan 2016 capital events, to offset the majority of the dilution, and ultimately resulted in an improved balance sheet.
Lastly, we expect a reduction on our full year incentive compensation, which is partially offset by higher-than-expected healthcare costs, resulting in a net reduction to G&A expense of $2 million at the midpoint.
A few other specifics from the page. We increased our sources guidance by $75 million at the midpoint, to a range of $650 million to $750 million for the year. This is due to an increase in planned dispositions, which we now anticipate being approximately $400 million for the year.
In addition to the $400 million of sales, we have issued $174 million of common equity, with the remainder of our sources coming from secured debt refinancings. We do not anticipate any additional equity issuances through the remainder of the year. 
Our debt maturities increased by $60 million as we have accelerated the accretive prepayment on some existing secured debt to the earliest possible date without penalty.
Additionally, we reduced our development, redevelopment and land acquisition guidance by $50 million at the midpoint, due to timing expense and we increased our acquisition guidance by $100 million in order to satisfy some section 1031 exchanges that we would like to complete this year. 
For same-store, our full year 2016 guidance remains unchanged, with revenue growth of 5.5% to 6%; expense, 3% to 3.5%; and NOI growth of 6.5% to 7%. Average 2016 occupancy remains forecasted at 96.6%. 
Third quarter 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance is $0.44 to $0.46, $0.44 to $0.46 and $0.39 to $0.41 respectfully. Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.295 in the second quarter, or $1.18 per share when annualized, 6% above 2015's level, which represents the yield of approximately 3.2%. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry."

In my remarks, I will cover the following topics. first, our second quarter performance metrics, leasing trends and rental rate growth we realized this quarter and early results for the third quarter. Second, how our primary markets performed during the quarter. And last, a brief update on our development lease ups. 
We're pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the second quarter, thanks to our net operating income, grew 5.7%. These results were driven by a 5.7% year-over-year increase in revenue, against a 5.5% increase in expenses. 
Year-to-date, through June 30, we have achieved NOI growth of 6.8%, behind revenue growth of 6% and expense growth of 4.1%.  Our same-store revenue, per occupied home, increased 6% year-over-year to $1,921 per month, while same-store occupancy of 96.6% was down 30 basis points versus the prior year period. 
Total portfolio revenue, per occupied home, was $2,027 per month, including pro rate JVs. Although we are feeling the impact of new supply in a few of our core markets, namely San Francisco and New York, a positive continued the outweigh the negatives, stable job growth, new household formations that are delaying home purchase, choosing to rent as well as empty nester baby boomers moving to an urban setting with the lift work lay atmosphere.
Our portfolio mix benefits from each of these scenarios. Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth, which detailed on Attachment 8G of our supplement. We grew our new lease rates by 4.4% in the second quarter, 330 basis points below the second quarter of 2015. Renewal growth remained robust at 6.3% in the second quarter, or 70 basis points behind last year.
On a blended rate basis, we averaged 5.3% during the second quarter, a reduction of 210 basis points versus the same period last year. If you look at the 76% of the same-store portfolio not located in New York and San Francisco, our decline in blended rate growth was only 100 basis points.
I'd like to point out the exceptional growth we achieved in 2015 was an anomaly, we are now back to a normal operating environment. Typically, renewal rate growth outpaces new lease rate growth by at least 100 basis points.
Because we were able to drive occupancy in late 2014 to the 96.5% to 97% level, we're able to push new lease growth in the peak leasing season in 2015, higher than that of renewal leases. 2016 has proven to be a more normalized year, with renewal growth outpacing new lease rate growth.
While we wish every year could be a strong as 2015, we are very happy with the strength seen in 2016 thus far, especially given that we are currently dealing with peak deliveries in the majority of our markets.
Next, moves out to home purchased were up 150 basis points year-over-year at 14.1%. And even with our strong renewal increases in the second quarter, less than 9% of our move outs gave rent increase as the reason for leaving.
Now moving on to the quarterly performance in our primary markets, which represents 70% of our same-store NOI and 75% of our total NOI. Metro DC, which represents 19% of our total NOI and 14% of our same-store NOI, posted year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 1.8%, a slight deceleration from first quarter, due primarily to very strong bad debt collections in the second quarter of 2015.
We are forecasting the market to generate top line growth in 2016 of between 2% and 3% as we will continue to benefit from our diverse 50-50 mix of A and B assets located both inside and outside the Beltway.
Our B product outperformed our As during the quarter, by 170 basis points, as sporadic supply issues continued to make for choppy results in some infill locations.
Orange County in Los Angeles combined, represents 16% of our total NOI and about 17% of our same-store NOI. Orange County posted year-over-year revenue growth of 8.9%, with both our As and Bs performing well above 8%, and all submarkets remaining very strong as we face very limit in supply.
Revenue growth in Los Angeles was 5.2% during the quarter. Our same-store portfolio is primarily concentrated within the Marina del Rey submarket, and is currently facing over 2,000 units of new supply, which we expect will be fully absorbed by year end. We continued to see good job growth in the supply picture improving in 2017 for our same-store L.A. portfolio.
New York City, which represents 12% of our total NOI and 13% of same-store NOI, posted 4.6% revenue growth for the quarter. While our same-store properties are not directly affected by any new developments, we are feeling the impact from new supply of the Manhattan market, as new lease growth during the quarter was 1.9%.  New Yorkers, who typically have been loyal to their preferred neighborhoods, are being enticed by pricing incentives in places like Midtown West.
For full year 2016, we expect New York to have revenue growth in the low 4% range, below our original estimates of approximately 5.5%. San Francisco which represents about 11% of both our total and same-store NOI, is continuing to feel the effects of new supply in several submarkets, including Southwood market. However, we still expect the Bay Area to be one of our best-performing markets this year, with revenue growth between 6% and 7%. 
Same-store revenue growth in the second quarter was 6.3%, due to the extremely strong blended rate growth we achieved in the third quarter of 2015. We currently see our portfolio being affected by lease up pressures through the middle of 2017.
Boston, which represents 7% of our total NOI and about 5% of same-store NOI, produced a strong 6.1% revenue growth during the second quarter. Our suburban assets in the North Shore, where our strongest performers, with growth over 7.5%. 
Even with new supply downtown, our one same-store asset in the Back Bay posted revenue growth of 4% for the quarter.
The Seaport District, home to our 2015 completion, 100 Pier 4, and the South end District, home to our under construction community, 345 Harrison, continued to see more growth with additional office and retail tenants in the submarket.
Seattle, which represents 6% of our total and same-store NOI, posted strong revenue growth of 8.5% for the quarter. 16% of our portfolio is B product, which posted revenue growth of 12.3%, while our A quality communities produced 6.6% growth. We continued to benefit from the strong growth inherent in these suburban B assets, which are located in submarkets that are less exposed to new supply.
Even with new supply pressure, our Bellevue assets posted revenue growth of 6.8% for the quarter, or revenue growth in downtown Seattle was essentially flat.
Last, Dallas, which represents just over 4% of our total and same-store NOI, posted 5% year-over-year same-store growth in the second quarter. Our B properties revenue growth that was 500 basis points higher than our As, is having new supply in uptown and along the tollways impacting rent growth in those submarkets.
While new supply remains elevated, we expect deliveries to decline after this year, and are confident they will be observed by the strengthened diversified job market in Dallas.
Our secondary markets, not just Portland, binary Peninsula, Florida, Asheville and Austin, which comprise roughly 20% of our portfolio, continued to have strong pricing power due to limited amounts of new supply and robust job growth. Our expectations that these models have a long runway of growth due to favorable economics.
July results came in, in line with our plan. As we look ahead to the next 2 months, we see stable pricing power and occupancy. Our 50-50 AB portfolio located throughout 20 markets, is enabled outperformance in our Sun Belt markets, Orange County, Seattle, Boston, Portland and Monterey, to offset markets that are being impacted by new supply, namely San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles.
I'll turn now to our 4 in lease-up developments, which you can find on Attachments 9A and 9B, or Pages 21 and 22 of our supplement. Our pro rata share of these 4 properties represents over $400 million or roughly 30% of our pipeline, inclusive of the West Coast development joint venture. In total, these properties are performing ahead of plan.
First, 399 Fremont, our 447 home, $318 million 50-50 MetLife JV lease-up in San Francisco, was 50% leased and 43% occupied at quarter end. Today, we are 57% leased and 48% occupied, with rents exceeding pro forma. We are currently offering 6 weeks concession as we begun to see increased competition from other lease ups in the submarket.
Over the last month, we have taken over 30 leases. The following 3 communities are all part of the West Coast development joint venture. [indiscernible] 1, our 399 home, $138 million lease-up in Anaheim, California, was 65% leased and 58% occupied at quarter end. And as of today, is 72% leased and 64% occupied. We are currently offering less than one month of concessions at this community, and leasing remains very strong, with about 30 applications per month.
8N Republican, our 211 home, $97 million lease-up in the South lake Union submarket of Seattle was 47% leased and 37% occupied at quarter end, and is currently 60% leased and 46% occupied, and we are averaging over one application per day.
CityLine, our 244 home, $80 million lease-up in the Columbia City submarket of Seattle, was 87% leased and 84% occupied at quarter end. Today, the property is 89% leased and 86% physically occupied.
All in, we had a very strong second quarter and we remained very positive on the outlook for multifamily fundamentals and our ability to execute throughout the remainder of 2016.
With that, we will open up the call to Q&A. Operator?"

You know we would see A is getting closer to B, probably midyear next year, maybe a little bit after that. And then as you get deeper into '18, I think A is probably start competing more head-to-head with Bs. But it's definitely market dependent. For example, I would think in Washington, D.C, we've seen that spread contract and expand multiple times. Last quarter, it was about 50 basis points where Bs were outperforming. This quarter, we expanded to 1.7, but we do see a slowdown of new supply affecting our product in DC over the next 1.5 years. So I do think As because there typically better locations, by the second half of next year, should start doing much better there. When you look at a place like New York, it's probably a little more prolonged, call it may be even 2019 or further, where we see Bs continuing to outperform. And in San Francisco, I think it's similar, you're going to see supply continue to affect the market in some places like that, at least through the middle of next year. And I think that will cost As to continue to have to go head-to-head against new supply well into '18. So I think San Francisco, New York, Dallas, Austin, it's probably pushed out a bit, but several of the other markets that's saw new supply come a little bit earlier it's shorter. But on average, I'm guessing, it gets closer in late '17, and probably pulls even in '18."

So it's gone. But yes, I think a big part of it that you have to consider is we really drove rate very strongly in the second half [indiscernible] benefits this year. And when you look at the -- we anticipated there'll be a deceleration in rate growth that we get this year, and that has happened. And while I'll say directionally and in total, that reduction was pretty close, we missed on a market-by-market basis. For example, 29% of our portfolio, which is made of New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, were missing our numbers. We came into the year thinking San Francisco would be an 8, now we think it's probably get end up at a 6.5. We thought New York was going to be high 5s, now we think it's going to be low 4s. And Los Angeles, you know we came in taking it's going to be call it a 7, and now we think it's going to be mid-5s. What we have, that a lot of people don't, is the diversified portfolio. In 20 markets, we've got the 50-50 split between A, Bs and urban. And what's really helping us is that 42% of our portfolio is performing better than we'd expected coming into the year, so it's offsetting those 3 markets that are doing work. So those are markets like Seattle, which I think all of us are doing well in right now, are Orange County portfolio with 8.9% revenue growth in the second quarter is doing exceptionally well. We're doing very well in Boston, where we have predominantly a suburban portfolio in our same-store pool. You know we held up about a little north of a 6 revenue there. The 2 markets in Florida, both Orlando and Tampa, are doing better than we expected. Nashville is on fire right now. And again, we're very suburban B there, we're not being impacted at all by the new supply. And then you have our Monterey in Portland portfolios that are doing well. So the beauty of our portfolio with that diversification is we're not dependent on a couple of markets doing well or not doing well. We realized diversified approach is in a continued to help us in the future because all markets are good and go through their natural cycle, so will always have some that are doing better, some that are doing worse.

I can tell you right now, we look at our model, we're coming in right in the midpoint of guidance. You know, there's a couple of things that can push us -- there's really one thing that could push us to the top end, and that would be if we get a significant occupancy pick up, and we have been pushing to drive occupancy a little bit higher over the last month or 2. You know, the thing that could drive us in the bottom is if we see a further degeneration in operating fundamentals. And typically, those would probably have to come with more downside than we projected. And really New York and San Francisco, since the other ones has been reacting kind of stable. There's a couple of things though, because I get what you're talking about, we've got a 6 or so in the first half of the year, which would imply second half would be a 5 5, but there's a few things to keep in mind. This year, so far, we've had 6.3% rent per occupied home growth, that's been offset by about 30-basis-point decline in occupancy. We had very difficult occupancy comps in the first half of last year. Our occupancy in the second half of last year decelerated about 20 or 30 bps. Now still very high at 96 6, if it wasn't at 96 8, 96 9. Our expectation and what we're shooting for this year is to have a positive spread over last year's occupancy, so we're not going to be losing revenue growth because of an occupancy decline. We're hoping we get a little bit of pick up from that. And then the second thing, just that's interesting, is our fee income is up almost 10% year-over-year, and we would expect that to continue through the second half of the year, and that's really coming partially from lease break fees. People electing to move and relocate for jobs or buy houses or things like that. But the second part is, we started working on an initiative in the second half of last year, to drive higher revenues from our parking rent, which was an initiative we began working on, like I said, late last year, but we've got the fruits of it this year, to find a way to increase this underoptimize-ed real estate. So you've got 6% of our your revenue stock coming from fee income that's growing at a much higher rate than my rents. And you know, is -- how optimistic or pessimistic or conservative is our that midpoint, you know right now, we've factored in, like I said earlier that we think the blended rate growth for the second half of the year is going to be low 4s. Again you're looking at renewal growth in the low 5s, and new lease rate growth, may be right around 3, and that seems to us to be pretty sustainable right now."

I guess, you said something interesting earlier about how you're kind of abandoning, maybe Jerry, abandoning this warehousing concepts, and thinking about keeping some assets in some markets in the portfolio. And so I was wondering if you could talk about any other adjustments you're making to the strategy, like that because one of them I recall we've spent some time together last year, the 50-50 Class A, Class B could actually morph into more like 60 or 70 Class A overtime.

And so when we think we've market, for example, where Baltimore has performed in the last 5 years averaging 3% growth, we kind of look out the next 5 years and say, we don't think it's really going to change a whole lot, where else do we think we can redeploy that capital in the enterprise? Most immediately, in the development pipeline. So we're always revisiting our markets. On the balance of 50-50, the As that we're putting in today, 10 years from now, will be Bs. And so I think we'll probably hover around the 50-50, it might go 60-40, but I don't see a long-term directional change in that allocation. I think what ultimately we're trying to build, and have done so far and will continue to refine, is building cash flow, and where we see it can grow the best. And concentrated positions create concentrated risks. And so we're always going to have this diversification. We think, over time, it works. Some markets having Bs work better than As. Other cases where we look at jobs, where they think they're coming up in the price point, As are going to be better. So I think that's the overriding doctrine that we're overall thinking about our capital allocation and decisions. And markets from time to time, Florida is an example right now, talking off-the-cuff is going to enjoy another couple of year run, but the supply will start coming at Florida in the near future, and then we'll look at how we feel about our assets positioned in that market, and rather we should move more capital out of that into other places where opportunities will become available."

Because I think everybody is got throwing around different numbers. I would tell you some anecdotal information that's critical to this conversation would be, is what are banks lending on? And what is the bank lending environment? And if you start digging into that with the bankers, you're realizing very rapidly that the terms on construction loans, the pricing on them and the availability is contracting at a rapid pace and we've seen several large banks just redline and say we're not doing multifamily loans any longer, or throwing up price terms that are prohibitive to make the deals work. So I think you're going to start to see the autos construction numbers start really coming down rapidly as people start to get into their construction loan draws, and trying to get their terms and their penciling work. I think it also creates an opportunity for UDR to look at Wolff and steel type creek opportunities that might start becoming available in '17 should this come to fruition. So I would stay very focused on what the supply of money looks like, the terms of that and watch how that ultimately unfolds. I know everybody's numbers are all over the map right now, but what I look at this what are the drivers.

But one is converting common area space, lighting, with LED lighting, which dramatically drops down both your electrical costs as well as the maintenance time people have to spend replacing those light bulbs. And we've seen a reduction in our electric cost this year from doing that. Secondly, package lockers, some people believe in them, and some people don't. I will tell you, we do. We've installed well over 40 lockers, we've got another 35, they're being installed right now. And we're doing it for 2 reasons: It's dealing with package management as a huge time slot on our on-site teams, so it opens them up to do more work that makes money for us. And secondly, it's a benefit that residents enjoy to have 24/7 access to pick up their own packages. So we get a little bit of a redemption pop from doing that too. And the package lockers have an IRR, when you look at it, a little over 25% to 30%. So financially it makes a lot of sense, but we always do things that the residents want and it typically is good for us. And you know, what both of those things do, you heard me mention on the LED lights that it takes less it gives it back sometime to our maintenance teams. You heard be on the package dollars, that we've been able to give some time back to our lease and maintenance because it if you look at our personnel numbers, personal expense number, you'll see that it's roughly flat for the quarter. We've been able to reduced about 1.5% to 2% of our site headcount this year because of some of these efficiencies that we've been able to do. So those are just a couple of examples, but like Timmy said, we're always looking, there are some that we'll spend a great deal of time, they don't work, but we're always trying to stretch for the next thing to expand our margins."

As we look towards the future, we don't see the big supply pressures coming in at the urban portfolios, but we do have a concern about job growth sustaining itself, and I think everybody should. And we'll wait and see how the election turns out, and how the economy turns out. But in both of those camps, that's the future will be what it's going to be. So I'm not at all surprised about those 2 markets. We're not surprised about our L.A. exposure, we saw it coming. What we see is this, these are supply driven numbers that are changing our pricing power. It is not the underlying fundamentals of demographics and/or job markets that are driving our business right out here those are still in very good shape. And so we're very focused on the supply pressure.

On the call with me today are Shawn Johnston, Interim Principal Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.
The second quarter of 2016 was another great quarter for UDR with 8% AFFO growth, driven by strong revenue growth of 5.7% and continued leasing strength in the 400 million developments in lease-up. This is a direct reflection of the continued execution of our strategic plan.
At the core of our strategic plan are 4 elements: First, a focus on cash flow growth for our shareholders through operational excellence, which Jerry will touch on later. Second, an accretive development pipeline that can be fully self-funded. Third, our diversed portfolio mix of 20 markets with A and B communities in urban and suburban locations. And lastly, a safe, low-levered balance sheet.
Combined, these 4 elements are designed to provide the greatest predictability of cash flow growth through a variety of economic cycles. This is reflected in our updated guidance range for the full year, with the midpoint resulting in 8% AFFO growth per share, which Shawn will touch on in his remarks. 
Before I turn the call over to Shawn, I wanted to add a couple of comments on the recent departure of Tom Herzog, our former CFO. While Tom was an exceptional CFO, he left UDR with an impressive bench, and I feel confident in the skills of those in the finance and accounting team to be more than adequate to handle his absence. 
At this time, Shawn Johnston, our Chief Accounting Officer, is serving as our Interim Principal Financial Officer, while we evaluate both internal and external candidates. Shawn is an exceptional candidate for the role, and we are glad to have him serving in his interim capacity now.
With that, I will turn the call over to Shawn for additional comments on the quarter."

The topics I will cover today include our second quarter results, a balance sheet update, and our third quarter and full year guidance update. Our second quarter earnings results were at the top end of our previously provided guidance. FFO,",801,"Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include our second quarter results, a balance sheet update, and our third quarter and full year guidance update. 
Our second quarter earnings results were at the top end of our previously provided guidance. FFO, FFO as adjusted, and AFFO per share were $0.44, $0.45 and $0.41, respectively. Second quarter same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth were 5.7%, 5.5% and 5.7%, respectively. Second quarter expense growth was elevated due to a higher-than-expected property tax assessment on our 2014 development completion in San Francisco.
Historically, San Francisco is value developments for tax purposes by using a mix of cost to construct in income capitalization. While we budgeted for a mix that was weighted more towards the income method and then president would indicate 100% of the valuation was eventually based on income capitalization.
This unexpected assessment resulted in a charge of $2.2 million during the quarter, $1.1 million of this was attributable to the period that the community was included in our same-store population and was recognized as additional same-store expense during the quarter. The remaining portion of the charge is for real estate taxes, while the community was in lease-up, which can be found in Attachment 5. 
Excluding this negative tax variance, quarterly same-store expense growth for the portfolio in the San Francisco Bay Area would have been 3.4% and 9.9%, respectively, versus the 5.5% and 33.1% realized.
Next, the balance sheet. At quarter end, our liquidity, as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, was $876 million. Our financial leverage on an underappreciated cost basis was 33.2%. 
Based on quarter-end market cap, it was 23.6%, and inclusive of JVs, it was 28.1%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.3x, and inclusive of JVs, was 6.3x. All balance sheet metric improvements were ahead of our strategic plan.
I would like to point out a few changes to our supplemental package. First, you'll note that we have provided additional GAAP metrics in both our release and supplement in response to the recent SEC interpretation regarding GAAP and non-GAAP metrics.
I'd also like to direct you to Attachment 15 or Page 28 of our supplement, where we have updated our full year guidance. We are now providing both our previous and updated guidance for ease of comparison. With that, we have tightened our full year 2016 AFFO per share guidance range to $1.76 to $1.80 and tightened and increased our FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance ranges to $1.77 to $1.80 and $1.61 to $1.64, respectively.
A few key items have impacted our original guidance. First, our same-store portfolio is performing in line with original guidance, but our MetLife properties, which are primarily urban A, have underperformed our expectations. This underperformance has been offset by the outperformance of our development lease-ups.
Second, the S&P 500 inclusion trade resulted in some deletion. However, this issuance gave us the flexibility to change the timing of other plan 2016 capital events to offset the majority of the dilution and ultimately, resulted in an improved balance sheet.
Lastly, we expect a reduction on our full year incentive compensation, which is partially offset by higher-than-expected health care costs, resulting in a net reduction to G&A expense of $2 million at the midpoint.
A few other specifics from the page. We increased our sources guidance by $75 million at the midpoint to a range of $650 million to $750 million for the year. This is due to an increase in planned dispositions, which we now anticipate being approximately $400 million for the year.
In addition to the $400 million of sales, we have issued $174 million of common equity with the remainder of our sources coming from secured debt refinancings. We do not anticipate any additional equity issuances through the remainder of the year. 
Our debt maturities increased by $60 million as we have accelerated the accretive prepayment on some existing secured debt to the earliest possible date without penalty. Additionally, we reduced our development, redevelopment and land acquisition guidance by $50 million at the midpoint due to timing expense, and we increased our acquisition guidance by $100 million in order to satisfy some Section 1031 exchanges that we would like to complete this year. 
For same-store, our full year 2016 guidance remains unchanged with revenue growth of 5.5% to 6%; expense, 3% to 3.5%; and NOI growth of 6.5% to 7%. Average 2016 occupancy remains forecasted at 96.6%. 
Third quarter 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance is $0.44 to $0.46, $0.44 to $0.46 and $0.39 to $0.41, respectively. Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.295 in the second quarter or $1.18 per share when annualized, 6% above 2015's level, which represents a yield of approximately 3.2%. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry."

In my remarks, I will cover the following topics: First, our second quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the rental rate growth we realized this quarter and early results for the third quarter. Second, how our primary markers performed during the quarter. And last, a brief update on our development lease-ups. 
We're pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the second quarter, thanks to our net operating income grew 5.7%, these results were driven by a 5.7% year-over-year increase in revenue against a 5.5% increase in expenses.
Year-to-date, through June 30, we have achieved NOI growth of 6.8%, behind revenue growth of 6% and expense growth of 4.1%. Our same-store revenue per occupied home increased 6% year-over-year to $1,921 per month, while same-store occupancy of 96.6% was down 30 basis points versus the prior year period. 
Total portfolio revenue per occupied home was $2,027 per month, including pro rata JVs. Although we are feeling the impact of new supply in a few of our core markets, namely San Francisco and New York, the positives we see continued to outweigh the negatives: stable job growth; new household formations that are delaying home purchase in choosing to rent; as well as empty nester baby boomers moving to an urban setting with the lift, work, play atmosphere. Our portfolio mix benefits from each of these scenarios. 
Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth, which is detailed on Attachment 8G of our supplement. We grew our new lease rates by 4.4% in the second quarter, 330 basis points below the second quarter of 2015. Renewal growth remained robust at 6.3% in the second quarter or 70 basis points behind last year.
On a blended rate basis, we averaged 5.3% during the second quarter, a reduction of 210 basis points versus the same period last year. If you look at the 76% of the same-store portfolio not located in New York and San Francisco, our decline in blended rate growth was only 100 basis points.
I'd like to point out the exceptional growth we achieved in 2015 was an anomaly. We are now back to a normal operating environment. Typically, renewal rate growth outpaces new lease rate growth by at least 100 basis points. Because we were able to drive occupancy in late 2014 to the 96.5% to 97% level, we're able to push new lease rate growth in the peak leasing season in 2015, higher than that of renewal leases. 2016 has proven to be a more normalized year with renewal growth outpacing new lease rate growth.
While we wish every year could be a strong as 2015, we are very happy with the strength seen in 2016 thus far, especially given that we are currently dealing with peak deliveries in the majority of our markets.
Next, move outs for home purchased were up 150 basis points year-over-year at 14.1%. And even with our strong renewal increases in the second quarter, less than 9% of our move outs gave rent increase as the reason for leaving.
Now moving on to the quarterly performance in our primary markets, which represents 70% of our same-store NOI and 75% of our total NOI. Metro D.C., which represents 19% of our total NOI and 14% of our same-store NOI, posted year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 1.8%, a slight deceleration from first quarter due primarily to very strong bad debt collections in the second quarter of 2015.
We are forecasting the market to generate top line growth in 2016 of between 2% and 3%, as we will continue to benefit from our diverse 50-50 mix of A and B assets located both inside and outside the Beltway.
Our B product outperformed our As during the quarter by 170 basis points, as sporadic supply issues continued to make for choppy results in some infill locations.
Orange County and Los Angeles combined represent 16% of our total NOI and about 17% of our same-store NOI. Orange County posted year-over-year revenue growth of 8.9% with both our As and Bs performing well above 8% and all submarkets remaining very strong as we face very little in the supply.
Revenue growth in Los Angeles was 5.2% during the quarter. Our same-store portfolio is primarily concentrated within the Marina del Rey submarket, and is currently facing over 2,000 units of new supply, which we expect will be fully absorbed by year-end. We continue to see good job growth in the supply picture improving in 2017 for our same-store L.A. portfolio.
New York City, which represents 12% of our total NOI and 13% of same-store NOI, posted 4.6% revenue growth for the quarter. While our same-store properties are not directly affected by any new developments, we are feeling the impact from new supply of the Manhattan market as new lease growth during the quarter was 1.9%. New Yorkers, who typically have been loyal to their preferred neighborhoods, are being enticed by pricing incentives in places like Midtown West.
For full year 2016, we expect New York to have revenue growth in the low 4% range, below our original estimates of approximately 5.5%. San Francisco, which represents about 11% of both our total and same-store NOI, is continuing to feel the effects of new supply in several submarkets, including Southwood market. However, we still expect the Bay Area to be one of our best-performing markets this year with revenue growth between 6% and 7%. 
Same-store revenue growth in the second quarter was 6.3% due to the extremely strong blended rate growth we achieved in the third quarter of 2015. We currently see our portfolio being affected by lease-up pressures through the middle of 2017.
Boston, which represents 7% of our total NOI and about 5% of same-store NOI, produced a strong 6.1% revenue growth during the second quarter. Our suburban assets in the North Shore were our strongest performers with growth over 7.5%. 
Even with new supply downtown, our one same-store asset in the Back Bay posted revenue growth of 4% for the quarter.
The Seaport District, home to our 2015 completion, 100 Pier 4, and the South End District, home to our under construction community, 345 Harrison, continued to see more growth with additional office and retail tenants in the submarket.
Seattle, which represents 6% of our total and same-store NOI, posted strong revenue growth of 8.5% for the quarter. 16% of our portfolio is B product, which posted revenue growth of 12.3%, while our A quality communities produced 6.6% growth. We continued to benefit from the strong growth inherent in these suburban B assets, which are located in submarkets that are less exposed to new supply.
Even with new supply pressure, our Bellevue assets posted revenue growth of 6.8% for the quarter or revenue growth in downtown Seattle was essentially flat.
Last, Dallas, which represents just over 4% of our total and same-store NOI, posted 5% year-over-year same-store growth in the second quarter. Our B properties revenue growth that was 500 basis points higher than our As is having new supply in uptown and along the tollways impacting rent growth in those submarkets.
While new supply remains elevated, we expect deliveries to decline after this year and are confident they will be observed by the strengthened diversified job market in Dallas.
Our secondary markets, not just Portland, Monterey Peninsula, Florida, Nashville and Austin, which comprise roughly 20% of our portfolio, continued to have strong pricing power due to limited amounts of new supply and robust job growth. Our expectation out of these markets have a long runway of growth due to favorable economics.
July results came in, in line with our plan. As we look ahead to the next 2 months, we see stable pricing power and occupancy. Our 50-50 AB portfolio located throughout 20 markets has enabled outperformance in our Sun Belt market, Orange County, Seattle, Boston, Portland and Monterey to offset markets that are being impacted by new supply, namely San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles.
I'll turn now to our 4 in lease-up developments, which you can find on Attachments 9A and 9B or Pages 21 and 22 of our supplement. Our pro rata share of these 4 properties represents over $400 million or roughly 30% of our pipeline, inclusive of the West Coast development joint venture. In total, these properties are performing ahead of plan.
First, 399 Fremont, our 447-home, $318 million 50-50 MetLife JV lease-up in San Francisco was 50% leased and 43% occupied at quarter end. Today, we are 57% leased and 48% occupied with rents exceeding pro forma. We are currently offering 6 weeks concession as we began to see increased competition from other lease-ups in the submarket. Over the last month, we have taken over 30 leases. 
The following 3 communities are all part of the West Coast development joint venture. Katella Grand I, our 399-home, $138 million lease-up in Anaheim, California was 65% leased and 58% occupied at quarter end. And as of today, it's 72% leased and 64% occupied. We are currently offering less than 1 month of concessions at this community, and leasing remains very strong with about 30 applications per month.
8th & Republican, our 211-home, $97 million lease-up in the South lake Union submarket of Seattle was 47% leased and 37% occupied at quarter end and is currently 60% leased and 46% occupied, and we are averaging over 1 application per day.
CityLine, our 244-home, $80 million lease-up in the Columbia City submarket of Seattle was 87% leased and 84% occupied at quarter end. Today, the property is 89% leased and 86% physically occupied.
All in, we had a very strong second quarter, and we remained very positive on the outlook for multifamily fundamentals and our ability to execute throughout the remainder of 2016.

And then as you get deeper into '18, I think A is probably -- start competing more head-to-head with Bs. But it's definitely market dependent. For example, I would think in Washington, D.C, we've seen that spread contract and expand multiple times. Last quarter, it was about 50 basis points where Bs were outperforming. This quarter, we expanded to 1.7, but we do see a slowdown of new supply affecting our product in DC over the next 1.5 years. So I do think As because they're in typically better locations. By the second half of next year, it should start doing much better there. When you look at a place like New York, it's probably a little more prolonged, call it maybe even 2019 or further, where we see Bs continuing to outperform. And in San Francisco, I think it's similar. You're going to see supply continue to affect the market in some places like that, at least through the middle of next year. And I think that will cost As to continue to have to go head-to-head against new supply well into '18. So I think San Francisco, New York, Dallas, Austin, it's probably pushed out a bit. But several of the other markets that saw new supply come a little bit earlier, it's shorter. But on average, I'm guessing it gets closer in late '17 and probably pulls even in '18."

But yes, I think a big part of it that you have to consider is we really drove rate very strongly in the second half less [ph] as paid benefits this year. And when you look at the -- we anticipated there'll be a deceleration in rate growth that we get this year, and that has happened. And while I'll say, directionally and in total, that reduction was pretty close, we missed on a market-by-market basis. For example, 29% of our portfolio, which is made up of New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, we're missing our numbers. We came into the year thinking San Francisco would be an 8, now we think it's probably going to end up at a 6.5. We thought New York was going to be high 5s, now we think it's going to be low 4s. And Los Angeles, we came in thinking it was going to be call it a 7, and now we think it's going to be mid-5s. What we have that a lot of people don't is the diversified portfolio: 20 markets; we've got the 50-50 split between A, Bs and urbans. And what's really helping us is that 42% of our portfolio is performing better than we'd expected coming into the year. So it's offsetting those 3 markets that are doing work. So those are markets like Seattle, which I think all of us are doing well in right now. Our Orange County portfolio with 8.9% revenue growth in the second quarter is doing exceptionally well. We're doing very well in Boston, where we have predominantly a suburban portfolio in our same-store pool. We held up at about a little north of a 6 revenue there. The 2 markets in Florida, both Orlando and Tampa, are doing better than we expected. Nashville is on fire right now. And again, we're very suburban B there, so we're not being impacted at all by the new supply. And then we have our Monterey and Portland portfolios that are doing well. So the beauty of our portfolio with that diversification is we're not dependent on a couple of markets doing well or not doing well. We realized the most diversified approach is going to continue to help us in the future because all markets are going to go through their natural cycle. So we'll always have some that are doing better, some that are doing worse. So I think it's really more of the portfolio diversification that's really helping us compared to some others."

We look at our model, we're coming in right in the midpoint of guidance. There's a couple of things that could push us through. There's only one thing that could push us to the top end, and that would be -- if we get a significant occupancy pick up, and we have been pushing to drive occupancy a little bit higher over the last month or 2. The thing that could drive us to the bottom is if we see a further deterioration in operating fundamentals. And typically, those would probably have to come with more downside than we projected. And really New York and San Francisco, since the other ones have been reacting kind of stable. There's a couple of things though, because I get what you're talking about, we've got a 6 or so in the first half of the year, which would imply second half would be a 5.5%. But there's a few things to keep in mind. This year, so far, we've had 6.3% rent per occupied home growth that's been offset by about 30 basis point decline in occupancy. We had very difficult occupancy comps in the first half of last year. Our occupancy in the second half of last year decelerated about 20 or 30 bps. Now we're still very high at 96.6%, but it wasn't at 96.8%, 96.9%. Our expectation and what we're shooting for this year is to have a positive spread over last year's occupancy. So we're not going to be losing revenue growth because of an occupancy decline. We're hoping we get a little bit of pick up from that. And then the second thing, just -- that's interesting is our fee income is up almost 10% year-over-year, and we would expect that to continue through the second half of the year. And that's really coming partially from lease break fees, people electing to move and relocate for jobs or buy houses or things like that. And -- but the second part is we started working on an initiative in the second half of last year to drive higher revenues from our parking rent, which was an initiative we began working on. Like I said, late last year, we've got the fruits of it this year to find a way to increase this under-optimized real estate. So you've got 6% of our your revenue stock coming from fee income that's growing at a much higher rate than my rents. And it's how optimistic or pessimistic or conservative is our -- is that midpoint. Right now, we've factored in, like I said earlier, that we think the blended rate growth for the second half of the year is going to be low 4s. So again, you're looking at renewal growth in the low 5s and new lease rate growth, maybe right around 3, and that seems, to us, to be pretty sustainable right now."

They're contractually obligated to pay us to get out of the lease, so a portion of it is that."

I think abandoning or changing is probably a little bit of an overstatement. I think what we're doing is constantly weighing our market mix and the price point, what we think cash flow is going to grow at. And so when we think we've a market, for example, where Baltimore has performed in the last 5 years averaging 3% growth, we kind of look out the next 5 years and say, we don't think it's really going to change a whole lot, where else do we think we can redeploy that capital in the enterprise? Most immediately, in the development pipeline. So we're always revisiting our markets. On the balance of 50-50, the As that we're putting in today, 10 years from now, will be Bs. And so I think we'll probably hover around the 50-50, it might go 60-40, but I don't see a long-term directional change in that allocation. I think what ultimately we're trying to build, and have done so far and will continue to refine, is building cash flow, and where we see it can grow the best and concentrated positions create concentrated risk. And so we're always going to have this diversification. We think, over time, it works. Some markets having Bs work better than As. Other cases where we look at jobs and where we think they're coming up in the price point, As are going to be better. So I think that's the overriding doctrine that we're overall thinking about our capital allocation and decisions. And markets from time to time, Florida is an example right now, talking off-the-cuff is going to enjoy another couple of year run, but the supply will start coming at Florida in the near future, and then we'll look at how we feel about our assets positioned in that market, and rather we should move more capital out of that into other places where opportunities will become available."

And what is the bank lending environment? And if you start digging into that with the bankers, you're realizing very rapidly that the terms on construction loans, the pricing on them and the availability is contracting at a rapid pace and we've seen several large banks just redline and say we're not doing multifamily loans any longer, or throwing up price terms that are prohibitive to make the deals work. So I think you're going to start to see the autos construction numbers start really coming down rapidly as people start to get into their construction loan draws, and trying to get their terms and their penciling work.

And we're always constantly pressing the next envelope for our customer. And we do a great job of listening to what they want and what they're willing to pay for. And it's Jerry and his team to filter through that innovation list and put it in a practical terms. This parking conversation that he alluded to earlier is really a conversation that started 2 years ago. And ultimately we built systems out, condense the field about the pricing scheme and they've done a great job of executing it.

So we've -- and some are capital expenditures that get us there. But one is converting common area space, lighting, with LED lighting, which dramatically drops down both your electrical cost as well as the maintenance time people have to spend replacing those light bulbs. And we've seen a reduction in our electric cost this year from doing that. Secondly, package lockers, some people believe in them, some people don't. I will tell you, we do. We've installed well over 40 lockers. We've got another 35, that are being installed right now. And we're doing it for 2 reasons: It's dealing with package management as a huge time slot on our on-site teams, so it opens them up to do more work that makes money for us. And secondly, it's a benefit that residents enjoy to have 24/7 access to pick up their own packages. So we get a little bit of a rent pop from doing that too. And the package lockers have an IRR, when you really look at it, a little over 25% to 30%. So financially it makes a lot of sense, but we always do things that the residents want and it typically is good for us. And, what both of those things do, you heard me mention on the LED lights that it takes -- it gives back sometime to our maintenance teams. You heard be on the package lockers say that we've been able to give some time back to our leasing agents. And this year and if you look at our personnel numbers, personnel expense number, you'll see that it's roughly flat for the quarter. We've been able to reduce about 1.5% to 2% of our site headcount this year because of some of these efficiencies that we've been able to do. So those are just a couple of examples, but like Toomey said, we're always looking. There are some that we'll spend a great deal of time on and they don't work, but we're always trying to stretch for the next thing that's going to expand our margins."

And we'll wait and see how the election turns out, and how the economy turns out. But in both of those camps, that's the future will be what it's going to be. So I'm not at all surprised about those 2 markets. We're not surprised about our L.A. exposure, we saw it coming. What we see is this, these are supply driven numbers that are changing our pricing power. It is not the underlying fundamentals of demographics and/or job markets that are driving our business right out here, those are still in very good shape. And so we're very focused on the supply pressure. And I think we have a very good handle on it, feel good about the way we're running the business to deal with that supply.

On the call with me today are Shawn Johnston, Interim Principal Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.
The second quarter of 2016 was another great quarter for UDR with 8% AFFO growth, driven by strong revenue growth of 5.7% and continued leasing strength in the 400 million developments in lease-up. This is a direct reflection of the continued execution of our strategic plan.
At the core of our strategic plan are 4 elements: First, a focus on cash flow growth for our shareholders through operational excellence, which Jerry will touch on later. Second, an accretive development pipeline that can be fully self-funded. Third, our diverse portfolio mix of 20 markets with A and B communities in urban and suburban locations. And lastly, a safe, low-levered balance sheet.
Combined, these 4 elements are designed to provide the greatest predictability of cash flow growth through a variety of economic cycles. This is reflected in our updated guidance range for the full year, with a midpoint resulting in 8% AFFO growth per share, which Shawn will touch on in his remarks. 
Before I turn the call over to Shawn, I wanted to add a couple of comments on the recent departure of Tom Herzog, our former CFO. While Tom was an exceptional CFO, he left UDR with an impressive bench, and I feel confident in the skills of those in the finance and accounting team to be more than adequate to handle his absence. 
At this time, Shawn Johnston, our Chief Accounting Officer, is serving as our Interim Principal Financial Officer, while we evaluate both internal and external candidates. Shawn is an exceptional candidate for the role, and we are glad to have him serving in his interim capacity now.
With that, I will turn the call over to Shawn for additional comments on the quarter."

The topics I will cover today include our second quarter results, a balance sheet update, and our third quarter and full year guidance update.Our second quarter earnings results were at the top end of our previously provided guidance. FFO,",801,"Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include our second quarter results, a balance sheet update, and our third quarter and full year guidance update.
Our second quarter earnings results were at the top end of our previously provided guidance. FFO, FFO as adjusted, and AFFO per share were $0.44, $0.45 and $0.41, respectively. Second quarter same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth were 5.7%, 5.5% and 5.7%, respectively. Second quarter expense growth was elevated due to a higher-than-expected property tax assessment on our 2014 development completion in San Francisco.
Historically, San Francisco has valued developments for tax purposes by using a mix of cost to construct and income capitalization. While we budgeted for a mix that was weighted more towards the income method than precedent would indicate, 100% of the valuation was eventually based on income capitalization.
This unexpected assessment resulted in a charge of $2.2 million during the quarter, $1.1 million of this was attributable to the period that the community was included in our same-store population and was recognized as additional same-store expense during the quarter. The remaining portion of the charge is for real estate taxes, while the community was in lease-up, which can be found in Attachment 5. 
Excluding this negative tax variance, quarterly same-store expense growth for the portfolio in the San Francisco Bay Area would have been 3.4% and 9.9%, respectively, versus the 5.5% and 33.1% realized.
Next, the balance sheet. At quarter end, our liquidity, as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, was $876 million. Our financial leverage on an underappreciated cost basis was 33.2%. 
Based on quarter-end market cap, it was 23.6%, and inclusive of JVs, it was 28.1%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.3x, and inclusive of JVs, was 6.3x. All balance sheet metric improvements were ahead of our strategic plan.
I would like to point out a few changes to our supplemental package. First, you'll note that we have provided additional GAAP metrics in both our release and supplement in response to the recent SEC interpretation regarding GAAP and non-GAAP metrics.
I'd also like to direct you to Attachment 15 or Page 28 of our supplement, where we have updated our full year guidance. We are now providing both our previous and updated guidance for ease of comparison. With that, we have tightened our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance range to $1.76 to $1.80 and tightened and increased our FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance ranges to $1.77 to $1.80 and $1.61 to $1.64, respectively.
A few key items have impacted our original guidance. First, our same-store portfolio is performing in line with original guidance, but our MetLife properties, which are primarily urban A, have underperformed our expectations. This underperformance has been offset by the outperformance of our development lease-ups.
Second, the S&P 500 inclusion trade resulted in some dilution. However, this issuance gave us the flexibility to change the timing of other plan 2016 capital events to offset the majority of the dilution, and ultimately resulted in an improved balance sheet.
Lastly, we expect a reduction on our full year incentive compensation, which is partially offset by higher-than-expected health care costs, resulting in a net reduction to G&A expense of $2 million at the midpoint.
A few other specifics from the page. We increased our sources guidance by $75 million at the midpoint to a range of $650 million to $750 million for the year. This is due to an increase in planned dispositions, which we now anticipate being approximately $400 million for the year.
In addition to the $400 million of sales, we have issued $174 million of common equity with the remainder of our sources coming from secured debt refinancings. We do not anticipate any additional equity issuances through the remainder of the year. 
Our debt maturities increased by $60 million as we have accelerated the accretive prepayment on some existing secured debt to the earliest possible date without penalty. Additionally, we reduced our development, redevelopment and land acquisition guidance by $50 million at the midpoint due to timing as spent, and we increased our acquisition guidance by $100 million in order to satisfy some Section 1031 exchanges that we would like to complete this year. 
For same-store, our full year 2016 guidance remains unchanged with revenue growth of 5.5% to 6%; expense, 3% to 3.5%; and NOI growth of 6.5% to 7%. Average 2016 occupancy remains forecasted at 96.6%. 
Third quarter 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance is $0.44 to $0.46, $0.44 to $0.46 and $0.39 to $0.41, respectively. Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.295 in the second quarter or $1.18 per share when annualized, 6% above 2015's level, which represents a yield of approximately 3.2%. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry."

In my remarks, I will cover the following topics: First, our second quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the rental rate growth we realized this quarter and early results for the third quarter; second, how our primary markers performed during the quarter; and last, a brief update on our development lease-ups. 
We're pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the second quarter, same-store net operating income grew 5.7%. These results were driven by a 5.7% year-over-year increase in revenue against a 5.5% increase in expenses.
Year-to-date, through June 30, we have achieved NOI growth of 6.8%, behind revenue growth of 6% and expense growth of 4.1%. Our same-store revenue per occupied home increased 6% year-over-year to $1,921 per month, while same-store occupancy of 96.6% was down 30 basis points versus the prior year period. 
Total portfolio revenue per occupied home was $2,027 per month, including pro rata JVs. Although we are feeling the impact of new supply in a few of our core markets, namely San Francisco and New York, the positives we see continue to outweigh the negatives: stable job growth; new household formations that are delaying home purchase and choosing to rent; as well as empty nester baby boomers moving to an urban setting with a live, work, play atmosphere. Our portfolio mix benefits from each of these scenarios. 
Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth, which is detailed on Attachment 8G of our supplement. We grew our new lease rates by 4.4% in the second quarter, 330 basis points below the second quarter of 2015. Renewal growth remained robust at 6.3% in the second quarter or 70 basis points behind last year.
On a blended rate basis, we averaged 5.3% during the second quarter, a reduction of 210 basis points versus the same period last year. If you look at the 76% of the same-store portfolio not located in New York and San Francisco, our decline in blended rate growth was only 100 basis points.
I'd like to point out the exceptional growth we achieved in 2015 was an anomaly. We are now back to a normal operating environment. Typically, renewal rate growth outpaces new lease rate growth by at least 100 basis points. Because we were able to drive occupancy in late 2014 to the 96.5% to 97% level, we're able to push new lease rate growth in the peak leasing season in 2015, higher than that of renewal leases. 2016 is proving to be a more normalized year, with renewal growth outpacing new lease rate growth.
While we wish every year could be a strong as 2015, we are very happy with the strength seen in 2016 thus far, especially given that we are currently dealing with peak deliveries in the majority of our markets.
Next, move outs to home purchase were up 150 basis points year-over-year at 14.1%, and even with our strong renewal increases in the second quarter, less than 9% of our move outs gave rent increase as the reason for leaving.
Now moving on to the quarterly performance in our primary markets, which represent 70% of our same-store NOI and 75% of our total NOI. Metro D.C., which represents 19% of our total NOI and 14% of our same-store NOI, posted year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 1.8%, a slight deceleration from first quarter due primarily to very strong bad debt collections in the second quarter of 2015.
We are forecasting the market to generate top line growth in 2016 of between 2% and 3%, as we will continue to benefit from our diverse 50-50 mix of A and B assets located both inside and outside the Beltway.
Our B product outperformed our As during the quarter by 170 basis points, as sporadic supply issues continued to make for choppy results in some infill locations.
Orange County and Los Angeles combined represent 16% of our total NOI and about 17% of our same-store NOI. Orange County posted year-over-year revenue growth of 8.9% with both our As and B's performing well above 8%, and all submarkets remaining very strong as we face very little new supply.
Revenue growth in Los Angeles was 5.2% during the quarter. Our same-store portfolio is primarily concentrated within the Marina del Rey submarket, and is currently facing over 2,000 units of new supply, which we expect will be fully absorbed by year-end. We continue to see good job growth, and the supply picture improving in 2017 for our same-store L.A. portfolio.
New York City, which represents 12% of our total NOI and 13% of same-store NOI, posted 4.6% revenue growth for the quarter. While our same-store properties are not directly affected by any new developments, we are feeling the impact from new supply in the Manhattan market as new lease growth during the quarter was 1.9%. New Yorkers, who typically have been loyal to their preferred neighborhoods, are being enticed by pricing incentives in places like Midtown West.
For full year 2016, we expect New York to have revenue growth in the low 4% range, below our original estimates of approximately 5.5%. San Francisco, which represents about 11% of both our total and same-store NOI, is continuing to feel the effects of new supply in several submarkets, including Southwood market. However, we still expect the Bay Area to be one of our best-performing markets this year with revenue growth between 6% and 7%. 
Same-store revenue growth in the second quarter was 6.3% due to the extremely strong blended rate growth we achieved in the third quarter of 2015. We currently see our portfolio being affected by lease-up pressures through the middle of 2017.
Boston, which represents 7% of our total NOI and about 5% of same-store NOI, produced a strong 6.1% revenue growth during the second quarter. Our suburban assets in the North Shore were our strongest performers with growth over 7.5%. 
Even with new supply downtown, our one same-store asset in the Back Bay posted revenue growth of 4% for the quarter.
The Seaport District, home to our 2015 completion, 100 Pier 4, and the South End District, home to our under construction community, 345 Harrison, continued to see more growth with additional office and retail tenants in the submarket.
Seattle, which represents 6% of our total and same-store NOI, posted strong revenue growth of 8.5% for the quarter. 16% of our portfolio is B product, which posted revenue growth of 12.3%, while our A quality communities produced 6.6% growth. We continue to benefit from the strong growth inherent in these suburban B assets, which are located in submarkets that are less exposed to new supply.
Even with new supply pressure, our Bellevue assets posted revenue growth of 6.8% for the quarter, while revenue growth in downtown Seattle was essentially flat.
Last, Dallas, which represents just over 4% of our total and same-store NOI, posted 5% year-over-year same-store growth in the second quarter. Our B properties had revenue growth that was 500 basis points higher than our As, as having new supply in uptown and along the tollways is impacting rent growth in those submarkets.
While new supply remains elevated, we expect deliveries to decline after this year and are confident they will be absorbed by the strengthened, diversified job market in Dallas.
Our secondary markets, not just Portland, Monterey Peninsula, Florida, Nashville and Austin, which comprise roughly 20% of our portfolio, continue to have strong pricing power due to limited amounts of new supply and robust job growth. Our expectation is that these markets have a long runway of growth due to favorable economics.
July results came in, in line with our plan. As we look ahead to the next 2 months, we see stable pricing power and occupancy. Our 50-50 AB portfolio, located throughout 20 markets, has enabled outperformance in our Sun Belt market, Orange County, Seattle, Boston, Portland and Monterey to offset markets that are being impacted by new supply, namely San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles.
I'll turn now to our 4 in lease-up developments, which you can find on Attachments 9A and 9B or Pages 21 and 22 of our supplement. Our pro rata share of these 4 properties represents over $400 million or roughly 30% of our pipeline, inclusive of the West Coast development joint venture. In total, these properties are performing ahead of plan.
First, 399 Fremont, our 447-home, $318 million 50-50 MetLife JV lease-up in San Francisco, was 50% leased and 43% occupied at quarter end. Today, we are 57% leased and 48% occupied with rents exceeding pro forma. We are currently offering 6 weeks concession as we've begun to see increased competition from other lease-ups in the submarket. Over the last month, we have taken over 30 leases. 
The following 3 communities are all part of the West Coast development joint venture. Katella Grand I, our 399-home, $138 million lease-up in Anaheim, California was 65% leased and 58% occupied at quarter end. And as of today, it's 72% leased and 64% occupied. We are currently offering less than 1 month of concessions at this community, and leasing remains very strong, with about 30 applications per month.
8th & Republican, our 211-home, $97 million lease-up in the South Lake Union submarket of Seattle was 47% leased and 37% occupied at quarter end, and is currently 60% leased and 46% occupied, and we are averaging over 1 application per day.
CityLine, our 244-home, $80 million lease-up in the Columbia City submarket of Seattle was 87% leased and 84% occupied at quarter end. Today, the property is 89% leased and 86% physically occupied.
All in, we had a very strong second quarter, and we remain very positive on the outlook for multifamily fundamentals and our ability to execute throughout the remainder of 2016.
With that, we will open up the call to Q&A. Operator?"

But I think, overall, and we stated this probably for the last 2 to 3 quarters, we would see A's is getting closer to B's probably midyear next year, maybe a little bit after that. And then as you get deeper into '18, I think A's probably start competing more head-to-head with B's. But it's definitely market dependent. For example, I would think in Washington, D.C, we've seen that spread contract and expand multiple times. Last quarter, it was about 50 basis points where B's outperforming. This quarter, we expanded to 1.7, but we do see a slowdown of new supply affecting our product in DC over the next 1.5 years. So I do think A's, because they're in typically better locations, by the second half of next year, should start doing much better there. When you look at a place like New York, it's probably a little more prolonged, call it maybe even 2019 or further, where we see B's continuing to outperform. And in San Francisco, I think it's similar. You're going to see supply continue to affect the market in SoMa and places like that, at least through the middle of next year. And I think that will cause A's to continue to have to go head-to-head against new supply well into '18. So I think San Francisco, New York, Dallas, Austin, it's probably pushed out a bit. But several of the other markets that saw new supply come a little bit earlier, it's shorter. But on average, I'm guessing it gets closer in late '17 and probably pulls even in '18."

And when you look at the -- we anticipated there'd be a deceleration in rate growth that we get this year, and that has happened. And while I'll say, directionally and in total, that reduction was pretty close, we missed on a market-by-market basis. For example, 29% of our portfolio, which is made up of New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, we're missing our numbers. We came into the year thinking San Francisco would be an 8, now we think it's probably going to end up at a 6.5. We thought New York was going to be high 5's, now we think it's going to be low 4's. And Los Angeles, we came in thinking it was going to be call it a 7, and now we think it's going to be mid-5's. What we have that a lot of people don't is the diversified portfolio: 20 markets; we've got the 50-50 split between A, B's and urbans. And what's really helping us is that 42% of our portfolio is performing better than we'd expected coming into the year. So it's offsetting those 3 markets that are doing worse. So those are markets like Seattle, which I think all of us are doing well in right now. Our Orange County portfolio with 8.9% revenue growth in the second quarter is doing exceptionally well. We're doing very well in Boston, where we have predominantly a suburban portfolio in our same-store pool. We held up at about a little north of a 6 revenue there. Our 2 markets in Florida, both Orlando and Tampa, are doing better than we expected. Nashville is on fire right now. And again, we're very suburban B there, so we're not being impacted at all by the new supply. And then you have our Monterey and Portland portfolios that are doing well. So the beauty of our portfolio with that diversification is we're not dependent on a couple of markets doing well or not doing well. We realize that this diversified approach is going to continue to help us in the future because all markets are going to go through their natural cycle. So we'll always have some that are doing better, some that are doing worse. So I think it's really more of the portfolio diversification that's really helping us compared to some others."

I can tell you right now, we look at our model, we're coming in right in the midpoint of guidance. There's a couple of things that could push us through. There's only one thing that could push us to the top end, and that would be -- if we get a significant occupancy pick up, and we have been pushing to drive occupancy a little bit higher over the last month or 2. The thing that could drive us to the bottom is if we see a further deterioration in operating fundamentals. And typically, those would probably have to come with more downside than we projected in really New York and San Francisco, since the other ones have been reacting kind of stable. There's a couple of things though, because I get what you're talking about, we've got a 6 or so in the first half of the year, which would imply second half would be a 5.5%. But there's a few things to keep in mind. This year, so far, we've had 6.3% rent per occupied home growth that's been offset by about a 30 basis point decline in occupancy. We had very difficult occupancy comps in the first half of last year. Our occupancy in the second half of last year decelerated about 20 or 30 bps. Now it was still very high at 96.6%, but it wasn't at 96.8%, 96.9%. Our expectation and what we're shooting for this year is to have a positive spread over last year's occupancy. So we're not going to be losing revenue growth because of an occupancy decline. We're hoping we get a little bit of pick up from that. And then the second thing, just, that's interesting is our fee income is up almost 10% year-over-year, and we would expect that to continue through the second half of the year. And that's really coming partially from lease break fees, people electing to move and relocate for jobs or to buy houses or things like that. And -- but the second part is we started working on an initiative in the second half of last year to drive higher revenues from our parking rent, which was an initiative we began working on, like I said, late last year, but we've got the fruits of it this year, to find a way to increase this under-optimized real estate. So you've got 6% of our your revenue stack coming from fee income that's growing at a much higher rate than my rents. And how optimistic or pessimistic or conservative is our -- is that midpoint? Right now, we've factored in, like I said earlier, that we think the blended rate growth for the second half of the year is going to be low 4's. So again, you're looking at renewal growth in the low 5's and new lease rate growth, maybe right around 3, and that seems, to us, to be pretty sustainable right now."

I think abandoning or changing is probably a little bit of an overstatement. I think what we're doing is constantly weighing our market mix and the price point and what we think cash flow is going to grow at. And so when we think we've a market, for example, where Baltimore has performed in the last 5 years averaging 3% growth, we kind of look out the next 5 years and say, we don't think it's really going to change a whole lot, where else do we think we can redeploy that capital in the enterprise most immediately in the development pipeline? So we're always revisiting our markets. On the balance of 50-50, the A's that we're putting in today, 10 years from now, will be B's. And so I think we'll probably hover around the 50-50, it might go 60-40, but I don't see a long-term directional change in that allocation. I think what ultimately we're trying to build, and have done so far and will continue to refine, is building cash flow, and where we see it can grow the best and concentrated positions create concentrated risk. And so we're always going to have this diversification. We think, over time, it works. Some markets having B's work better than A's. Other cases where we look at jobs and where we think they're coming up in the price point, A's are going to be better. So I think that's the overriding doctrine that we're overall thinking about our capital allocation and decisions. And markets from time to time, Florida is an example right now, talking off-the-cuff, is going to enjoy another couple year run, but the supply will start coming at Florida in the near future, and then we'll look at how we feel about our assets positioned in that market, and whether we should move more capital out of that into other places where opportunities will become available."

Because I think everybody is kind of throwing around different numbers. I would tell you some anecdotal information that's critical to this conversation would be, is what are banks lending on? And what is the bank lending environment? And if you start digging into that with the bankers, you're realizing very rapidly that the terms on construction loans, the pricing on them and the availability is contracting at a rapid pace. And we've seen several large banks just redline and say we're not doing multifamily loans any longer, or throwing up price terms that are prohibitive to make the deals work. So I think you're going to start to see all those construction numbers start really coming down rapidly as people start to get into their construction loan draws, and trying to get their terms and their penciling work. I think it also creates an opportunity for UDR to look at Wolff and Steele-type Creek opportunities that might start becoming available in '17 should this come to fruition. So I would stay very focused on what the supply of money looks like, the terms of that and watch how that ultimately unfolds. I know everybody's numbers are all over the map right now, but what I look at is what are the drivers. And it's not the opportunities, not the fundamentals, those are there, it's the question of capital and the price of that capital and will deals work. And stay focused on that, would be my recommendation for '17."

So we've -- and some are capital expenditures that get us that return. But one is converting common area space, lighting, with LED lighting, which dramatically drops down both your electrical cost as well as the maintenance time people have to spend replacing those light bulbs. And we've seen a reduction in our electric cost this year from doing that. Secondly, package lockers, some people believe in them, some people don't. I will tell you, we do. We've installed well over 40 lockers. We've got another 35, that are being installed right now. And we're doing it for 2 reasons: It's dealing with package management is a huge time suck on our on-site teams, so it opens them up to do more work that makes money for us. And secondly, it's a benefit that residents enjoy to have 24/7 access to pick up their own packages. So we get a little bit of a rent pop from doing that too. And the package lockers have an IRR, when you really look at it, well over 25% to 30%. So financially it makes a lot of sense, but we always do things that the residents want and that typically is good for us. And, what both of those things do, you heard me mention on the LED lights that it takes -- it gives back some time to our maintenance teams. You heard be on the package lockers say that we've been able to give some time back to our leasing agents. And this year, and if you look at our personnel numbers, personnel expense number, you'll see that it's roughly flat for the quarter, we've been able to reduce about 1.5% to 2% of our site headcount this year because of some of these efficiencies that we've been able to do. So those are just a couple of examples, but like Toomey said, we're always looking. There are some that we'll spend a great deal of time on and they don't work, but we're always trying to stretch for the next thing that's going to expand our margins."

And we'll wait and see how the election turns out, and how the economy turns out. But in both of those camps, that's the future will be what it's going to be. So I'm not at all surprised about those 2 markets. We're not surprised about our L.A. exposure, we saw it coming. What we see is this, these are supply-driven numbers that are changing our pricing power. It is not the underlying fundamentals of demographics and/or job markets that are driving our business right now. Those are still in very good shape. And so we're very focused on the supply pressure.

On the call with me today are Shawn Johnston, Interim Principal Financial Officer; and Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.
The second quarter of 2016 was another great quarter for UDR with 8% AFFO growth, driven by strong revenue growth of 5.7% and continued leasing strength in the 400 million developments in lease-up. This is a direct reflection of the continued execution of our strategic plan.
At the core of our strategic plan are 4 elements: First, a focus on cash flow growth for our shareholders through operational excellence, which Jerry will touch on later. Second, an accretive development pipeline that can be fully self-funded. Third, our diverse portfolio mix of 20 markets with A and B communities in urban and suburban locations. And lastly, a safe, low-levered balance sheet.
Combined, these 4 elements are designed to provide the greatest predictability of cash flow growth through a variety of economic cycles. This is reflected in our updated guidance range for the full year, with a midpoint resulting in 8% AFFO growth per share, which Shawn will touch on in his remarks. 
Before I turn the call over to Shawn, I wanted to add a couple of comments on the recent departure of Tom Herzog, our former CFO. While Tom was an exceptional CFO, he left UDR with an impressive bench, and I feel confident in the skills of those in the finance and accounting team to be more than adequate to handle his absence. 
At this time, Shawn Johnston, our Chief Accounting Officer, is serving as our Interim Principal Financial Officer, while we evaluate both internal and external candidates. Shawn is an exceptional candidate for the role, and we are glad to have him serving in his interim capacity now.
With that, I will turn the call over to Shawn for additional comments on the quarter."
310667,370255179,1014797,"UDR, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","UDR, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include our second quarter results, a balance sheet update, and our third quarter and full year guidance update.Our second quarter earnings results were at the top end of our previously provided guidance. FFO,",801,"Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include our second quarter results, a balance sheet update, and our third quarter and full year guidance update.
Our second quarter earnings results were at the top end of our previously provided guidance. FFO, FFO as adjusted, and AFFO per share were $0.44, $0.45 and $0.41, respectively. Second quarter same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth were 5.7%, 5.5% and 5.7%, respectively. Second quarter expense growth was elevated due to a higher-than-expected property tax assessment on our 2014 development completion in San Francisco.
Historically, San Francisco has valued developments for tax purposes by using a mix of cost to construct and income capitalization. While we budgeted for a mix that was weighted more towards the income method than precedent would indicate, 100% of the valuation was eventually based on income capitalization.
This unexpected assessment resulted in a charge of $2.2 million during the quarter, $1.1 million of this was attributable to the period that the community was included in our same-store population and was recognized as additional same-store expense during the quarter. The remaining portion of the charge is for real estate taxes, while the community was in lease-up, which can be found in Attachment 5. 
Excluding this negative tax variance, quarterly same-store expense growth for the portfolio in the San Francisco Bay Area would have been 3.4% and 9.9%, respectively, versus the 5.5% and 33.1% realized.
Next, the balance sheet. At quarter end, our liquidity, as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, was $876 million. Our financial leverage on an underappreciated cost basis was 33.2%. 
Based on quarter-end market cap, it was 23.6%, and inclusive of JVs, it was 28.1%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.3x, and inclusive of JVs, was 6.3x. All balance sheet metric improvements were ahead of our strategic plan.
I would like to point out a few changes to our supplemental package. First, you'll note that we have provided additional GAAP metrics in both our release and supplement in response to the recent SEC interpretation regarding GAAP and non-GAAP metrics.
I'd also like to direct you to Attachment 15 or Page 28 of our supplement, where we have updated our full year guidance. We are now providing both our previous and updated guidance for ease of comparison. With that, we have tightened our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance range to $1.76 to $1.80 and tightened and increased our FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance ranges to $1.77 to $1.80 and $1.61 to $1.64, respectively.
A few key items have impacted our original guidance. First, our same-store portfolio is performing in line with original guidance, but our MetLife properties, which are primarily urban A, have underperformed our expectations. This underperformance has been offset by the outperformance of our development lease-ups.
Second, the S&P 500 inclusion trade resulted in some dilution. However, this issuance gave us the flexibility to change the timing of other plan 2016 capital events to offset the majority of the dilution, and ultimately resulted in an improved balance sheet.
Lastly, we expect a reduction on our full year incentive compensation, which is partially offset by higher-than-expected health care costs, resulting in a net reduction to G&A expense of $2 million at the midpoint.
A few other specifics from the page. We increased our sources guidance by $75 million at the midpoint to a range of $650 million to $750 million for the year. This is due to an increase in planned dispositions, which we now anticipate being approximately $400 million for the year.
In addition to the $400 million of sales, we have issued $174 million of common equity with the remainder of our sources coming from secured debt refinancings. We do not anticipate any additional equity issuances through the remainder of the year. 
Our debt maturities increased by $60 million as we have accelerated the accretive prepayment on some existing secured debt to the earliest possible date without penalty. Additionally, we reduced our development, redevelopment and land acquisition guidance by $50 million at the midpoint due to timing as spent, and we increased our acquisition guidance by $100 million in order to satisfy some Section 1031 exchanges that we would like to complete this year. 
For same-store, our full year 2016 guidance remains unchanged with revenue growth of 5.5% to 6%; expense, 3% to 3.5%; and NOI growth of 6.5% to 7%. Average 2016 occupancy remains forecasted at 96.6%. 
Third quarter 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance is $0.44 to $0.46, $0.44 to $0.46 and $0.39 to $0.41, respectively. Finally, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.295 in the second quarter or $1.18 per share when annualized, 6% above 2015's level, which represents a yield of approximately 3.2%. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jerry."

In my remarks, I will cover the following topics: First, our second quarter portfolio metrics, leasing trends and the rental rate growth we realized this quarter and early results for the third quarter; second, how our primary markers performed during the quarter; and last, a brief update on our development lease-ups. 
We're pleased to announce another strong quarter of operating results. In the second quarter, same-store net operating income grew 5.7%. These results were driven by a 5.7% year-over-year increase in revenue against a 5.5% increase in expenses.
Year-to-date, through June 30, we have achieved NOI growth of 6.8%, behind revenue growth of 6% and expense growth of 4.1%. Our same-store revenue per occupied home increased 6% year-over-year to $1,921 per month, while same-store occupancy of 96.6% was down 30 basis points versus the prior year period. 
Total portfolio revenue per occupied home was $2,027 per month, including pro rata JVs. Although we are feeling the impact of new supply in a few of our core markets, namely San Francisco and New York, the positives we see continue to outweigh the negatives: stable job growth; new household formations that are delaying home purchase and choosing to rent; as well as empty nester baby boomers moving to an urban setting with a live, work, play atmosphere. Our portfolio mix benefits from each of these scenarios. 
Turning to new and renewal lease rate growth, which is detailed on Attachment 8G of our supplement. We grew our new lease rates by 4.4% in the second quarter, 330 basis points below the second quarter of 2015. Renewal growth remained robust at 6.3% in the second quarter or 70 basis points behind last year.
On a blended rate basis, we averaged 5.3% during the second quarter, a reduction of 210 basis points versus the same period last year. If you look at the 76% of the same-store portfolio not located in New York and San Francisco, our decline in blended rate growth was only 100 basis points.
I'd like to point out the exceptional growth we achieved in 2015 was an anomaly. We are now back to a normal operating environment. Typically, renewal rate growth outpaces new lease rate growth by at least 100 basis points. Because we were able to drive occupancy in late 2014 to the 96.5% to 97% level, we're able to push new lease rate growth in the peak leasing season in 2015, higher than that of renewal leases. 2016 is proving to be a more normalized year, with renewal growth outpacing new lease rate growth.
While we wish every year could be a strong as 2015, we are very happy with the strength seen in 2016 thus far, especially given that we are currently dealing with peak deliveries in the majority of our markets.
Next, move outs to home purchase were up 150 basis points year-over-year at 14.1%, and even with our strong renewal increases in the second quarter, less than 9% of our move outs gave rent increase as the reason for leaving.
Now moving on to the quarterly performance in our primary markets, which represent 70% of our same-store NOI and 75% of our total NOI. Metro D.C., which represents 19% of our total NOI and 14% of our same-store NOI, posted year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 1.8%, a slight deceleration from first quarter due primarily to very strong bad debt collections in the second quarter of 2015.
We are forecasting the market to generate top line growth in 2016 of between 2% and 3%, as we will continue to benefit from our diverse 50-50 mix of A and B assets located both inside and outside the Beltway.
Our B product outperformed our As during the quarter by 170 basis points, as sporadic supply issues continued to make for choppy results in some infill locations.
Orange County and Los Angeles combined represent 16% of our total NOI and about 17% of our same-store NOI. Orange County posted year-over-year revenue growth of 8.9% with both our As and Bs performing well above 8%, and all submarkets remaining very strong as we face very little new supply.
Revenue growth in Los Angeles was 5.2% during the quarter. Our same-store portfolio is primarily concentrated within the Marina del Rey submarket, and is currently facing over 2,000 units of new supply, which we expect will be fully absorbed by year-end. We continue to see good job growth, and the supply picture improving in 2017 for our same-store L.A. portfolio.
New York City, which represents 12% of our total NOI and 13% of same-store NOI, posted 4.6% revenue growth for the quarter. While our same-store properties are not directly affected by any new developments, we are feeling the impact from new supply in the Manhattan market as new lease growth during the quarter was 1.9%. New Yorkers, who typically have been loyal to their preferred neighborhoods, are being enticed by pricing incentives in places like Midtown West.
For full year 2016, we expect New York to have revenue growth in the low 4% range, below our original estimates of approximately 5.5%. San Francisco, which represents about 11% of both our total and same-store NOI, is continuing to feel the effects of new supply in several submarkets, including Southwood market. However, we still expect the Bay Area to be one of our best-performing markets this year with revenue growth between 6% and 7%. 
Same-store revenue growth in the second quarter was 6.3% due to the extremely strong blended rate growth we achieved in the third quarter of 2015. We currently see our portfolio being affected by lease-up pressures through the middle of 2017.
Boston, which represents 7% of our total NOI and about 5% of same-store NOI, produced a strong 6.1% revenue growth during the second quarter. Our suburban assets in the North Shore were our strongest performers with growth over 7.5%. 
Even with new supply downtown, our one same-store asset in the Back Bay posted revenue growth of 4% for the quarter.
The Seaport District, home to our 2015 completion, 100 Pier 4, and the South End District, home to our under construction community, 345 Harrison, continued to see more growth with additional office and retail tenants in the submarket.
Seattle, which represents 6% of our total and same-store NOI, posted strong revenue growth of 8.5% for the quarter. 16% of our portfolio is B product, which posted revenue growth of 12.3%, while our A quality communities produced 6.6% growth. We continue to benefit from the strong growth inherent in these suburban B assets, which are located in submarkets that are less exposed to new supply.
Even with new supply pressure, our Bellevue assets posted revenue growth of 6.8% for the quarter, while revenue growth in downtown Seattle was essentially flat.
Last, Dallas, which represents just over 4% of our total and same-store NOI, posted 5% year-over-year same-store growth in the second quarter. Our B properties had revenue growth that was 500 basis points higher than our As, as having new supply in uptown and along the tollways is impacting rent growth in those submarkets.
While new supply remains elevated, we expect deliveries to decline after this year and are confident they will be absorbed by the strengthened, diversified job market in Dallas.
Our secondary markets, not just Portland, Monterey Peninsula, Florida, Nashville and Austin, which comprise roughly 20% of our portfolio, continue to have strong pricing power due to limited amounts of new supply and robust job growth. Our expectation is that these markets have a long runway of growth due to favorable economics.
July results came in, in line with our plan. As we look ahead to the next 2 months, we see stable pricing power and occupancy. Our 50-50 AB portfolio, located throughout 20 markets, has enabled outperformance in our Sun Belt market, Orange County, Seattle, Boston, Portland and Monterey to offset markets that are being impacted by new supply, namely San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles.
I'll turn now to our 4 in lease-up developments, which you can find on Attachments 9A and 9B or Pages 21 and 22 of our supplement. Our pro rata share of these 4 properties represents over $400 million or roughly 30% of our pipeline, inclusive of the West Coast development joint venture. In total, these properties are performing ahead of plan.
First, 399 Fremont, our 447-home, $318 million 50-50 MetLife JV lease-up in San Francisco, was 50% leased and 43% occupied at quarter end. Today, we are 57% leased and 48% occupied with rents exceeding pro forma. We are currently offering 6 weeks concession as we've begun to see increased competition from other lease-ups in the submarket. Over the last month, we have taken over 30 leases. 
The following 3 communities are all part of the West Coast development joint venture. Katella Grand I, our 399-home, $138 million lease-up in Anaheim, California was 65% leased and 58% occupied at quarter end. And as of today, it's 72% leased and 64% occupied. We are currently offering less than 1 month of concessions at this community, and leasing remains very strong, with about 30 applications per month.
8th & Republican, our 211-home, $97 million lease-up in the South Lake Union submarket of Seattle was 47% leased and 37% occupied at quarter end, and is currently 60% leased and 46% occupied, and we are averaging over 1 application per day.
CityLine, our 244-home, $80 million lease-up in the Columbia City submarket of Seattle was 87% leased and 84% occupied at quarter end. Today, the property is 89% leased and 86% physically occupied.
All in, we had a very strong second quarter, and we remain very positive on the outlook for multifamily fundamentals and our ability to execute throughout the remainder of 2016.

But I think, overall, and we stated this probably for the last 2 to 3 quarters, we would see As is getting closer to Bs probably midyear next year, maybe a little bit after that. And then as you get deeper into '18, I think As probably start competing more head-to-head with Bs. But it's definitely market dependent. For example, I would think in Washington, D.C, we've seen that spread contract and expand multiple times. Last quarter, it was about 50 basis points where Bs outperforming. This quarter, we expanded to 1.7, but we do see a slowdown of new supply affecting our product in DC over the next 1.5 years. So I do think As, because they're in typically better locations, by the second half of next year, should start doing much better there. When you look at a place like New York, it's probably a little more prolonged, call it maybe even 2019 or further, where we see Bs continuing to outperform. And in San Francisco, I think it's similar. You're going to see supply continue to affect the market in SoMa and places like that, at least through the middle of next year. And I think that will cause As to continue to have to go head-to-head against new supply well into '18. So I think San Francisco, New York, Dallas, Austin, it's probably pushed out a bit. But several of the other markets that saw new supply come a little bit earlier, it's shorter. But on average, I'm guessing it gets closer in late '17 and probably pulls even in '18."

For example, 29% of our portfolio, which is made up of New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, we're missing our numbers. We came into the year thinking San Francisco would be an 8, now we think it's probably going to end up at a 6.5. We thought New York was going to be high 5s, now we think it's going to be low 4s. And Los Angeles, we came in thinking it was going to be call it a 7, and now we think it's going to be mid-5s. What we have that a lot of people don't is the diversified portfolio: 20 markets; we've got the 50-50 split between A, Bs and urbans. And what's really helping us is that 42% of our portfolio is performing better than we'd expected coming into the year. So it's offsetting those 3 markets that are doing worse. So those are markets like Seattle, which I think all of us are doing well in right now. Our Orange County portfolio with 8.9% revenue growth in the second quarter is doing exceptionally well. We're doing very well in Boston, where we have predominantly a suburban portfolio in our same-store pool. We held up at about a little north of a 6 revenue there. Our 2 markets in Florida, both Orlando and Tampa, are doing better than we expected. Nashville is on fire right now. And again, we're very suburban B there, so we're not being impacted at all by the new supply. And then you have our Monterey and Portland portfolios that are doing well. So the beauty of our portfolio with that diversification is we're not dependent on a couple of markets doing well or not doing well. We realize that this diversified approach is going to continue to help us in the future because all markets are going to go through their natural cycle. So we'll always have some that are doing better, some that are doing worse. So I think it's really more of the portfolio diversification that's really helping us compared to some others."

I can tell you right now, we look at our model, we're coming in right in the midpoint of guidance. There's a couple of things that could push us through. There's only one thing that could push us to the top end, and that would be -- if we get a significant occupancy pick up, and we have been pushing to drive occupancy a little bit higher over the last month or 2. The thing that could drive us to the bottom is if we see a further deterioration in operating fundamentals. And typically, those would probably have to come with more downside than we projected in really New York and San Francisco, since the other ones have been reacting kind of stable. There's a couple of things though, because I get what you're talking about, we've got a 6 or so in the first half of the year, which would imply second half would be a 5.5%. But there's a few things to keep in mind. This year, so far, we've had 6.3% rent per occupied home growth that's been offset by about a 30 basis point decline in occupancy. We had very difficult occupancy comps in the first half of last year. Our occupancy in the second half of last year decelerated about 20 or 30 bps. Now it was still very high at 96.6%, but it wasn't at 96.8%, 96.9%. Our expectation and what we're shooting for this year is to have a positive spread over last year's occupancy. So we're not going to be losing revenue growth because of an occupancy decline. We're hoping we get a little bit of pick up from that. And then the second thing, just, that's interesting is our fee income is up almost 10% year-over-year, and we would expect that to continue through the second half of the year. And that's really coming partially from lease break fees, people electing to move and relocate for jobs or to buy houses or things like that. And -- but the second part is we started working on an initiative in the second half of last year to drive higher revenues from our parking rent, which was an initiative we began working on, like I said, late last year, but we've got the fruits of it this year, to find a way to increase this under-optimized real estate. So you've got 6% of our your revenue stack coming from fee income that's growing at a much higher rate than my rents. And how optimistic or pessimistic or conservative is our -- is that midpoint? Right now, we've factored in, like I said earlier, that we think the blended rate growth for the second half of the year is going to be low 4s. So again, you're looking at renewal growth in the low 5s and new lease rate growth, maybe right around 3, and that seems, to us, to be pretty sustainable right now."

I think what we're doing is constantly weighing our market mix and the price point and what we think cash flow is going to grow at. And so when we think we've a market, for example, where Baltimore has performed in the last 5 years averaging 3% growth, we kind of look out the next 5 years and say, we don't think it's really going to change a whole lot, where else do we think we can redeploy that capital in the enterprise most immediately in the development pipeline? So we're always revisiting our markets. On the balance of 50-50, the As that we're putting in today, 10 years from now, will be Bs. And so I think we'll probably hover around the 50-50, it might go 60-40, but I don't see a long-term directional change in that allocation. I think what ultimately we're trying to build, and have done so far and will continue to refine, is building cash flow, and where we see it can grow the best and concentrated positions create concentrated risk. And so we're always going to have this diversification. We think, over time, it works. Some markets having Bs work better than As. Other cases where we look at jobs and where we think they're coming up in the price point, As are going to be better. So I think that's the overriding doctrine that we're overall thinking about our capital allocation and decisions. And markets from time to time, Florida is an example right now, talking off-the-cuff, is going to enjoy another couple year run, but the supply will start coming at Florida in the near future, and then we'll look at how we feel about our assets positioned in that market, and whether we should move more capital out of that into other places where opportunities will become available."

I think when you look at the other Sun Belts, Orlando and Tampa, I think you're going to see Orlando turn back around. What happened in the quarter, second quarter, is we probably got a bit aggressive on renewal growth where we were popping out 7.9%, and that opened the backdoor a little, put a little pressure on occupancy levels and we had to cut new lease rate growth to get occupancy back up. Our occupancy in Orlando today is 97.1%, that compares to an average of 96.5% during the second quarter. And we've seen new lease rate growth in the month of July jump back up to 6.6% compared to the 4.9% that we reported in 2Q. So I think Orlando feels good. And then Tampa just feels stable. We've had a few lease ups in a submarket of Tampa that's affected us and I think they're starting to stabilize now, and I think our numbers will too."

Because I think everybody is kind of throwing around different numbers. I would tell you some anecdotal information that's critical to this conversation would be, is what are banks lending on? And what is the bank lending environment? And if you start digging into that with the bankers, you're realizing very rapidly that the terms on construction loans, the pricing on them and the availability is contracting at a rapid pace. And we've seen several large banks just redline and say we're not doing multifamily loans any longer, or throwing up price terms that are prohibitive to make the deals work. So I think you're going to start to see all those construction numbers start really coming down rapidly as people start to get into their construction loan draws, and trying to get their terms and their penciling work. I think it also creates an opportunity for UDR to look at Wolff and Steele-type Creek opportunities that might start becoming available in '17 should this come to fruition. So I would stay very focused on what the supply of money looks like, the terms of that and watch how that ultimately unfolds. I know everybody's numbers are all over the map right now, but what I look at is what are the drivers. And it's not the opportunities, not the fundamentals, those are there, it's the question of capital and the price of that capital and will deals work.

So we've -- and some are capital expenditures that get us that return. But one is converting common area space, lighting, with LED lighting, which dramatically drops down both your electrical cost as well as the maintenance time people have to spend replacing those light bulbs. And we've seen a reduction in our electric cost this year from doing that. Secondly, package lockers, some people believe in them, some people don't. I will tell you, we do. We've installed well over 40 lockers. We've got another 35, that are being installed right now. And we're doing it for 2 reasons: It's dealing with package management is a huge time suck on our on-site teams, so it opens them up to do more work that makes money for us. And secondly, it's a benefit that residents enjoy to have 24/7 access to pick up their own packages. So we get a little bit of a rent pop from doing that too. And the package lockers have an IRR, when you really look at it, well over 25% to 30%. So financially it makes a lot of sense, but we always do things that the residents want and that typically is good for us. And what both of those things do, you heard me mention on the LED lights that it takes -- it gives back some time to our maintenance teams. You heard be on the package lockers say that we've been able to give some time back to our leasing agents. And this year, and if you look at our personnel numbers, personnel expense number, you'll see that it's roughly flat for the quarter, we've been able to reduce about 1.5% to 2% of our site headcount this year because of some of these efficiencies that we've been able to do. So those are just a couple of examples, but like Toomey said, we're always looking. There are some that we'll spend a great deal of time on and they don't work, but we're always trying to stretch for the next thing that's going to expand our margins."

And we'll wait and see how the election turns out, and how the economy turns out. But in both of those camps, that's the future will be what it's going to be. So I'm not at all surprised about those 2 markets. We're not surprised about our L.A. exposure, we saw it coming. What we see is this, these are supply-driven numbers that are changing our pricing power. It is not the underlying fundamentals of demographics and/or job markets that are driving our business right now. Those are still in very good shape. And so we're very focused on the supply pressure. And I think we have a very good handle on it, feel good about the way we're running the business to deal with that supply. When it abates, we think we're back to guns on pricing and we'll do very well in that environment."

Welcome to UDR's third quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer; and Shawn Johnston, Interim Principal Financial Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.
UDR reported another strong quarter of results, highlighted by solid same-store and cash flow growth, strong leasing velocities in rental rates at our development communities, several strategic transactions and continued improvement of our balance sheet. Jerry and Shawn will provide additional details in their prepared remarks.
As we near the end of 2016, I'd like to take a couple of minutes to discuss our strategic plan and how we've executed on it. As you know, consistently generating 6% to 10% cash flow per share growth has been the cornerstone of our plan since it was first published in 2013. In 2016, we expect to again achieve that goal with full-year AFFO per share growth of approximately 8%, at the midpoint of our guidance.
Next, a deeper look into how the primary drivers of our cash flow growth have performed. First, operations. We expect that our full year 2016 same-store growth metrics will compare well on an absolute and relative basis, in spite of the headwinds that New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles generated this year. We have successfully weathered this storm and continued to do so, partly because of our diversified portfolio, but much of our success stems from our operating platform.
Starting with the team's ability to quickly adjust operating tactics to maximize revenue growth in a shifting market as well as a consistent implementation of innovative technologies. I'm grateful for our team's hard work.
Next, capital allocations. We delivered $163 million of accretive development in 2016 and believe that our $937 million under construction pipeline will be no different. Our development pipeline provides our shareholders with a strong risk adjusted return on their capital and allows us to consistently refresh our portfolio via our self-funding model.
Fully funding our development growth in a non-dilutive manner through retained cash flow and capital recycled from asset sales is a funding mechanism that we can employ year in and year out.
Moving forward, we remained comfortable with this strategy. Last, our balance sheet continues to improve. Our leverage metrics at the end of the third quarter were better than those originally envisioned for the year ended 2016.
As we look into 2017 and without providing guidance, we remain confident in our ability to execute on our strategic plan. Currently, we are in the midst of building the 2017-'18 plan from the ground up. We see no need to change our strategies, as they continue to work well as we move through this part of the business cycle. We will share the updated details of the plan with you on the fourth quarter call.
In summary, while 2016 has presented challenges, we have successfully worked through them and will achieve the guidance provided at the beginning of the year as part of our strategic plan. Given the outlook for sound intermediate and long-term multifamily fundamentals, we remain confident that adhering to our strategic plan's core principles will continue to help us drive strong cash flow growth for many years to come.
With that, I will turn the call over to Jerry for additional comments on the quarter."
310667,403302013,1061906,"UDR, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","UDR, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to announce another quarter of strong operating results. During the third quarter, year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI growth were 5.3% and 6.4%, respectively.

During the third quarter, year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI growth were 5.3% and 6.4%, respectively. On a year-to-date basis, same-store revenue and NOI growth totaled 5.9% and 6.9%, respectively.
During the third quarter, operating transferred or normalized [ph] as compared to 2015, when the majority of markets were accelerating. Localized demand/supply dynamics today are creating strength in some markets and weakness in others. Making up 45% of our NOI, strength was evident in Seattle, Orange County, the Monterey Peninsula, Boston and our Sun Belt markets. [ph] While New York City, the Bay area and Los Angeles, which comprised 28% of our NOI, remains challenging due to concentrated new supply and concessions.
Overall, our highly diversified portfolio is defined by market mix, price point and location within markets, the theater perform well during the quarter, [ph][ph] and we expect will generate growth that compares favorably versus the multifamily group average over the foreseeable future.
Turning to operating tactics. As you know, driving rate growth was our primary focus over the past 2 to 3 years. This approach was successful, largely as a result of the robust multifamily fundamentals present throughout the majority of our markets and evidenced by our cumulative same-store revenue growth of 16% between 2013 and 2015.
As 2016 has progressed, diminished pricing power due to concentrated new supply caused us to reevaluate this tactic. Towards the end of the second quarter, we made a change, pivoting our operating tactics to favor higher occupancy over rate growth in markets that were more challenged by new supply. Higher occupancy in select markets prior to the seasonally slower fourth and first quarters, when few of our leases expire, is a more prudent approach to maximizing revenue and cash flow growth in the current environment. This strategic shift [ph] with third quarter occupancy averaging 96.8%, a 20 basis point sequential increase. We will operate the portfolio in the high 96% range through at least the end of this year.
With regard to the prime leasing season, 2016 results were clearly not as robust as those realized in 2015 but still compared favorably versus historical standards. For the third quarter, portfolio-wide new lease and renewal growth totaled 2.7% and 5.6%.
We continue to see minimal pressure from single-family competition with move-outs [ph] to home purchase totaling 13% during the third quarter. A lack of affordability is also not meaningfully affecting us as portfolio-wide move-outs due to rent increases remains relatively constrained at 7%. Net bad debt remains at 0.1% of rents, at levels consistent with that of third quarter 2015.
Next, forward expectations. Without providing 2017 guidance, we are projecting a revenue earn in [ph] of about 2% going into 2017 versus the 2.75% earn in that was baked into the beginning of 2016. Directionally, we continue to expect deceleration in 2017 same-store growth metrics as elevated new supply is further absorbed in some of our higher rent markets.
With that being said, next year is still expected to look good when compared against our long-term 15-year revenue growth average of about 3%. We will provide detailed 2017 guidance and an update to our 2-year strategic plan on our fourth quarter call.
Now moving on to the quarterly performance at our largest markets, which represents 72% of our total NOI. Metro D.C., [ph] which contributes 19% of our total NOI, continues to incrementally improve. Job growth is gaining steam versus a couple of years ago, though new supply remains persistent in some infill locations. We expect our highly diversified DC [ph] portfolio to see continuing improvement throughout 2017.
Orange County and Los Angeles contributed 16.5% of our total NOI. Orange County has been one of our strongest markets in 2016, primarily because our portfolio is concentrated west of the 405 Freeway [ph] and has benefited from good job growth set against limited new supply.
Conversely, Los Angeles has struggled this year due to significant new supply in excess of concessions hitting our highly concentrated Marina del Rey [ph] portfolio. This pressure is now subsiding, and we expect pricing power in L.A. to improve in 2017 and for Orange County to remain stable.
New York City makes up 12% of our total NOI, and it continues to struggle due to concentrated new supply at Midtown West [ph] as well as Brooklyn and excessive concessions. Given the glot [ph] of building permits issued prior to 421(a)s [ph] expiring, we expect that driving meaningful growth in Manhattan will be problematic through at least 2018.
Like New York City, San Francisco, which contributes about 12% of our total NOI, continues to be negatively affected by supply, especially south of Market Street. [ph] Expect [ph] the 2016 job growth of 2.9% still looks good versus long-term averages but has decelerated from 2015's 4.5% growth rate.
Our data providers indicate that supply pressures shed some slides [ph] in the city as we move into the second half of 2017, at which time pricing power should improve.
Boston, which contributes 7% of our total NOI, has held up well, largely due to our suburban B [ph] exposure. On a relative basis, our downtown and back B [ph] communities have also outperformed due primarily to their differentiated characteristics. Boston continues to look like a good market for us going forward.
Seattle contributes 6% of our total NOI. It remains UDR's strongest core market on the West Coast. The NSA's [ph] relatively higher affordability, strong [indiscernible] jobs and urban renewal continued to attract educated, tech savvy residents. We expect that Seattle will continue to put up good numbers moving forward, although we are keeping our eye on near-term Bellevue [ph] supply as that submarket further transforms.
Our secondary markets, such as Portland, Monterey Peninsula, Florida, Asheville and Austin, [ph] comprise roughly 25% of our portfolio. Pricing power remained strong in the majority of these markets and continues to help offset the relative weakness in some of our higher rent coastal locales. [ph] Move-outs to home purchase remained constrained, and our expectation is that these markets have a long runway for growth due to continued favorable multifamily fundamentals.
Last, our development lease-ups continued to perform well, achieving rates above original expectations and with leasing velocities ahead of original forecast. Thus far, in October, these trends have remained firm, and our development pipeline remains highly accretive than the average value creation spread in excess of the top end of our targeted 150 to 200 basis point range. Community specific quarter end lease-up statistics are available on Attachment 9 or Page 21 [ph] of our supplement.
Summing it up, we've had another good quarter, proactively pivoted our strategy to maximize revenue growth and remained [ph] positive on the outlook for multifamily fundamentals and our ability to execute throughout the remainder of 2016 and into 2017.
With that, I'll turn it over to Shawn."

The topics I will cover today include our third quarter results, a transactions update, a capital markets and balance sheet update and our fourth quarter and full year guidance.
Our third quarter earnings results were at the mid- to high end of our previously provided guidance. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.46, $0.45 and $0.41, driven by solid same-store revenue expense and NOI growth of 5.3%, 2.5% and 6.4%, respectively.
Next, transactions. We are under contract to sell 7 communities in Baltimore [ph] and 1 community in Dallas for $285 million. We expect to close these transactions in the fourth quarter at a cash flow cap rate of approximately 6% and a weighted average IRR of 13%. We also completed a series of strategic transactions with MetLife [ph] that further simplified our joint venture.
First, we completed a swap of our land interest in 3 development sites where we acquired MetLife's [ph] 95% interest in a land site located in Dublin, California [ph] in exchange for our 5% weighted average ownership interest in 2 land sites located in Bellevue, Washington and Los Angeles California. The Dublin site is within walking distance of the Bay area [indiscernible] and provides the opportunity to develop a differentiated product in that submarket.
Next, UDR-MetLife [ph] joint venture sold 100% of [indiscernible], a high-rise community located in Dallas, to an unrelated third party for approximately $75 million at a cash flow cap rate in the mid-4 [ph] and an IRR of 10%.
Subsequent to quarter end, we also acquired MetLife's 50% ownership interest in Ashton Bellevue and 10 20, [ph] 2 adjacent highrise communities located in Bellevue, Washington, for $68 million plus the assumption of $38 million of debt, at a cash flow cap rate in the mid-4s. We know both of these assets well. They complement our other assets in the Bellevue submarket, and we like the long-term prospects as more established tech companies continue to create a presence on the east side of Metro Seattle.[ph] 
After accounting for joint venture refinancings, these MetLife transactions were net cash positive to the company by approximately $14 million and reduce the size of the UDR-MetLife joint venture by approximately 10% or $355 million.
Next, capital markets. During the third quarter, we issued $300 million of 10-year unsecured notes priced at 2.95%. $158 million of the proceeds were used to prepay 2017 debt maturities with an average interest rate of 5.61%. The majority of the remaining proceeds were used to pay down our [ph] revolver.
With the prepayment of the 2017 debt, next year's maturities now total only $71 million. Development will likely represent our largest use of capital in 2017. We will continue to self-fund our accretive development pipeline via retained earnings and asset sales, and we'll provide a detailed update of our 2017 sources and uses on the fourth quarter call.
As a result of the unsecured offering, our weighted average maturities increased by nearly half a year to 5.3 years and improved our near-term liquidity by approximately $140 million. At quarter end, our liquidity, as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, was $931 million. Our financial leverage on an undepreciated cost basis was 33.5%. Based on quarter end market cap, it was 24.4%, and inclusive of joint ventures, it was 29%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.3x and inclusive of joint ventures was 6.4x. All balance sheet metrics continue to track ahead of our strategic outlook.
I would now like to direct you to Attachment 15 or Page 28 of our supplement, where we have updated our full year guidance. We have tightened and increased our full year 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance ranges to $1.77 to $1.80, $1.78 to $1.80 and $1.62 to $1.64, respectively, by increasing the bottom end of the range by $0.01.
For same-store, our full year 2016 guidance remains unchanged with revenue growth of 5.5% to 6%, expense growth of 3% to 3.5% and NOI growth of 6.5% to 7%. Average 2016 forecasted occupancy is unchanged at 96.6%.
Fourth quarter 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance is $0.44 to $0.46, $0.45 to $0.47 and $0.39 to $0.41, respectively.
Next, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.295 in the third quarter or a $1.18 when annualized. This is 6% above 2015's level and represents a yield of approximately 3.3% as of quarter end.
Finally, a housekeeping item. We moved and consolidated our preferred equity investments and participating loan information and economics to a new attachment, 12B.

When you look at it, there's 5 cities in Northern California that are bringing forth some rent-controlled issues to the ballots. There's 2 markets, where were located that are bringing it, San Mateo and Mountain View. We really only have 3 properties that constitute about 2.5% of that was you that target to be affected by it. It's only for pre-1995 built assets that would still be the rent-controlled with range from 1% to 5% on increases. I'd say the California Department of Associates has been finding it pretty strongly and thanks for the probability of passages probably limited, but we'll have to wait and see. But right now, I can tell you over the next year or so, I don't think those up to 5% on increases would make much of a difference.

And Harry, you can talk what you do with the valuations?
Sure. Sort of really dealt with this type of issue was in New York City, where you have rent stabilization. And I can tell you I answered a couple of different ways. One, the short term that will have probably a slight negative impact on value where the absolute rent growth in the near term will be slightly lower because you do have these phase cap on increases. However, the way you look at it over the long term is truly a timing issue that typically you have vacancy B control. So over time, you capture those sort of embedded shortfalls as your tendency turns over.
In the long term, if you get say 5 years into a rent-controlled program, these assets actually traded lower cap rates because of the embedded upside that exist on the [indiscernible]  so that you have a certain number of units that are well below sort of market rent. You shoot that over time, this really on the actuarial basis, you're going to get 5 or 10 or 15% of those assets or those units to turn over in our able to capture that upside."

Welcome to UDR's third quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer; and Shawn Johnston, Interim Principal Financial Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.
UDR reported another strong quarter of results, highlighted by solid same-store and cash flow growth, strong leasing velocities in rental rates at our development communities, several strategic transactions and continued improvement of our balance sheet. Jerry and Shawn will provide additional details in their prepared remarks.
As we near the end of 2016, I'd like to take a couple of minutes to discuss our strategic plan and how we've executed on it. As you know, consistently generating 6% to 10% cash flow per share growth has been the cornerstone of our plan since it was first published in 2013. In 2016, we expect to again achieve that goal with full-year AFFO per share growth of approximately 8%, at the midpoint of our guidance.
Next, a deeper look into how the primary drivers of our cash flow growth have performed. First, operations. We expect that our full year 2016 same-store growth metrics will compare well on an absolute and relative basis, in spite of the headwinds that New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles generated this year. We have successfully weathered this storm and continued to do so, partly because of our diversified portfolio, but much of our success stems from our operating platform.
Starting with the team's ability to quickly adjust operating tactics to maximize revenue growth in a shifting market as well as a consistent implementation of innovative technologies. I'm grateful for our team's hard work.
Next, capital allocations. We delivered $163 million of accretive development in 2016 and believe that our $937 million under construction pipeline will be no different. Our development pipeline provides our shareholders with a strong risk adjusted return on their capital and allows us to consistently refresh our portfolio via our self-funding model.
Fully funding our development growth in a non-dilutive manner through retained cash flow and capital recycled from asset sales is a funding mechanism that we can employ year in and year out.
Moving forward, we remained comfortable with this strategy. Last, our balance sheet continues to improve. Our leverage metrics at the end of the third quarter were better than those originally envisioned for the year ended 2016.
As we look into 2017 and without providing guidance, we remain confident in our ability to execute on our strategic plan. Currently, we are in the midst of building the 2017-'18 plan from the ground up. We see no need to change our strategies, as they continue to work well as we move through this part of the business cycle. We will share the updated details of the plan with you on the fourth quarter call.
In summary, while 2016 has presented challenges, we have successfully worked through them and will achieve the guidance provided at the beginning of the year as part of our strategic plan. Given the outlook for sound intermediate and long-term multifamily fundamentals, we remain confident that adhering to our strategic plan's core principles will continue to help us drive strong cash flow growth for many years to come.
With that, I will turn the call over to Jerry for additional comments on the quarter."
310667,403302013,1062016,"UDR, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","UDR, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to announce another quarter of strong operating results. During the third quarter, year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI growth were 5.3% and 6.4%, respectively.

During the third quarter, year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI growth were 5.3% and 6.4%, respectively. On a year-to-date basis, same-store revenue and NOI growth totaled 5.9% and 6.9%, respectively.
During the third quarter, operating trends further normalized as compared to 2015, when the majority of markets were accelerating. Localized demand/supply dynamics today are creating strength in some markets and weakness in others. Making up 45% of our NOI, strength was evident in Seattle, Orange County, the Monterey Peninsula, Boston and our Sun Belt markets. While New York City, the Bay area and Los Angeles, which comprised 28% of our NOI, remains challenged due to concentrated new supply and concessions.
Overall, our highly diversified portfolios, defined by market mix, price point and location within markets, continue to perform well during the quarter, and we expect will generate growth that compares favorably versus the multifamily group average over the foreseeable future.
Turning to operating tactics. As you know, driving rate growth was our primary focus over the past 2 to 3 years. This approach was successful, largely as a result of the robust multifamily fundamentals present throughout the majority of our markets and evidenced by our cumulative same-store revenue growth of 16% between 2013 and 2015.
As 2016 has progressed, diminished pricing power due to concentrated new supply caused us to reevaluate this tactic. Towards the end of the second quarter, we made a change, pivoting our operating tactics to favor higher occupancy over rate growth in markets that were more challenged by new supply. Higher occupancy in select markets prior to the seasonally slower fourth and first quarters, when few of our leases expire, is a more prudent approach to maximizing revenue and cash flow growth in the current environment. This strategic shift bore fruit with third quarter occupancy averaging 96.8%, a 20 basis point sequential increase. We will operate the portfolio in the high 96% range through at least the end of this year.
With regard to the prime leasing season, 2016 results were clearly not as robust as those realized in 2015 but still compared favorably versus historical standards. For the third quarter, portfolio-wide new lease and renewal growth totaled 2.7% and 5.6%.
We continue to see minimal pressure from single-family competition with move-outs to home purchase totaling 13% during the third quarter. A lack of affordability is also not meaningfully affecting us as portfolio-wide move-outs due to rent increases remains relatively constrained at 7%. Net bad debt remains at 0.1% of rents, at levels consistent with that of third quarter 2015.
Next, forward expectations. Without providing 2017 guidance, we are projecting a revenue earn-in of about 2% going into 2017 versus the 2.75% earn-in that was baked into the beginning of 2016. Directionally, we continue to expect deceleration in 2017 same-store growth metrics as elevated new supply is further absorbed in some of our higher rent markets.
With that being said, next year is still expected to look good when compared against our long-term 15-year revenue growth average of about 3%. We will provide detailed 2017 guidance and an update to our 2-year strategic plan on our fourth quarter call.
Now moving on to the quarterly performance at our largest markets, which represents 72% of our total NOI. Metro D.C., which contributes 19% of our total NOI, continues to incrementally improve. Job growth is gaining steam versus a couple of years ago, though new supply remains persistent in some infill locations. We expect our highly diversified D.C. portfolio to see continuing improvement throughout 2017.
Orange County and Los Angeles contributed 16.5% of our total NOI. Orange County has been one of our strongest markets in 2016, primarily because our portfolio is concentrated west of the 405 freeway and has benefited from good job growth set against limited new supply.
Conversely, Los Angeles has struggled this year due to significant new supply in excess of concessions hitting our highly concentrated Marina del Rey portfolio. This pressure is now subsiding, and we expect pricing power in L.A. to improve in 2017 and for Orange County to remain stable.
New York City makes up 12% of our total NOI, and it continues to struggle due to concentrated new supply at Midtown West as well as Brooklyn and excessive concessions. Given the glut of building permits issued prior to 421-as expiring, we expect that driving meaningful growth in Manhattan will be problematic through at least 2018.
Like New York City, San Francisco, which contributes about 12% of our total NOI, continues to be negatively affected by supply, especially South of Market Street. Expected 2016 job growth of 2.9% still looks good versus long-term averages but has decelerated from 2015's 4.5% growth rate.
Our data providers indicate that supply pressures should subside in the city as we move into the second half of 2017, at which time pricing power should improve.
Boston, which contributes 7% of our total NOI, has held up well, largely due to our suburban B exposure. On a relative basis, our downtown and Back Bay communities have also outperformed due primarily to their differentiated characteristics. Boston continues to look like a good market for us going forward.
Seattle contributes 6% of our total NOI. It remains UDR's strongest core market on the West Coast. The MSAs' relatively higher affordability, strong [Audio Gap] jobs and urban renewal continued to attract educated, tech savvy residents. We expect that Seattle will continue to put up good numbers moving forward, although we are keeping our eye on near-term Bellevue supply as that submarket further transforms.
Our secondary markets, such as Portland, Monterey Peninsula, Florida, Nashville and Austin, comprise roughly 25% of our portfolio. Pricing power remained strong in the majority of these markets and continues to help offset the relative weakness in some of our higher-rent coastal locales. Move-outs to home purchase remained constrained, and our expectation is that these markets have a long runway for growth due to continued favorable multifamily fundamentals.
Last, our development lease-ups continued to perform well, achieving rates above original expectations and with leasing velocities ahead of original forecast. Thus far, in October, these trends have remained firm, and our development pipeline remains highly accretive than the average value creation spread in excess of the top end of our targeted 150 to 200 basis point range. Community specific quarter end lease-up statistics are available on Attachment 9 or Page 21 of our supplement.
Summing it up, we've had another good quarter, proactively pivoted our strategy to maximize revenue growth and remained positive on the outlook for multifamily fundamentals and our ability to execute throughout the remainder of 2016 and into 2017.
With that, I'll turn it over to Shawn."

The topics I will cover today include our third quarter results, a transactions update, a capital markets and balance sheet update and our fourth quarter and full year guidance.
Our third quarter earnings results were at the mid- to high end of our previously provided guidance. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.46, $0.45 and $0.41, driven by solid same-store revenue expense and NOI growth of 5.3%, 2.5% and 6.4%, respectively.
Next, transactions. We are under contract to sell 7 communities in Baltimore and 1 community in Dallas for $285 million. We expect to close these transactions in the fourth quarter at a cash flow cap rate of approximately 6% and a weighted average IRR of 13%. We also completed a series of strategic transactions with MetLife that further simplified our joint venture.
First, we completed a swap of our land interest in 3 development sites where we acquired MetLife's 95% interest in a land site located in Dublin, California in exchange for our 5% weighted average ownership interest in 2 land sites located in Bellevue, Washington and Los Angeles California. The Dublin site is within walking distance of the Bay Area BART line and provides the opportunity to develop a differentiated product in that submarket.
Next, UDR/MetLife joint venture sold 100% of Cirque, a high-rise community located in Dallas, to an unrelated third party for approximately $75 million at a cash flow cap rate in the mid-4s and an IRR of 10%.
Subsequent to quarter end, we also acquired MetLife's 50% ownership interest in Ashton Bellevue and TEN20, 2 adjacent highrise communities located in Bellevue, Washington, for $68 million plus the assumption of $38 million of debt, at a cash flow cap rate in the mid-4s. We know both of these assets well. They complement our other assets in the Bellevue submarket, and we like the long-term prospects as more established tech companies continue to create a presence on the east side of Metro Seattle.
After accounting for joint venture refinancings, these MetLife transactions were net cash positive to the company by approximately $14 million and reduce the size of the UDR/MetLife joint venture by approximately 10% or $355 million.
Next, capital markets. During the third quarter, we issued $300 million of 10-year unsecured notes priced at 2.95%. $158 million of the proceeds were used to prepay 2017 debt maturities with an average interest rate of 5.61%. The majority of the remaining proceeds were used to pay down our revolver.
With the prepayment of the 2017 debt, next year's maturities now total only $71 million. Development will likely represent our largest use of capital in 2017. We will continue to self-fund our accretive development pipeline via retained earnings and asset sales, and we'll provide a detailed update of our 2017 sources and uses on the fourth quarter call.
As a result of the unsecured offering, our weighted average maturities increased by nearly half a year to 5.3 years and improved our near-term liquidity by approximately $140 million. At quarter end, our liquidity, as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, was $931 million. Our financial leverage on an undepreciated cost basis was 33.5%. Based on quarter end market cap, it was 24.4%, and inclusive of joint ventures, it was 29%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.3x and inclusive of joint ventures was 6.4x. All balance sheet metrics continue to track ahead of our strategic outlook.
I would now like to direct you to Attachment 15 or Page 28 of our supplement, where we have updated our full year guidance. We have tightened and increased our full year 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance ranges to $1.77 to $1.80, $1.78 to $1.80 and $1.62 to $1.64, respectively, by increasing the bottom end of the range by $0.01.
For same-store, our full year 2016 guidance remains unchanged with revenue growth of 5.5% to 6%, expense growth of 3% to 3.5% and NOI growth of 6.5% to 7%. Average 2016 forecasted occupancy is unchanged at 96.6%.
Fourth quarter 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance is $0.44 to $0.46, $0.45 to $0.47 and $0.39 to $0.41, respectively.
Next, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.295 in the third quarter or a $1.18 when annualized. This is 6% above 2015's level and represents a yield of approximately 3.3% as of quarter end.
Finally, a housekeeping item. We moved and consolidated our preferred equity investments and participating loan information and economics to a new attachment, 12B. All information that was previously provided for these investments is still available on the new attachment. With that, I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator?"

So I think that's going to be difficult. I think you're going to see a continuation of some supply pressures in SoMa at least through the first quarter, maybe second quarter of 2017.
Downtown Seattle continues to battle new supply. We do not have any same-store assets there, but we do have 2 different JV properties there. And the other one that I've been keeping my eye on but we really haven't seen a downturn in fundamentals has been Bellevue, Washington. We're very high on Bellevue, even though there's probably 5 or 6 properties delivering there. Bellevue, as you know, we just purchased the other 50% of 2 assets from MetLife there. And you've got jobs that are coming in there, Amazon is creating a mini campus, if you will, over on the side of Lake Washington, where they just signed a lease for a 350,000 square-foot office space that rumor has it, Apple was looking at the same building and is continuing to look in Bellevue. So Bellevue, I think, is going to have job growth that should absorb the new supply, but we are watching the new supply there. And other than that, obviously, when you get up to New York City, where we've been battling not direct competition in a submarket but throughout Manhattan, we're going to continue to face supply headwinds throughout our Manhattan portfolio all through next year and probably well into 2018."

Similarly, Seattle has felt that kind of pressure. And then because of our 421 abatement burn-offs, we're going to feel it there, too. We're always watching personnel costs, and there is a lot of demand for the quality people that we hire, especially in high new supply areas. Fortunately for the quarter and year-to-date, we've kept that growth at 1.1%, and we did it really because we realize quite a few efficiencies over the last year or 2 at our site staff that allowed us this year to reduce staffing levels by 1.5% or so, and that's through things like our inside sales group, who assist in renewals and leasing. And secondly, we've deployed about 70 package lockers out into the field that take the burden of package handling off of our site people, so that they can spend more time on sales and service. And we've been able to turn that into some headcount savings.

So it doesn't just have to be job growth in Bellevue. It's a lot of those places on the east side that benefit. I think Bellevue is a bit different, and I do think job growth will continue in that.

The other thing to keep in mind, and this is a little more long term, but in about 5 or 6 years, the light rail is going to reach across Lake Washington and really connect both Bellevue as well as Redmond to the west side of town, and I think it will enhance the east side even more."

One, the short term that will have probably a slight negative impact on value, where the absolute rent growth in the near term will be slightly lower because you do have these base cap on increases. However, the way you look at it over the long term is truly a timing issue that typically you have vacancy B control. So over time, you capture those sort of embedded shortfalls as your tendency turns over.
In the long term, if you get say 5 years into a rent control program, these assets actually traded lower cap rates because of the embedded upside that exist on the rent roll, so that you have a certain number of units that are well below sort of market rent. You assume that over time, just really on an actuarial basis, you're going to get 5% or 10% or 15% of those assets or those units to turn over and are able to capture that upside."

Welcome to UDR's third quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer; and Shawn Johnston, Interim Principal Financial Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.
UDR reported another strong quarter of results, highlighted by solid same-store and cash flow growth, strong leasing velocities in rental rates at our development communities, several strategic transactions and continued improvement of our balance sheet. Jerry and Shawn will provide additional details in their prepared remarks.
As we near the end of 2016, I'd like to take a couple of minutes to discuss our strategic plan and how we've executed on it. As you know, consistently generating 6% to 10% cash flow per share growth has been the cornerstone of our plan since it was first published in 2013. In 2016, we expect to again achieve that goal with full-year AFFO per share growth of approximately 8%, at the midpoint of our guidance.
Next, a deeper look into how the primary drivers of our cash flow growth have performed. First, operations. We expect that our full year 2016 same-store growth metrics will compare well on an absolute and relative basis, in spite of the headwinds that New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles generated this year. We have successfully weathered this storm and continued to do so, partly because of our diversified portfolio, but much of our success stems from our operating platform.
Starting with the team's ability to quickly adjust operating tactics to maximize revenue growth in a shifting market as well as a consistent implementation of innovative technologies. I'm grateful for our team's hard work.
Next, capital allocation. We delivered $163 million of accretive development in 2016 and believe that our $937 million under-construction pipeline will be no different. Our development pipeline provides our shareholders with a strong risk adjusted return on their capital and allows us to consistently refresh our portfolio via our self-funding model.
Fully funding our development growth in a non-dilutive manner through retained cash flow and capital recycled from asset sales is a funding mechanism that we can employ year in and year out.
Moving forward, we remain comfortable with this strategy. Last, our balance sheet continues to improve. Our leverage metrics at the end of the third quarter were better than those originally envisioned for the year ended 2016.
As we look into 2017 and without providing guidance, we remain confident in our ability to execute on our strategic plan. Currently, we are in the midst of building the 2017-'18 plan from the ground up. We see no need to change our strategies, as they continue to work well as we move through this part of the business cycle. We will share the updated details of the plan with you on the fourth quarter call.
In summary, while 2016 has presented challenges, we have successfully worked through them and will achieve the guidance provided at the beginning of the year as part of our strategic plan. Given the outlook for sound intermediate and long-term multifamily fundamentals, we remain confident that adhering to our strategic plan's core principles will continue to help us drive strong cash flow growth for many years to come.
With that, I will turn the call over to Jerry for additional comments on the quarter."
310667,403302013,1062188,"UDR, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","UDR, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to announce another quarter of strong operating results. During the third quarter, year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI growth were 5.3% and 6.4%, respectively.

During the third quarter, year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI growth were 5.3% and 6.4%, respectively. On a year-to-date basis, same-store revenue and NOI growth totaled 5.9% and 6.9%, respectively.
During the third quarter, operating trends further normalized as compared to 2015, when the majority of markets were accelerating. Localized demand/supply dynamics today are creating strength in some markets and weakness in others. Making up 45% of our NOI, strength was evident in Seattle, Orange County, the Monterey Peninsula, Boston and our Sun Belt markets. While New York City, the Bay area and Los Angeles, which comprised 28% of our NOI, remain challenged due to concentrated new supply and concessions.
Overall, our highly diversified portfolio is defined by market mix, price point and location within markets, continued to perform well during the quarter, and we expect will generate growth that compares favorably versus the multifamily group average over the foreseeable future.
Turning to operating tactics. As you know, driving rate growth was our primary focus over the past 2 to 3 years. This approach was successful, largely as a result of the robust multifamily fundamentals present throughout the majority of our markets and evidenced by our cumulative same-store revenue growth of 16% between 2013 and 2015.
As 2016 has progressed, diminished pricing power due to concentrated new supply caused us to reevaluate this tactic. Towards the end of the second quarter, we made a change, pivoting our operating tactics to favor higher occupancy over rate growth in markets that were more challenged by new supply. Higher occupancy in select markets prior to the seasonally slower fourth and first quarters, when few of our leases expire, is a more prudent approach to maximizing revenue and cash flow growth in the current environment. This strategic shift bore fruit with third quarter occupancy averaging 96.8%, a 20 basis point sequential increase. We will operate the portfolio in the high 96% range through at least the end of this year.
With regard to the prime leasing season, 2016 results were clearly not as robust as those realized in 2015 but still compared favorably versus historical standards. For the third quarter, portfolio-wide new lease and renewal growth totaled 2.7% and 5.6%.
We continue to see minimal pressure from single-family competition with move-outs to home purchase totaling 13% during the third quarter. A lack of affordability is also not meaningfully affecting us as portfolio-wide move-outs due to rent increases remains relatively constrained at 7%. Net bad debt remains at 0.1% of rents, at levels consistent with that of third quarter 2015.
Next, forward expectations. Without providing 2017 guidance, we are projecting a revenue earn-in of about 2% going into 2017 versus the 2.75% earn-in that was baked into the beginning of 2016. Directionally, we continue to expect deceleration in 2017 same-store growth metrics as elevated new supply is further absorbed in some of our higher rent markets.
With that being said, next year is still expected to look good when compared against our long-term 15-year revenue growth average of about 3%. We will provide detailed 2017 guidance and an update to our 2-year strategic plan on our fourth quarter call.
Now moving on to the quarterly performance at our largest markets, which represents 72% of our total NOI. Metro D.C., which contributes 19% of our total NOI, continues to incrementally improve. Job growth is gaining steam versus a couple of years ago, though new supply remains persistent in some infill locations. We expect our highly diversified D.C. portfolio to see continuing improvement throughout 2017.
Orange County and Los Angeles contributed 16.5% of our total NOI. Orange County has been one of our strongest markets in 2016, primarily because our portfolio is concentrated west of the 405 freeway and has benefited from good job growth set against limited new supply.
Conversely, Los Angeles has struggled this year due to significant new supply in excess of concessions hitting our highly concentrated Marina del Rey portfolio. This pressure is now subsiding, and we expect pricing power in L.A. to improve in 2017 and for Orange County to remain stable.
New York City makes up 12% of our total NOI, and it continues to struggle due to concentrated new supply at Midtown West as well as Brooklyn and excessive concessions. Given the glut of building permits issued prior to 421-As expiring, we expect that driving meaningful growth in Manhattan will be problematic through at least 2018.
Like New York City, San Francisco, which contributes about 12% of our total NOI, continues to be negatively affected by supply, especially South of Market Street. Expected 2016 job growth of 2.9% still looks good versus long-term averages but has decelerated from 2015's 4.5% growth rate.
Our data providers indicate that supply pressures should subside in the city as we move into the second half of 2017, at which time pricing power should improve.
Boston, which contributes 7% of our total NOI, has held up well, largely due to our suburban B exposure. On a relative basis, our downtown and Back Bay communities have also outperformed due primarily to their differentiated characteristics. Boston continues to look like a good market for us going forward.
Seattle contributes 6% of our total NOI. It remains UDR's strongest core market on the West Coast. The MSAs' relatively higher affordability, strong [Audio Gap] jobs and urban renewal continued to attract educated, tech savvy residents. We expect that Seattle will continue to put up good numbers moving forward, although we are keeping our eye on near-term Bellevue supply as that submarket further transforms.
Our secondary markets, such as Portland, Monterey Peninsula, Florida, Nashville and Austin, comprise roughly 25% of our portfolio. Pricing power remained strong in the majority of these markets and continues to help offset the relative weakness in some of our higher-rent coastal locales. Move-outs to home purchase remained constrained, and our expectation is that these markets have a long runway for growth due to continued favorable multifamily fundamentals.
Last, our development lease-ups continued to perform well, achieving rates above original expectations and with leasing velocities ahead of original forecast. Thus far, in October, these trends have remained firm, and our development pipeline remains highly accretive than the average value creation spread in excess of the top end of our targeted 150 to 200 basis point range. Community specific quarter end lease-up statistics are available on Attachment 9 or Page 21 of our supplement.
Summing it up, we had another good quarter, proactively pivoted our strategy to maximize revenue growth and remained positive on the outlook for multifamily fundamentals and our ability to execute throughout the remainder of 2016 and into 2017.
With that, I'll turn it over to Shawn."

The topics I will cover today include our third quarter results, a transactions update, a capital markets and balance sheet update and our fourth quarter and full year guidance.
Our third quarter earnings results were at the mid- to high end of our previously provided guidance. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.46, $0.45 and $0.41, driven by solid same-store revenue expense and NOI growth of 5.3%, 2.5% and 6.4%, respectively.
Next, transactions. We are under contract to sell 7 communities in Baltimore and 1 community in Dallas for $285 million. We expect to close these transactions in the fourth quarter at a cash flow cap rate of approximately 6% and a weighted average IRR of 13%. We also completed a series of strategic transactions with MetLife that further simplified our joint venture.
First, we completed a swap of our land interest in 3 development sites where we acquired MetLife's 95% interest in a land site located in Dublin, California in exchange for our 5% weighted average ownership interest in 2 land sites located in Bellevue, Washington and Los Angeles California. The Dublin site is within walking distance of the Bay Area BART line and provides the opportunity to develop a differentiated product in that submarket.
Next, UDR/MetLife joint venture sold 100% of Cirque, a high-rise community located in Dallas, to an unrelated third party for approximately $75 million at a cash flow cap rate in the mid-4s and an IRR of 10%.
Subsequent to quarter end, we also acquired MetLife's 50% ownership interest in Ashton Bellevue and TEN20, 2 adjacent highrise communities located in Bellevue, Washington, for $68 million plus the assumption of $38 million of debt, at a cash flow cap rate in the mid-4s. We know both of these assets well. They complement our other assets in the Bellevue submarket, and we like the long-term prospects as more established tech companies continue to create a presence on the east side of metro Seattle.
After accounting for joint venture refinancings, these MetLife transactions were net cash positive to the company by approximately $14 million and reduced the size of the UDR/MetLife joint venture by approximately 10% or $355 million.
Next, capital markets. During the third quarter, we issued $300 million of 10-year unsecured notes priced at 2.95%. $158 million of the proceeds were used to prepay 2017 debt maturities with an average interest rate of 5.61%. The majority of the remaining proceeds were used to pay down our revolver.
With the prepayment of the 2017 debt, next year's maturities now total only $71 million. Development will likely represent our largest use of capital in 2017. We will continue to self-fund our accretive development pipeline via retained earnings and asset sales, and we'll provide a detailed update of our 2017 sources and uses on the fourth quarter call.
As a result of the unsecured offering, our weighted average maturities increased by nearly half a year to 5.3 years and improved our near-term liquidity by approximately $140 million. At quarter end, our liquidity, as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, was $931 million. Our financial leverage on an undepreciated cost basis was 33.5%. Based on quarter end market cap, it was 24.4%, and inclusive of joint ventures, it was 29%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.3x and inclusive of joint ventures was 6.4x. All balance sheet metrics continue to track ahead of our strategic outlook.
I would now like to direct you to Attachment 15 or Page 28 of our supplement, where we have updated our full year guidance. We have tightened and increased our full year 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance ranges to $1.77 to $1.80, $1.78 to $1.80 and $1.62 to $1.64, respectively, by increasing the bottom end of the range by $0.01.
For same-store, our full year 2016 guidance remains unchanged with revenue growth of 5.5% to 6%, expense growth of 3% to 3.5% and NOI growth of 6.5% to 7%. Average 2016 forecasted occupancy is unchanged at 96.6%.
Fourth quarter 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance is $0.44 to $0.46, $0.45 to $0.47 and $0.39 to $0.41, respectively.
Next, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.295 in the third quarter or a $1.18 per share when annualized. This is 6% above 2015's level and represents a yield of approximately 3.3% as of quarter end.
Finally, a housekeeping item. We moved and consolidated our preferred equity investments and participating loan information and economics to a new attachment, 12B. All information that was previously provided for these investments is still available on the new attachment. With that, I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator?"

And what's really encouraging is, like you said, we had new lease rate growth in the third quarter of 0.1%, and when I look at where we're at in Los Angeles so far in the month of October, it's over 3%. So we are starting to emerge out of our problem area in Los Angeles."

So I think that's going to be difficult. I think you're going to see a continuation of some supply pressures in SOMA at least through the first quarter, maybe second quarter of 2017.
Downtown Seattle continues to battle new supply. We do not have any same-store assets there, but we do have 2 different JV properties there. And the other one that I've been keeping my eye on but we really haven't seen a downturn in fundamentals has been Bellevue, Washington. We're very high on Bellevue, even though there's probably 5 or 6 properties delivering there. Bellevue, as you know, we just purchased the other 50% of 2 assets from MetLife there. And you've got jobs that are coming in there, Amazon is creating a mini campus, if you will, over on the east side of Lake Washington, where they just signed a lease for a 350,000 square-foot office space that rumor has it, Apple was looking at the same building and is continuing to look in Bellevue. So Bellevue, I think, is going to have job growth that should absorb the new supply, but we are watching the new supply there. And other than that, obviously, when you get up to New York City, where we've been battling not direct competition in a submarket but throughout Manhattan, we're going to continue to face supply headwinds throughout our Manhattan portfolio all through next year and probably well into 2018."

We're always watching personnel costs, and there is a lot of demand for the quality people that we hire, especially in high new supply areas. Fortunately for the quarter and year-to-date, we've kept that growth at 1.1%, and we did it really because we've realize quited a few efficiencies over the last year or 2 at our site staff that allowed us this year to reduce staffing levels by 1.5% or so, and that's through things like our inside sales group, who assist in renewals and leasing. And secondly, we've deployed about 70 package lockers out into the field that take the burden of package handling off of our site people, so that they can spend more time on sales and service.

And I can tell you -- I guess I'd answer it a couple of different ways. One, in the short term that will have probably a slight negative impact on value, where the absolute rent growth in the near term will be slightly lower because you do have these base cap on increases. However, the way you look at it over the long term is really a timing issue that typically you have vacancy B control. So over time, you capture those sort of embedded shortfalls as your tenancy turns over.
In the long term, as you get say 5 years into a rent control program, these assets actually traded lower cap rates because of the embedded upside that exist on the rent roll. So that you have a certain number of units that are well below sort of market rent. You assume that over time, just really on an actuarial basis, you're going to get 5% or 10% or 15% of those assets or those units to turn over and are able to capture that upside."

Welcome to UDR's third quarter conference call. On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer; and Shawn Johnston, Interim Principal Financial Officer, who will discuss our results, as well as senior officers Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.
UDR reported another strong quarter of results, highlighted by solid same-store and cash flow growth, strong leasing velocities in rental rates at our development communities, several strategic transactions and continued improvement of our balance sheet. Jerry and Shawn will provide additional details in their prepared remarks.
As we near the end of 2016, I'd like to take a couple of minutes to discuss our strategic plan and how we've executed on it. As you know, consistently generating 6% to 10% cash flow per share growth has been the cornerstone of our plan since it was first published in 2013. In 2016, we expect to again achieve that goal with full-year AFFO per share growth of approximately 8%, at the midpoint of our guidance.
Next, a deeper look into how the primary drivers of our cash flow growth have performed. First, operations. We expect that our full year 2016 same-store growth metrics will compare well on an absolute and relative basis, in spite of the headwinds that New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles generated this year. We have successfully weathered this storm and continued to do so, partly because of our diversified portfolio, but much of our success stems from our operating platform.
Starting with the team's ability to quickly adjust operating tactics to maximize revenue growth in a shifting market as well as a consistent implementation of innovative technologies. I'm grateful for our team's hard work.
Next, capital allocation. We delivered $163 million of accretive development in 2016 and believe that our $937 million under-construction pipeline will be no different. Our development pipeline provides our shareholders with a strong risk adjusted return on their capital and allows us to consistently refresh our portfolio via our self-funding model.
Fully funding our development growth in a non-dilutive manner through retained cash flow and capital recycled from asset sales is a funding mechanism that we can employ year in and year out.
Moving forward, we remain comfortable with this strategy. Last, our balance sheet continues to improve. Our leverage metrics at the end of the third quarter were better than those originally envisioned for the year ended 2016.
As we look into 2017 and without providing guidance, we remain confident in our ability to execute on our strategic plan. Currently, we are in the midst of building the 2017-'18 plan from the ground up. We see no need to change our strategies, as they continue to work well as we move through this part of the business cycle. We will share the updated details of the plan with you on the fourth quarter call.
In summary, while 2016 has presented challenges, we have successfully worked through them and will achieve the guidance provided at the beginning of the year as part of our strategic plan. Given the outlook for sound intermediate and long-term multifamily fundamentals, we remain confident that adhering to our strategic plan's core principles will continue to help us drive strong cash flow growth for many years to come.
With that, I will turn the call over to Jerry for additional comments on the quarter."
310667,403302013,1062664,"UDR, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","UDR, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to announce another quarter of strong operating results. During the third quarter, year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI growth were 5.3% and 6.4%, respectively. On a year-to-date basis, same-s",1129,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to announce another quarter of strong operating results. During the third quarter, year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI growth were 5.3% and 6.4%, respectively. On a year-to-date basis, same-store revenue and NOI growth totaled 5.9% and 6.9%, respectively.
During the third quarter, operating trends further normalized as compared to 2015, when the majority of markets were accelerating. Localized demand/supply dynamics today are creating strength in some markets and weakness in others. Making up 45% of our NOI, strength was evident in Seattle, Orange County, the Monterey Peninsula, Boston and our Sun Belt markets. While New York City, the Bay area and Los Angeles, which comprised 28% of our NOI, remain challenged due to concentrated new supply and concessions.
Overall, our highly diversified portfolio is defined by market mix, price point and location within markets, continued to perform well during the quarter, and we expect will generate growth that compares favorably versus the multifamily group average over the foreseeable future.
Turning to operating tactics. As you know, driving rate growth was our primary focus over the past 2 to 3 years. This approach was successful, largely as a result of the robust multifamily fundamentals present throughout the majority of our markets and evidenced by our cumulative same-store revenue growth of 16% between 2013 and 2015.
As 2016 has progressed, diminished pricing power due to concentrated new supply caused us to reevaluate this tactic. Towards the end of the second quarter, we made a change, pivoting our operating tactics to favor higher occupancy over rate growth in markets that were more challenged by new supply. Higher occupancy in select markets prior to the seasonally slower fourth and first quarters, when few of our leases expire, is a more prudent approach to maximizing revenue and cash flow growth in the current environment. This strategic shift bore fruit with third quarter occupancy averaging 96.8%, a 20 basis point sequential increase. We will operate the portfolio in the high 96% range through at least the end of this year.
With regard to the prime leasing season, 2016 results were clearly not as robust as those realized in 2015 but still compared favorably versus historical standards. For the third quarter, portfolio-wide new lease and renewal growth totaled 2.7% and 5.6%.
We continue to see minimal pressure from single-family competition with move-outs to home purchase totaling 13% during the third quarter. A lack of affordability is also not meaningfully affecting us as portfolio-wide move-outs due to rent increases remains relatively constrained at 7%. Net bad debt remains at 0.1% of rents, at levels consistent with that of third quarter 2015.
Next, forward expectations. Without providing 2017 guidance, we are projecting a revenue earn-in of about 2% going into 2017 versus the 2.75% earn-in that was baked into the beginning of 2016. Directionally, we continue to expect deceleration in 2017 same-store growth metrics as elevated new supply is further absorbed in some of our higher rent markets.
With that being said, next year is still expected to look good when compared against our long-term 15-year revenue growth average of about 3%. We will provide detailed 2017 guidance and an update to our 2-year strategic plan on our fourth quarter call.
Now moving on to the quarterly performance at our largest markets, which represents 72% of our total NOI. Metro D.C., which contributes 19% of our total NOI, continues to incrementally improve. Job growth is gaining steam versus a couple of years ago, though new supply remains persistent in some infill locations. We expect our highly diversified D.C. portfolio to see continuing improvement throughout 2017.
Orange County and Los Angeles contributed 16.5% of our total NOI. Orange County has been one of our strongest markets in 2016, primarily because our portfolio is concentrated west of the 405 freeway and has benefited from good job growth set against limited new supply.
Conversely, Los Angeles has struggled this year due to significant new supply in excess of concessions hitting our highly concentrated Marina del Rey portfolio. This pressure is now subsiding, and we expect pricing power in L.A. to improve in 2017 and for Orange County to remain stable.
New York City makes up 12% of our total NOI, and it continues to struggle due to concentrated new supply at Midtown West as well as Brooklyn and excessive concessions. Given the glut of building permits issued prior to 421-As expiring, we expect that driving meaningful growth in Manhattan will be problematic through at least 2018.
Like New York City, San Francisco, which contributes about 12% of our total NOI, continues to be negatively affected by supply, especially South of Market Street. Expected 2016 job growth of 2.9% still looks good versus long-term averages but has decelerated from 2015's 4.5% growth rate.
Our data providers indicate that supply pressures should subside in the city as we move into the second half of 2017, at which time pricing power should improve.
Boston, which contributes 7% of our total NOI, has held up well, largely due to our suburban B exposure. On a relative basis, our downtown and Back Bay communities have also outperformed due primarily to their differentiated characteristics. Boston continues to look like a good market for us going forward.
Seattle contributes 6% of our total NOI. It remains UDR's strongest core market on the West Coast. The MSAs' relatively higher affordability, strong [Audio Gap] jobs and urban renewal continued to attract educated, tech savvy residents. We expect that Seattle will continue to put up good numbers moving forward, although we are keeping our eye on near-term Bellevue supply as that submarket further transforms.
Our secondary markets, such as Portland, Monterey Peninsula, Florida, Nashville and Austin, comprise roughly 25% of our portfolio. Pricing power remained strong in the majority of these markets and continues to help offset the relative weakness in some of our higher-rent coastal locales. Move-outs to home purchase remained constrained, and our expectation is that these markets have a long runway for growth due to continued favorable multifamily fundamentals.
Last, our development lease-ups continued to perform well, achieving rates above original expectations and with leasing velocities ahead of original forecast. Thus far, in October, these trends have remained firm, and our development pipeline remains highly accretive than the average value creation spread in excess of the top end of our targeted 150 to 200 basis point range. Community specific quarter end lease-up statistics are available on Attachment 9 or Page 21 of our supplement.
Summing it up, we had another good quarter, proactively pivoted our strategy to maximize revenue growth and remained positive on the outlook for multifamily fundamentals and our ability to execute throughout the remainder of 2016 and into 2017.
With that, I'll turn it over to Shawn."

The topics I will cover today include our third quarter results, a transactions update, a capital markets and balance sheet update and our fourth quarter and full year guidance.
Our third quarter earnings results were at the mid- to high end of our previously provided guidance. FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share were $0.46, $0.45 and $0.41, driven by solid same-store revenue expense and NOI growth of 5.3%, 2.5% and 6.4%, respectively.
Next, transactions. We are under contract to sell 7 communities in Baltimore and 1 community in Dallas for $285 million. We expect to close these transactions in the fourth quarter at a cash flow cap rate of approximately 6% and a weighted average IRR of 13%. We also completed a series of strategic transactions with MetLife that further simplified our joint venture.
First, we completed a swap of our land interest in 3 development sites where we acquired MetLife's 95% interest in a land site located in Dublin, California in exchange for our 5% weighted average ownership interest in 2 land sites located in Bellevue, Washington and Los Angeles California. The Dublin site is within walking distance of the Bay Area BART line and provides the opportunity to develop a differentiated product in that submarket.
Next, UDR/MetLife joint venture sold 100% of Cirque, a high-rise community located in Dallas, to an unrelated third party for approximately $75 million at a cash flow cap rate in the mid-4s and an IRR of 10%.
Subsequent to quarter end, we also acquired MetLife's 50% ownership interest in Ashton Bellevue and TEN20, 2 adjacent highrise communities located in Bellevue, Washington, for $68 million plus the assumption of $38 million of debt, at a cash flow cap rate in the mid-4s. We know both of these assets well. They complement our other assets in the Bellevue submarket, and we like the long-term prospects as more established tech companies continue to create a presence on the east side of metro Seattle.
After accounting for joint venture refinancings, these MetLife transactions were net cash positive to the company by approximately $14 million and reduced the size of the UDR/MetLife joint venture by approximately 10% or $355 million.
Next, capital markets. During the third quarter, we issued $300 million of 10-year unsecured notes priced at 2.95%. $158 million of the proceeds were used to prepay 2017 debt maturities with an average interest rate of 5.61%. The majority of the remaining proceeds were used to pay down our revolver.
With the prepayment of the 2017 debt, next year's maturities now total only $71 million. Development will likely represent our largest use of capital in 2017. We will continue to self-fund our accretive development pipeline via retained earnings and asset sales, and we'll provide a detailed update of our 2017 sources and uses on the fourth quarter call.
As a result of the unsecured offering, our weighted average maturities increased by nearly half a year to 5.3 years and improved our near-term liquidity by approximately $140 million. At quarter end, our liquidity, as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, was $931 million. Our financial leverage on an undepreciated cost basis was 33.5%. Based on quarter end market cap, it was 24.4%, and inclusive of joint ventures, it was 29%. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.3x and inclusive of joint ventures was 6.4x. All balance sheet metrics continue to track ahead of our strategic outlook.
I would now like to direct you to Attachment 15 or Page 28 of our supplement, where we have updated our full year guidance. We have tightened and increased our full year 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance ranges to $1.77 to $1.80, $1.78 to $1.80 and $1.62 to $1.64, respectively, by increasing the bottom end of the range by $0.01.
For same-store, our full year 2016 guidance remains unchanged with revenue growth of 5.5% to 6%, expense growth of 3% to 3.5% and NOI growth of 6.5% to 7%. Average 2016 forecasted occupancy is unchanged at 96.6%.
Fourth quarter 2016 FFO, FFO as adjusted and AFFO per share guidance is $0.44 to $0.46, $0.45 to $0.47 and $0.39 to $0.41, respectively.
Next, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.295 in the third quarter or a $1.18 per share when annualized. This is 6% above 2015's level and represents a yield of approximately 3.3% as of quarter end.
Finally, a housekeeping item. We moved and consolidated our preferred equity investments and participating loan information and economics to a new attachment, 12B. All information that was previously provided for these investments is still available on the new attachment. With that, I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator?"

Through the first, call it, 7 to 9 months of this year, we were competing against that new supply that was offering up to 2 months free rent. Luckily, the properties in that submarket that we were battling with have come very close to hitting stabilized occupancies, pushing 90%. We've seen concession levels late in the third quarter start to come back down to 1 month free. And what's really encouraging is, like you said, we had new lease rate growth in the third quarter of 0.1%, and when I look at where we're at in Los Angeles so far in the month of October, it's over 3%. So we are starting to emerge out of our problem area in Los Angeles."

Downtown Seattle continues to battle new supply. We do not have any same-store assets there, but we do have 2 different JV properties there. And the other one that I've been keeping my eye on but we really haven't seen a downturn in fundamentals has been Bellevue, Washington. We're very high on Bellevue, even though there's probably 5 or 6 properties delivering there. Bellevue, as you know, we just purchased the other 50% of 2 assets from MetLife there. And you've got jobs that are coming in there, Amazon is creating a mini campus, if you will, over on the east side of Lake Washington, where they just signed a lease for a 350,000 square-foot office space that rumor has it, Apple was looking at the same building and is continuing to look in Bellevue. So Bellevue, I think, is going to have job growth that should absorb the new supply, but we are watching the new supply there. And other than that, obviously, when you get up to New York City, where we've been battling not direct competition in a submarket but throughout Manhattan, we're going to continue to face supply headwinds throughout our Manhattan portfolio all through next year and probably well into 2018."

We're always watching personnel costs, and there is a lot of demand for the quality people that we hire, especially in high new supply areas. Fortunately for the quarter and year-to-date, we've kept that growth at 1.1%, and we did it really because we realize quite a few efficiencies over the last year or 2 at our site staff that allowed us this year to reduce staffing levels by 1.5% or so, and that's through things like our inside sales group, who assist in renewals and leasing. And secondly, we've deployed about 70 package lockers out into the field that take the burden of package handling off of our site people, so that they can spend more time on sales and service.

One, in the short term that will have probably a slight negative impact on value, where the absolute rent growth in the near term will be slightly lower because you do have these base cap on increases. However, the way you look at it over the long term is really a timing issue that typically you have vacancy B control. So over time, you capture those sort of embedded shortfalls as your tenancy turns over.
In the long term, as you get say 5 years into a rent control program, these assets actually traded lower cap rates because of the embedded upside that exist on the rent roll. So that you have a certain number of units that are well below sort of market rent. You assume that over time, just really on an actuarial basis, you're going to get 5% or 10% or 15% of those assets or those units to turn over and are able to capture that upside."
