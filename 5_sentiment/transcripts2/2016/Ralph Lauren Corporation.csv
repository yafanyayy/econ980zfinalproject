I'm here to share with you how I spent my first 3 months, my initial observations and a rough outline for how we rebuild the long-term growth plan for this great company. Chris and Bob will then share financial results for the quarter and give you guidance going forward. I will then come back again to conclude the presentation part of the call and open up for your questions. 
But before we get going, I would like to take the opportunity to thank Ralph and the Board for their partnership and trust that they have given me in leading this great company forward. Now let's start with how I spent with my first 3 months with the role. 
Over the last 90 days, I've done all the travels. I've been to London, Paris, Geneva, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing and all over the U.S., including our distribution center in North Carolina. I've also met with our biggest customers. I've spent time with the many influences in the industry, and I met with thousands of our team members across all functions and levels of the organization. And in many of these meetings, I received direct feedback from frontline team members and customers.
The goal of the travel and meeting has been to learn as much as possible about our brand, our team, our customers and the environment we compete in. Parallel to the traveling meetings, the senior management team is in the process of conducting a formal and comprehensive assessment of our entire organization and every function we do. This review goes beyond the cost savings initiatives and brand planning processes that run away when I joined, covers all the value creators in the business from brand, product, marketing to supply-chain distribution geographies, as well as less customers and competitors. The assessment in our multiyear growth strategy will be completed in the coming weeks and months, and I look forward to sharing that with you in next spring.
While it is still early days in the assessment, the picture is starting to develop on our strength and opportunities, as well as a rough outline for how we will build our long-term growth plan. Let me start with our strengths.
Our brand, our team and the infrastructure we are building are by far our biggest strengths. Our brand is very strong and unique. Ralph and the team have built a brand on a dream of an aspirational life a in way, that quintessential American dream. But there is a bigger than that, it's a less and celled that goes beyond apparel. It's built on unauthentic style, quality and specialness. And it became the customer's dream, and our success is both highly aspirational and highly relatable at the same time. 
Right after I came in, we did a comprehensive brand study that confirms, not surprisingly, that our customers see our brand as one of the strongest in the industry. The strength, depth and uniqueness of our brand that Ralph created 48 years ago is a very strong platform to build on.
Another key strength we have is our team. Our team members, and I met many of them already, are highly dedicated, they're passionate and they care deeply about our brand. They can't wait to get back to consistency beating our competitors. And there's a hunger for change that will be critical for realizing the full potential of this company. 
Finally, the infrastructure that we're investing in, like SAP and our new e-commerce platform that will enable us to have best-in-class digital capabilities. That's especially important in the world we're living in today. Moving to our opportunities. 
And here, I want to start with our performance trend over the last several years. Our recent financial performance has not been living up to the strength of our brand. It's been very disappointing on both on a top and a bottom line level. With this underwhelming performance, we are asking ourselves the tough questions needed to identify where the opportunities are to get back to leveraging our strengths to consistently drive high performance.
In our assessment work, we started by asking the following questions, starting with brand. With our multiple brands, how increased focus on the brands, where we have the biggest opportunity to win. Even though our brand is strong, how do we build on the authentic core what we stand for and continues to evolve it? Relating to product and assortment. How do we improve the balance in our assortment? Do we have a systematic way of continuously strengthen our assortment? Relating to marketing. How do we focus our resources on cutting through in today's market? How do we evolve our brand voice in a way that makes our brand DNA stand out and insights and surprises that customers more than anyone else. We want to customers to love us more than anyone else. Relating to supply-chain and inventory management. How do we shorten our lead times to be disrupted. How do we optimize our inventory in relation to sales? 
Relating to distribution and international expansion. How do we improve the quality of our distribution to be able to grow with high full price selling and lower discount levels? How do we strengthen our direct-to-consumer channels, given where the market is growing? How do we make our online channel show up to the way it showed and drive grown strength and profitable sales growth at the same time? How do we pursue our global growth potential in a much more strategic away? 
Relating to cost structure. How do we make the cost structure competitive with our best competitors? How do we make sure that we invest in a disciplined enough way for the future to get us the highest return on investment. Relating to customers. How do we get to the use of customers to know what our aspiration, wants and needs are? How do we engage and build enough the long-term relationships with our customers? And finally, relating to the increasingly disruptive environment we're in. How do we strengthen the brand and develop the business model fast enough to succeed in an increasingly disruptive world? Find the right answers to these type of questions create actions in place that drive execution will be the most important work we have in front of us over the next few months. It would be the foundation to building our growth plan.
Even though our complete plan will not be ready until the end of spring, I would like to share some thinking on where we're driving towards and how we're going to build up the plan. We are working towards efficient center on becoming the most admired, aspirational and high-performing style brand in the world. And we will measure our progress to this division through brand strength, profitable sales growth and shareholder return. The foundation of our plan will be our commitment and focus on developing our brand, our teams and our customers.
There will be 2 main parts to our plan framework. The first will be the customer facing part of the brand, where we will evolve and strengthen the products, the marketing and the shopping experience. The second part will be to radically strengthen the underlying business engines. These engines will include developing a systematic, repeatable way of creating the strongest strong assortment, and more driven demand supply-chain and a holistic global expansion strategy, as well as a best-in-class consumer insights capability. Underlying all these initiatives are the strengthening of our team and the rightsizing of our cost structure. 
When it comes to our costs, we just have to become more competitive. The work we are undertaking is the work we need to do to build the company back to high-performance and position ourselves to lead an increasingly disruptive environment. It's complex work that will take time. We will show you the pacing through the plan we will present in late spring, and we showed progress every year. I know how critical it is to build and maintain the trust of our shareholders. This will require clear and consistent performance in communication going forward. I am committed to both. We are going to be laser-focused on transitioning our business back to excellence. 
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Chris."
362220,322203714,926370,"Ralph Lauren Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. Revenues in the third quarter were down 1% in constant currency and down 4% on a reported basis, below our guidance of 0% to 2% reported growth. Despite the sales shortfall, we were able to generate operating",532,"Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. Revenues in the third quarter were down 1% in constant currency and down 4% on a reported basis, below our guidance of 0% to 2% reported growth. Despite the sales shortfall, we were able to generate operating margin above our guidance range, due to both better expense management and a solid gross profit rate. 
The sales shortfall in the quarter was driven by our North America business, due to the above average temperatures that persisted for most of the fall and holiday selling period, a significant drop in foreign tourist traffic, challenges in the Lauren brand and general macroeconomic weakness. Our performance in international markets was much better as revenue grew 6% in constant currency outside of North America.
Let me provide you with more color on our performance by key geographies. Starting with Europe. Our revenue grew 8% in the third quarter in constant currency. Wholesale demand was particularly strong with robust sell-throughs that drove strong reorders. Our region, Northern and Central Europe, performed the best.
In Asia, third quarter revenue was up 3% in constant currency. While this growth rate is below the high single-digit growth rate we posted in the first half of the year, it was within our expectations. We reduced markdowns and the length of the sale period in Japan and Korea, our 2 key markets within Asia. This pressured sales growth in the quarter, however, drove gross margin improvement and gross profit growth. We believe these actions will continue to help us elevate the brand in this region.
Looking at performance by country. Hong Kong and Macau continued to under perform due to reduced tourist traffic, while Japan and Australia continued to outperform. As we spoke about previously, we implemented price increases in key international markets to help mitigate the negative margin impact from currency fluctuations. I want to provide some perspective on how that's gone.
In Japan, Australia and Canada, the pricing actions we have taken have been well-received by the customer, and we have continued to gain market share on these markets. In Europe, we raised prices for the cruise in Spring 2016 seasons. Early indications based on selling are encouraging, but it is too soon to have a definitive read on the consumer response.
Moving on to the Americas. Net revenue was down 4% in constant currency, below our expectations. While we anticipated a challenging holiday season given the slow start to fall, it was even more difficult than we expected. The silver lining of that comes from positive in store locations, where domestic customers represent more of the traffic similar to last quarter. As a result, we are optimistic that comps can show improvement as we begin to lap the foreign tourist traffic issues this coming summer. The sales challenges we faced in the third quarter are reflected in our operating margin guidance for the fourth quarter fiscal '16, as we are proactively clearing end-of-season inventories. We will carefully manage expenses to mitigate as much of the negative impact from these actions as possible.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob for a review of additional financial results and balance sheet dynamics."

Gross profit margin in the third quarter was 56.8%, excluding restructuring and other charges.

Gross profit margin in the third quarter was 56.8%, excluding restructuring and other charges. This was 20 basis points lower than the prior year period, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. On a constant currency basis, gross margin was up 30 basis points compared to the prior year period due to benefits from the initial phases of SKU and style rationalization, product cost negotiations and favorable mix shifts.
Operating margin in the third quarter was 13.7%, excluding restructuring and other charges, 180 basis points below the prior-year period. This is better than the November outlook we provided of a 200 to 250 basis point decline and was due to better expense management.
The lower operating margin year-over-year was primarily attributable to negative foreign currency effects, fixed expense deleverage and incremental investments and infrastructure. Net income for the third quarter was $193 million or $2.27 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and other charges. This compared to reported net income of $215 million or $2.41 per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. On a reported basis, net income was $131 million or $1.54 per diluted share in the third quarter. The effective tax rate was 25% in the third quarter, excluding restructuring and other charges, and was 28% on a reported basis. This was lower than our guidance of 31%, due primarily to discrete items recorded in the quarter and the effective tax rate of 29% in the prior year period.
Moving to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory was $1.3 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 5% year-over-year. This growth reflects investments to support sales growth for existing operations, new businesses and new store openings. At the end of the third quarter, we had 31 more directly operated stores and 85 additional concessions compared to the prior year period, which is contributing to the growth.
We ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $611 million in total debt. The company repurchased 803,000 shares of its common stock during the third quarter at a cost of $100 million. This brought year-to-date repurchases to $380 million.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Chris, who will provide guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2016 and some initial thoughts on fiscal 2017."

For the fourth quarter, we are taking proactive action to clear end-of-season inventories for fall and holiday in the U.S. so that we start the spring selling season in a strong position. As a result, we expect reported revenues to be flat to down 2% on a reported basis due to continued pressure from lower foreign tourist traffic, as well as higher allowances in the U.S. wholesale channel to move excess inventory. 
The fourth quarter includes the 53rd week, which we estimate will contribute approximately $65 million in revenue. We estimate the negative currency impact on sales growth in the fourth quarter to be approximately 150 basis points based on current exchange rates. Our operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 400 to 450 basis points below the prior year period, due to the proactive action we are taking on inventory in addition to infrastructure investments and negative foreign exchange impacts. The fourth quarter tax rate is estimated at 32%.
For the full year fiscal 2016 period, revenues are expected to decline approximately 3% on a reported basis with 400 basis points of negative impact from currency. This compares to our prior outlook of flat revenues on a reported basis and 400 basis points of foreign exchange impact. 
The full year fiscal '16 operating margin is now estimated to be 290 to 320 basis points below the prior year's level, which compares to our previous expectation of 180 to 230 basis point decline. This guidance excludes restructuring and other charges that are primarily related to restructuring activities associated with our global brand reorganization and a pending customs audit. We expect these restructuring charges to approximately $120 million to $150 million for fiscal 2016, excluding $34 million for pending customs audit. We recognized $42 million of this charge in the third quarter and $130 million in the first 9 months of fiscal 2016. We remain on track to deliver the $110 million of annual expense savings associated with our global brand restructuring effort. We will get a partial benefit this year and the entirety of the benefit in fiscal 2017.
Our fiscal 2016 tax rate is expected to be 28%. We continue to plan $400 million to $500 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 to support our global direct-to-consumer and infrastructure investments.
Now let me provide some initial thoughts on how we are thinking about fiscal 2017. We recently started the planning process for fiscal 2017, which as Stefan said, will include a deep dive into all aspects of the business. The plan will include the following key elements. First, we plan to rightsize and increase the quality of our distribution; second, we plan to intentionally reduce the depth of the inventory buy to decrease discount rates and promotional selling levels; and third, we plan to take significant action to improve the company's cost structure. While we are still working through the details, at this point, we expect fiscal 2017 total revenues to be down versus fiscal 2016 and operating margin to be up versus fiscal 2016, excluding restructuring and other charges.
The operating margin improvement will be despite an approximate $90 million negative operating income impact from foreign currency in fiscal 2017. We look forward to sharing more details on our outlook in late spring. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Stefan for some closing remarks."

Within the company, we see the current performance of the business as very disappointing and we have full focus across the whole organization to drive the business back to high performance. The challenges we are facing did not materialize overnight. They developed over years, and our solutions will take time as well. 
I want to be very clear. The growth journey we set out on is not to drive results next quarter, but rather position Ralph Lauren for success and relevance over the next decade and beyond. We have an opportunity to do something that we build Ralph Lauren stronger than ever before.
In a world where the customer is in charge, we will build everything we do around our customer's dream of a life well lit. We will give them access to authentic style, quality and specialness in all aspects of their life, and we will do this in a way that we build on what made us great and we involve it in new and innovative ways. I look forward to providing more specifics when we share our detail growth plan in late spring.
One thing is clear, I never have a stronger vision to build on. The combined strength of the brand of Ralph, one of the most iconic designers in the world, our talented team and my experience on driving high-performance in this industry makes me very excited for the future ahead. With the full support of Ralph, our Board of Directors, we will move forward to create significant shareholder value.

So when it comes to the brand, what excites me is that Ralph's original idea behind the brand when he created it, it was much bigger than apparel and it was much bigger than product. So it was about inviting the customers into an aspirational life, their aspirational life, and being a very consistent in offering authentic style, high-quality and deliver specialness in the experience. And if you look at the disruptive market today, I believe that that's exactly what you need to do to win. You need to be special. You need to deliver a value that goes beyond apparel. And it's -- if you look at the customer, the customer is now in charge. And the customer is living a busy life. And what excites me about the original brand vision and building that out and why I see so much potential in it is that we should deliver style to the customer. And we can do that, and we are known to do that and why we're so loved is because we have been so consistent in delivering authentic style, quality and specialness."

And when it comes to evolving assortment in terms of the balance of the assortment and in terms of sports and catering to the customer's different needs -- coming back to why I believe in the brand. I believe that we should give customers access to a life in style better than anyone else, and that means mirroring what their need is and how they build up their wardrobe. And we can do that more authentic, with higher quality and with more specialness than anybody else. And we could also -- and we should think in new ways and innovative ways of how we can utilize the disruptive world we are in to actually deliver that specialness to the customer in a way that excites and delights them, but also that makes it convenient for them.

Chris and Bob will then share financial results for the quarter and give you guidance going forward. I will then come back again to conclude the presentation part of the call and open up for your questions. 
But before we get going, I would like to take the opportunity to thank Ralph and the board for their partnership and trust that they have given me in leading this great company forward. 
Now let's start with how I've spent my first 3 months in the role. Over the last 90 days, I've done long travels. I've been to London, Paris, Geneva, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing and all over the U.S., including our distribution center in North Carolina. I've also met with our biggest customers. I've spent time with many influences in the industry, and I met with thousands of our team members across all functions and levels of the organization. And in many of these meetings, I received direct feedback from frontline team members and customers. The goal of the travel and meetings has been to learn as much as possible about our brand, our team, our customers and the environment we compete in. 
Parallel to the travel and meetings, the senior management team is in the process of conducting a formal and comprehensive assessment of our entire organization and every function we do. This review goes beyond the cost-savings initiatives and brand-planning processes that were underway when I joined. It covers all the value creators in the business from brand, product, marketing to supply chain distribution geographies as well as customers and competitors. The assessment in our multiyear growth strategy will be completed in the coming weeks and months, and I look forward to sharing that with you in next spring.
While it's still early days in the assessment, the picture is starting to develop on our strength and opportunities as well as a rough outline for how we will build our long-term growth plan. Let me start with our strengths.
Our brand, our team and the infrastructure we are building are by far our biggest strengths. Our brand is very strong and unique. Ralph and the team have built a brand on a dream of an aspirational life. In a way, it's the quintessential American dream, but it's bigger than that. It's a life in style that goes far beyond apparel. It's built on authentic style, quality and specialness. And it became the customer's dream and at its best is both highly aspirational and highly relatable at the same time. 
Right after I came in, we did a comprehensive brand study that confirms, not surprisingly, that our customers see our brand as one of the strongest in the industry. The strength, depth and uniqueness of our brand that Ralph created 48 years ago is a very strong platform to build on.
Another key strength we have is our team. Our team members, and I met many of them already, are highly dedicated. They're passionate, and they care deeply about our brand. They can't wait to get back to consistently beating our competitors, and there is a hunger for change that will be critical for realizing the full potential of this company. 
Finally, the infrastructure we are investing in, like SAP and our new e-commerce platform that will enable us to have best-in-class digital capabilities that's especially important in the world we're living in today. 
Moving to our opportunities. And here, I want to start with our performance trend over the last several years. Our recent financial performance has not been living up to the strength of our brand. It's been very disappointing on both on a top and a bottom line level. With this underwhelming performance, we are asking ourselves the tough questions needed to identify where the opportunities are to get back to leveraging our strength to consistently drive high performance.
In our assessment work, we started by asking the following questions, starting with brand: with our multiple brands, how do we increase focus on the brands where we have the biggest opportunity to win? Even though our brand is strong, how do we build on the authentic core of what we stand for and continuously evolve it? Relating to product and assortment. How do we improve the balance in our assortment? Do we have a systematic way of continuously strengthen our assortment? Relating to marketing. How do we focus our resources on cutting through in today's market? How do we evolve our brand voice in a way that makes our brand DNA stand out and excites and surprises the customer more than anyone else? We want our customers to love us more than anyone else. Relating to supply chain and inventory management. How do we shorten our lead times to be disrupted? How do we optimize our inventory in relation to sales? Relating to distribution and international expansion. How do we improve the quality of our distribution to be able to grow with high full price selling and lower discount levels? How do we strengthen our direct-to-consumer channels given where the market is going? How do we make our online channel show up the way it should and drive ground [ph] strength and profitable sales growth at the same time? How do we pursue our global growth potential in a much more strategic away? Relating to cost structure. How do we make the cost structure competitive with our best competitors? How do we make sure that we invest in a disciplined enough way for the future to get us the highest return on investment? Relating to customers. How do we get to those customers to know what our aspiration, wants and needs are? How do we engage and build enough long-term relationships with our customers? And finally, relating to the increasingly disruptive environment we're in. How do we strengthen the brand and develop the business model fast enough to succeed in an increasingly disruptive world? Finding the right answers to these type of questions, creating actions in place to drive execution will be the most important work we have in front of us over the next few months. It will be the foundation to living our growth plan.
Even though our complete plan will not be ready until the end of spring, I would like to share some thinking on where we're driving towards and how we're going to build out the plan. We are working towards a vision center on becoming the most admired, aspirational and high-performing style brand in the world. And we will measure our progress towards the vision through brand strength, profitable sales growth and shareholder return. The foundation of our plan will be our commitment and focus on developing our brand, our teams and our customers.
There will be 2 main parts to our planned framework. The first will be the customer-facing part of the brand, where we will evolve and strengthen the products, the marketing and the shopping experience. The second part will be to radically strengthen the underlying business engines. These engines will include developing a systematic, repeatable way of creating a stronger and stronger assortment, a more demand-driven supply chain and a holistic global expansion strategy as well as a best-in-class consumer insights capability. Underlying all these initiatives are the strengthening of our team and the rightsizing of our cost structure. 
When it comes to our costs, we just have to become more competitive. The work we are undertaking is the work we need to do to build the company back to high performance and position ourselves to lead in an increasingly disruptive environment. It's complex work that will take time. We will show you the pacing through the plan we will present in late spring, and we show progress every year. I know how critical it is to build and maintain the trust of our shareholders. This will require clear and consistent performance and communication going forward. I am committed to both. We are going to be laser-focused on transitioning our business back to excellence. 
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Chris."

The sales shortfall in the quarter was driven by our North America business due to the above-average temperatures that persisted for most of the fall and holiday selling period, a significant drop in foreign tourist traffic, challenges in the Lauren brand and general macroeconomic weakness. Our performance in international markets was much better as revenue grew 6% in constant currency outside of North America.
Let me provide you with more color on our performance by key geographies. Starting with Europe. Our revenue grew 8% in the third quarter in constant currency. Wholesale demand was particularly strong with robust sell-throughs that drove strong reorders. Our region, Northern and Central Europe, performed the best.
In Asia, third quarter revenue was up 3% in constant currency. While this growth rate is below the high single-digit growth rate we posted in the first half of the year, it was within our expectations. We reduced markdowns and the length of the sale period in Japan and Korea, our 2 key markets within Asia. This pressured sales growth in the quarter, however, drove gross margin improvement and gross profit growth. We believe these actions will continue to help us elevate the brand in this region.
Looking at performance by country. Hong Kong and Macau continued to underperform due to reduced tourist traffic, while Japan and Australia continued to outperform. As we spoke about previously, we implemented price increases in key international markets to help mitigate the negative margin impact from currency fluctuations. I want to provide some perspective on how that's gone.
In Japan, Australia and Canada, the pricing actions we have taken have been well received by the customer, and we have continued to gain market share on these markets. In Europe, we raised prices for the cruise in spring 2016 seasons. Early indications based on selling are Encouraging, but it is too soon to have a definitive read on the consumer response.
Moving on to the Americas. Net revenue was down 4% in constant currency, below our expectations. 
While we anticipated a challenging holiday season given the slow start to fall, it was even more difficult than we expected. The silver lining of that comps for positive in store locations where domestic customers represent more of the traffic similar to last quarter. As a result, we are optimistic that comps can show improvement as we begin to lap the foreign tourist traffic issues this coming summer. The sales challenges we faced in the third quarter are reflected in our operating margin guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal '16 as we are proactively clearing end-of-season inventories. We will carefully manage expenses to mitigate as much of the negative impact from these actions as possible.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob for a review of additional financial results and balance sheet dynamics."

Gross profit margin in the third quarter was 56.8%, excluding restructuring and other charges. This was 20 basis points lower than the prior-year period, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency effects.",387,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Gross profit margin in the third quarter was 56.8%, excluding restructuring and other charges. This was 20 basis points lower than the prior-year period, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. On a constant currency basis, gross margin was up 30 basis points compared to the prior-year period due to benefits from the initial phases of SKU and style rationalization, product cost negotiations and favorable mix shifts.
Operating margin in the third quarter was 13.7%, excluding restructuring and other charges, 180 basis points below the prior-year period. This is better than the November outlook we provided of a 200 to 250 basis point decline and was due to better expense management. The lower operating margin year-over-year was primarily attributable to negative foreign currency effects, fixed expense deleverage and incremental investments and infrastructure. 
Net income for the third quarter was $193 million or $2.27 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and other charges. This compared to reported net income of $215 million or $2.41 per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. On a reported basis, net income was $131 million or $1.54 per diluted share in the third quarter. The effective tax rate was 25% in the third quarter, excluding restructuring and other charges, and was 28% on a reported basis. This was lower than our guidance of 31% due primarily to discrete items recorded in the quarter and the effective tax rate of 29% in the prior-year period.
Moving to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory was $1.3 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 5% year-over-year. This growth reflects investments to support sales growth for existing operations, new businesses and new store openings. At the end of the third quarter, we had 31 more directly operated stores and 85 additional concessions compared to the prior-year period, which is contributing to the growth.
We ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $611 million in total debt. The company repurchased 803,000 shares of its common stock during the third quarter at a cost of $100 million. This brought year-to-date repurchases to $380 million.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Chris, who will provide guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2016 and some initial thoughts on fiscal 2017."

For the fourth quarter, we are taking proactive action to clear end-of-season inventories for fall and the holiday in the U.S. so that we start the spring selling season in a strong position. As a result, we expect reported revenues to be flat to down 2% on a reported basis due to continued pressure from lower foreign tourist traffic as well as higher allowances in the U.S. wholesale channel to move excess inventory. 
The fourth quarter includes the 53rd week, which we estimate will contribute approximately $65 million in revenue. We estimate the negative currency impact on sales growth in the fourth quarter to be approximately 150 basis points based on current exchange rates. Our operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 400 to 450 basis points below the prior-year period due to the proactive action we are taking on inventory in addition to infrastructure investments and negative foreign exchange impacts. The fourth quarter tax rate is estimated at 32%.
For the full year fiscal 2016 period, revenues are expected to decline approximately 3% on a reported basis with 400 basis points of negative impact from currency. This compares to our prior outlook of flat revenues on a reported basis and 400 basis points of foreign exchange impact. 
The full year fiscal '16 operating margin is now estimated to be 290 to 320 basis points below the prior year's level, which compares to our previous expectation of 180 to 230 basis point decline. This guidance excludes restructuring and other charges that are primarily related to restructuring activities associated with our global brand reorganization and a pending customs audit. We expect these restructuring charges to approximately $120 million to $150 million for fiscal 2016, excluding $34 million for a pending customs audit. We recognized $42 million of this charge in the third quarter and $113 million in the first 9 months of fiscal 2016. We remain on track to deliver the $110 million of annual expense savings associated with our global brand restructuring effort. We will get a partial benefit this year and the entirety of the benefit in fiscal 2017.
Our fiscal 2016 tax rate is expected to be 28%. We continue to plan $400 million to $500 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 to support our global direct-to-consumer and infrastructure investments.
Now let me provide some initial thoughts on how we were thinking about fiscal 2017. We recently started the planning process for fiscal 2017, which, as Stefan said, will include a deep dive into all aspects of the business. The plan will include the following key elements: first, we plan to rightsize and increase the quality of our distribution; second, we plan to intentionally reduce the depth of the inventory buy to decrease discount rates and promotional selling levels; and third, we plan to take significant action to improve the company's cost structure. While we are still working through the details, at this point, we expect fiscal 2017 total revenues to be down versus fiscal 2016 and operating margin to be up versus fiscal 2016, excluding restructuring and other charges.
The operating margin improvement will be despite an approximate $90 million negative operating income impact from foreign currency in fiscal 2017. We look forward to sharing more details on our outlook in late spring. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Stefan for some closing remarks."

Within the company, we see the current performance of the business as very disappointing, and we have full focus across the whole organization to drive the business back to high performance. The challenges we are facing did not materialize overnight. They developed over years, and our solutions will take time as well. 
I want to be very clear. The growth journey we set out on is not to drive results next quarter but rather position Ralph Lauren for success and relevance over the next decade and beyond. We have an opportunity to do something that will build Ralph Lauren stronger than ever before.
In a world where the customer is in charge, we will build everything we do around our customer's dream of a life well lived. We will give them access to authentic style, quality and specialness in all aspects of their life, and we will do this in a way that we build on what made us great, and we evolve it in new and innovative ways. I look forward to providing more specifics when we share our detail growth plan in late spring.
One thing is clear, I've never had a stronger vision to build on. The combined strength of the brand of Ralph, one of the most iconic designers in the world, our talented team and my experience of driving high performance in this industry makes me very excited for the future ahead. With the full support of Ralph, our Board of Directors, we will move forward to create significant shareholder value.
And with that, I would like to open out the call for your questions. Thank you."

We actually had a number of our store shut down, both in France and the U.K. for a few days, and we saw the shopping pull back. But it returned relatively quickly after that. And so that's how we were able to deliver a relatively strong result of the 8% constant currency top line growth despite that short-term disruption."

And it also makes me think about how Ralph has been 10, 15 years ahead of many, many macro trends because we were one of the first in the industry several years back in thinking about sport. And what we have to do now is we have to get close to the customer, and we have to evolve our offerings. So we reflect how they want to build their wardrobe."

In our fourth quarter guidance is reflected on the gross margin rate, a plan to increase markdown moneys and allowances to clear excess fall and holiday inventory, so that we start the spring selling season strong. So I would say that's really the driver and the gross margin trend in Q3 and Q4. With regard to FX and hedging, our hedging policy has not changed. It's consistent. And so we expect that current exchange rates to have a very small to nominal impact on translation next year in fiscal '17. But we will have a transactional impact, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. The combination of those 2, we expect to impact the results by about $90 million negatively as the favorable hedges -- we lap the favorable hedge benefit this year going into next year."

Chris and Bob will then share financial results for the quarter and give you guidance going forward. I will then come back again to conclude the presentation part of the call and open up for your questions. 
But before we get going, I would like to take the opportunity to thank Ralph and the board for their partnership and trust that they have given me in leading this great company forward. 
Now let's start with how I've spent my first 3 months in the role. Over the last 90 days, I've done long travels. I've been to London, Paris, Geneva, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing and all over the U.S., including our distribution center in North Carolina. I've also met with our biggest customers. I've spent time with many influencers in the industry, and I met with thousands of our team members across all functions and levels of the organization. And in many of these meetings, I received direct feedback from frontline team members and customers. The goal of the travel and meetings has been to learn as much as possible about our brand, our team, our customers and the environment we compete in. 
Parallel to the travel and meetings, the senior management team is in the process of conducting a formal and comprehensive assessment of our entire organization and every function we do. This review goes beyond the cost-savings initiatives and brand-planning processes that were underway when I joined. It covers all the value creators in the business from brand, product, marketing to supply chain distribution geographies as well as customers and competitors. The assessment in our multiyear growth strategy will be completed in the coming weeks and months, and I look forward to sharing that with you in late spring.
While it's still early days in the assessment, a picture is starting to develop on our strength and opportunities as well as a rough outline for how we will build our long-term growth plan. Let me start with our strengths.
Our brand, our team and the infrastructure we are building are by far our biggest strengths. Our brand is very strong and unique. Ralph and the team have built a brand on a dream of an aspirational life. In a way, it's the quintessential American dream, but it's bigger than that. It's a life in style that goes far beyond apparel. It's built on authentic style, quality and specialness. And it became the customer's dream and at its best is both highly aspirational and highly relatable at the same time. 
Right after I came in, we did a comprehensive brand study that confirms, not surprisingly, that our customers see our brand as one of the strongest in the industry. The strength, depth and uniqueness of our brand that Ralph created 48 years ago is a very strong platform to build on.
Another key strength we have is our team. Our team members, and I met many of them already, are highly dedicated. They're passionate, and they care deeply about our brand. They can't wait to get back to consistently beating our competitors, and there is a hunger for change that will be critical for realizing the full potential of this company. 
Finally, the infrastructure we are investing in, like SAP and our new e-commerce platform that will enable us to have best-in-class digital capabilities that's especially important in the world we're living in today. 
Moving to our opportunities. And here, I want to start with our performance trend over the last several years. Our recent financial performance has not been living up to the strength of our brand. It's been very disappointing on -- both on a top and a bottom line level. With this underwhelming performance, we are asking ourselves the tough questions needed to identify where the opportunities are to get back to leveraging our strength to consistently drive high performance.
In our assessment work, we started by asking the following questions, starting with brand: With our multiple brands, how do we increase focus on the brands where we have the biggest opportunity to win? Even though our brand is strong, how do we build on the authentic core of what we stand for and continuously evolve it? Relating to product and assortment. How do we improve the balance in our assortment? Do we have a systematic way of continuously strengthen our assortment? Relating to marketing. How do we focus our resources on cutting through in today's market? How do we evolve our brand voice in a way that makes our brand DNA stand out and excites and surprises the customer more than anyone else? We want our customers to love us more than anyone else. Relating to supply chain and inventory management: How do we shorten our lead times to be disruptive? How do we optimize our inventory in relation to sales? Relating to distribution and international expansion: How do we improve the quality of our distribution to be able to grow with higher full price selling and lower discount levels? How do we strengthen our direct-to-consumer channels given where the market is going? How do we make our online channel show up the way it should and drive brand strength and profitable sales growth at the same time? How do we pursue our global growth potential in a much more strategic away? Relating to cost structure: How do we make the cost structure competitive with our best competitors? How do we make sure that we invest in a disciplined enough way for the future to give us the highest return on investment? Relating to customers: How do we get closer to our customers to know what their aspiration, wants and needs are? How do we engage and build enough long-term relationships with our customers? And finally, relating to the increasingly disruptive environment we're in: How do we strengthen the brand and develop the business model fast enough to succeed in an increasingly disruptive world? Finding the right answers to these type of questions, putting actions in place to drive execution will be the most important work we have in front of us over the next few months. It will be the foundation to building our growth plan.
Even though our complete plan will not be ready until the end of spring, I would like to share some thinking on where we're driving towards and how we're going to build out the plan. We are working towards a vision centered on becoming the most admired, aspirational and high-performing style brand in the world. And we will measure our progress towards the vision through brand strength, profitable sales growth and shareholder return. The foundation of our plan will be our commitment and focus on developing our brand, our teams and our customers.
There will be 2 main parts to our plan framework. The first will be the customer-facing part of the brand, where we will evolve and strengthen the products, the marketing and the shopping experience. The second part will be to radically strengthen the underlying business engines. These engines will include developing a systematic, repeatable way of creating a stronger and stronger assortment, a more demand-driven supply chain and a holistic global expansion strategy as well as a best-in-class consumer insights capability. Underlying all these initiatives are the strengthening of our team and the rightsizing of our cost structure. 
When it comes to our costs, we just have to become more competitive. The work we are undertaking is the work we need to do to build the company back to high performance and position ourselves to lead in an increasingly disruptive environment. It's complex work that will take time. We will show you the pacing through the plan we will present in late spring, and we'll show progress every year. I know how critical it is to build and maintain the trust of our shareholders. This will require clear and consistent performance and communication going forward. I am committed to both. We are going to be laser-focused on transitioning our business back to excellence. 
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Chris."

Revenues in the third quarter were down 1% in constant currency and down 4% on a reported basis, below our guidance of 0% to 2% reported growth. Despite the sales shortfall, we were able to generate operating",533,"Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. Revenues in the third quarter were down 1% in constant currency and down 4% on a reported basis, below our guidance of 0% to 2% reported growth. Despite the sales shortfall, we were able to generate operating margin above our guidance range due to both better expense management and a solid gross profit rate.  The sales shortfall in the quarter was driven by our North America business due to the above-average temperatures that persisted for most of the fall and holiday selling period, a significant drop in foreign tourist traffic, challenges in the Lauren brand and general macroeconomic weakness. Our performance in international markets was much better as revenue grew 6% in constant currency outside of North America.
Let me provide you with more color on our performance by key geographies. Starting with Europe. Our revenue grew 8% in the third quarter in constant currency. Wholesale demand was particularly strong with robust sell-throughs that drove strong reorders. By region, Northern and Central Europe performed the best.
In Asia, third quarter revenue was up 3% in constant currency. While this growth rate is below the high single-digit growth rate we posted in the first half of the year, it was within our expectations. We reduced markdowns and the length of the sale period in Japan and Korea, our 2 key markets within Asia. This pressured sales growth in the quarter, however, it drove gross margin improvement and gross profit growth. We believe these actions will continue to help us elevate the brand in this region.
Looking at performance by country. Hong Kong and Macau continued to underperform due to reduced tourist traffic, while Japan and Australia continued to outperform. As we spoke about previously, we implemented price increases in key international markets to help mitigate the negative margin impact from currency fluctuations. I want to provide some perspective on how that's gone.
In Japan, Australia and Canada, the pricing actions we have taken have been well received by the customer, and we have continued to gain market share in these markets. In Europe, we raised prices for the cruise and spring 2016 seasons. Early indications based on selling are encouraging, but it is too soon to have a definitive read on the consumer response.
Moving on to the Americas. Net revenue was down 4% in constant currency, below our expectations. 
While we anticipated a challenging holiday season given the slow start to fall, it was even more difficult than we expected. The silver lining is that comps were positive in store locations where domestic customers represent more of the traffic, similar to last quarter. As a result, we are optimistic that comps can show improvement as we begin to lap the foreign tourist traffic issues this coming summer. The sales challenges we faced in the third quarter are reflected in our operating margin guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal '16 as we are proactively clearing end-of-season inventories. We will carefully manage expenses to mitigate as much of the negative impact from these actions as possible.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob for a review of additional financial results and balance sheet dynamics."

Gross profit margin in the third quarter was 56.8%, excluding restructuring and other charges. This was 20 basis points lower than the prior-year period, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. On a constant currency basis, gross margin was up 30 basis points compared to the prior-year period due to benefits from the initial phases of SKU and style rationalization, product cost negotiations and favorable mix shifts.
Operating margin in the third quarter was 13.7%, excluding restructuring and other charges, 180 basis points below the prior-year period. This is better than the November outlook we provided of a 200 to 250 basis point decline and was due to better expense management. The lower operating margin year-over-year was primarily attributable to negative foreign currency effects, fixed expense deleverage and incremental investments in infrastructure. 
Net income for the third quarter was $193 million or $2.27 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and other charges. This compared to reported net income of $215 million or $2.41 per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. On a reported basis, net income was $131 million or $1.54 per diluted share in the third quarter. The effective tax rate was 25% in the third quarter, excluding restructuring and other charges, and was 28% on a reported basis. This was lower than our guidance of 31% due primarily to discrete items recorded in the quarter and the effective tax rate of 29% in the prior-year period.
Moving to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory was $1.3 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 5% year-over-year. This growth reflects investments to support sales growth for existing operations, new businesses and new store openings. At the end of the third quarter, we had 31 more directly operated stores and 85 additional concessions compared to the prior-year period, which is contributing to the growth.
We ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $611 million in total debt. The company repurchased 803,000 shares of its common stock during the third quarter at a cost of $100 million. This brought year-to-date repurchases to $380 million.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Chris, who will provide guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2016 and some initial thoughts on fiscal 2017."

For the fourth quarter, we are taking proactive action to clear end-of-season inventories for fall and the holiday in the U.S. so that we start the spring selling season in a strong position. As a result, we expect reported revenues to be flat to down 2% on a reported basis due to continued pressure from lower foreign tourist traffic as well as higher allowances in the U.S. wholesale channel to move excess inventory. 
The fourth quarter includes the 53rd week, which we estimate will contribute approximately $65 million in revenue. We estimate the negative currency impact on sales growth in the fourth quarter to be approximately 150 basis points based on current exchange rates. Our operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 400 to 450 basis points below the prior-year period due to the proactive action we are taking on inventory in addition to infrastructure investments and negative foreign exchange impacts. The fourth quarter tax rate is estimated at 32%.
For the full year fiscal 2016 period, revenues are expected to decline approximately 3% on a reported basis with 400 basis points of negative impact from currency. This compares to our prior outlook of flat revenues on a reported basis and 400 basis points of foreign exchange impact. 
The full year fiscal '16 operating margin is now estimated to be 290 to 320 basis points below the prior year's level, which compares to our previous expectation of 180 to 230 basis point decline. This guidance excludes restructuring and other charges that are primarily related to restructuring activities associated with our global brand reorganization and a pending customs audit. We expect these restructuring charges to -- approximately $120 million to $150 million for fiscal 2016, excluding $34 million for a pending customs audit. We recognized $42 million of this charge in the third quarter and $113 million in the first 9 months of fiscal 2016. We remain on track to deliver the $110 million of annual expense savings associated with our global brand restructuring effort. We will get a partial benefit this year and the entirety of the benefit in fiscal 2017.
Our fiscal 2016 tax rate is expected to be 28%. We continue to plan $400 million to $500 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 to support our global direct-to-consumer and infrastructure investments.
Now let me provide some initial thoughts on how we are thinking about fiscal 2017. We recently started the planning process for fiscal 2017, which, as Stefan said, will include a deep dive into all aspects of the business. The plan will include the following key elements: first, we plan to rightsize and increase the quality of our distribution; second, we plan to intentionally reduce the depth of the inventory buy to decrease discount rates and promotional selling levels; and third, we plan to take significant action to improve the company's cost structure. While we are still working through the details, at this point we expect fiscal 2017 total revenues to be down versus fiscal 2016 and operating margin to be up versus fiscal 2016, excluding restructuring and other charges.
The operating margin improvement will be despite an approximate $90 million negative operating income impact from foreign currency in fiscal 2017. We look forward to sharing more details on our outlook in late spring. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Stefan for some closing remarks."

Within the company, we see the current performance of the business as very disappointing, and we have full focus across the whole organization to drive the business back to high performance. The challenges we are facing did not materialize overnight. They developed over years, and our solutions will take time as well. 
I want to be very clear. The growth journey we set out on is not to drive results next quarter but rather position Ralph Lauren for success and relevance over the next decade and beyond. We have an opportunity to do something that will build Ralph Lauren stronger than ever before.
In a world where the customer is in charge, we will build everything we do around our customer's dream of a life well lived. We will give them access to authentic style, quality and specialness in all aspects of their life, and we will do this in a way that will build on what made us great, and we evolve it in new and innovative ways. I look forward to providing more specifics when we share our detailed growth plan in late spring.
One thing is clear, I've never had a stronger vision to build on. The combined strength of the brand, of Ralph, one of the most iconic designers in the world, our talented team and my experience of driving high performance in this industry makes me very excited for the future ahead. With the full support of Ralph, our Board of Directors, we will move forward to create significant shareholder value.
And with that, I would like to open out the call for your questions. Thank you."

So when I look at the brand, it's one of the strongest in the industry. And when I looked at our performance over the last couple of years, including the recent quarters, it's very disappointing. So I see significant untapped value in both the idea behind the brand and as well as how we drive the business. And therefore, I -- and the way I outlined, the way we approach, building the growth plan for the future, there will be a customer-facing component, which is about evolving the brand, evolving our product, marketing, shopping experience; and then radically improve some of our business engines.

And I believe we have opportunities in being -- taking a holistic expansion approach to our brand and our business, and by doing that, unlock even more brand strength and unlock even more value in terms of driving profitable sales growth."

Let me start by saying we are making progress in setting and beginning to execute our strategy to return Ralph Lauren Corporation to profitable growth. In doing that, we will balance driving near-term performance with our long-term vision. I look forward to doing a deep dive on our plan and providing a Q1 and fiscal 2017 outlook, as well as discussing how plan will translate into long-term financial performance at our Investor Day on June 7. 
When we last spoke, I shared with you how I spent my first 3 months in the role, my initial observations in the Ralph Lauren line and my approach to building the growth plans for this great company. Today, I will provide an overview of our main priorities and recent performance before turning the call over to Bob to discuss the Q4 and fiscal year financial results in more detail. 
In recent months, while I've been working hard to drive the business here and now, I've also worked closely with our teams to complete the comprehensive review of the business and develop the strategic plan. Through that work, we have gained a very clear understanding of the underlying drivers of the current performance and we now have a detailed view of what's driving the downward trend. 
In short, we have not focused enough on nor evolved enough to core of what make us great, in product, marketing and the shopping experience. In addition, our underlying business edges are not quite at full-speed. We also have an inefficient cost structure and an organization that's not nimble enough in the marketplace. What made us great was a crystal clear focus on owning classic, iconic style and putting an approach twist to it to make it current and desirable. We will become more true to our core, focused assortment on creating the best iconic style in the market and evolve the way we twist it so it becomes more desirable for today. 
Iconic style made current has never been more relevant. While staying true to our D&A, we will also evolve our marketing and the shopping experience to better reflect the aspirational life and style people dream of today. We have many unique strengths to build on. These include our brand strength, being the original for aspirational, authentic, American and iconic style, very strong share position, a talented team and a solid infrastructure. 
In our diagnosis of the business, I've been deeply embedded with our global teams who create the customer offering. These are the teams that create our products, marketing and shopping experience, as well as one  the inventory management sourcing and supply chain, the core value creating drivers in our business. They must provide our regions and channels with a consumer offering we need to win versus our best competitors.
I've done this deep dive to understand how we create our offering and will drive the underperformance of today. What I learned is encouraging because we now know what we need to do differently, and we have a clear line of sight to improving the way we connect with consumers and operate the business. 
From most of my 18-year career in this industry, I've lead teams through the process of tanning creative energy and talent into high-performance businesses. I know the value driving components of the creative processes from my time with H&M and then in turning around Old Navy. I'm excited to see so much untapped potential at Ralph Lauren, and we will leverage our brand mission into much stronger consumer offering. 
This offering will be built by evolving our brand voice, our products, our marketing and our shopping experience. In parallel, we're developing stronger underlying business engines, rightsizing our cost structure and strengthening our leadership team. Getting these elements right will help us connect more with our existing consumers, expand our reach to new consumers and return the business to strong growth over time. An important part of getting back to high-performance is strengthening our leadership team on both the design and operational side of the business. I'm pleased with how we're starting to come together here. We're recruiting new talent and challenging our top performance with standard goals. A few examples of Valerie Herman, Frederick Elmers and how à la costs. Valérie has been with Ralph Lauren for a little over 2 years and has started to build the foundation that will strengthen our luxury business. She has decades of experience in luxury, including CEO of U Celeron and head of women's wear for Dior. She has built a track record of strengthening brands and driving high performance and luxury. She has unique experience in working to commercialized design and drive profitable growth. We have there for recently expanded Valérie's role as brand president to now also include Lauren, Polo Women's, Chaps and Denim & Supply. 
Frederick Elmers joined us in April in the newly created role of Senior Vice President, Global Expansion and Business Development. He has 7 years of experience leading high-performance global expansion to new markets within the H&M group. Frederick will be responsible for globally leading the work to create the and execute the strongest possible multi-brand and multichannel distribution and expansion strategy for the company, which is one of the core components in our growth plan. 
Holiday Alagos is joining our team in June as Head of Global sourcing. She has 18 years of sourcing driving high performance within production and sourcing for H&M and her track record is stellar. Holiday has been a key driver for H&M's stability to make sourcing a competitive advantage and she created a tremendous amount of value for them. We're looking forward to Holiday coming on board as we develop a best-in-class sourcing strategy. 
We will continue to strengthen our team in the months and years ahead, and I'm happy to say that our teams are aligned and excited about where we're going and how we're going to get there. We will move this company into the future in a way that excites our consumers, beats our competitors and drives value for the company and shareholders. 
One way Ralph made this company great was by being an entrepreneur, and that's what we're going back to. We're going to move fast to begin executing our growth strategy, continuously learn and improve, get closer to the consumer and get back to high performance. Now let me turn to a few key takeaways from our fourth quarter results. 
As you saw in the press release, net revenues were in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter, down 1% on a reported basis and flat in constant currency. The key driver for the top line performance in the fourth quarter was, as expected, pressure in North America, which was offset by growth in international markets. Following a challenging fall and holiday seasons, we were focused on clearing end-of-seasons inventories across our channels of distribution in the U.S, I've been focusing much of my time on our U.S. business. I've been working closely with our key customers in the market. 
As we look to fiscal 2017, we are planning our inventory receipts very carefully in the U.S. for both the wholesale and retail channels. Our strategic plan will address the issues in our core U.S. market. Moving on to our profitability. 
Q4 gross margin was pressured by the inventory clearance activity in the U.S. and continued foreign currency impact. Our operating margin was down significantly, but better than our guidance driven by strong expense management. While I'm feeling relatively good about how we manage expenses, I want to make it clear that I see this kind of operating income declined as unacceptable. 
We have significant opportunity to further reduce cost and reinvest some of those savings in engines that will drive brand strength and profitable sales growth. 
Before I turn it over to Bob for the details of our financial's performance in the quarter and fiscal 2016, I want to reiterate that we are looking forward to sharing our strategic growth plan in detail with you at our upcoming Investor Day. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob."
362220,330708489,982634,"Ralph Lauren Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, May 12, 2016",2016-05-12,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter net revenues were flat with the prior year period on a constant currency basis and declined 1% on a reported basis to $1.9 billion. This is in line with the guidance we provided in February of",1408,"Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter net revenues were flat with the prior year period on a constant currency basis and declined 1% on a reported basis to $1.9 billion. This is in line with the guidance we provided in February of a flat to 2% decline on a reported basis. 
Negative FX impact of revenue growth was approximately 110 basis points, slightly better than our expectation of 150 basis points of negative impact as foreign currencies move favorably during the quarter. 
The company's fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 included a 53rd week that contributed approximately $70 million in sales and was primarily generated within the retail segment. For the full year fiscal 2016 period, net revenues grew 1% in constant currency and declined 3% on a reported basis to $7.4 billion. Gross profit margin was 54.4% in the fourth quarter, excluding restructuring charges. This was 90 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting proactive measures taken in the U.S. to clear industries and inventories related to the fall season in addition to unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
For the full year fiscal 2016 period, gross margin declined 70 basis points to 56.8% excluding restructuring charges due to negative foreign currency impacts, which is partially offset by a favorable sales mix shift to the retail segment. Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 6.4%, excluding restructuring and other charges. This was 370 basis points below the prior year due to gross margin pressure, unfavorable foreign currency effects and incremental investments in infrastructure and marketing. 
However, operating margin was better than the outlook we provided in February of 400 to 450 basis point decline. This was due to disciplined expense management throughout the organization. 
For the full year fiscal 2016 period, operating margin declined 290 basis points to 10.7%, excluding restructuring and other charges, due to gross margin pressure, fixed expense deleverage, unfavorable foreign currency effects and incremental investments in infrastructure and new stores. Net income for the fourth quarter was $74 million or $0.88 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and other charges. 
On a reported basis, net income in the fourth quarter was $41 million or $0.49 per diluted share. For the full year period, net income was $546 million or $6.36 per diluted share excluding restructuring and other charges. The effective tax rate of 34% in the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis was higher than the guidance of 32% due to one-time discrete items and compared to an effective tax rate of 28% in the prior year period. Moving on to segment performance. 
Wholesale revenues decreased 5% in constant currency in the fourth quarter and 6% on a reported basis to $942 million. This was primarily due to a decline in North America as business trends remain challenging. We are refining our product assortments and deliveries for fiscal 2017 to improve trends in this channel in what is a very challenging environment. Wholesale operating margin in the fourth quarter was 27.2% excluding restructuring and other charges. This was 350 basis points below the prior year period due to proactive measures taken in the U.S. to clear indices and inventories related to the fall season and negative foreign currency effects. 
Retail segments sales rose 7% in constant currency and 6% on a reported basis to $889 million. Growth was driven by the benefit of a 53rd week of sales, new store expansion and e-commerce growth. On a 13 to 13-week basis, consolidated comparable store sales decreased 5% in constant currency and 6% as reported during the fourth quarter. 
Brick-and-mortar traffic trends remain negative in the U.S. Sales to foreign tourists were down approximately 25% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and for the full year. e-commerce revenue was up mid single-digits on a global basis in the fourth quarter supported by the 53rd week, while comps were up slightly on the 13 to 13-week basis. 
We continue to expect to move to our new e-commerce platform later this fiscal year. The new platform will not only improve the functionality of our site, but will allow us to improve how we engage with our customers digitally and across our retail channels. We believe this will dramatically improve the customer's experience on mobile devices. We look forward to delivering a best-in-class site experience. 
At year-end, we had 493 directly operated stand-alone stores and 583 concessions globally. That represents an increase of 27 net new directly operated stores and 47 concession shops when compared to the end of fiscal 2015. In addition, our international licensing partners operated 93 Ralph Lauren stores and 42 dedicated shops, as well as 58 Club Monaco stores and 75 Club Monaco concession shops at the end of fiscal 2016. 
Retail operating margin in the fourth quarter, excluding restructuring and other charges, was 2.4%, which was 100 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting proactive measures taken to clear end-of-season inventories in the U.S. in addition in negative foreign currency effects. 
Licensing revenues increased 8% and operating income was up 9% in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher royalties from increased sales of Ralph Lauren, Polo Ralph Lauren and Lauren products worldwide. Now let me provide some color on performance by geography in the quarter. 
In the Americas, net revenue declined 1% in constant currency, driven by pressure in our North America business that we spoke about previously. Same-store sales were down mid single-digits in the fourth quarter. In Europe, net revenues were up 4% in constant currency. We continue to experience strong sell-through rates in our retail partners across mall of our brands and same-store sales were positive in our own retail stores. 
In Asia, net revenue growth of 3% in constant currency was muted by decline in same-store sales, which was negatively impacted by our strategy to reduce markdowns in Japan and Korea, our 2 key markets in Asia. We experienced gross margin improvement and our average unit retails were up strong double digits in Japan and Korea and our markdown rates were down significantly. We believe that these actions will continue to help us elevate the brand and drive profitable sales growth in this region. 
Now let me provide you with an update on our restructuring activities related to the global brand management issue. The total restructuring charge for fiscal 2016 was $142 million. In addition, we incurred another $22 million of impairment related to underperforming stores subject to potential future closure. We now expect to deliver approximately $125 million of annual cost savings from the fiscal 2016 global reorganization plan. $15 million higher than the $110 million that we communicated previously. This is driven by digital restructuring activities we identified and executed late in the fiscal year. 
We had a part year benefit in fiscal 2016 from our restructuring activities and will have a full year benefit in fiscal 2017. Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory was $1.1 billion at the end of the fiscal year, up 8% year-over-year. This growth reflects investments to support new stores and concession shops and a change in the time of receipt plans. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had 27 more directly operated stores and 47 more concession shops than 1 year ago, which is contributing to the growth. 
Moving to capital expenditures. We spent $418 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $391 million in fiscal 2015, mostly to support new retail stores, concession shops and in hooray projects. The company repurchased 1.2 million shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter at a cost of $100 million. This brought our total buyback activity to 4.2 million shares for a total cost of $480 million for the full year. 
In addition, we returned $170 million of shareholders via dividend payments. Yesterday, the company's Board of Directors authorized an additional $200 million stock repurchase program. This amount is an additional to the $100 million available at the end of the fourth quarter fiscal 2016 as part of a previously authorized stock repurchase program, bring the company's total current authorization to $300 million. We ended the year with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $713 million of total debt. Looking out to fiscal 2017, as Stefan mentioned, we plan in provide financial guidance at our investor's day on June 7 for the new fiscal year, as well as of the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 
With that, we'll open the call for your questions."

And when I -- I can give high level thoughts on supply chain, which is that I see big opportunities to start there and in 2 areas. Both inventory management part and the lead time part. So in essence, I see opportunities to sell more with less inventory. And I also see an opportunity to drastically increase our speed and our flexibility. So that will help us when we evolve the consumer facing offering."

Let me start by saying we're making progress in setting and beginning to execute our strategy to return Ralph Lauren Corporation to profitable growth. In doing that, we will balance driving near-term performance with our long-term vision. I look forward to doing a deep dive on our plan and providing a Q1 and fiscal 2017 outlook, as well as discussing how plan will translate into long-term financial performance at our Investor Day on June 7. 
When we last spoke, I shared with you how I spent my first 3 months in the role, my initial observations and a rough outline of my approach to building the growth plan for this great company. Today, I will provide an overview of our main priorities and recent performance before turning the call over to Bob to discuss the Q4 and fiscal year financial results in more detail. 
In recent months, while I've been working hard to drive the business here and now, I've also worked closely with our teams to complete a comprehensive review of the business and develop a strategic plan. Through that work, we have gained a very clear understanding of the underlying drivers of the current performance, and we now have a detailed view of what's driving the downward trend. 
In short, we have not focused enough on nor evolved enough to core of what made us great, in product, marketing and the shopping experience. In addition, our underlying business engines are not running at full speed. We also have an inefficient cost structure and an organization that's not nimble enough in the marketplace. 
What made us great was a crystal clear focus on owning classic, iconic style and putting an effortless twist to it to make it current and desirable. We will become more true to our core focused assortment on creating the best iconic style in the market and evolve the way we twist it so it becomes more desirable for today. Iconic style made current has never been more relevant. While staying true to our DNA, we will also evolve our marketing and the shopping experience to better reflect the aspirational life and style people dream of today. 
We have many unique strengths to build on. These include our brand strength, being the original for aspirational, authentic American and iconic style, a very strong share position, a talented team and a solid infrastructure. 
In our diagnosis of the business, I've been deeply embedded with our global teams who create the customer offering. These are the teams that create our products, marketing and shopping experience as well as run the inventory management sourcing and supply chain, the core value creating drivers in our business. They must provide our regions and channels with a consumer offering we need to win versus our best competitors. I've done this deep dive to understand how we create our offering and what drives the underperformance of today. What I learned is encouraging because we now know what we need to do differently, and we have a clear line of sight to improving the way we connect with consumers and operate the business. 
From most of my 18-year career in this industry, I've led teams through the process of turning creative energy and talent into high-performance businesses. I know the value-driving components of the creative processes from my time with H&M and then in turning around Old Navy. 
I'm excited to see so much untapped potential at Ralph Lauren, and we will leverage our brand vision into a much stronger consumer offering. This offering will be built by evolving our brand voice, our products, our marketing and our shopping experience. In parallel, we're developing stronger underlying business engines, rightsizing our cost structure and strengthening our leadership team. Getting these elements right will help us connect more with our existing consumers, expand our reach to new consumers and return the business to strong growth over time. 
An important part of getting back to high performance is strengthening our leadership team on both the design and operation side of the business. I'm pleased with how we're starting to come together here. We're recruiting new talent and challenging our top performers with expanded roles. A few examples of Valérie Hermann, Fredrik Hjalmers and Halide Alagöz. 
Valérie has been with Ralph Lauren for a little over 2 years and has started to build the foundation that will strengthen our luxury business. She has decades of experience in luxury, including CEO of Yves Saint Laurent and head of women's ready to wear for Dior. She has built a track record of strengthening brands and driving high performance in luxury. She has unique experience in working through commercialized design and drive profitable growth. We have, therefore, recently expanded Valérie's role as Brand President to now also include Lauren, Polo Women's, Chaps and Denim & Supply. 
Fredrik Hjalmers joined us in April in the newly created role of Senior Vice President, Global Expansion and Business Development. He has 7 years of experience leading high performance global expansion to new markets within the H&M group. Fredrik will be responsible for globally leading the work to create and execute the strongest possible multi-brand and multichannel distribution and expansion strategy for the company, which is one of the core components in our growth plan. 
Halide Alagöz is joining our team in June as Head of Global Sourcing. She has 18 years of experience driving high performance within production and sourcing for H&M, and her track record is stellar. Halide has been a key driver for H&M's stability to make sourcing a competitive advantage, and she created a tremendous amount of value for them. We're looking forward to Halide coming onboard as we develop a best-in-class sourcing strategy. 
We will continue to strengthen our team in the months and years ahead, and I'm happy to say that our teams are aligned and excited about where we're going and how we're going to get there. We will move this company into the future in a way that excites our consumers, beats our competitors and drives value for the company and shareholders. 
One way Ralph made this company great was by being an entrepreneur, and that's what we're going back to. We're going to move fast to begin executing our growth strategy, continuously learn and improve, get closer to the consumer and get back to high performance. 
Now let me turn to a few key takeaways from our fourth quarter results. As you saw in the press release, net revenues were in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter, down 1% on a reported basis and flat in constant currency. The key driver for the top line performance in the fourth quarter was, as expected, pressure in North America, which was offset by growth in international markets. 
Following a challenging fall and holiday seasons, we were focused on clearing end-of-seasons inventories across our channels of distribution in the U.S. I've been focusing much of my time on our U.S. business. I've been working closely with our key customers in the market. As we look to fiscal 2017, we are planning our inventory receipts very carefully in the U.S. for both the wholesale and retail channels. Our strategic plan will address the issues in our core U.S. market. 
Moving on to our profitability. Q4 gross margin was pressured by the inventory clearance activity in the U.S. and continued foreign currency impact. Our operating margin was down significantly but better than our guidance, driven by strong expense management. While I'm feeling relatively good about how we managed the expenses, I want to make it clear that I see this kind of operating income decline as unacceptable. We have significant opportunity to further reduce cost and reinvest some of those savings in engines that will drive brand strength and profitable sales growth. 
Before I turn it over to Bob for the details of our financial performance in the quarter and fiscal 2016, I want to reiterate that we're looking forward to sharing our strategic growth plan in detail with you at our upcoming Investor Day. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob."

Fourth quarter net revenues were flat with the prior year period on a constant currency basis and declined 1% on a reported basis to $1.9 billion. This is in line with the guidance we provided in February of a flat to 2% decline on a reported basis. the negative FX impact to revenue growth was approximately 110 basis points, slightly better than our expectation of 150 basis points of negative impact as foreign currencies move favorably during the quarter. The company's fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 included a 53rd week that contributed approximately $70 million in sales and was primarily generated within the retail segment. For the full year fiscal 2016 period, net revenues grew 1% in constant currency and declined 3% on a reported basis to $7.4 billion. 
Gross profit margin was 54.4% in the fourth quarter, excluding restructuring charges. This was 90 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting proactive measures taken in the U.S. to clear end-of-season inventories related to the fall season in addition to unfavorable foreign currency effects. For the full year fiscal 2016 period, gross margin declined 70 basis points to 56.8%, excluding restructuring charges, due to negative foreign currency impacts, which was partially offset by a favorable sales mix shift to the retail segment. 
Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 6.4%, excluding restructuring and other charges. This was 370 basis points below the prior year due to gross margin pressure, unfavorable foreign currency effects and incremental investments in infrastructure and marketing. However, operating margin was better than the outlook we provided in February of a 400 to 450 basis point decline. This was due to disciplined expense management throughout the organization. For the full year fiscal 2016 period, operating margin declined 290 basis points to 10.7%, excluding restructuring and other charges, due to gross margin pressure, fixed expense deleverage, unfavorable foreign currency effects and incremental investments in infrastructure and new stores. 
Net income for the fourth quarter was $74 million or $0.88 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and other charges. On a reported basis, net income in the fourth quarter was $41 million or $0.49 per diluted share. For the full year period, net income was $546 million or $6.36 per diluted share excluding restructuring and other charges. The effective tax rate of 34% in the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis was higher than the guidance of 32% due to onetime discrete items and compared to an effective tax rate of 28% in the prior year period. 
Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues decreased 5% in constant currency in the fourth quarter and 6% on a reported basis to $942 million. This was primarily due to a decline in North America as business trends remained challenging. We are refining our product assortments and deliveries for fiscal 2017 to improve trends in this channel in what is a very challenging environment. Wholesale operating margin in the fourth quarter was 27.2%, excluding restructuring and other charges. This was 350 basis points below the prior year period due to proactive measures taken in the U.S. to clear end-of-season inventories related to the fall season and negative foreign currency effects. 
Retail segment sales rose 7% in constant currency and 6% on a reported basis to $889 million. Growth was driven by the benefit of a 53rd week of sales, new store expansion and e-commerce growth. On a 13 to 13 week basis, consolidated comparable store sales decreased 5% in constant currency and 6% as reported during the fourth quarter. Brick-and-mortar traffic trends remain negative in the U.S. Sales to foreign tourists were down approximately 25% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and for the full year. e-commerce revenue was up mid-single digits on a global basis in the fourth quarter, supported by the 53rd week, while comps were up slightly on a 13 to 13 week basis. 
We continue to expect to move to our new e-commerce platform later this fiscal year. The new platform will not only improve the functionality of our site but will allow us to improve how we engage with our customers digitally and across our retail channels. We believe this will dramatically improve the customer's experience on mobile devices. We look forward to delivering a best-in-class site experience. 
At year-end, we had 493 directly operated stand-alone stores and 583 concessions globally. That represents an increase of 27 net new directly operated stores and 47 concession shops when compared to the end of fiscal 2015. In addition, our international licensing partners operated 93 Ralph Lauren stores and 42 dedicated shops as well as 58 Club Monaco stores and 75 Club Monaco concession shops at the end of fiscal 2016. 
Retail operating margin in the fourth quarter, excluding restructuring and other charges, was 2.4%, which was 100 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting proactive measures taken to clear end-of-season inventories in the U.S. in addition to negative foreign currency effects. Licensing revenues increased 8%, and operating income was up 9% in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher royalties from increased sales of Ralph Lauren, Polo Ralph Lauren and Lauren products worldwide. 
Now let me provide some color on performance by geography in the quarter. In the Americas, net revenue declined 1% in constant currency, driven by pressure in our North America business that we spoke about previously. Same-store sales were down mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. In Europe, net revenues were up 4% in constant currency. We continue to experience strong sell-through rates at our retail partners across most of our brands, and same-store sales were positive in our own retail stores. 
In Asia, net revenue growth of 3% in constant currency was muted by decline in same-store sales, which was negatively impacted by our strategy to reduce markdowns in Japan and Korea, our 2 key markets in Asia. We experienced gross margin improvement. And our average unit retails were up strong double digits in Japan, and Korea and our markdown rates were down significantly. We believe that these actions will continue to help us elevate the brand and drive profitable sales growth in this region. 
Now let me provide you with an update on our restructuring activities related to the global brand management initiative. The total restructuring charge for fiscal 2016 was $142 million. In addition, we incurred another $22 million of impairment related to underperforming stores subject to potential future closure. We now expect to deliver approximately $125 million of annual cost savings from the fiscal 2016 global reorganization plan, $15 million higher than the $110 million that we communicated previously. This is driven by additional restructuring activities we identified and executed late in the fiscal year. We had a part year benefit in fiscal 2016 from our restructuring activities, and we'll have a full year benefit in fiscal 2017. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory was $1.1 billion at the end of the fiscal year, up 8% year-over-year. This growth reflects investments to support new stores and concession shops and a change in the timing of receipt plans. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had 27 more directly operated stores and 47 more concession shops than a year ago, which is contributing to the growth. 
Moving to capital expenditures. We spent $418 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $391 million in fiscal 2015, mostly to support new retail stores, concession shops and infrastructure projects. 
The company repurchased 1.2 million shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter at a cost of $100 million. This brought our total buyback activity to 4.2 million shares for a total cost of $480 million for the full year. In addition, we returned $170 million to shareholders via dividend payments. Yesterday, the company's Board of Directors authorized an additional $200 million stock repurchase program. This amount is in addition to the $100 million available at the end of the fourth quarter fiscal 2016 as part of a previously authorized stock repurchase program, bringing the company's total current authorization to $300 million. 
We ended the year with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $713 million of total debt. Looking out to fiscal 2017, as Stefan mentioned, we plan to provide financial guidance at our Investors Day on June 7 for the new fiscal year as well as the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 
With that, we'll open the call for your questions."

And when I -- I can give high-level thoughts on supply chain, which is that I see big opportunities to start there and in 2 areas, both inventory management part and the lead time part. So in essence, I see opportunities to sell more with less inventory, and I also see an opportunity to drastically increase our speed and our flexibility.

Let me start by saying we're making progress in setting and beginning to execute our strategy to return Ralph Lauren Corporation to profitable growth. In doing that, we will balance driving near-term performance with our long-term vision. I look forward to doing a deep dive on our plan and providing a Q1 and fiscal 2017 outlook, as well as discussing how our plan will translate into long-term financial performance at our Investor Day on June 7. 
When we last spoke, I shared with you how I spent my first 3 months in the role, my initial observations and a rough outline of my approach to building the growth plan for this great company. Today, I will provide an overview of our main priorities and recent performance before turning the call over to Bob to discuss the Q4 and fiscal year financial results in more detail. 
In recent months, while I've been working hard to drive the business here and now, I've also worked closely with our teams to complete a comprehensive review of the business and develop a strategic plan. Through that work, we have gained a very clear understanding of the underlying drivers of the current performance, and we now have a detailed view of what's driving the downward trend. 
In short, we have not focused enough on, nor evolved enough, the core of what made us great in product, marketing and the shopping experience. In addition, our underlying business engines are not running at full speed. We also have an inefficient cost structure and an organization that's not nimble enough in the marketplace. 
What made us great was a crystal clear focus on owning classic, iconic style and putting an effortless twist to it to make it current and desirable. We will become more true to our core focused assortment on creating the best iconic style in the market and evolve the way we twist it so it becomes more desirable for today. Iconic style made current has never been more relevant. While staying true to our DNA, we will also evolve our marketing and the shopping experience to better reflect the aspirational life and style people dream of today. 
We have many unique strengths to build on. These include our brand strength, being the original for aspirational, authentic American and iconic style, a very strong share position, a talented team and a solid infrastructure. 
In our diagnosis of the business, I've been deeply embedded with our global teams who create the customer offering. These are the teams that create our products, marketing and shopping experience as well as run the inventory management, sourcing and supply chain, the core value-creating drivers in our business. They must provide our regions and channels with a consumer offering we need to win versus our best competitors. I've done this deep dive to understand how we create our offering and what drives the underperformance of today. What I've learned is encouraging because we now know what we need to do differently, and we have a clear line of sight to improving the way we connect with consumers and operate the business. 
For most of my 18-year career in this industry, I've led teams through the process of turning creative energy and talent into high-performance businesses. I know the value-driving components of the creative processes from my time with H&M and then in turning around Old Navy. 
I'm excited to see so much untapped potential at Ralph Lauren, and we will leverage our brand vision into a much stronger consumer offering. This offering will be built by evolving our brand voice, our products, our marketing and our shopping experience. In parallel, we're developing stronger underlying business engines, rightsizing our cost structure and strengthening our leadership team. Getting these elements right will help us connect more with our existing consumers, expand our reach to new consumers and return the business to strong growth over time. 
An important part of getting back to high performance is strengthening our leadership team on both the design and operation side of the business. I'm pleased with how we're starting to come together here. We're recruiting new talent and challenging our top performers with expanded roles. A few examples are Valérie Hermann, Fredrik Hjalmers and Halide Alagöz. 
Valérie has been with Ralph Lauren for a little over 2 years and has started to build the foundation that will strengthen our luxury business. She has decades of experience in luxury, including CEO of Yves Saint Laurent and head of women's ready-to-wear for Dior. She has built a track record of strengthening brands and driving high performance in luxury. She has unique experience in working to commercialize design and drive profitable growth. We have therefore recently expanded Valérie's role as Brand President to now also include Lauren, Polo Women's, Chaps and Denim & Supply. 
Fredrik Hjalmers joined us in April in the newly created role of Senior Vice President, Global Expansion and Business Development. He has 7 years of experience leading high performance global expansion to new markets within the H&M group. Fredrik will be responsible for globally leading the work to create and execute the strongest possible multi-brand and multichannel distribution and expansion strategy for the company, which is one of the core components in our growth plan. 
Halide Alagöz is joining our team in June as Head of Global Sourcing. She has 18 years of experience driving high performance within production and sourcing for H&M, and her track record is stellar. Halide has been a key driver for H&M's ability to make sourcing a competitive advantage, and she created a tremendous amount of value for them. We're looking forward to Halide coming onboard as we develop a best-in-class sourcing strategy. 
We will continue to strengthen our team in the months and years ahead, and I'm happy to say that our teams are aligned and excited about where we're going and how we're going to get there. We will move this company into the future in a way that excites our consumers, beats our competitors and drives value for the company and shareholders. 
One way Ralph made this company great was by being an entrepreneur, and that's what we're going back to. We're going to move fast to begin executing our growth strategy, continuously learn and improve, get closer to the consumer and get back to high performance. 
Now let me turn to a few key takeaways from our fourth quarter results. As you saw in the press release, net revenues were in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter, down 1% on a reported basis and flat in constant currency. The key driver for the top line performance in the fourth quarter was, as expected, pressure in North America, which was offset by growth in international markets. 
Following a challenging fall and holiday seasons, we were focused on clearing end-of-seasons inventories across our channels of distribution in the U.S. I've been focusing much of my time on our U.S. business. I've been working closely with our key customers in the market. As we look to fiscal 2017, we are planning our inventory receipts very carefully in the U.S. for both the wholesale and retail channels. Our strategic plan will address the issues in our core U.S. market. 
Moving on to our profitability. Q4 gross margin was pressured by the inventory clearance activity in the U.S. and continued foreign currency impact. Our operating margin was down significantly but better than our guidance, driven by strong expense management. While I'm feeling relatively good about how we managed expenses, I want to make it clear that I see this kind of operating income decline as unacceptable. We have significant opportunity to further reduce cost and reinvest some of those savings in engines that will drive brand strength and profitable sales growth. 
Before I turn it over to Bob for the details of our financial performance in the quarter and fiscal 2016, I want to reiterate that we're looking forward to sharing our strategic growth plan in detail with you at our upcoming Investor Day. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob."
362220,330708489,983051,"Ralph Lauren Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, May 12, 2016",2016-05-12,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter net revenues were flat with the prior year period on a constant currency basis and declined 1% on a reported basis to $1.9 billion. This is in line with the guidance we provided in February of",1406,"Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter net revenues were flat with the prior year period on a constant currency basis and declined 1% on a reported basis to $1.9 billion. This is in line with the guidance we provided in February of a flat to 2% decline on a reported basis. The negative FX impact to revenue growth was approximately 110 basis points, slightly better than our expectation of 150 basis points of negative impact as foreign currencies moved favorably during the quarter. The company's fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 included a 53rd week that contributed approximately $70 million in sales and was primarily generated within the retail segment. For the full year fiscal 2016 period, net revenues grew 1% in constant currency and declined 3% on a reported basis to $7.4 billion. 
Gross profit margin was 54.4% in the fourth quarter, excluding restructuring charges. This was 90 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting proactive measures taken in the U.S. to clear end-of-season inventories related to the fall season in addition to unfavorable foreign currency effects. For the full year fiscal 2016 period, gross margin declined 70 basis points to 56.8%, excluding restructuring charges, due to negative foreign currency impacts, which was partially offset by a favorable sales mix shift to the retail segment. 
Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 6.4%, excluding restructuring and other charges. This was 370 basis points below the prior year due to gross margin pressure, unfavorable foreign currency effects and incremental investments in infrastructure and marketing. However, operating margin was better than the outlook we provided in February of a 400 to 450 basis point decline. This was due to disciplined expense management throughout the organization. For the full year fiscal 2016 period, operating margin declined 290 basis points to 10.7%, excluding restructuring and other charges, due to gross margin pressure, fixed expense deleverage, unfavorable foreign currency effects and incremental investments in infrastructure and new stores. 
Net income for the fourth quarter was $74 million or $0.88 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and other charges. On a reported basis, net income in the fourth quarter was $41 million or $0.49 per diluted share. For the full year period, net income was $546 million or $6.36 per diluted share excluding restructuring and other charges. The effective tax rate of 34% in the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis was higher than the guidance of 32% due to onetime discrete items and compared to an effective tax rate of 28% in the prior year period. 
Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues decreased 5% in constant currency in the fourth quarter and 6% on a reported basis to $942 million. This was primarily due to a decline in North America, as business trends remained challenging. We are refining our product assortments and deliveries for fiscal 2017 to improve trends in this channel in what is a very challenging environment. Wholesale operating margin in the fourth quarter was 27.2%, excluding restructuring and other charges. This was 350 basis points below the prior year period due to proactive measures taken in the U.S. to clear end-of-season inventories related to the fall season and negative foreign currency effects. 
Retail segment sales rose 7% in constant currency and 6% on a reported basis to $889 million. Growth was driven by the benefit of a 53rd week of sales, new store expansion and e-commerce growth. On a 13-to-13 week basis, consolidated comparable store sales decreased 5% in constant currency and 6% as reported during the fourth quarter. Brick-and-mortar traffic trends remained negative in the U.S. Sales to foreign tourists were down approximately 25% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and for the full year. E-commerce revenue was up mid-single digits on a global basis in the fourth quarter, supported by the 53rd week, while comps were up slightly on a 13-to-13 week basis. 
We continue to expect to move to our new e-commerce platform later this fiscal year. The new platform will not only improve the functionality of our site but will allow us to improve how we engage with our customers digitally and across our retail channels. We believe this will dramatically improve the customer's experience on mobile devices. We look forward to delivering a best-in-class site experience. 
At year-end, we had 493 directly operated stand-alone stores and 583 concessions globally. That represents an increase of 27 net new directly operated stores and 47 concession shops when compared to the end of fiscal 2015. In addition, our international licensing partners operated 93 Ralph Lauren stores and 42 dedicated shops as well as 58 Club Monaco stores and 75 Club Monaco concession shops at the end of fiscal 2016. 
Retail operating margin in the fourth quarter, excluding restructuring and other charges, was 2.4%, which was 100 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting proactive measures taken to clear end-of-season inventories in the U.S. in addition to negative foreign currency effects. Licensing revenues increased 8%, and operating income was up 9% in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher royalties from increased sales of Ralph Lauren, Polo Ralph Lauren and Lauren products worldwide. 
Now let me provide some color on performance by geography in the quarter. In the Americas, net revenue declined 1% in constant currency, driven by pressure in our North America business that we spoke about previously. Same-store sales were down mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. In Europe, net revenues were up 4% in constant currency. We continue to experience strong sell-through rates at our retail partners across most of our brands, and same-store sales were positive in our own retail stores. 
In Asia, net revenue growth of 3% in constant currency was muted by a decline in same-store sales, which was negatively impacted by our strategy to reduce markdowns in Japan and Korea, our 2 key markets in Asia. We experienced gross margin improvement and our average unit retails were up strong double digits in Japan and Korea, and our markdown rates were down significantly. We believe that these actions will continue to help us elevate the brand and drive profitable sales growth in this region. 
Now let me provide you with an update on our restructuring activities related to the global brand management initiative. The total restructuring charge for fiscal 2016 was $142 million. In addition, we incurred another $22 million of impairment related to underperforming stores subject to potential future closure. We now expect to deliver approximately $125 million of annual cost savings from the fiscal 2016 global reorganization plan, $15 million higher than the $110 million that we communicated previously. This is driven by additional restructuring activities we identified and executed late in the fiscal year. We had a part year benefit in fiscal 2016 from our restructuring activities, and we'll have a full year benefit in fiscal 2017. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory was $1.1 billion at the end of the fiscal year, up 8% year-over-year. This growth reflects investments to support new stores and concession shops and a change in the timing of receipt plans. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had 27 more directly operated stores and 47 more concession shops than a year ago, which is contributing to the growth. 
Moving to capital expenditures. We spent $418 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $391 million in fiscal 2015, mostly to support new retail stores, concession shops and infrastructure projects. 
The company repurchased 1.2 million shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter at a cost of $100 million. This brought our total buyback activity to 4.2 million shares for a total cost of $480 million for the full year. In addition, we returned $170 million to shareholders via dividend payments. Yesterday, the company's Board of Directors authorized an additional $200 million stock repurchase program. This amount is in addition to the $100 million available at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as part of a previously authorized stock repurchase program, bringing the company's total current authorization to $300 million. 
We ended the year with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $713 million of total debt. Looking out to fiscal 2017, as Stefan mentioned, we plan to provide financial guidance at our Investors Day on June 7 for the new fiscal year as well as the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 
With that, we'll open the call for your questions."

Let me start by saying we're making progress in setting and beginning to execute our strategy to return Ralph Lauren Corporation to profitable growth. In doing that, we will balance driving near-term performance with our long-term vision. I look forward to doing a deep dive on our plan and providing a Q1 and fiscal 2017 outlook, as well as discussing how our plan will translate into long-term financial performance at our Investor Day on June 7. 
When we last spoke, I shared with you how I spent my first 3 months in the role, my initial observations and a rough outline of my approach to building the growth plan for this great company. Today, I will provide an overview of our main priorities and recent performance before turning the call over to Bob to discuss the Q4 and fiscal year financial results in more detail. 
In recent months, while I've been working hard to drive the business here and now, I've also worked closely with our teams to complete a comprehensive review of the business and develop a strategic plan. Through that work, we have gained a very clear understanding of the underlying drivers of the current performance, and we now have a detailed view of what's driving the downward trend. 
In short, we have not focused enough on, nor evolved enough, the core of what made us great in product, marketing and the shopping experience. In addition, our underlying business engines are not running at full speed. We also have an inefficient cost structure and an organization that's not nimble enough in the marketplace. 
What made us great was a crystal clear focus on owning classic, iconic style and putting an effortless twist to it to make it current and desirable. We will become more true to our core focused assortment on creating the best iconic style in the market and evolve the way we twist it so it becomes more desirable for today. Iconic style made current has never been more relevant. While staying true to our DNA, we will also evolve our marketing and the shopping experience to better reflect the aspirational life and style people dream of today. 
We have many unique strengths to build on. These include our brand strength, being the original for aspirational, authentic American and iconic style, a very strong share position, a talented team and a solid infrastructure. 
In our diagnosis of the business, I've been deeply embedded with our global teams who create the customer offering. These are the teams that create our products, marketing and shopping experience as well as run the inventory management, sourcing and supply chain, the core value-creating drivers in our business. They must provide our regions and channels with a consumer offering we need to win versus our best competitors. I've done this deep dive to understand how we create our offering and what drives the underperformance of today. What I've learned is encouraging because we now know what we need to do differently, and we have a clear line of sight to improving the way we connect with consumers and operate the business. 
For most of my 18-year career in this industry, I've led teams through the process of turning creative energy and talent into high-performance businesses. I know the value-driving components of the creative processes from my time with H&M and then in turning around Old Navy. 
I'm excited to see so much untapped potential at Ralph Lauren, and we will leverage our brand vision into a much stronger consumer offering. This offering will be built by evolving our brand voice, our products, our marketing and our shopping experience. In parallel, we're developing stronger underlying business engines, rightsizing our cost structure and strengthening our leadership team. Getting these elements right will help us connect more with our existing consumers, expand our reach to new consumers and return the business to strong growth over time. 
An important part of getting back to high performance is strengthening our leadership team on both the design and operation side of the business. I'm pleased with how we're starting to come together here. We're recruiting new talent and challenging our top performers with expanded roles. A few examples are Valérie Hermann, Fredrik Hjalmers and Halide Alagöz. 
Valérie has been with Ralph Lauren for a little over 2 years and has started to build the foundation that will strengthen our luxury business. She has decades of experience in luxury, including CEO of Yves Saint Laurent and head of women's ready-to-wear for Dior. She has built a track record of strengthening brands and driving high performance in luxury. She has unique experience in working to commercialize design and drive profitable growth. We have therefore recently expanded Valérie's role as Brand President to now also include Lauren, Polo Women's, Chaps and Denim & Supply. 
Fredrik Hjalmers joined us in April in the newly created role of Senior Vice President, Global Expansion and Business Development. He has 7 years of experience leading high performance global expansion to new markets within the H&M group. Fredrik will be responsible for globally leading the work to create and execute the strongest possible multi-brand and multichannel distribution and expansion strategy for the company, which is one of the core components in our growth plan. 
Halide Alagöz is joining our team in June as Head of Global Sourcing. She has 18 years of experience driving high performance within production and sourcing for H&M, and her track record is stellar. Halide has been a key driver for H&M's ability to make sourcing a competitive advantage, and she created a tremendous amount of value for them. We're looking forward to Halide coming onboard as we develop a best-in-class sourcing strategy. 
We will continue to strengthen our team in the months and years ahead, and I'm happy to say that our teams are aligned and excited about where we're going and how we're going to get there. We will move this company into the future in a way that excites our consumers, beats our competitors and drives value for the company and shareholders. 
One way Ralph made this company great was by being an entrepreneur, and that's what we're going back to. We're going to move fast to begin executing our growth strategy, continuously learn and improve, get closer to the consumer and get back to high performance. 
Now let me turn to a few key takeaways from our fourth quarter results. As you saw in the press release, net revenues were in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter, down 1% on a reported basis and flat in constant currency. The key driver for the top line performance in the fourth quarter was, as expected, pressure in North America, which was offset by growth in international markets. 
Following a challenging fall and holiday seasons, we were focused on clearing end-of-seasons inventories across our channels of distribution in the U.S. I've been focusing much of my time on our U.S. business. I've been working closely with our key customers in the market. As we look to fiscal 2017, we are planning our inventory receipts very carefully in the U.S. for both the wholesale and retail channels. Our strategic plan will address the issues in our core U.S. market. 
Moving on to our profitability. Q4 gross margin was pressured by the inventory clearance activity in the U.S. and continued foreign currency impact. Our operating margin was down significantly but better than our guidance, driven by strong expense management. While I'm feeling relatively good about how we managed expenses, I want to make it clear that I see this kind of operating income decline as unacceptable. We have significant opportunity to further reduce cost and reinvest some of those savings in engines that will drive brand strength and profitable sales growth. 
Before I turn it over to Bob for the details of our financial performance in the quarter and fiscal 2016, I want to reiterate that we're looking forward to sharing our strategic growth plan in detail with you at our upcoming Investor Day. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob."
362220,330708489,983822,"Ralph Lauren Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, May 12, 2016",2016-05-12,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter net revenues were flat with the prior year period on a constant currency basis and declined 1% on a reported basis to $1.9 billion. This is in line with the guidance we provided in February of",1406,"Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter net revenues were flat with the prior year period on a constant currency basis and declined 1% on a reported basis to $1.9 billion. This is in line with the guidance we provided in February of a flat to 2% decline on a reported basis. The negative FX impact to revenue growth was approximately 110 basis points, slightly better than our expectation of 150 basis points of negative impact as foreign currencies moved favorably during the quarter. The company's fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 included a 53rd week that contributed approximately $70 million in sales and was primarily generated within the retail segment. For the full year fiscal 2016 period, net revenues grew 1% in constant currency and declined 3% on a reported basis to $7.4 billion. 
Gross profit margin was 54.4% in the fourth quarter, excluding restructuring charges. This was 90 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting proactive measures taken in the U.S. to clear end-of-season inventories related to the fall season in addition to unfavorable foreign currency effects. For the full year fiscal 2016 period, gross margin declined 70 basis points to 56.8%, excluding restructuring charges, due to negative foreign currency impacts, which was partially offset by a favorable sales mix shift to the retail segment. 
Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 6.4%, excluding restructuring and other charges. This was 370 basis points below the prior year due to gross margin pressure, unfavorable foreign currency effects and incremental investments in infrastructure and marketing. However, operating margin was better than the outlook we provided in February of a 400 to 450 basis point decline. This was due to disciplined expense management throughout the organization. For the full year fiscal 2016 period, operating margin declined 290 basis points to 10.7%, excluding restructuring and other charges, due to gross margin pressure, fixed expense deleverage, unfavorable foreign currency effects and incremental investments in infrastructure and new stores. 
Net income for the fourth quarter was $74 million or $0.88 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and other charges. On a reported basis, net income in the fourth quarter was $41 million or $0.49 per diluted share. For the full year period, net income was $546 million or $6.36 per diluted share excluding restructuring and other charges. The effective tax rate of 34% in the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis was higher than the guidance of 32% due to onetime discrete items and compared to an effective tax rate of 28% in the prior year period. 
Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues decreased 5% in constant currency in the fourth quarter and 6% on a reported basis to $942 million. This was primarily due to a decline in North America, as business trends remained challenging. We are refining our product assortments and deliveries for fiscal 2017 to improve trends in this channel in what is a very challenging environment. Wholesale operating margin in the fourth quarter was 27.2%, excluding restructuring and other charges. This was 350 basis points below the prior year period due to proactive measures taken in the U.S. to clear end-of-season inventories related to the fall season and negative foreign currency effects. 
Retail segment sales rose 7% in constant currency and 6% on a reported basis to $889 million. Growth was driven by the benefit of a 53rd week of sales, new store expansion and e-commerce growth. On a 13-to-13 week basis, consolidated comparable store sales decreased 5% in constant currency and 6% as reported during the fourth quarter. Brick-and-mortar traffic trends remained negative in the U.S. Sales to foreign tourists were down approximately 25% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and for the full year. E-commerce revenue was up mid-single digits on a global basis in the fourth quarter, supported by the 53rd week, while comps were up slightly on a 13-to-13 week basis. 
We continue to expect to move to our new e-commerce platform later this fiscal year. The new platform will not only improve the functionality of our site but will allow us to improve how we engage with our customers digitally and across our retail channels. We believe this will dramatically improve the customer's experience on mobile devices. We look forward to delivering a best-in-class site experience. 
At year-end, we had 493 directly operated stand-alone stores and 583 concessions globally. That represents an increase of 27 net new directly operated stores and 47 concession shops when compared to the end of fiscal 2015. In addition, our international licensing partners operated 93 Ralph Lauren stores and 42 dedicated shops as well as 58 Club Monaco stores and 75 Club Monaco concession shops at the end of fiscal 2016. 
Retail operating margin in the fourth quarter, excluding restructuring and other charges, was 2.4%, which was 100 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting proactive measures taken to clear end-of-season inventories in the U.S. in addition to negative foreign currency effects. Licensing revenues increased 8%, and operating income was up 9% in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher royalties from increased sales of Ralph Lauren, Polo Ralph Lauren and Lauren products worldwide. 
Now let me provide some color on performance by geography in the quarter. In the Americas, net revenue declined 1% in constant currency, driven by pressure in our North America business that we spoke about previously. Same-store sales were down mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. In Europe, net revenues were up 4% in constant currency. We continue to experience strong sell-through rates at our retail partners across most of our brands, and same-store sales were positive in our own retail stores. 
In Asia, net revenue growth of 3% in constant currency was muted by a decline in same-store sales, which was negatively impacted by our strategy to reduce markdowns in Japan and Korea, our 2 key markets in Asia. We experienced gross margin improvement and our average unit retails were up strong double digits in Japan and Korea, and our markdown rates were down significantly. We believe that these actions will continue to help us elevate the brand and drive profitable sales growth in this region. 
Now let me provide you with an update on our restructuring activities related to the global brand management initiative. The total restructuring charge for fiscal 2016 was $142 million. In addition, we incurred another $22 million of impairment related to underperforming stores subject to potential future closure. We now expect to deliver approximately $125 million of annual cost savings from the fiscal 2016 global reorganization plan, $15 million higher than the $110 million that we communicated previously. This is driven by additional restructuring activities we identified and executed late in the fiscal year. We had a part year benefit in fiscal 2016 from our restructuring activities, and we'll have a full year benefit in fiscal 2017. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory was $1.1 billion at the end of the fiscal year, up 8% year-over-year. This growth reflects investments to support new stores and concession shops and a change in the timing of receipt plans. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had 27 more directly operated stores and 47 more concession shops than a year ago, which is contributing to the growth. 
Moving to capital expenditures. We spent $418 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $391 million in fiscal 2015, mostly to support new retail stores, concession shops and infrastructure projects. 
The company repurchased 1.2 million shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter at a cost of $100 million. This brought our total buyback activity to 4.2 million shares for a total cost of $480 million for the full year. In addition, we returned $170 million to shareholders via dividend payments. Yesterday, the company's Board of Directors authorized an additional $200 million stock repurchase program. This amount is in addition to the $100 million available at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as part of a previously authorized stock repurchase program, bringing the company's total current authorization to $300 million. 
We ended the year with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $713 million of total debt. Looking out to fiscal 2017, as Stefan mentioned, we plan to provide financial guidance at our Investors Day on June 7 for the new fiscal year as well as the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 
With that, we'll open the call for your questions."

And when I -- I can give high-level thoughts on supply chain, which is that I see big opportunities to start there and in 2 areas, both inventory management part and the lead time part. So in essence, I see opportunities to sell more with less inventory, and I also see an opportunity to drastically increase our speed and our flexibility. So that will help us when we evolve the consumer-facing offering."

We last spoke at our Investor Day in early June, where we shared with you the details of our Way Forward Plan. The Way Forward Plan is our multiyear plan to build on the unique brand strengths we have, go back to the core of work made us iconic and work from that core and build the business back to sustainable, profitable growth. 
Today, I will share my key takeaways from the first quarter and then provide a brief update on what we have achieved and learned so far is starting to drive the execution of our Way Forward Plan. Then I will turn it over to Bob to review the company's quarterly financial performance in more detail. 
Beginning with the quarter, performance was mostly in line with our expectations with some minor puts and takes, as we would expect at this early stage of the execution of our Way Forward Plan. 
On the revenue side, the domestic business, as expected, continued to be challenged while the international business delivered a strong quarter, posting 10% revenue growth year-over-year. The main drivers to the decline in North America are what we shared in detail during the Investor Day: A combination of not having evolved our consumer offering enough in product, marketing, shopping experience and having had an operating model that has generated too much excess inventory. Having these self-induced challenges are hurting us when we, like everyone else, are facing difficult retail traffic trends in a highly promotional environment.
In our international markets, even though we have a much smaller presence there than in North America and we globally have much improvement work to do ahead of us, there were valuable learnings in the quarter that we will use in building back strengths in our domestic business. Let me give you a few examples.
In Asia, over the last 6 months, we have acted aggressively to drive quality of sales up. Our team there proactively closed 43 brand weakening locations, reduced the length of the sale period by an average of 30% and significantly decreased the depth of mark down rates. We have seen some very encouraging results. Our average unit retail prices and our gross profit dollars were both up significantly. Simultaneously, the team has continued to drive high quality expansion.
In Europe, as expected, this quarter benefited from a shift in timing of wholesale shipments. However, the underlying business was also solid and our team has driven several successful quality of sale initiatives. They have been able to reduce buys for this year in a way that has protected full price selling, increased the stock turnover and if the current trend continues, we'll significantly reduce excess inventory at the end of the season. 
As a part of executing the Way Forward Plan, you will see us increasingly focus on proactively driving quality of sales up. These initiatives will include pulling back on inventory receipts, counting lead times, strengthening our assortment and store closures. These will be some of the most important drivers in getting us back to sustainable, profitable growth.
Speaking of profitability. In the first quarter, operating margin was better than our guidance. However, this was driven by one-time benefits that Bob will take you through in detail. Excluding this impact, the quarter was in line with our expectations.
Now let me give you an update on our progress on the execution of the Way Forward Plan. As you recall from Investor Day, the Way Forward Plan is built up of a consumer facing part, where we're going to refocus on and evolve from the core in product, marketing and the shopping experience. In the second part, that is about evolving the operating model, where we are developing 4 business engines: a Systematic repeatable way of building a stronger assortment, a demand-driven supply chain, a best-in-class sourcing and a multichannel global expansion strategy. Underlying both of these 2 parts is the foundational strengthening the leadership, team and culture, as well as developing a strong economic model.
Let me start by sharing how we have strengthened the foundation, starting with the leadership team. Jane Nielsen, our new Chief Financial Officer, will be starting right after Labor Day. I can't tell you how excited I am to soon have Jane here on the ground working next to me. Jane has the knowledge and experience to support us with driving a very strong execution. 
Jeff Kuster, our new Group President for the Americas, has been on the ground for a month. He has already met several of our biggest customers and started the work together with his team to build a value creating plan that will get us back to high performance in North America. Halide Alagoz, our new Head of Global Sourcing, who started in early June, has already had a positive effect on the sourcing decisions we are making. She's working very closely with her team to build the best-in-class sourcing capability. Bill Campbell, our new Head of Global Supply Chain and Inventory Management, will be leaving Amazon shortly and joining us in early October. Finally, Fredrik Hjalmers, our Head of Global Expansion, started in June and has began the work with this team to build out a global multi-brand and multichannel expansion plan. 
Moving to the progress we have made in strengthening the organization. We already completed the planned rightsizing of our headcount by decreasing it with 8% and reduced layers from an average of 9 to 6, increasing each lead to span of control. The biggest positive effect of this is that we have become a leaner, faster, will empower the doers and reclaim the entrepreneurial culture. In addition, it drives an SG&A savings of approximately $115 million on an annualized basis already this year. Completing the plan rightsizing of the organization has given us a good start in fixing the overall cost structure and developing a disciplined financial model. 
We are also underway with closing underperforming stores we identified as part the Way Forward Plan. In the first quarter, we closed 8 of the 50 plus total stores under consideration. we're also on track to getting the order targeted SG&A cost savings out during the remainder of the year. Let me now move to the consumer facing part of the Way Forward Plan and share some highlights that we're driving there.
For the last few months, Valerie Herman and other brand presidents, have been intensely centered on refocusing our core product offering and evolving from that core. And in doing that, we have not only been able to improve our classic iconic styles, but we have also been able to start counting the long tail of unproductive styles. So far, we have been able to partially impact what we bought for spring 2017 with a double-digit percentage reduction in the number of SKUs across our biggest brands. 
The bigger impact in both evolving the product core and cutting more of the longtail will be seen for fall 2017, when we will be able to not just reduce what we buy, but also what we develop. As we discussed in June, a big value driver that is connected to evolving our products and assortment is developing best-in-class sourcing.
Just a few weeks after Halide started, as our Head of Sourcing, she and I held a very important meeting in Asia with our key strategic suppliers, where we solicited their support in driving increased quality, decrease cost and increase flexibility and speed in our sourcing. We received a very strong response from many of our suppliers. And together with them, we have already started to make measurable improvements in driving quality up, cost down on comparable products and decreasing our time-to-market. We're also full-speed ahead with shortening our lead times from 15 to 9 months. And even though the full effect will not be seen for a few seasons, we will be 50% there already by the end of this year. 
Next year, we should be 90% of the way there. Almost equally important to cutting the overall lead times down is the work we are doing in building an 8-week test and rapid response pipeline. For this year, we're just starting. And by next fall, we will have the capability that will enable testing on most of the new product ideas before introduction.
The work of developing a demand-driven supply chain has just started. Even though Bill Campbell is not starting until October, we have already adjusted our inventory levels down to better mast demand and decrease excess inventory that drove excess markdowns and cannibalization.
Overall inventory levels are projected to go down for the remainder the year. In parallel to driving the execution of the Way Forward Plan, there were several important examples recently that demonstrated how we are building strength in the business from a position of unique and iconic brand strength. One of those proud moments was our presence at Wimbledon earlier this summer and another was the Olympic ceremony this last Friday, where we can see Team USA walk into the stadium, demonstrating the strength of American iconic style. We are so proud to be able to partner up with and support the U.S. Olympic team.
In conclusion, even though it's early days in the execution of our Way Forward Plan, this is a multiyear journey and we are now one quarter in just in the beginning of the execution phase. I'm very pleased with the progress we are making. We have guided this year as we stabilize here, and that is what we are delivering on. We will continue to balance meeting our near-term commitments with staying on track to execute our long-term Way Forward Plan.
As I noted, we have made progress in a number of areas from strengthening the leadership team, to starting to improve the product and assortment building, starting to cut the lead times and improving our sourcing to the execution in the regions and the cost initiatives. I'm excited to see our teams taking on the challenges head on, and we believe the company is again moving in the right direction.
And with that, would like to turn on the call over to Bob."
362220,376790177,1032542,"Ralph Lauren Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2016",2016-08-10,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. First quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion were down 4% compared to the prior year period on both the reported and constant currency basis. This is in line with the guidance we provided this past June of a mi",1430,"Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. First quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion were down 4% compared to the prior year period on both the reported and constant currency basis. This is in line with the guidance we provided this past June of a mid single-digit revenue decline. Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on revenue growth in the first quarter. On an adjusted basis, gross profit margin was 61.1% in the first quarter, excluding noncash inventory-related charges of $54 million associated with our restructuring activities.
This was 130 basis points above the prior year period, primarily reflecting favorable sales mix shifts, lower product cost and improvement in Asia, driven by initiatives to improve quality sale metrics. Operating expenses, on an adjusted basis, were $821 million and excluding $105 million in restructuring and other related charges. These expenses were down only 1% to last year, as our headcount reduction and other expense initiatives under the Way Forward Plan had limited benefit in the first quarter due to the timing of these activities.
Adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 8.2%, excluding $159 million in restructuring and other related charges. This was 60 basis points below last year due to fixed expense deleverage on lower net revenues and partially offset by higher gross margin. The adjusted operating margin performance was better than the outlook we provided in June of a 110 to 160 basis point decline driven by more favorable impact of our inventory management initiatives, specifically, lower inventory reserves due to restructuring-related inventory charges as well as product mix. The product mix shift was significant in Europe and was driven by a higher level of summer product within the wholesale shipments and a higher wellbore of made for factory product and factory stores due to less excess inventory.
Adjusted net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $90 million or $1.06 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and other related charges. On a reported basis, net loss in the first quarter was $22 million or a loss of $0.27 per diluted share. The effective tax rate was 29% in the first quarter on an adjusted basis compared to an effective tax rate of 30% in the prior year period. 
Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues decreased 5% in both reported and constant currency in the first quarter to $607 million. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in North America as the U.S. Department store channel continue to expense challenging traffic trends. This was partially offset by also revenue growth in Europe primarily driven by a benefit from timing of shipments relative to last year, in addition to proactive measures taking a clear inventory. Adjusted wholesale operating margin in the first quarter was 23.7%, excluding restructuring and other related charges.
This was 190 basis points above the prior year period driven by a higher gross margin. Retail segment sales decreased 3% in both reported and constant currency in the first quarter to $907 million. The sales decline was driven by comparable stores sales decline that was partially offset by noncomparable-store sales growth. Consolidated comparable store sales decreased 7% constant currency and 6% as reported during the first quarter primarily driven by lower traffic trends during the quarter and a challenging macro environment in most regions.
Global e-commerce revenues declined 6% on the quarter on a reported basis, primarily due to the company's pricing harmonization and other quality of sale initiatives. 
At the end of first quarter of fiscal 2017, we had 485 directly operated stand-alone stores and 598 concessions globally. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the company had 18 net new directly operated stores and 40 net new concession shops at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017. In addition, our international licensing partners operated 96 Ralph Lauren stores and 17 dedicated shops, as well as 60 Club Monaco stores and 74 Club Monaco concession shops at the end of first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Retail operating margin in the first quarter, excluding restructuring and other related charges, was 13.8%, which was 120 basis points above the prior year period due to a higher gross margin. Licensing revenues decreased 8% in both reported and constant currency impacted by timing of shipments during the quarter. Licensing segment operating income was down 7% in the first quarter compared with the prior year period. Now I'd like to provide some color on our performance by geography in the first quarter.
In the Americas, net revenue declined 11% as we continue to see pressure in the U.S. department store channel. Same-store sales were down high single digits in North America in the first quarter driven by traffic challenges. 
In Europe, net revenues increased 14% on a reported basis and grew 15% in constant currency. This growth was mostly driven by a benefit from timing of shipments relative to last year. Excluding this shift, the underlying trend was solid in the quarter. Going forward, we note that the potential impact of Brexit on consumer spending and geopolitical volatility in the region are increasing uncertainty in this market. In Asia, net revenues increased 3% on a reported basis and were flat with the prior year period in constant currency.
We experienced continue to growth Japan and Australia. Same-store sales growth was negatively impacted by ongoing strategy to improve our quality of sales and metrics in the region. We continue to experience gross margin improvement in average unit retails were up significantly while markdown rates were down significantly. Now let me provide you with an update on our restructuring activities related to the Way Forward Plan.
The company continues to expect restructuring activities to result in approximately $180 million to $220 million of annualize expense savings related to its initiatives to streamline the organizational structure and rightsize cost structure and real estate portfolio. We continue to expect restructuring charges of up to $400 million as a result the fiscal 2017 restructuring activities and up to $150 million inventory charge associated with the company's Way Forward Plan.
These charges are expected to be substantially realized by the end of fiscal 2017. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the company recorded $104 million in restructuring and related impairment charges and $50 million in inventory charges. Now moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory was $1.2 billion at the end the first quarter, down 2% year-over-year. The company expects inventory quality to continue to improve on the balance sheet as inventory clearance activities continue.
Moving to capital expenditures. We spent $78 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $68 million in the prior year period, mostly to support our retail store network, concession shops and infrastructure projects. During the first quarter, the company paid approximately $100 million related to repurchase of its Class A common stock. At the end the quarter, approximately $200 million  remain available for future share repurchases. We ended the year with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $692 million of total debt. Now I'd like to turn the guidance for fiscal 2017.
As a reminder, this guidance excludes service restructuring, impairment, inventory income that show the copies Way Forward Plan. For fiscal 2017, the company continues to expect consolidated net revenues to decrease at a low double-digit rate to proactive pullback in inventory receipts, store closures, pricing harmonization and other quality sales initiative, combined with the weak retail traffic and a highly promotional environment in the U.S.
Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency will have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2017. The company continues to expect operating margin for fiscal '17 to be approximately 10%, as cost savings are expected to be offset by growth in new store expenses, unfavorable foreign currency impacts, infrastructure investments and fixed expense deleverage. 
The fiscal 2017 tax rate is estimated to be approximately 29%. For the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company expects consolidated net revenues to be down mid to high single-digits on a reported basis. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency will have minimal impact on revenue growth in the second quarter.
Operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal '17 is expected to be 200 to 250 basis points below the comparable prior year period. Initiatives under the Way Forward Plan are expected to have a greater impact in the second half of the fiscal year than the second quarter. Second quarter tax rate is estimated at 29%.

Two different ways, One, significantly shortening the length of promotion and two, just the depth of the discounting in the markdown. And what we've seen is, overall, from a quality of sale perspective, whether it's looking at this got a great, which is decreased significantly. We've seen a very significant increase in average unit retail. And although we've seen a more moderate decrease in UPTs, overall, it's driving a stronger average transaction value for us. That's been the biggest change and the biggest benefit that we've seen from there. 
And when it comes to, Jeff Kuster, when Jeff started, he is, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, he is starting with the assessment the challenge in North America and diagnosing that in detail. So we got of fact-based view on what we're up against. And then we are pivoting to building a plan to increase quality of sales in North America. So differences there, Omar, coming back to your question, there are definitely differences in Asia, North America based on channel differences as being 1 big difference. But it comes back to how we plan the inventory. How we buy the inventory to demand. How our promotional strategy, our promotional execution and how that plays across channels. That's why the fact-based diagnosis is so important. Jeff just started 3, 4 weeks ago and he is underway with that team and we'll work with the different channels. And that's where we're going to have the most value in this analysis and coming back. That's what gives me the most confidence when it comes to a plan to increase quality of sales, that we are doing this for the first time cross channel, and we're going to do it together with our biggest customers as well. So we are looking to come back and provide our insights when we get them."

As I mentioned on the Investor Day, the biggest change here is a cultural change and it's a change of how we work as a team. So instead of work in a sequential way where you had over a function by function and by that, you build in stock in the lead times and you extended the lead times. We are working together question function only. So I think that has really excited me over the last couple of months digging into the Way Forward Plan execution with a team is to break down the silos. To have the sign merchandising, sourcing, sales, distribution channel at the table from the first design idea all the way into selling that sure product. And just by that, we caught a lot of time from the lead times.
And then it's about growing and mapping through. And Halide Alagoz is leading that work. She's not think every single component the current lead times and looking at if how is every component and every day and our spend adding value to driving brand strength and profitable sales growth and driving a strong assortment. And I can say that I'm very encouraged by the fact that we are digging out that. We will be 90% on a 9-month leadtime by the end of next year. Herald to that is going to be the 8-week test and rapid response pipeline. Because that's going to be a beginning there as well. That, in a very short period of time, we're going to be able to test any and every new big bid ideas before we go pick. And roughly, whether Spence to that part is to say when we sell something and we see a bigger amount-than-expected, we will be able to much faster chase back into those products."

I thought the cost reduction have already taken what have meant more SG&A leverage this quarter and maybe not as much cost of goods. And then longer-term, as you guys laid out the plan for the next 4 years at the Analyst Day. You referred to 2018 as revenue stabilizing. And as we look at it, with the guidance of give today, we were able to do a little bit of math around the year and we can see that the back half the year looks like revenues will be down by mid- to high-teens, it looks like. We know in the fourth quarter, you will have to lap an Easter shift and extra week, and then you'll be closing stores so that will naturally lower. But certainly, some the drivers of where the growth rate leaving there will be sp low will extend into the first half of next year.

Relative to your first question on the SG&A cost savings, the majority of our restructuring activities are more heavily weighted to the second half the year. So for instance, our organizational changes were just made in June. So you'll start to see the benefit of those in Q2, but they'll be much more heavily weighted to the second half. The overall savings that we discussed and quantified at the investors day relative to the Way Forward Plan of $445 million, that's a gross number. It doesn't represent 8 savings that will drop to the bottom line and all of those savings essentially represent SG&A savings, not cost of goods savings. So more heavily weighted to the second half, related to your question on SG&A expenses, particularly as it relates to completion of our anticipated store closures. So we communicated 50 plus closures. We're actually looking a little deeper at that number. And relative to that 50 plus, we closed 8 in Q1. So again, our store closures are more heavily weighted towards the second half the year. That's purposeful because we had committed to inventory buys for a lot of those stores and we want to be able to liquidate them through those stores. Relative to the revenue guidance for the remainder of the year, and then I'll turn the question over to Stefan to talk about the guidance for the longer term period. The high -- the mid-high-teens are really being driven by again timing of store closures, timing related to a number of quality of sale initiatives, whether it's calling back significantly on inventory receipts, which will reduce sales, whether it's -- the impact of pricing harmonization within regions and channels, et cetera, and we also don't expect as much benefit from sales mix shifts as we've seen in Q1 in particular."

Then, everything is on the table, and then, we look at how we drive brand strength and sustainable profitable sales growth in a responsible growth from where we are to where we are heading. Atrix speed pipeline. So I mentioned a few times before that coming into this role, they Wholesale relationship partnership was new to me. And I was blown away by our because customers and their willingness to take on the challenge together with us. So they are waiting for us to come back and say relating to the 8 weeks the pipeline and another -- a number of other areas to say, how can we partner up and create joint value out of this. Because when we get into a more balanced inventory and cut most of the excess out and be able to react on 8 weeks, then we will be able to create value, not only for us, but for them. And they are very clear on that. So we have an ongoing dialogue with them and they are waiting for us to be ready to start to execute on it. What excites me is to see by the speed, Halide, and his -- her team have come into not only assessing the states, but also reaching out to the suppliers. As I mentioned, we went to Asia, holiday and I, and met with our key suppliers. This applies that weather represent 70%, approximately, of our total volume. And we invited them into cocreate this journey, to cocreate the sourcing part the Way Forward Plan, which will also didn't surprise me because I more expense from working closely with sourcing partners that they were more than ready to dive in.

So working with Halide and her team and putting sourcing at the table upfront together with a sign and merchandising, has led to that we have been able to move towards the 9-month leadtime, have an 8-week speed, increase the quality at the same time as we see costs on comparable products go down. So Halide has like everyone else working on the Way Forward Plan. She has started -- she and her team has started focusing on the core. And that is what will make the biggest difference from a consumer perspective or from a business perspective.

We last spoke at our Investor Day in early June, where we shared with you the details of our Way Forward Plan.

We last spoke at our Investor Day in early June, where we shared with you the details of our Way Forward Plan. The Way Forward Plan is our multiyear plan to build on the unique brand strengths we have, go back to the core of what made us iconic, evolve from that core and build the business back to sustainable, profitable growth.
Today, I will share my key takeaways from the first quarter and then provide a brief update on what we have achieved and learned so far is starting to drive the execution of our Way Forward Plan. Then I will turn it over to Bob to review the company's quarterly financial performance in more detail.
Beginning with the quarter, performance was mostly in line with our expectations with some minor puts and takes, as we would expect at this early stage of the execution of our Way Forward Plan.
On the revenue side, the domestic business, as expected, continued to be challenged while the international business delivered a strong quarter, posting 10% revenue growth year-over-year. The main drivers to the decline in North America are what we shared in detail during the Investor Day: a combination of not having evolved our consumer offering enough in product, marketing, shopping experience and having had an operating model that has generated too much excess inventory. Having these self-induced challenges are hurting us when we, like everyone else, are facing difficult retail traffic trends in a highly promotional environment.
In our international markets, even though we have a much smaller presence there than in North America, and we globally have much improvement work to do ahead of us, there were valuable learnings in the quarter that we will use in building back strengths in our domestic business. Let me give you a few examples.
In Asia, over the last 6 months, we have acted aggressively to drive quality of sales up. Our team there proactively closed 43 brand weakening locations, reduced the length of the sale period by an average of 30% and significantly decreased the depth of markdown rates. We have seen some very encouraging results. Our average unit retail prices and our gross profit dollars were both up significantly. Simultaneously, the team has continued to drive high quality expansion.
In Europe, as expected, this quarter benefited from a shift in timing of wholesale shipments. However, the underlying business was also solid, and our team has driven several successful quality of sale initiatives. They have been able to reduce buys for this year in a way that has protected full price selling, increased the stock turnover and if the current trend continues, we'll significantly reduce excess inventory at the end of the season.
As a part of executing the Way Forward Plan, you will see us increasingly focus on proactively driving quality of sales up. These initiatives will include pulling back on inventory receipts, counting lead times, strengthening our assortment and store closures. These will be some of the most important drivers in getting us back to sustainable, profitable growth.
Speaking of profitability. In the first quarter, operating margin was better than our guidance. However, this was driven by one-time benefits that Bob will take you through in detail. Excluding this impact, the quarter was in line with our expectations.
Now let me give you an update on our progress on the execution of the Way Forward Plan. As you recall from Investor Day, the Way Forward Plan is built up of a consumer facing part, where we're going to refocus on and evolve from the core in product, marketing and the shopping experience. In the second part, that is about evolving the operating model, where we are developing 4 business engines: a systematic repeatable way of building a stronger assortment; a demand-driven supply chain; a best-in-class sourcing; and a multichannel global expansion strategy. Underlying both of these 2 parts is the foundation of strengthening the leadership, team and culture, as well as developing a strong economic model.
Let me start by sharing how we have strengthened the foundation, starting with the leadership team. Jane Nielsen, our new Chief Financial Officer, will be starting right after Labor Day. I can't tell you how excited I am to soon have Jane here on the ground working next to me. Jane has the knowledge and experience to support us with driving a very strong execution.
Jeff Kuster, our new Group President for the Americas, has been on the ground for a month. He has already met several of our biggest customers and started the work together with his team to build a value creating plan that will get us back to high performance in North America. Halide Alagöz, our new Head of Global Sourcing, who started in early June, has already had a positive effect on the sourcing decisions we are making. She's working very closely with her team to build the best-in-class sourcing capability. Bill Campbell, our new Head of Global Supply Chain and Inventory Management, will be leaving Amazon shortly and joining us in early October. Finally, Fredrik Hjalmers, our Head of Global Expansion, started in June and has begun the work with this team to build out a global multi-brand and multichannel expansion plan.
Moving to the progress we have made in strengthening the organization. We already completed the planned rightsizing of our headcount by decreasing it with 8% and reduced layers from an average of 9 to 6, increasing each lead to span of control. The biggest positive effect of this is that we have become leaner, faster, will empower the doers and reclaim the entrepreneurial culture.
In addition, it drives an SG&A savings of approximately $115 million on an annualized basis already this year. Completing the plan rightsizing of the organization has given us a good start in fixing the overall cost structure and developing a disciplined financial model.
We're also underway with closing the underperforming stores we identified as part of the Way Forward Plan. In the first quarter, we closed 8 of the 50 plus total stores under consideration. We're also on track to getting the order targeted SG&A cost savings out during the remainder of the year. Let me now move to the consumer facing part of the Way Forward Plan and share some highlights that we're driving there.
For the last few months, Valerie Hermann and the other brand presidents, have been intensely centered on refocusing our core product offering and evolving from that core. And in doing that, we have not only been able to improve our classic iconic styles, but we have also been able to start counting the long tail of unproductive styles. So far, we have been able to partially impact what we bought for spring 2017 with a double-digit percentage reduction in the number of SKUs across our biggest brands.
The bigger impact in both evolving the product core and cutting more of the long tail will be seen for fall 2017, when we will be able to not just reduce what we buy, but also what we develop. As we discussed in June, a big value driver that is connected to evolving our products and assortment is developing best-in-class sourcing.
Just a few weeks after Halide started, as our Head of Sourcing, she and I held a very important meeting in Asia with our key strategic suppliers, where we solicited their support in driving increased quality, decreased cost and increased flexibility and speed in our sourcing. We received a very strong response from many of our suppliers. And together with them, we have already started to make measurable improvements in driving quality up, cost down on comparable products and decreasing our time-to-market. We're also full-speed ahead with shortening our lead times from 15 to 9 months. And even though the full effect will not be seen for a few seasons, we will be 50% there already by the end of this year.
Next year, we should be 90% of the way there. Almost equally important to cutting the overall lead times down is the work we are doing in building an 8-week test and rapid response pipeline. For this year, we're just starting. And by next fall, we will have the capability that will enable testing on most of the new product ideas before introduction.
The work of developing a demand-driven supply chain has just started. Even though Bill Campbell is not starting until October, we have already adjusted our inventory levels down to better match demand and decrease excess inventory that drove excess markdowns and cannibalization.
Overall inventory levels are projected to go down for the remainder the year. In parallel to driving the execution of the Way Forward Plan, there were several important examples recently that demonstrated how we are building strength in the business from a position of unique and iconic brand strength. One of those proud moments was our presence at Wimbledon earlier this summer and another was the Olympic ceremony this last Friday, where we could see Team USA walk into the stadium, demonstrating the strength of American iconic style. We are so proud to be able to partner up with and support the U.S. Olympic team.
In conclusion, even though it's early days in the execution of our Way Forward Plan, this is a multiyear journey, and we are now one quarter in just in the beginning of the execution phase. I'm very pleased with the progress we are making. We have guided this year as we sort of stabilize here, and that is what we are delivering on. We will continue to balance meeting our near-term commitments with staying on track to execute our long-term Way Forward Plan.
As I noted, we have made progress in a number of areas from strengthening the leadership team, to starting to improve the product and assortment building, starting to cut the lead times and improving our sourcing to the execution in the regions and the cost initiatives. I'm excited to see our teams taking on the challenges head on, and we believe the company is again moving in the right direction.
And with that, I would like to turn on the call over to Bob."

First quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion were down 4% compared to the prior year period on both the reported and constant currency basis. This is in line with the guidance we provided this past June of a mi",1432,"Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. First quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion were down 4% compared to the prior year period on both the reported and constant currency basis. This is in line with the guidance we provided this past June of a mid single-digit revenue decline. Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on revenue growth in the first quarter. On an adjusted basis, gross profit margin was 61.1% in the first quarter, excluding noncash inventory-related charges of $54 million associated with our restructuring activities.
This was 130 basis points above the prior year period, primarily reflecting favorable sales mix shifts, lower product cost and improvement in Asia, driven by initiatives to improve quality sale metrics. Operating expenses, on an adjusted basis, were $821 million, excluding $105 million in restructuring and other related charges. These expenses were down only 1% to last year, as our headcount reduction and other expense initiatives under the Way Forward Plan had limited benefit in the first quarter due to the timing of these activities.
Adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 8.2%, excluding $159 million in restructuring and other related charges. This was 60 basis points below last year due to fixed expense deleverage on lower net revenues and partially offset by higher gross margin. The adjusted operating margin performance was better than the outlook we provided in June of a 110 to 160 basis point decline driven by more favorable impact of our inventory management initiatives, specifically, lower inventory reserves due to restructuring-related inventory charges as well as product mix. The product mix shift was significant in Europe and was driven by a higher level of summer product within the wholesale shipments and a higher level of made-for-factory product and factory stores due to less excess inventory.
Adjusted net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $90 million or $1.06 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and other related charges. On a reported basis, net loss in the first quarter was $22 million or a loss of $0.27 per diluted share. The effective tax rate was 29% in the first quarter on an adjusted basis compared to an effective tax rate of 30% in the prior year period.
Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues decreased 5% in both reported and constant currency in the first quarter to $607 million. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in North America as the U.S. Department store channel continued to experience challenging traffic trends. This was partially offset by wholesale revenue growth in Europe, primarily driven by a benefit from timing of shipments relative to last year, in addition to proactive measures taking the clear inventory. Adjusted wholesale operating margin in the first quarter was 23.7%, excluding restructuring and other related charges.
This was 190 basis points above the prior year period driven by a higher gross margin. Retail segment sales decreased 3% in both reported and constant currency in the first quarter to $907 million. The sales decline was driven by comparable stores sales decline that was partially offset by noncomparable-store sales growth. Consolidated comparable store sales decreased 7% in constant currency and 6% as reported during the first quarter, primarily driven by lower traffic trends during the quarter and a challenging macro environment in most regions.
Global e-commerce revenues declined 6% during the quarter on a reported basis, primarily due to the company's pricing harmonization and other quality of sale initiatives. 
At the end of first quarter of fiscal 2017, we had 485 directly operated stand-alone stores and 598 concessions globally. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the company had 18 net new directly operated stores and 40 net new concession shops at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017. In addition, our international licensing partners operated 96 Ralph Lauren stores and 17 dedicated shops, as well as 60 Club Monaco stores and 74 Club Monaco concession shops at the end of first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Retail operating margin in the first quarter, excluding restructuring and other related charges, was 13.8%, which was 120 basis points above the prior year period due to a higher gross margin. Licensing revenues decreased 8% in both reported and constant currency impacted by timing of shipments during the quarter. Licensing segment operating income was down 7% in the first quarter compared with the prior year period. Now I'd like to provide some color on our performance by geography in the first quarter.
In the Americas, net revenue declined 11% as we continue to see pressure in the U.S. department store channel. Same-store sales were down high single digits in North America in the first quarter driven by traffic challenges.
In Europe, net revenues increased 14% on a reported basis and grew 15% in constant currency. This growth was mostly driven by a benefit from timing of shipments relative to last year. Excluding this shift, the underlying trend was solid in the quarter. Going forward, we note that the potential impact of Brexit on consumer spending and geopolitical volatility in the region are increasing uncertainty in this market. In Asia, net revenues increased 3% on a reported basis and were flat with prior year period in constant currency.
We experienced continuing growth in Japan and Australia. Same-store sales growth was negatively impacted by ongoing strategy to improve our quality of sales and metrics in the region. We continue to experience gross margin improvement and average unit retails were up significantly while markdown rates were down significantly. Now let me provide you with an update on our restructuring activities related to the Way Forward Plan.
The company continues to expect restructuring activities to result in approximately $180 million to $220 million of annualize expense savings related to its initiatives to streamline the organizational structure and rightsize the cost structure and real estate portfolio. We continue to expect restructuring charges of up to $400 million as a result of the fiscal 2017 restructuring activities and up to $150 million inventory charge associated with the company's Way Forward Plan.
These charges are expected to be substantially realized by the end of fiscal 2017. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the company recorded $104 million in restructuring and related impairment charges and $50 million in inventory charges.
Now moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory was $1.2 billion at the end the first quarter, down 2% year-over-year. The company expects inventory quality to continue to improve on the balance sheet as inventory clearance activities continue.
Moving to capital expenditures. We spent $78 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $68 million in the prior year period, mostly to support our retail store network, concession shops and infrastructure projects. During the first quarter, the company paid approximately $100 million related to repurchase of its Class A common stock. At the end the quarter, approximately $200 million remain available for future share repurchases. We ended the year with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $692 million of total debt.
Now I'd like to turn the guidance for fiscal 2017. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring, impairment and inventory-related charges in connection with the company's Way Forward Plan. For fiscal 2017, the company continues to expect consolidated net revenues to decrease at a low double-digit rate due to proactive pullback in inventory receipts, store closures, pricing harmonization and other quality sales initiative, combined with the weak retail traffic and a highly promotional environment in the U.S.
Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency will have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2017. The company continues to expect operating margin for fiscal '17 to be approximately 10%, as cost savings are expected to be offset by growth in new store expenses, unfavorable foreign currency impacts, infrastructure investments and fixed expense deleverage.
The fiscal 2017 tax rate is estimated to be approximately 29%. For the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company expects consolidated net revenues to be down mid- to high single digits on a reported basis. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency will have minimal impact on revenue growth in the second quarter.
Operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal '17 is expected to be 200 to 250 basis points below the comparable prior year period. Initiatives under the Way Forward Plan are expected to have a greater impact in the second half of the fiscal year than the second quarter. Second quarter tax rate is estimated at 29%.

The biggest changes that we've made to support and strengthen the quality of sale that we're seeing in Asia is to really significantly cutback on our promotional stands. Two different ways: one, significantly shortening the length of promotion; and two, just the depth of the discounting in the markdown. And what we've seen is, overall, from a quality of sale perspective, whether it's looking at discount rates, which has decreased significantly. We've seen a very significant increase in average unit retail. And although we've seen a more moderate decrease in UPTs, overall, it's driving a stronger average transaction value for us. That's been the biggest change and the biggest benefit that we've seen from there.
When it comes to, Jeff Kuster, when Jeff started, he is, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, he is starting with the assessment the challenge in North America and diagnosing that in detail. So we got of fact-based view on what we're up against. And then we are pivoting to building a plan to increase quality of sales in North America. So differences there, Omar, coming back to your question, there are definitely differences in Asia, North America based on channel differences as being one big difference. But it comes back to how we plan the inventory. How we buy the inventory to demand. How our promotional strategy, our promotional execution and how that plays across channels. That's why the fact-based diagnosis is so important. Jeff just started 3, 4 weeks ago, and he is underway with the team and we'll work with the different channels. And that's where we're going to have the most value in this analysis and coming back. That's what gives me the most confidence when it comes to a plan to increase quality of sales, that we are doing this for the first time cross channel, and we're going to do it together with our biggest customers as well. So we are looking to come back and provide our insights when we get them."

So for example, on our wholesale channel, which is a relatively small business in Asia, but we saw in the quarter a 48% increase in the number of shops in our wholesale channel, too.

We're going to be 50% on a 9-month lead time by the end of this year And we're going to be 90% on a 9-month lead time by next year. As I mentioned on the Investor Day, the biggest change here is a cultural change and it's a change of how we work as a team. So instead of work in a sequential way where you had over function by function and by that, you build in [indiscernible] in the lead times and you extended the lead times. We are working together cross-functionally. So one thing that, that's really excited me over the first couple of months digging into the Way Forward execution with the team is to break down the silos. To have the sign merchandising, sourcing, sales, distribution channel at the table from the first design idea all the way into selling the actual product. And just by that, we get a lot of time from the lead times.
And then it's about going and mapping through. And Halide Alagöz is leading that work. She is mapping every single component of the current lead times and looking at is -- how is every component and every day and hour spend adding value to driving brand strength and profitable sales growth and driving a strong assortment. And I can say that I'm very encouraged by the fact that we are digging out that. We will be 90% on a 9-month lead time by the end of next year. Parallel to that is going to be the 8-week test and rapid response pipeline. Because that's going to be a big enabler as well. That -- in a very short period of time, we're going to be able to test any and every new big product idea before we go big. And rapid response part of that is to say, when we sell something and we see a bigger demand than expected, we will be able to much faster chase back into those products."

On the model, could you help us think about the, the planned cost savings split between SG&A and cost of goods sold as we look at both the second quarter and the second half? I guess, I thought -- I guess we have a little bit upside down in our model. I thought some of the cost reductions you had already taken would have meant more SG&A leverage this quarter and maybe not as much cost of goods. And then longer-term, as you guys laid out the plan for the next 4 years at the Analyst Day. You referred to 2018 as revenue stabilizing. And as we look at it, with the guidance you give today, we were able to do a little bit of math around the year, and we can see that the back half of the year looks like revenues will be down by mid- to high-teens, it looks like. We know in the fourth quarter, you will have to lap an Easter shift and an extra week. And then you'll be closing stores, it'll naturally be lower. But certainly, some the drivers on why that growth rate leaving the year will be so low will extend into the first half of next year. I'm trying to think if a little bit of time is gone by now, if you could help us think about how to -- may start quantifying what your real reference to stabilizing revenues will look like in fiscal 18, given what you know about the business today as you start walking into the plan."

Relative to your first question on the SG&A cost savings, the majority of our restructuring activities are more heavily weighted to the second half the year. So for instance, our organizational changes were just made in June. So you'll start to see the benefit of those in Q2, but they'll be much more heavily weighted to the second half. Of the overall savings that we discussed and quantified at the Investors Day relative to the Way Forward Plan of $445 million, that's a gross number. It doesn't represent net savings that will drop to the bottom line and all of those savings essentially represent SG&A savings, not cost of goods savings. So more heavily weighted to the second half, related to your question on SG&A expenses, particularly as it relates to completion of our anticipated store closures. So we communicated 50 plus closures. We're actually looking a little deeper at that number. And relative to that 50 plus, we closed 8 in Q1. So again, our store closures are more heavily weighted towards the second half the year. And that's purposeful because we are committed to inventory buys for a lot of those stores, and we want to be able to liquidate them through those stores. Relative to the revenue guidance for the remainder of the year, and then I'll turn the question over to Stefan to talk about the guidance for the longer term period. The high -- the mid-high-teens are really being driven by, again, timing of store closures, timing related to a number of quality of sale initiatives. Whether it's pulling back significantly on inventory receipts, which will reduce sales. Whether it's -- the impact of pricing harmonization within regions and channels, et cetera. And we also don't expect as much benefit from sales mix shifts as we've seen in Q1 in particular."

Then, its -- everything is on the table, and then, we look at how do we drive brand strength and sustainable profitable sales growth in a responsible way from where we are to where we are heading, and entering speed pipeline. So I mentioned a few times before that coming into this role, the Wholesale relationship partnership was new to me. And I was blown away by our biggest customers and their willingness to take on the challenge together with us. So they are waiting for us to come back and say relating to the 8 weeks big pipeline and another -- a number of other areas to say, how can we partner up and create joint value out of this. Because when we get into a more balanced inventory and cut most of the excess out and be able to react on 8 weeks, then we will be able to create value, not only for us, but for them. And they are very clear on that. So we have an ongoing dialogue with them and they are waiting for us to be ready to start to execute on it. What excites me is to see by the speed, Halide, and his -- her team have come into not only assessing the state, but also reaching out to the suppliers. As I mentioned, we went to Asia, Halide and I, and met with our key suppliers. The suppliers that were there represent 70%, approximately, of our total volume. And we invited them into cocreate this journey, to cocreate the sourcing part the Way Forward Plan, which will also -- it didn't surprise me because I've more experience from working closely with sourcing partners that they were more than ready to dive in.

We last spoke at our Investor Day in early June, where we shared with you the details of our Way Forward Plan. The Way Forward Plan is our multiyear plan to build on the unique brand strengths we have, go back",1706,"Thank you, Evren, and good morning, everyone. We last spoke at our Investor Day in early June, where we shared with you the details of our Way Forward Plan. The Way Forward Plan is our multiyear plan to build on the unique brand strengths we have, go back to the core of what made us iconic, evolve from that core and build the business back to sustainable, profitable growth.
Today, I will share my key takeaways from the first quarter and then provide a brief update on what we have achieved and learned so far is starting to drive the execution of our Way Forward Plan. Then I will turn it over to Bob to review the company's quarterly financial performance in more detail.
Beginning with the quarter, performance was mostly in line with our expectations with some minor puts and takes, as we would expect at this early stage of the execution of our Way Forward Plan.
On the revenue side, the domestic business, as expected, continued to be challenged while the international business delivered a strong quarter, posting 10% revenue growth year-over-year. The main drivers to the decline in North America are what we shared in detail during the Investor Day: a combination of not having evolved our consumer offering enough in product, marketing, shopping experience and having had an operating model that has generated too much excess inventory. Having these self-induced challenges are hurting us when we, like everyone else, are facing difficult retail traffic trends in a highly promotional environment.
In our international markets, even though we have a much smaller presence there than in North America, and we globally have much improvement work to do ahead of us, there were valuable learnings in the quarter that we will use in building back strengths in our domestic business. Let me give you a few examples.
In Asia, over the last 6 months, we have acted aggressively to drive quality of sales up. Our team there proactively closed 43 brand weakening locations, reduced the length of the sale period by an average of 30% and significantly decreased the depth of markdown rates. We have seen some very encouraging results. Our average unit retail prices and our gross profit dollars were both up significantly. Simultaneously, the team has continued to drive high quality expansion.
In Europe, as expected, this quarter benefited from a shift in timing of wholesale shipments. However, the underlying business was also solid, and our team has driven several successful quality of sale initiatives. They have been able to reduce buys for this year in a way that has protected full price selling, increased the stock turnover and if the current trend continues, we'll significantly reduce excess inventory at the end of the season.
As a part of executing the Way Forward Plan, you will see us increasingly focus on proactively driving quality of sales up. These initiatives will include pulling back on inventory receipts, cutting lead times, strengthening our assortment and store closures. These will be some of the most important drivers in getting us back to sustainable, profitable growth.
Speaking of profitability. In the first quarter, operating margin was better than our guidance. However, this was driven by one-time benefits that Bob will take you through in detail. Excluding this impact, the quarter was in line with our expectations.
Now let me give you an update on our progress on the execution of the Way Forward Plan. As you recall from Investor Day, the Way Forward Plan is built up of a consumer facing part, where we're going to refocus on and evolve from the core in product, marketing and the shopping experience. In the second part, that is about evolving the operating model, where we are developing 4 business engines: a systematic repeatable way of building a stronger assortment; a demand-driven supply chain; a best-in-class sourcing; and a multichannel global expansion strategy. Underlying both of these 2 parts is the foundation of strengthening the leadership team and culture, as well as developing a strong economic model.
Let me start by sharing how we have strengthened the foundation, starting with the leadership team. Jane Nielsen, our new Chief Financial Officer, will be starting right after Labor Day. I can't tell you how excited I am to soon have Jane here on the ground working next to me. Jane has the knowledge and experience to support us with driving a very strong execution.
Jeff Kuster, our new Group President for the Americas, has been on the ground for a month. He has already met several of our biggest customers and started the work together with his team to build a value creating plan that will get us back to high performance in North America. Halide Alagöz, our new Head of Global Sourcing, who started in early June, has already had a positive effect on the sourcing decisions we are making. She's working very closely with her team to build the best-in-class sourcing capability. Bill Campbell, our new Head of Global Supply Chain and Inventory Management, will be leaving Amazon shortly and joining us in early October. Finally, Fredrik Hjalmers, our Head of Global Expansion, started in June and has begun the work with this team to build out a global multi-brand and multichannel expansion plan.
Moving to the progress we have made in strengthening the organization. We already completed the planned rightsizing of our headcount by decreasing it with 8% and reduced layers from an average of 9 to 6, increasing each leaders span of control. The biggest positive effect of this is that we have become leaner, faster, will empower the doers and reclaim the entrepreneurial culture.
In addition, it drives an SG&A savings of approximately $115 million on an annualized basis already this year. Completing the plan rightsizing of the organization has given us a good start in fixing the overall cost structure and developing a disciplined financial model.
We're also underway with closing the underperforming stores we identified as part of the Way Forward Plan. In the first quarter, we closed 8 of the 50 plus total stores under consideration. We're also on track to getting the other targeted SG&A cost savings out during the remainder of the year. Let me now move to the consumer facing part of the Way Forward Plan and share some highlights that we're driving there.
For the last few months, Valerie Hermann and the other brand presidents, have been intensely centered on refocusing our core product offering and evolving from that core. And in doing that, we have not only been able to improve our classic iconic styles, but we have also been able to start counting the long tail of unproductive styles. So far, we have been able to partially impact what we bought for spring 2017 with a double-digit percentage reduction in the number of SKUs across our biggest brands.
The bigger impact in both evolving the product core and cutting more of the long tail will be seen for fall 2017, when we will be able to not just reduce what we buy, but also what we develop. As we discussed in June, a big value driver that is connected to evolving our products and assortment is developing best-in-class sourcing.
Just a few weeks after Halide started, as our Head of Sourcing, she and I held a very important meeting in Asia with our key strategic suppliers, where we solicited their support in driving increased quality, decreased cost and increased flexibility and speed in our sourcing. We received a very strong response from many of our suppliers. And together with them, we have already started to make measurable improvements in driving quality up, cost down on comparable products and decreasing our time-to-market. We're also full-speed ahead with shortening our lead times from 15 to 9 months. And even though the full effect will not be seen for a few seasons, we will be 50% there already by the end of this year.
Next year, we should be 90% of the way there. Almost equally important to cutting the overall lead times down is the work we are doing in building an 8-week test and rapid response pipeline. For this year, we're just starting. And by next fall, we will have the capability that will enable testing on most of the new product ideas before introduction.
The work of developing a demand-driven supply chain has just started. Even though Bill Campbell is not starting until October, we have already adjusted our inventory levels down to better match demand and decrease excess inventory that drove excess markdowns and cannibalization.
Overall inventory levels are projected to go down for the remainder the year. In parallel to driving the execution of the Way Forward Plan, there were several important examples recently that demonstrated how we are building strength in the business from a position of unique and iconic brand strength. One of those proud moments was our presence at Wimbledon earlier this summer and another was the Olympic ceremony this last Friday, where we could see Team USA walk into the stadium, demonstrating the strength of American iconic style. We are so proud to be able to partner up with and support the U.S. Olympic team.
In conclusion, even though it's early days in the execution of our Way Forward Plan, this is a multiyear journey, and we are now one quarter in just in the beginning of the execution phase. I'm very pleased with the progress we are making. We have guided this year as a reset stabilized year, and that is what we are delivering on. We will continue to balance meeting our near-term commitments with staying on track to execute our long-term Way Forward Plan.
As I noted, we have made progress in a number of areas from strengthening the leadership team, to starting to improve the product and assortment building, starting to cut the lead times and improving our sourcing to the execution in the regions and the cost initiatives. I'm excited to see our teams taking on the challenges head on, and we believe the company is again moving in the right direction.
And with that, I would like to turn on the call over to Bob."
362220,376790177,1032970,"Ralph Lauren Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2016",2016-08-10,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. First quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion were down 4% compared to the prior year period on both the reported and constant currency basis. This is in line with the guidance we provided this past June of a mi",1432,"Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. First quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion were down 4% compared to the prior year period on both the reported and constant currency basis. This is in line with the guidance we provided this past June of a mid single-digit revenue decline. Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on revenue growth in the first quarter. On an adjusted basis, gross profit margin was 61.1% in the first quarter, excluding noncash inventory-related charges of $54 million associated with our restructuring activities.
This was 130 basis points above the prior year period, primarily reflecting favorable sales mix shifts, lower product cost and improvement in Asia, driven by initiatives to improve quality sale metrics. Operating expenses, on an adjusted basis, were $821 million, excluding $105 million in restructuring and other related charges. These expenses were down only 1% to last year, as our headcount reduction and other expense initiatives under the Way Forward Plan had limited benefit in the first quarter due to the timing of these activities.
Adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 8.2%, excluding $159 million in restructuring and other related charges. This was 60 basis points below last year due to fixed expense deleverage on lower net revenues and partially offset by higher gross margin. The adjusted operating margin performance was better than the outlook we provided in June of a 110 to 160 basis point decline driven by more favorable impact of our inventory management initiatives, specifically, lower inventory reserves due to restructuring-related inventory charges as well as product mix. The product mix shift was significant in Europe and was driven by a higher level of summer product within the wholesale shipments and a higher level of made-for-factory product and factory stores due to less excess inventory.
Adjusted net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $90 million or $1.06 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and other related charges. On a reported basis, net loss in the first quarter was $22 million or a loss of $0.27 per diluted share. The effective tax rate was 29% in the first quarter on an adjusted basis compared to an effective tax rate of 30% in the prior year period.
Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues decreased 5% in both reported and constant currency in the first quarter to $607 million. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in North America as the U.S. Department store channel continued to experience challenging traffic trends. This was partially offset by wholesale revenue growth in Europe, primarily driven by a benefit from timing of shipments relative to last year, in addition to proactive measures taking to clear inventory. Adjusted wholesale operating margin in the first quarter was 23.7%, excluding restructuring and other related charges.
This was 190 basis points above the prior year period driven by a higher gross margin. Retail segment sales decreased 3% in both reported and constant currency in the first quarter to $907 million. The sales decline was driven by comparable stores sales decline that was partially offset by noncomparable-store sales growth. Consolidated comparable store sales decreased 7% in constant currency and 6% as reported during the first quarter, primarily driven by lower traffic trends during the quarter and a challenging macro environment in most regions.
Global e-commerce revenues declined 6% during the quarter on a reported basis, primarily due to the company's pricing harmonization and other quality of sale initiatives. 
At the end of first quarter of fiscal 2017, we had 485 directly operated stand-alone stores and 598 concessions globally. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the company had 18 net new directly operated stores and 40 net new concession shops at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017. In addition, our international licensing partners operated 96 Ralph Lauren stores and 17 dedicated shops, as well as 60 Club Monaco stores and 74 Club Monaco concession shops at the end of first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Retail operating margin in the first quarter, excluding restructuring and other related charges, was 13.8%, which was 120 basis points above the prior year period due to a higher gross margin. Licensing revenues decreased 8% in both reported and constant currency impacted by timing of shipments during the quarter. Licensing segment operating income was down 7% in the first quarter compared with the prior year period. Now I'd like to provide some color on our performance by geography in the first quarter.
In the Americas, net revenue declined 11% as we continue to see pressure in the U.S. department store channel. Same-store sales were down high single digits in North America in the first quarter driven by traffic challenges.
In Europe, net revenues increased 14% on a reported basis and grew 15% in constant currency. This growth was mostly driven by a benefit from timing of shipments relative to last year. Excluding this shift, the underlying trend was solid in the quarter. Going forward, we note that the potential impact of Brexit on consumer spending and geopolitical volatility in the region are increasing uncertainty in this market. In Asia, net revenues increased 3% on a reported basis and were flat with prior year period in constant currency.
We experienced continuing growth in Japan and Australia. Same-store sales growth was negatively impacted by ongoing strategy to improve our quality of sale metrics in the region. We continue to experience gross margin improvement and average unit retails were up significantly while markdown rates were down significantly. Now let me provide you with an update on our restructuring activities related to the Way Forward Plan.
The company continues to expect restructuring activities to result in approximately $180 million to $220 million of annualized expense savings related to its initiatives to streamline the organizational structure and rightsize the cost structure and real estate portfolio. We continue to expect restructuring charges of up to $400 million as a result of the fiscal 2017 restructuring activities and up to $150 million inventory charge associated with the company's Way Forward Plan.
These charges are expected to be substantially realized by the end of fiscal 2017. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the company recorded $104 million in restructuring and related impairment charges and $50 million in inventory charges.
Now moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory was $1.2 billion at the end of the first quarter, down 2% year-over-year. The company expects inventory quality to continue to improve on the balance sheet as inventory clearance activities continue.
Moving to capital expenditures. We spent $78 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $68 million in the prior year period, mostly to support our retail store network, concession shops and infrastructure projects. During the first quarter, the company paid approximately $100 million related to repurchase of its Class A common stock. At the end the quarter, approximately $200 million remain available for future share repurchases. We ended the year with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $692 million of total debt.
Now I'd like to turn the guidance for fiscal 2017. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring, impairment and inventory-related charges in connection with the company's Way Forward Plan. For fiscal 2017, the company continues to expect consolidated net revenues to decrease at a low double-digit rate due to proactive pullback in inventory receipts, store closures, pricing harmonization and other quality sales initiative, combined with the weak retail traffic and a highly promotional environment in the U.S.
Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency will have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2017. The company continues to expect operating margin for fiscal '17 to be approximately 10%, as cost savings are expected to be offset by growth in new store expenses, unfavorable foreign currency impacts, infrastructure investments and fixed expense deleverage.
The fiscal 2017 tax rate is estimated to be approximately 29%. For the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company expects consolidated net revenues to be down mid- to high single digits on a reported basis. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency will have minimal impact on revenue growth in the second quarter.
Operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal '17 is expected to be 200 to 250 basis points below the comparable prior year period.

The biggest changes that we've made to support and strengthen the quality of sale that we're seeing in Asia is to really significantly cutback on our promotional stance. Two different ways: one, significantly shortening the length of promotion; and two, just the depth of the discounting in the markdown. And what we've seen is, overall, from a quality of sale perspective, whether it's looking at discount rates, which has decreased significantly. We've seen a very significant increase in average unit retail. And although we've seen a more moderate decrease in UPTs, overall, it's driving a stronger average transaction value for us. That's been the biggest change and the biggest benefit that we've seen from there.
When it comes to, Jeff Kuster, who just started, he is, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, he is starting with the assessment the challenge in North America and diagnosing that in detail. So we got of fact-based view on what we're up against. And then we are pivoting to building a plan to increase quality of sales in North America. So differences there, Omar, coming back to your question, there are definitely differences in Asia, North America based on channel differences as being one big difference. But it comes back to how we plan the inventory. How we buy the inventory to demand. How our promotional strategy, our promotional execution and how that plays across channels. That's why the fact-based diagnosis is so important. Jeff just started 3, 4 weeks ago, and he is underway with the team and we'll work with the different channels. And that's where we're going to have the most value in this analysis and coming back. That's what gives me the most confidence when it comes to a plan to increase quality of sales, that we are doing this for the first time cross channel, and we're going to do it together with our biggest customers as well. So we are looking forward to come back and provide our insights when we get them."

But at the same time, we also identified a number of additional points of distribution. So for example, on our wholesale channel, which is a relatively small business in Asia, but we saw in the quarter a 48% increase in the number of shops in our wholesale channel, too.

We're going to be 50% on a 9-month lead time by the end of this year. And we're going to be 90% on a 9-month lead time by next year. As I mentioned on the Investor Day, the biggest change here is a cultural change and it's a change of how we work as a team. So instead of work in a sequential way where you hand over function by function and by that, you build in slack in the lead times and you extended the lead times. We are working together cross-functionally. So one thing that, that's really excited me over the first couple of months digging into the Way Forward execution with the team is to break down the silos. To have design, merchandising, sourcing, sales, distribution channel at the table from the first design idea all the way into selling the actual product. And just by that, we cut a lot of time from the lead times.
And then it's about going and mapping through. And Halide Alagöz is leading that work. She is mapping every single component of the current lead times and looking at is -- how is every component and every day and hour spent adding value to driving brand strength and profitable sales growth and driving a stronger assortment. And I can say that I'm very encouraged by the fact that we are digging out that. We will be 90% on a 9-month lead time by the end of next year. Parallel to that is going to be the 8-week test and rapid response pipeline. Because that's going to be a big enabler as well. That -- in a very short period of time, we're going to be able to test any and every new big product idea before we go big. And rapid response part of that is to say, when we sell something and we see a bigger demand than expected, we will be able to much faster chase back into those products."

On the model, could you help us think about the, the planned cost savings split between SG&A and cost of goods sold as we look at both the second quarter and the second half? I guess, I thought -- I guess we have a little bit upside down in our model. I thought some of the cost reductions you had already taken would have meant more SG&A leverage this quarter and maybe not as much cost of goods. And then longer-term, as you guys laid out the plan for the next 4 years at the Analyst Day. You referred to 2018 as revenue stabilizing. And as we look at it, with the guidance you give today, we were able to do a little bit of math around the year, and we can see that the back half of the year looks like revenues will be down by mid- to high-teens, it looks like. We know in the fourth quarter, you will have to lap an Easter shift and an extra week. And then you'll be closing stores, it'll naturally be lower. But certainly, some the drivers on why that growth rate leaving the year will be so low will extend into the first half of next year. I'm trying to think if a little bit of time is gone by now, if you could help us think about how to -- may start quantifying what your real reference to stabilizing revenues will look like in fiscal 18, given what you know about the business today as you start walking into the plan."

Relative to your first question on the SG&A cost savings, the majority of our restructuring activities are more heavily weighted to the second half the year. So for instance, our organizational changes were just made in June. So you'll start to see the benefit of those in Q2, but they'll be much more heavily weighted to the second half. Of the overall savings that we discussed and quantified at the Investors Day relative to the Way Forward Plan of $445 million, that's a gross number. It doesn't represent net savings that will drop to the bottom line and all of those savings essentially represent SG&A savings, not cost of goods savings. So more heavily weighted to the second half, related to your question on SG&A expenses, particularly as it relates to completion of our anticipated store closures. So we communicated 50 plus closures. We're actually looking a little deeper at that number. And relative to that 50 plus, we closed 8 in Q1. So again, our store closures are more heavily weighted towards the second half the year. And that's purposeful because we are committed to inventory buys for a lot of those stores, and we want to be able to liquidate them through those doors. Relative to the revenue guidance for the remainder of the year, and then I'll turn the question over to Stefan to talk about the guidance for the longer term period. The high -- the mid-high-teens are really being driven by, again, timing of store closures, timing related to a number of quality of sale initiatives. Whether it's pulling back significantly on inventory receipts, which will reduce sales. Whether it's -- the impact of pricing harmonization within regions and channels, et cetera. And we also don't expect as much benefit from sales mix shifts as we've seen in Q1 in particular."

Then, its -- everything is on the table, and then, we look at how do we drive brand strength and sustainable profitable sales growth in a responsible way from where we are to where we are heading, 8-week speed pipeline. So I mentioned a few times before that coming into this role, the Wholesale relationship partnership was new to me. And I was blown away by our biggest customers and their willingness to take on the challenge together with us. So they are waiting for us to come back and say relating to the 8 weeks speed pipeline and another -- a number of other areas to say, how can we partner up and create joint value out of this. Because when we get into a more balanced inventory and cut most of the excess out and be able to react on 8 weeks, then we will be able to create value, not only for us, but for them. And they are very clear on that. So we have an ongoing dialogue with them and they are waiting for us to be ready to start to execute on it. What excites me is to see by the speed, Halide, and his -- her team have come into not only assessing the state, but also reaching out to the suppliers. As I mentioned, we went to Asia, Halide and I, and met with our key suppliers. The suppliers that were there represent 70%, approximately, of our total volume. And we invited them into cocreate this journey, to cocreate the sourcing part the Way Forward Plan, which will also -- it didn't surprise me because I've more experience from working closely with sourcing partners that they were more than ready to dive in.

So Halide has like everyone else working on the Way Forward Plan. She has started -- she and her team has started focusing on the core.

We last spoke at our Investor Day in early June, where we shared with you the details of our Way Forward Plan. The Way Forward Plan is our multiyear plan to build on the unique brand strengths we have, go back",1706,"Thank you, Evren, and good morning, everyone. We last spoke at our Investor Day in early June, where we shared with you the details of our Way Forward Plan. The Way Forward Plan is our multiyear plan to build on the unique brand strengths we have, go back to the core of what made us iconic, evolve from that core and build the business back to sustainable, profitable growth.
Today, I will share my key takeaways from the first quarter and then provide a brief update on what we have achieved and learned so far is starting to drive the execution of our Way Forward Plan. Then I will turn it over to Bob to review the company's quarterly financial performance in more detail.
Beginning with the quarter, performance was mostly in line with our expectations with some minor puts and takes, as we would expect at this early stage of the execution of our Way Forward Plan.
On the revenue side, the domestic business, as expected, continued to be challenged while the international business delivered a strong quarter, posting 10% revenue growth year-over-year. The main drivers to the decline in North America are what we shared in detail during the Investor Day: a combination of not having evolved our consumer offering enough in product, marketing, shopping experience and having had an operating model that has generated too much excess inventory. Having these self-induced challenges are hurting us when we, like everyone else, are facing difficult retail traffic trends in a highly promotional environment.
In our international markets, even though we have a much smaller presence there than in North America, and we globally have much improvement work to do ahead of us, there were valuable learnings in the quarter that we will use in building back strengths in our domestic business. Let me give you a few examples.
In Asia, over the last 6 months, we have acted aggressively to drive quality of sales up. Our team there proactively closed 43 brand weakening locations, reduced the length of the sale period by an average of 30% and significantly decreased the depth of markdown rates. We have seen some very encouraging results. Our average unit retail prices and our gross profit dollars were both up significantly. Simultaneously, the team has continued to drive high quality expansion.
In Europe, as expected, this quarter benefited from a shift in timing of wholesale shipments. However, the underlying business was also solid, and our team has driven several successful quality of sale initiatives. They have been able to reduce buys for this year in a way that has protected full price selling, increased the stock turnover and if the current trend continues, we'll significantly reduce excess inventory at the end of the season.
As a part of executing the Way Forward Plan, you will see us increasingly focus on proactively driving quality of sales up. These initiatives will include pulling back on inventory receipts, cutting lead times, strengthening our assortment and store closures. These will be some of the most important drivers in getting us back to sustainable, profitable growth.
Speaking of profitability. In the first quarter, operating margin was better than our guidance. However, this was driven by one-time benefits that Bob will take you through in detail. Excluding this impact, the quarter was in line with our expectations.
Now let me give you an update on our progress on the execution of the Way Forward Plan. As you recall from Investor Day, the Way Forward Plan is built up of a consumer facing part, where we're going to refocus on and evolve from the core in product, marketing and the shopping experience. In the second part, that is about evolving the operating model, where we are developing 4 business engines: a systematic repeatable way of building a stronger assortment; a demand-driven supply chain; a best-in-class sourcing; and a multichannel global expansion strategy. Underlying both of these 2 parts is the foundation of strengthening the leadership team and culture, as well as developing a strong economic model.
Let me start by sharing how we have strengthened the foundation, starting with the leadership team. Jane Nielsen, our new Chief Financial Officer, will be starting right after Labor Day. I can't tell you how excited I am to soon have Jane here on the ground working next to me. Jane has the knowledge and experience to support us with driving a very strong execution.
Jeff Kuster, our new Group President for the Americas, has been on the ground for a month. He has already met several of our biggest customers and started the work together with his team to build a value creating plan that will get us back to high performance in North America. Halide Alagöz, our new Head of Global Sourcing, who started in early June, has already had a positive effect on the sourcing decisions we are making. She's working very closely with her team to build the best-in-class sourcing capability. Bill Campbell, our new Head of Global Supply Chain and Inventory Management, will be leaving Amazon shortly and joining us in early October. Finally, Fredrik Hjalmers, our Head of Global Expansion, started in June and has begun the work with this team to build out a global multi-brand and multichannel expansion plan.
Moving to the progress we have made in strengthening the organization. We already completed the planned rightsizing of our headcount by decreasing it with 8% and reduced layers from an average of 9 to 6, increasing each leaders span of control. The biggest positive effect of this is that we have become leaner, faster, will empower the doers and reclaim the entrepreneurial culture.
In addition, it drives an SG&A savings of approximately $115 million on an annualized basis already this year. Completing the plan rightsizing of the organization has given us a good start in fixing the overall cost structure and developing a disciplined financial model.
We're also underway with closing the underperforming stores we identified as part of the Way Forward Plan. In the first quarter, we closed 8 of the 50 plus total stores under consideration. We're also on track to getting the other targeted SG&A cost savings out during the remainder of the year. Let me now move to the consumer facing part of the Way Forward Plan and share some highlights that we're driving there.
For the last few months, Valerie Hermann and the other brand presidents, have been intensely centered on refocusing our core product offering and evolving from that core. And in doing that, we have not only been able to improve our classic iconic styles, but we have also been able to start counting the long tail of unproductive styles. So far, we have been able to partially impact what we bought for spring 2017 with a double-digit percentage reduction in the number of SKUs across our biggest brands.
The bigger impact in both evolving the product core and cutting more of the long tail will be seen for fall 2017, when we will be able to not just reduce what we buy, but also what we develop. As we discussed in June, a big value driver that is connected to evolving our products and assortment is developing best-in-class sourcing.
Just a few weeks after Halide started, as our Head of Sourcing, she and I held a very important meeting in Asia with our key strategic suppliers, where we solicited their support in driving increased quality, decreased cost and increased flexibility and speed in our sourcing. We received a very strong response from many of our suppliers. And together with them, we have already started to make measurable improvements in driving quality up, cost down on comparable products and decreasing our time-to-market. We're also full-speed ahead with shortening our lead times from 15 to 9 months. And even though the full effect will not be seen for a few seasons, we will be 50% there already by the end of this year.
Next year, we should be 90% of the way there. Almost equally important to cutting the overall lead times down is the work we are doing in building an 8-week test and rapid response pipeline. For this year, we're just starting. And by next fall, we will have the capability that will enable testing on most of the new product ideas before introduction.
The work of developing a demand-driven supply chain has just started. Even though Bill Campbell is not starting until October, we have already adjusted our inventory levels down to better match demand and decrease excess inventory that drove excess markdowns and cannibalization.
Overall inventory levels are projected to go down for the remainder the year. In parallel to driving the execution of the Way Forward Plan, there were several important examples recently that demonstrated how we are building strength in the business from a position of unique and iconic brand strength. One of those proud moments was our presence at Wimbledon earlier this summer and another was the Olympic ceremony this last Friday, where we could see Team USA walk into the stadium, demonstrating the strength of American iconic style. We are so proud to be able to partner up with and support the U.S. Olympic team.
In conclusion, even though it's early days in the execution of our Way Forward Plan, this is a multiyear journey, and we are now one quarter in just in the beginning of the execution phase. I'm very pleased with the progress we are making. We have guided this year as a reset stabilized year, and that is what we are delivering on. We will continue to balance meeting our near-term commitments with staying on track to execute our long-term Way Forward Plan.
As I noted, we have made progress in a number of areas from strengthening the leadership team, to starting to improve the product and assortment building, starting to cut the lead times and improving our sourcing to the execution in the regions and the cost initiatives. I'm excited to see our teams taking on the challenges head on, and we believe the company is again moving in the right direction.
And with that, I would like to turn on the call over to Bob."
362220,376790177,1033352,"Ralph Lauren Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2016",2016-08-10,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. First quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion were down 4% compared to the prior year period on both the reported and constant currency basis. This is in line with the guidance we provided this past June of a mi",1431,"Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. First quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion were down 4% compared to the prior year period on both the reported and constant currency basis. This is in line with the guidance we provided this past June of a mid-single-digit revenue decline. Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on revenue growth in the first quarter. On an adjusted basis, gross profit margin was 61.1% in the first quarter, excluding noncash inventory-related charges of $54 million associated with our restructuring activities.
This was 130 basis points above the prior year period, primarily reflecting favorable sales mix shifts, lower product cost and improvement in Asia, driven by initiatives to improve quality sale metrics. Operating expenses, on an adjusted basis, were $821 million, excluding $105 million in restructuring and other related charges. These expenses were down only 1% to last year, as our headcount reduction and other expense initiatives under the Way Forward Plan had limited benefit in the first quarter due to the timing of these activities.
Adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 8.2%, excluding $159 million in restructuring and other related charges. This was 60 basis points below last year due to fixed expense deleverage on lower net revenues and partially offset by higher gross margin. The adjusted operating margin performance was better than the outlook we provided in June of a 110 to 160 basis point decline driven by more favorable impact of our inventory management initiatives, specifically, lower inventory reserves due to restructuring-related inventory charges as well as product mix. The product mix shift was significant in Europe and was driven by a higher level of summer product within the wholesale shipments and a higher level of made-for-factory product and factory stores due to less excess inventory.
Adjusted net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $90 million or $1.06 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and other related charges. On a reported basis, net loss in the first quarter was $22 million or a loss of $0.27 per diluted share. The effective tax rate was 29% in the first quarter on an adjusted basis compared to an effective tax rate of 30% in the prior year period.
Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues decreased 5% in both reported and constant currency in the first quarter to $607 million. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in North America as the U.S. Department store channel continued to experience challenging traffic trends. This was partially offset by wholesale revenue growth in Europe, primarily driven by a benefit from timing of shipments relative to last year, in addition to proactive measures taking to clear inventory. Adjusted wholesale operating margin in the first quarter was 23.7%, excluding restructuring and other related charges.
This was 190 basis points above the prior year period driven by a higher gross margin. Retail segment sales decreased 3% in both reported and constant currency in the first quarter to $907 million. The sales decline was driven by comparable stores sales decline that was partially offset by noncomparable-store sales growth. Consolidated comparable store sales decreased 7% in constant currency and 6% as reported during the first quarter, primarily driven by lower traffic trends during the quarter and a challenging macro environment in most regions.
Global e-commerce revenues declined 6% during the quarter on a reported basis, primarily due to the company's pricing harmonization and other quality of sale initiatives. 
At the end of first quarter of fiscal 2017, we had 485 directly operated stand-alone stores and 598 concessions globally. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the company had 18 net new directly operated stores and 40 net new concession shops at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017. In addition, our international licensing partners operated 96 Ralph Lauren stores and 17 dedicated shops, as well as 60 Club Monaco stores and 74 Club Monaco concession shops at the end of first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Retail operating margin in the first quarter, excluding restructuring and other related charges, was 13.8%, which was 120 basis points above the prior year period due to a higher gross margin. Licensing revenues decreased 8% in both reported and constant currency impacted by timing of shipments during the quarter. Licensing segment operating income was down 7% in the first quarter compared with the prior year period. Now I'd like to provide some color on our performance by geography in the first quarter.
In the Americas, net revenue declined 11% as we continue to see pressure in the U.S. department store channel. Same-store sales were down high single digits in North America in the first quarter driven by traffic challenges.
In Europe, net revenues increased 14% on a reported basis and grew 15% in constant currency. This growth was mostly driven by a benefit from timing of shipments relative to last year. Excluding this shift, the underlying trend was solid in the quarter. Going forward, we note that the potential impact of Brexit on consumer spending and geopolitical volatility in the region are increasing uncertainty in this market. In Asia, net revenues increased 3% on a reported basis and were flat with prior year period in constant currency.
We experienced continuing growth in Japan and Australia. Same-store sales growth was negatively impacted by ongoing strategy to improve our quality of sale metrics in the region. We continue to experience gross margin improvement and average unit retails were up significantly while markdown rates were down significantly. Now let me provide you with an update on our restructuring activities related to the Way Forward Plan.
The company continues to expect restructuring activities to result in approximately $180 million to $220 million of annualized expense savings related to its initiatives to streamline the organizational structure and rightsize the cost structure and real estate portfolio. We continue to expect restructuring charges of up to $400 million as a result of the fiscal 2017 restructuring activities and up to $150 million inventory charge associated with the company's Way Forward Plan.
These charges are expected to be substantially realized by the end of fiscal 2017. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the company recorded $104 million in restructuring and related impairment charges and $50 million in inventory charges.
Now moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory was $1.2 billion at the end of the first quarter, down 2% year-over-year. The company expects inventory quality to continue to improve on the balance sheet as inventory clearance activities continue.
Moving to capital expenditures. We spent $78 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $68 million in the prior year period, mostly to support our retail store network, concession shops and infrastructure projects. During the first quarter, the company paid approximately $100 million related to repurchase of its Class A common stock. At the end the quarter, approximately $200 million remain available for future share repurchases. We ended the year with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $692 million of total debt.
Now I'd like to turn the guidance for fiscal 2017. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring, impairment and inventory-related charges in connection with the company's Way Forward Plan. For fiscal 2017, the company continues to expect consolidated net revenues to decrease at a low double-digit rate due to proactive pullback in inventory receipts, store closures, pricing harmonization and other quality sales initiative, combined with the weak retail traffic and a highly promotional environment in the U.S.
Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency will have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2017. The company continues to expect operating margin for fiscal '17 to be approximately 10%, as cost savings are expected to be offset by growth in new store expenses, unfavorable foreign currency impacts, infrastructure investments and fixed expense deleverage.
The fiscal 2017 tax rate is estimated to be approximately 29%. For the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company expects consolidated net revenues to be down mid- to high single digits on a reported basis. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency will have minimal impact on revenue growth in the second quarter.
Operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal '17 is expected to be 200 to 250 basis points below the comparable prior year period.

The biggest changes that we've made to support and strengthen the quality of sale that we're seeing in Asia is to really significantly cut back on our promotional stance. Two different ways: one, significantly shortening the length of promotion; and two, just the depth of the discounting in the markdown. And what we've seen is, overall, from a quality of sale perspective, whether it's looking at discount rates, which has decreased significantly. We've seen a very significant increase in average unit retail. And although we've seen a more moderate decrease in UPTs, overall, it's driving a stronger average transaction value for us. That's been the biggest change and the biggest benefit that we've seen from there.
When it comes to, Jeff Kuster, who just started, he is, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, he is starting with the assessment the challenge in North America and diagnosing that in detail. So we got of fact-based view on what we're up against. And then we are pivoting to building a plan to increase quality of sales in North America. So differences there, Omar, coming back to your question, there are definitely differences in Asia, North America based on channel differences as being one big difference. But it comes back to how we plan the inventory. How we buy the inventory to demand. How our promotional strategy, our promotional execution and how that plays across channels. That's why the fact-based diagnosis is so important. Jeff just started 3, 4 weeks ago, and he is underway with the team and we'll work with the different channels. And that's where we're going to have the most value in this analysis and coming back. That's what gives me the most confidence when it comes to a plan to increase quality of sales, that we are doing this for the first time cross channel, and we're going to do it together with our biggest customers as well. So we are looking forward to come back and provide our insights when we get them."

But at the same time, we also identified a number of additional points of distribution. So for example, on our wholesale channel, which is a relatively small business in Asia, but we saw in the quarter a 48% increase in the number of shops in our wholesale channel, too.

We're going to be 50% on a 9-month lead time by the end of this year. And we're going to be 90% on a 9-month lead time by next year. As I mentioned on the Investor Day, the biggest change here is a cultural change and it's a change of how we work as a team. So instead of work in a sequential way where you hand over function by function and by that, you build in slack in the lead times and you extended the lead times. We are working together cross-functionally. So one thing that, that's really excited me over the first couple of months digging into the Way Forward execution with the team is to break down the silos. To have design, merchandising, sourcing, sales, distribution channel at the table from the first design idea all the way into selling the actual product. And just by that, we cut a lot of time from the lead times.
And then it's about going and mapping through. And Halide Alagöz is leading that work. She is mapping every single component of the current lead times and looking at is -- how is every component and every day and hour spent adding value to driving brand strength and profitable sales growth and driving a stronger assortment. And I can say that I'm very encouraged by the fact that we are digging out that. We will be 90% on a 9-month lead time by the end of next year. Parallel to that is going to be the 8-week test and rapid response pipeline. Because that's going to be a big enabler as well. That -- in a very short period of time, we're going to be able to test any and every new big product idea before we go big. And rapid response part of that is to say, when we sell something and we see a bigger demand than expected, we will be able to much faster chase back into those products."

On the model, could you help us think about the, the planned cost savings split between SG&A and cost of goods sold as we look at both the second quarter and the second half? I guess, I thought -- I guess we have a little bit upside down in our model. I thought some of the cost reductions you had already taken would have meant more SG&A leverage this quarter and maybe not as much cost of goods. And then longer term, as you guys laid out the plan for the next 4 years at the Analyst Day. You referred to 2018 as revenue stabilizing. And as we look at it, with the guidance you give today, we were able to do a little bit of math around the year, and we can see that the back half of the year looks like revenues will be down by mid- to high-teens, it looks like. We know in the fourth quarter, you will have to lap an Easter shift and an extra week. And then you'll be closing stores, it'll naturally be lower. But certainly, some the drivers on why that growth rate leaving the year will be so low will extend into the first half of next year. I'm trying to think if a little bit of time is gone by now, if you could help us think about how to -- may start quantifying what your real reference to stabilizing revenues will look like in fiscal 18, given what you know about the business today as you start walking into the plan."

Relative to your first question on the SG&A cost savings, the majority of our restructuring activities are more heavily weighted to the second half the year. So for instance, our organizational changes were just made in June. So you'll start to see the benefit of those in Q2, but they'll be much more heavily weighted to the second half. Of the overall savings that we discussed and quantified at the Investors Day relative to the Way Forward Plan of $445 million, that's a gross number. It doesn't represent net savings that will drop to the bottom line and all of those savings essentially represent SG&A savings, not cost of goods savings. So more heavily weighted to the second half, related to your question on SG&A expenses, particularly as it relates to completion of our anticipated store closures. So we communicated 50 plus closures. We're actually looking a little deeper at that number. And relative to that 50 plus, we closed 8 in Q1. So again, our store closures are more heavily weighted towards the second half the year. And that's purposeful because we are committed to inventory buys for a lot of those stores, and we want to be able to liquidate them through those doors. Relative to the revenue guidance for the remainder of the year, and then I'll turn the question over to Stefan to talk about the guidance for the longer term period. The high -- the mid-high-teens are really being driven by, again, timing of store closures, timing related to a number of quality of sale initiatives. Whether it's pulling back significantly on inventory receipts, which will reduce sales. Whether it's -- the impact of pricing harmonization within regions and channels, et cetera. And we also don't expect as much benefit from sales mix shifts as we've seen in Q1 in particular."

When it comes to friends and family and other couponing initiatives are on the table. Everything is on the table. Then, its -- everything is on the table, and then, we look at how do we drive brand strength and sustainable profitable sales growth in a responsible way from where we are to where we are heading, 8-week speed pipeline. So I mentioned a few times before that coming into this role, the Wholesale relationship partnership was new to me. And I was blown away by our biggest customers and their willingness to take on the challenge together with us. So they are waiting for us to come back and say relating to the 8 weeks speed pipeline and another -- a number of other areas to say, how can we partner up and create joint value out of this. Because when we get into a more balanced inventory and cut most of the excess out and be able to react on 8 weeks, then we will be able to create value, not only for us, but for them. And they are very clear on that. So we have an ongoing dialogue with them and they are waiting for us to be ready to start to execute on it. What excites me is to see by the speed, Halide, and his -- her team have come into not only assessing the state, but also reaching out to the suppliers. As I mentioned, we went to Asia, Halide and I, and met with our key suppliers. The suppliers that were there represent 70%, approximately, of our total volume. And we invited them into cocreate this journey, to cocreate the sourcing part the Way Forward Plan, which will also -- it didn't surprise me because I've more experience from working closely with sourcing partners that they were more than ready to dive in.

Since we last spoke on our earnings call in August, the team and I have continued our intense focus on driving the execution of our Way Forward Plan. The Way Forward Plan, as a reminder, is our multiyear strategy to build on the unique brand strengths we have, go back to the core of what made Ralph Lauren iconic, evolve from that core and build the business back to sustainable, profitable growth. We are 2 quarters into executing on the plan, and my focus is leading our teams to ensure that every action we take today drives towards our long-term Way Forward goals while, at the same time, optimizing near-term performance. 
Today, I will share my key learnings from the second quarter and then provide an update on our progress in driving the execution of our Way Forward Plan. Then I'm excited about having Jane here with me and will turn it over to her to review the details of the company's quarterly financial performance and our outlook for fiscal 2017. 
In the second quarter, we continue to deliver against our expectations. Our performance keeps us on track to achieve our full year fiscal 2017 guidance with some changes in the quarterly [ph] flow. In the second quarter, revenue of $1.8 billion was consistent with our plan, while operating margin was ahead of our target, driven by higher gross margins in our international markets, quality of sales initiatives starting to get traction and planned SG&A expenses shifting into the third quarter. Jane will take you through these in detail. 
Our revenue in the quarter declined in line with our plan, down 8% versus prior year, with continued and expected larger decline in wholesale than retail. Consistent with our Way Forward Plan, we continue to drive the quality of our sales up by moderating discount rates, tightening inventory buys and closing another 7 underperforming stores in the quarter. These initiatives successfully reduced inventories, which were down 15% to last year at the end of the quarter. 
North America continues to be our most challenged market where revenue declined 12% in the quarter. As I shared on our last call, assessing our North American challenge, which to a large extent is self-induced, and building and executing a plan to get back to winning in North America is one of our biggest priorities. 
In our international markets, revenue increased 2% in the second quarter. Our teams there continue to drive up quality of sales, rightsize the inventory and optimize the store fleets to build the foundation for profitable growth.
In Asia, we continue to see encouraging results of our proactive quality of sales actions. Over the last 9 months, our team has now closed a total of 72 points of distribution that weakened the brand and opened 159 new high-quality points of sale. The new points of distribution have better locations, improved adjacencies and refreshed store environments relative to the locations we closed. 
In addition, we continue to reduce the length of the sale periods and significantly decrease the depth of [ph] markdown rates. We continue to see the positive impact of our initiatives on profitability. Over the past 9 months, our average unit retail prices are up 10% in constant currency, and our gross profit margin continues to expand.
In Europe, growth remains solid in the second quarter, and our team is [ph] centered on tighter inventory management, strengthening the assortment and resulting in improved margins. 
Now let me give you a few important updates on our progress on the execution of the Way Forward Plan.  As we are still early in the execution of the plan, there will often be a lag time between when we take a Way Forward action and when it shows up in the P&L. However, I do see early indicators of success, and I would use these calls to give you updates on the progress points of our execution. 
The Way Forward Plan is built on 2 key parts. The first is consumer-facing, where we're going to focus on and evolve from the core in product, marketing and the shopping experience. The second part is about evolving the operating model, where we are developing 4 business engines: a systematic repeatable way of building a stronger assortment, a demand-driven supply chain, a best-in-class sourcing capability and a multichannel global expansion strategy. Underlying both of these 2 parts is the foundation of strengthening the leadership team and culture as well as developing a strong economic model.
With the addition of Jane Nielsen from Coach and Bill Campbell from Amazon last quarter, we are now very close to having our full operations team in place. The only outstanding role to fill is the Global Chief Marketing Officer, and we are underway with that search.
Delivering on our objective to increase our focus and resources on our core brands, we recently announced our decision to discontinue the Denim & Supply brand. We will address the denim market more effectively through our Polo brand by leveraging the brand strengths of Polo. 
Moving on to the work of evolving the assortment and product. I'm excited about the work that Valerie and her team are driving in cutting the product tail, [ph] refocusing our core product offering and evolving from that core.  In the second quarter, we continue to make good progress in identifying and cutting the long tail of unproductive styles, leading to a big reduction in the number of SKUs.
For Fall 2016, we achieved a 10% reduction in SKUs across our apparel brands. And for spring 2017, we are on track to achieve over a 20% reduction. And for Fall 2017, we're on the way to further SKU reductions.
The style and SKU reduction frees up time, resources and creativity to focus on and evolve our core icons, leading to a more productive and desirable assortment. Our improved discipline in assortment creation enables us to buy closer to market and reduce early commitments. We continue to expect to be halfway through to [ph] our goal of a 9-month lead time by the end of this fiscal year and 90% there by the end of next fiscal year. 
The key unlock [ph] for our shorter lead times is the fabric platforming for our core styles. We made significant progress in this area during the quarter.  Almost all of our core fabrics will be platformed by the end of this month. This enables us to increase the quality of our fabric, secure better prices and decrease our lead times and increase our flexibility to react to selling-in season. We can now, for the first time, work in partnership with our big customers and move from buying a blind [ph] before their buys to buying our inventory based on their buys and therefore significantly improve matching our inventory to the real demand.
In the second quarter, we continue to drive down inventory levels across the company to get closer to matching inventory with demand. In addition to our inventory restructuring actions, I'm pleased with our meaningful progress to reduce inventory buys. Although we are still in the early stages of this journey, optimizing our buys should improve sell-throughs and gross margin rate.
Now I want to share our plan to come back to high performance in North America. North America is our largest market and one where it's essential for us to return to profitable growth. The plan is based on leveraging our unique brand strength, solid market position and strong relationships with our wholesale partners. 
As we mentioned on our last call, Jeff Kuster joined in July as our new Group President for the Americas. Together with his team, Jeff has worked through a detailed, fact-based assessment of our North American challenges. From that assessment, we have built a plan that will take us back to strength. 
And strength in North America starts with our U.S. wholesale business.  The challenges we face there are similar to our overall challenges as a company that we shared during our Investor Day in June. We have been buying too much inventory, letting that overflow to value channels, buying too much in the [ph] product tail, buying too early before the customers have bought, not created room to chase in season [ph] and distributed too much in the low-volume shops and promoted too deep and too frequently.
To start building strength back, we will work even more closely with our biggest wholesale customers, partnering together with them to build strength that will make us both drive high performance. Together, we will, first, reduce our overall buys to better match demand. This will reduce the overflow of inventory going to value channels. Second, cut the product tail and refocus investments in the evolved [ph] core. This will improve inventory productivity. Third, we will cut supplier lead times. This will allow our customers to buy much closer in and improve the flexibility to chase in [ph] season. Fourth, we will refocus our marketing efforts in line with our Way Forward Plan to develop cut-through marketing campaigns for our main brands. This will be targeted to drive traffic and conversion. Our first initiatives will start with Polo in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Fifth and finally, working in collaboration with our partners, we will reduce and close the tail of our distribution, which accounts for 20% to 25% of the total distribution points. 
These shops represent a very small share of sales and profit for us as well as our partners. Just as with assortment, we will refocus on and evolve from the core, which means the top-selling doors, and invest in refreshing and rebuilding the store experience. This will create an exciting shopping experience and supercharge the evolved assortment strategy. 
It's worth mentioning again that we believe in the strong wholesale channel and in the well-executed department store. We believe a well-curated department store offers a convenient and exciting shopping experience that saves the consumer time while also bringing them into the brand. Our distribution plan will follow the consumer. And department stores, off- and online, represent one of the largest channels the full-price consumer shops today and in the near future.
Parallel to strengthening our wholesale efforts, we're also strengthening our e-commerce presence. But even though department stores represent one of the biggest channels for our consumers, the e-commerce channel has the highest growth rate and is increasingly important. Our assessment of our e-commerce challenges and our plan to strengthen e-commerce are also very much in line with our overall Way Forward Plan assessment and plan. We are reducing the overall buys. We are reducing the promotions. We are reducing the product tail. We are refocusing on and evolving our core products and will start to present them in an evolved and refreshed way. 
We have taken the first steps here. And you can now see our refreshed landing pages [ph] on both our mobile as well as our desktop site.  We recently launched our redesigned mobile site, which features significant improvements in functionality. We improved the checkout process, navigation and creative execution, and many more steps to follow on that. 
Finally, a few words on marketing. In September, we held our first-ever see-now-buy-now runway show for the women's collection. The show was held in a glass structure on the sidewalk outside of our Madison Avenue flagship. We even managed to close down Madison Avenue for a few hours. It was a big success and generated more than twice the global media value compared to the previous season's show.
We also recently launched the Ralph Lauren Icons campaign in our women's luxury business. It's built on our Way Forward goal to refocus on and evolve from core iconic products to make them even more desirable to today's consumer. The response so far has been very positive. 
In conclusion, we are making good progress against our Way Forward Plan. While most of it is still to be done, I'm excited with what I see. During the last 3 months, while we have been getting ready to execute the [ph] holiday season, I've been traveling extensively and spent much time with our teams and our biggest customers. From my perspective, whether I'm in Little Rock, Arkansas with our friends at Dillard's or seeing our newly renovated flagship store come to life on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills or visiting our new Polo store on Regent Street in London, I feel the excitement from our teams and partners that we are starting to move towards unlocking the true potential of this great brand that Ralph started almost 50 years ago. 
So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Jane."

It's great to be with all of you and to be a part of the Ralph Lauren team. I'm excited about executing our Way Forward Plan and sharing our progress with you.

I'm excited about executing our Way Forward Plan and sharing our progress with you. 
Second quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion were down 8% to last year on both a reported and constant currency basis. This reflects our quality of sales initiatives starting to take hold and is in line with the guidance we provided in August of mid- to high single-digit revenue decline.  Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on revenue growth in the second quarter. 
On an adjusted basis, gross margin was 56.9% in the second quarter, excluding noncash inventory-related charges of $81 million associated with our restructuring activities. This was 40 basis points above prior year, primarily driven by favorable geographic and channel mix shifts, improved product costing and initiatives to improve quality of sales primarily to reduce promotional activity in our international businesses.  This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects of approximately 80 basis points. 
Operating expenses on an adjusted basis were $809 million, excluding $69 million in restructuring and other related charges. These expenses were down 4% compared to last year primarily as a result of expense initiatives under the Way Forward Plan, including headcount reductions and 7 store closures.
Store closures in the second quarter were lower than expectations. We delayed closures to take advantage of the peak holiday shopping period and to minimize store closure costs through negotiations with our landlords. 
Adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 12.4%, excluding $150 million in restructuring and other related charges. This was 110 basis points below last year due to fixed cost expense [ph] deleverage on lower net revenues, which was partially offset by our improved gross margin.  
The adjusted operating margin performance was better than the outlook we provided in August of a 200 to 250 basis point decline. This was primarily driven by improved gross margin in our international markets and a change in the timing of about $12 million of planned SG&A expense, which benefited the second quarter and will shift into the third quarter. Adjusted net income for the second quarter was $158 million or $1.90 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and other related charges.
On a reported basis, net income in the second quarter was $45 million or $0.55 per diluted share. 
The effective tax rate was 29% in the second quarter on an adjusted basis, similar to the effective tax rate of 29% in the prior year period.
Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues decreased 10% to $831 million on both a reported and constant currency basis in the second quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in North America as shipments were strategically reduced as a part of the Way Forward Plan. This was partially offset by wholesale revenue growth in Europe. 
Adjusted wholesale operating margin in the second quarter was 26.4%, excluding restructuring and other related charges. This was 40 basis points below prior year.
Retail segment sales decreased 5% to $942 million on a reported basis and were down 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by a comparable store sales decline. Consolidated comparable store sales decreased 9% in constant currency and 8% as reported, primarily due to challenging traffic and average dollar transaction trends.
Similarly, global e-commerce revenues declined 7% during the quarter on a reported basis and 6% in constant currency, driven by our price commoditization  [ph] initiatives. 
Retail operating margin in the second quarter, excluding restructuring and other related charges, was 11.8%, which was 100 basis points below the prior year period. 
Licensing revenues increased 2% on a reported basis and were flat in constant currency. Licensing segment operating income increased 5% in the second quarter compared with the prior year period.
Turning to distribution. At the end of the second quarter, we had 485 directly operated stand-alone stores and 620 concessions globally. Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the company had 5 net new directly operated stores and 44 net new concession shops at the end of the second quarter. In addition, our international licensing partners operated 102 Ralph Lauren stores and 20 dedicated shops as well as 59 Club Monaco store and 77 Club Monaco concession shops at the end of the second quarter.
We continue to close underperforming doors that we identified as a part of the Way Forward Plan. In the second quarter, we closed 7 stand-alone stores, bringing the total for the first half to 15 store closures as a part of our restructuring activity. These stores were geographically dispersed and primarily in our full-price concept. 
For the full year, we still expect to close approximately 50 stores. More of the closures are now slated for the fourth quarter after the holiday period. We continue to take a pragmatic approach to closures, balancing closure timing with realizing peak holiday season sales volume and minimizing door closure costs. Additionally, we continue to rightsize our cost structure and expect to make continued progress as we close out our fiscal year.
Now let me provide you with an update on our restructuring activities related to the Way Forward Plan. The company continues to expect restructuring activities to result in approximately $180 million to $220 million of annualized expense savings related to its initiatives to streamline the organization structure and rightsize the cost structure and our efforts to optimize the real estate portfolio. We continue to expect restructuring charges of about $400 million as a result of our Way Forward Plan and about $150 million in inventory charges related to our restructuring activities. These charges are expected to be substantially realized by the end of fiscal 2017.  In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company recorded $150 million in restructuring-related impairment and inventory charges. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory was $1.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, down 15% or $200 million compared to the end of the prior year period. The reduction was attributable to both [ph] restructuring actions and about 40% due to our operating process initiatives to reduce inventory, including a proactive pullback in receipts and our early efforts to move towards a demand-driven supply chain.  Our progress in the second quarter increases our confidence that inventory will continue to show double-digit declines for the remainder of the year and inventory quality will continue to improve. 
Moving on to capital expenditures. We spent $87 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $134 million in the prior year period, mostly to support our retail store network and infrastructure projects. 
During the second quarter, approximately 80,000 shares of Class A common stocks were retired as a part of the $100 million accelerated share repurchase program the company initiated in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  There were no new share repurchases in the second quarter. At the end of the second quarter, $200 million remained available for future share repurchases. 
We ended the second quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $692 million of total debt. 
I'd like to now turn to guidance for fiscal 2017.  As a reminder, this guidance excludes the restructuring and other related charges in connection with the company's Way Forward Plan. For fiscal 2017, we are maintaining our guidance. We continue to expect consolidated net revenue to decrease at a low double-digit rate as we execute our Way Forward Plan. Key elements include a proactive pullback in inventory receipts, store closures, pricing harmonization and quality of sale initiatives. Based on the current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2017. 
The company continues to expect operating margin for fiscal 2017 to be approximately 10% as cost savings are expected to be offset by growth in new store expenses, unfavorable foreign currency impacts in gross margin and SG&A, infrastructure investments and fixed expense deleverage.  Fiscal 2017 tax rate is expected to be approximately 29%. 
For the third quarter, the company expects consolidated net revenues to be down low double digits to down low teens on a reported basis. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to have a minimal impact on revenue growth but should pressure gross margin by at least 120 basis points.
Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be approximately 200 to 225 basis points below the comparable year prior period. Key pressure points are FX pressures to gross margin and the shift in timing of about $12 million of planned operating expenses from the second to the third quarter. 
In addition, savings initiatives from the Way Forward Plan will be more fully realized in the fourth quarter as more store closures are slated for after the holiday period. The third quarter tax rate is estimated at 29%. 
In closing, we are pleased with the progress we are making on our Way Forward Plan. We have the key elements in place to ensure continued progress. We have strong and collaborative relationships with our wholesale partners, a strong brand, a strong balance sheet and a motivated and committed team of over 25,000 Ralph Lauren employees around the globe. 
With that, I'd like to open up the call for your question."

Probably means we expect to see some of the year-over-year impact of those closures more focused in the first half of 2018, if that's safe to assume. Can you help us fine tune the guidance or revenues that we're going to be stabilizing in fiscal '18 based on that change and how do you think about magnitude? And then just on the gross margin for our models in the third quarter. Can the gross margin in the third quarter actually be positive year-over-year if we include that 120 basis point drag from currency that you mentioned, Jane?"

So Michael, as you look at it, we have looked at the store closures. As I said, we're going to be very pragmatic about capturing holiday season sales and negotiating the best deals possible with our landlords. Obviously, if we close at the end of the year, there will be a spillover effect on growth into FY '18 from store closures. But remember, those stores are smallest and least productive doors. So while that will be a factor and will play that into our initiative, overall, our guidance for FY '18 that we will see stabilization is still intact. As we did with the North America comeback plan, we are working through a team on an initiative-by-initiative basis and we'll come back to you in the fourth quarter, as is our practice, and give you much more specific guidance on that. And then if you look at the third quarter overall in terms of gross margin, here's what I see in terms of headwinds and tailwinds. The tailwinds that we saw in the second quarter of the benefit of products and channel mix and the benefit of markdown rates. Notably, in our international markets, those are going to be intact as we see -- as we move into quarters 3 and 4. The headwind, as you saw in Q2, will be FX. And it will increase. We are at 80 basis points in Q2. It's going to go up to about 120 basis points in Q3. But I still remain optimistic about our ability to move through, on a conservative basis, to hold or even grow gross margin."

Since we last spoke on our earnings call in August, the team and I have continued our intense focus on driving the execution of our Way Forward Plan. The Way Forward Plan, as a reminder, is our multiyear strategy to build on the unique brand strengths we have, go back to the core of what made Ralph Lauren iconic, evolve from that core and build the business back to sustainable, profitable growth. We are 2 quarters into executing on the plan, and my focus is leading our teams to ensure that every action we take today drives towards our long-term Way Forward goals while, at the same time, optimizing near-term performance. 
Today, I will share my key learnings from the second quarter and then provide an update on our progress in driving the execution of our Way Forward Plan. Then I'm excited about having Jane here with me and will turn it over to her to review the details of the company's quarterly financial performance and our outlook for fiscal 2017. 
In the second quarter, we continue to deliver against our expectations. Our performance keeps us on track to achieve our full year fiscal 2017 guidance with some changes in the quarterly flow. In the second quarter, revenue of $1.8 billion was consistent with our plan, while operating margin was ahead of our target, driven by higher gross margins in our international markets, quality of sales initiatives starting to get traction and planned SG&A expenses shifting into the third quarter. Jane will take you through these in detail. 
Our revenue in the quarter declined in line with our plan, down 8% versus prior year, with continued and expected larger decline in wholesale than retail. Consistent with our Way Forward Plan, we continue to drive the quality of our sales up by moderating discount rates, tightening inventory buys and closing another 7 underperforming stores in the quarter. These initiatives successfully reduced inventories, which were down 15% to last year at the end of the quarter. 
North America continues to be our most challenged market where revenue declined 12% in the quarter. As I shared on our last call, assessing our North American challenge, which to a large extent is self-induced, and building and executing a plan to get back to winning in North America is one of our biggest priorities. 
In our international markets, revenue increased 2% in the second quarter. Our teams there continue to drive up quality of sales, rightsize the inventory and optimize the store fleets to build the foundation for profitable growth.
In Asia, we continue to see encouraging results of our proactive quality of sales actions. Over the last 9 months, our team has now closed a total of 72 points of distribution that weakened the brand and opened 159 new high-quality points of sale. The new points of distribution have better locations, improved adjacencies and refreshed store environments relative to the locations we closed. 
In addition, we continue to reduce the length of the sale periods and significantly decrease the depth of markdown rates. We continue to see the positive impact of our initiatives on profitability. Over the past 9 months, our average unit retail prices are up 10% in constant currency, and our gross profit margin continues to expand.
In Europe, growth remained solid in the second quarter, and our team is centered on tighter inventory management, strengthening the assortment and resulting in improved margins. 
Now let me give you a few important updates on our progress on the execution of the Way Forward Plan. As we are still early in the execution of the plan, there will often be a lag time between when we take a Way Forward action and when it shows up in the P&L. However, I do see early indicators of success, and I would use these calls to give you updates on the progress points of our execution. 
The Way Forward Plan is built on 2 key parts. The first is consumer-facing, where we're going to focus on and evolve from the core in product, marketing and the shopping experience. The second part is about evolving the operating model, where we are developing 4 business engines: a systematic repeatable way of building a stronger assortment, a demand-driven supply chain, a best-in-class sourcing capability and a multichannel global expansion strategy. Underlying both of these 2 parts is the foundation of strengthening the leadership team and culture as well as developing a strong economic model.
With the addition of Jane Nielsen from Coach and Bill Campbell from Amazon last quarter, we are now very close to having our full operations team in place. The only outstanding role to fill is the Global Chief Marketing Officer, and we are underway with that search.
Delivering on our objective to increase our focus and resources on our core brands, we recently announced our decision to discontinue the Denim & Supply brand. We will address the denim market more effectively through our Polo brand by leveraging the brand strengths of Polo. 
Moving on to the work of evolving the assortment and product. I'm excited about the work that Valerie and her team are driving in cutting the product tail, refocusing our core product offering and evolving from that core. In the second quarter, we continue to make good progress in identifying and cutting the long tail of unproductive styles, leading to a big reduction in the number of SKUs.
For Fall 2016, we achieved a 10% reduction in SKUs across our apparel brands. And for spring 2017, we are on track to achieve over a 20% reduction. And for Fall 2017, we're on the way to further SKU reductions.
The style and SKU reduction frees up time, resources and creativity to focus on and evolve our core icons, leading to a more productive and desirable assortment. Our improved discipline in assortment creation enables us to buy closer to market and reduce early commitments. We continue to expect to be halfway to our goal of a 9-month lead time by the end of this fiscal year and 90% there by the end of next fiscal year. 
The key unlock for our shorter lead times is the fabric platforming for our core styles. We made significant progress in this area during the quarter. Almost all of our core fabrics will be platformed by the end of this month. This enables us to increase the quality of our fabric, secure better prices and decrease our lead times and increase our flexibility to react to selling-in season. We can now, for the first time, work in partnership with our big customers and move from buying blind before their buys to buying our inventory based on their buys and therefore significantly improve matching our inventory to the real demand.
In the second quarter, we continue to drive down inventory levels across the company to get closer to matching inventory with demand. In addition to our inventory restructuring actions, I'm pleased with our meaningful progress to reduce inventory buys. Although we are still in the early stages of this journey, optimizing our buys should improve sell-throughs and gross margin rate.
Now I want to share our plan to come back to high performance in North America. North America is our largest market and one where it's essential for us to return to profitable growth. The plan is based on leveraging our unique brand strength, solid market position and strong relationships with our wholesale partners. 
As we mentioned on our last call, Jeff Kuster joined in July as our new Group President for the Americas. Together with his team, Jeff has worked through a detailed, fact-based assessment of our North American challenges. From that assessment, we have built a plan that will take us back to strength. 
And strength in North America starts with our U.S. wholesale business. The challenges we face there are similar to our overall challenges as a company that we shared during our Investor Day in June. We have been buying too much inventory, letting that overflow to value channels, buying too much in the product tail, buying too early before the customers have bought, not created room to chase in season and distributed too much in the low-volume shops and promoted too deep and too frequently.
To start building strength back, we will work even more closely with our biggest wholesale customers, partnering together with them to build strength that will make us both drive high performance. Together, we will, first, reduce our overall buys to better match demand. This will reduce the overflow of inventory going to value channels. Second, cut the product tail and refocus investments in the evolved core. This will improve inventory productivity. Third, we will cut supplier lead times. This will allow our customers to buy much closer in and improve the flexibility to chase in season. Fourth, we will refocus our marketing efforts in line with our Way Forward Plan to develop cut-through marketing campaigns for our main brands. This will be targeted to drive traffic and conversion. Our first initiatives will start with Polo in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Fifth and finally, working in collaboration with our partners, we will reduce and close the tail of our distribution, which accounts for 20% to 25% of the total distribution points. 
These shops represent a very small share of sales and profit for us as well as our partners. Just as with assortment, we will refocus on and evolve from the core, which means the top-selling doors, and invest in refreshing and rebuilding the store experience. This will create an exciting shopping experience and supercharge the evolved assortment strategy. 
It's worth mentioning again that we believe in the strong wholesale channel and in the well-executed department store. We believe a well-curated department store offers a convenient and exciting shopping experience that saves the consumer time while also bringing them into the brand. Our distribution plan will follow the consumer. And department stores, off- and online, represent one of the largest channels the full-price consumer shops today and in the near future.
Parallel to strengthening our wholesale efforts, we're also strengthening our e-commerce presence. But even though department stores represent one of the biggest channels for our consumers, the e-commerce channel has the highest growth rate and is increasingly important. Our assessment of our e-commerce challenges and our plan to strengthen e-commerce are also very much in line with our overall Way Forward Plan assessment and plan. We are reducing the overall buys. We are reducing the promotions. We are reducing the product tail. We are refocusing on and evolving our core products and will start to present them in an evolved and refreshed way. 
We have taken the first steps here. And you can now see our refreshed landing pages on both our mobile as well as our desktop site. We recently launched our redesigned mobile site, which features significant improvements in functionality. We improved the checkout process, navigation and creative execution, and many more steps to follow on that. 
Finally, a few words on marketing. In September, we held our first-ever see-now-buy-now runway show for the women's collection. The show was held in a glass structure on the sidewalk outside of our Madison Avenue flagship. We even managed to close down Madison Avenue for a few hours. It was a big success and generated more than twice the global media value compared to the previous season's show.
We also recently launched the Ralph Lauren Icons campaign in our women's luxury business. It's built on our Way Forward goal to refocus on and evolve from core iconic products to make them even more desirable to today's consumer. The response so far has been very positive. 
In conclusion, we are making good progress against our Way Forward Plan. While most of it is still to be done, I'm excited with what I see. During the last 3 months, while we have been getting ready to execute the holiday season, I've been traveling extensively and spent much time with our teams and our biggest customers. From my perspective, whether I'm in Little Rock, Arkansas with our friends at Dillard's or seeing our newly renovated flagship store come to life on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills or visiting our new Polo store on Regent Street in London, I feel the excitement from our teams and partners that we are starting to move towards unlocking the true potential of this great brand that Ralph started almost 50 years ago. 
So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Jane."

It's great to be with all of you and to be a part of the Ralph Lauren team. I'm excited about executing our Way Forward Plan and sharing our progress with you.

I'm excited about executing our Way Forward Plan and sharing our progress with you. 
Second quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion were down 8% to last year on both a reported and constant currency basis. This reflects our quality of sales initiatives starting to take hold and is in line with the guidance we provided in August of mid- to high single-digit revenue decline. Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on revenue growth in the second quarter. 
On an adjusted basis, gross margin was 56.9% in the second quarter, excluding noncash inventory-related charges of $81 million associated with our restructuring activities. This was 40 basis points above prior year, primarily driven by favorable geographic and channel mix shifts, improved product costing and initiatives to improve quality of sales primarily to reduce promotional activity in our international businesses. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects of approximately 80 basis points. 
Operating expenses on an adjusted basis were $809 million, excluding $69 million in restructuring and other related charges. These expenses were down 4% compared to last year primarily as a result of expense initiatives under the Way Forward Plan, including headcount reductions and 7 store closures.
Store closures in the second quarter were lower than expectations. We delayed closures to take advantage of the peak holiday shopping period and to minimize store closure costs through negotiations with our landlords. 
Adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 12.4%, excluding $150 million in restructuring and other related charges. This was 110 basis points below last year due to fixed cost expense deleverage on lower net revenues, which was partially offset by our improved gross margin. 
The adjusted operating margin performance was better than the outlook we provided in August of a 200 to 250 basis point decline. This was primarily driven by improved gross margin in our international markets and a change in the timing of about $12 million of planned SG&A expense, which benefited the second quarter and will shift into the third quarter. Adjusted net income for the second quarter was $158 million or $1.90 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and other related charges.
On a reported basis, net income in the second quarter was $45 million or $0.55 per diluted share. 
The effective tax rate was 29% in the second quarter on an adjusted basis, similar to the effective tax rate of 29% in the prior year period.
Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues decreased 10% to $831 million on both a reported and constant currency basis in the second quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in North America as shipments were strategically reduced as a part of the Way Forward Plan. This was partially offset by wholesale revenue growth in Europe. 
Adjusted wholesale operating margin in the second quarter was 26.4%, excluding restructuring and other related charges. This was 40 basis points below prior year.
Retail segment sales decreased 5% to $942 million on a reported basis and were down 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by a comparable store sales decline. Consolidated comparable store sales decreased 9% in constant currency and 8% as reported, primarily due to challenging traffic and average dollar transaction trends.
Similarly, global e-commerce revenues declined 7% during the quarter on a reported basis and 6% in constant currency, driven by our price harmonization initiatives. 
Retail operating margin in the second quarter, excluding restructuring and other related charges, was 11.8%, which was 100 basis points below the prior year period. 
Licensing revenues increased 2% on a reported basis and were flat in constant currency. Licensing segment operating income increased 5% in the second quarter compared with the prior year period.
Turning to distribution. At the end of the second quarter, we had 485 directly operated stand-alone stores and 620 concessions globally. Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the company had 5 net new directly operated stores and 44 net new concession shops at the end of the second quarter. In addition, our international licensing partners operated 102 Ralph Lauren stores and 20 dedicated shops as well as 59 Club Monaco store and 77 Club Monaco concession shops at the end of the second quarter.
We continue to close underperforming doors that we identified as a part of the Way Forward Plan. In the second quarter, we closed 7 stand-alone stores, bringing the total for the first half to 15 store closures as a part of our restructuring activity. These stores were geographically dispersed and primarily in our full-price concept. 
For the full year, we still expect to close approximately 50 stores. More of the closures are now slated for the fourth quarter after the holiday period. We continue to take a pragmatic approach to closures, balancing closure timing with realizing peak holiday season sales volume and minimizing door closure costs. Additionally, we continue to rightsize our cost structure and expect to make continued progress as we close out our fiscal year.
Now let me provide you with an update on our restructuring activities related to the Way Forward Plan. The company continues to expect restructuring activities to result in approximately $180 million to $220 million of annualized expense savings related to its initiatives to streamline the organization structure and rightsize the cost structure and our efforts to optimize the real estate portfolio. We continue to expect restructuring charges of about $400 million as a result of our Way Forward Plan and about $150 million in inventory charges related to our restructuring activities. These charges are expected to be substantially realized by the end of fiscal 2017. In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company recorded $150 million in restructuring-related impairment and inventory charges. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory was $1.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, down 15% or $200 million compared to the end of the prior year period. The reduction was attributable to both restructuring actions and about 40% due to our operating process initiatives to reduce inventory, including a proactive pullback in receipts and our early efforts to move towards a demand-driven supply chain. Our progress in the second quarter increases our confidence that inventory will continue to show double-digit declines for the remainder of the year and inventory quality will continue to improve. 
Moving on to capital expenditures. We spent $87 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $134 million in the prior year period, mostly to support our retail store network and infrastructure projects. 
During the second quarter, approximately 80,000 shares of Class A common stocks were retired as a part of the $100 million accelerated share repurchase program the company initiated in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. There were no new share repurchases in the second quarter. At the end of the second quarter, $200 million remained available for future share repurchases. 
We ended the second quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $692 million of total debt. 
I'd like to now turn to guidance for fiscal 2017. As a reminder, this guidance excludes the restructuring and other related charges in connection with the company's Way Forward Plan. For fiscal 2017, we are maintaining our guidance. We continue to expect consolidated net revenue to decrease at a low double-digit rate as we execute our Way Forward Plan. Key elements include a proactive pullback in inventory receipts, store closures, pricing harmonization and quality of sale initiatives. Based on the current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2017. 
The company continues to expect operating margin for fiscal 2017 to be approximately 10% as cost savings are expected to be offset by growth in new store expenses, unfavorable foreign currency impacts in gross margin and SG&A, infrastructure investments and fixed expense deleverage. Fiscal 2017 tax rate is expected to be approximately 29%. 
For the third quarter, the company expects consolidated net revenues to be down low double digits to down low teens on a reported basis. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to have a minimal impact on revenue growth but should pressure gross margin by at least 120 basis points.
Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be approximately 200 to 225 basis points below the comparable year prior period. Key pressure points are FX pressures to gross margin and the shift in timing of about $12 million of planned operating expenses from the second to the third quarter. 
In addition, savings initiatives from the Way Forward Plan will be more fully realized in the fourth quarter as more store closures are slated for after the holiday period. The third quarter tax rate is estimated at 29%. 
In closing, we are pleased with the progress we are making on our Way Forward Plan. We have the key elements in place to ensure continued progress. We have strong and collaborative relationships with our wholesale partners, a strong brand, a strong balance sheet and a motivated and committed team of over 25,000 Ralph Lauren employees around the globe. 
With that, I'd like to open up the call for your question."

But with some of the store closures pushing into fourth quarter, I think it's important to kind of think about the change in the cadence in terms of what that means looking out past your fiscal '17. It probably means we expect to see some of the year-over-year impact of those closures more focused in the first half of 2018, if that's safe to assume. Can you help us fine-tune the guidance for revenues that we're going to be stabilizing in fiscal '18 based on that change and how we could think about magnitude? And then just on the gross margin for our models in the third quarter, can the gross margin in the third quarter actually be positive year-over-year if we include that 120 basis point drag from currency that you mentioned, Jane?"

So Michael, as you look at it, we have looked at those store closures. As I said, we're going to be very pragmatic about capturing holiday season sales and negotiating the best deals possible with our landlords. Obviously, if we close at the end of the year, there will be a spillover effect on growth into FY '18 from store closures. But remember, those stores are our smallest and least productive doors. So while that will be a factor and we'll play that into our initiatives, overall, our guidance for FY '18 that we will see stabilization is still intact. As we did with the North America comeback plan, we are working through '18 on an initiative-by-initiative basis, and we'll come back to you in the fourth quarter, as is our practice, and give you much more specific guidance on that. And then if you look at the third quarter overall in terms of gross margin, here's what I see in terms of headwinds and tailwinds. The tailwinds that we saw in the second quarter of the benefit of products and channel mix and the benefit of markdown rates, notably, in our international markets, those are going to be intact as we see -- as we move into quarters 3 and 4. The headwind, as you saw in Q2, will be FX, and it will increase. We are at 80 basis points in Q2. It's going to go up to about 120 basis points in Q3. But I still remain optimistic about our ability to move through, on a conservative basis, to hold or even grow gross margin."

So we increase quality, we increase our ability to negotiate a better cost price for that fabric, and we increase our flexibility and can shorten our lead times dramatically.

Since we last spoke on our earnings call in August, the team and I have continued our intense focus on driving the execution of our Way Forward Plan. The Way Forward Plan, as a reminder, is our multiyear strategy to build on the unique brand strengths we have, go back to the core of what made Ralph Lauren iconic, evolve from that core and build the business back to sustainable, profitable growth. We are 2 quarters into executing on the plan, and my focus is leading our teams to ensure that every action we take today drives towards our long-term Way Forward goals, while at the same time optimizing near-term performance. 
Today, I will share my key learnings from the second quarter and then provide an update on our progress in driving the execution of our Way Forward Plan. Then I'm excited about having Jane here with me and will turn it over to her to review the details of the company's quarterly financial performance and our outlook for fiscal 2017. 
In the second quarter, we continued to deliver against our expectations. Our performance keeps us on track to achieve our full year fiscal 2017 guidance, with some changes in the quarterly flow. In the second quarter, revenue of $1.8 billion was consistent with our plan, while operating margin was ahead of our target, driven by higher gross margins in our international markets, quality of sales initiatives starting to get traction and planned SG&A expenses shifting into the third quarter. Jane will take you through these in detail. 
Our revenue in the quarter declined in line with our plan, down 8% versus prior year, with continued and expected larger decline in wholesale than retail. Consistent with our Way Forward Plan, we continue to drive the quality of our sales up by moderating discount rates, tightening inventory buys and closing another 7 underperforming stores in the quarter. These initiatives successfully reduced inventories, which were down 15% to last year at the end of the quarter. 
North America continues to be our most challenged market, where revenue declined 12% in the quarter. As I shared on our last call, assessing our North American challenge, which to a large extent is self-induced, and building and executing a plan to get back to winning in North America, is one of our biggest priorities. 
In our international markets, revenue increased 2% in the second quarter. Our teams there continue to drive up quality of sales, rightsize the inventory and optimize the store fleets to build the foundation for profitable growth.
In Asia, we continue to see encouraging results of our proactive quality of sales actions. Over the last 9 months, our team has now closed a total of 72 points of distribution that weakened the brand and opened 159 new high-quality points of sale. The new points of distribution have better locations, improved adjacencies and refreshed store environments relative to the locations we closed. 
In addition, we continue to reduce the length of the sale periods and significantly decrease the depth of markdown rates. We continue to see the positive impact of our initiatives on profitability. Over the past 9 months, our average unit retail prices are up 10% in constant currency, and our gross profit margin continues to expand.
In Europe, growth remained solid in the second quarter, and our team is centered on tighter inventory management, strengthening the assortment and resulting in improved margins. 
Now let me give you a few important updates on our progress on the execution of the Way Forward Plan. As we are still early in the execution of the plan, there will often be a lag time between when we take a Way Forward action and when it shows up in the P&L. However, I do see early indicators of success, and I will use these calls to give you updates on the progress points of our execution. 
The Way Forward Plan is built on 2 key parts. The first is consumer-facing, where we're going to focus on and evolve from the core in product, marketing and the shopping experience. The second part is about evolving the operating model, where we are developing 4 business engines: a systematic repeatable way of building a stronger assortment, a demand-driven supply chain, a best-in-class sourcing capability and a multichannel global expansion strategy. Underlying both of these 2 parts is the foundation of strengthening the leadership team and culture as well as developing a strong economic model.
With the addition of Jane Nielsen from Coach and Bill Campbell from Amazon last quarter, we are now very close to having our full operations team in place. The only outstanding role to fill is the Global Chief Marketing Officer, and we are underway with that search.
Delivering on our objective to increase our focus and resources on our core brands, we recently announced our decision to discontinue the Denim & Supply brand. We will address the denim market more effectively through our Polo brand by leveraging the brand strength of Polo. 
Moving on to the work of evolving the assortment and product. I'm excited about the work that Valerie and her team are driving in cutting the product tail, refocusing our core product offering and evolving from that core. In the second quarter, we continue to make good progress in identifying and cutting the long tail of unproductive styles, leading to a big reduction in the number of SKUs.
For Fall 2016, we achieved a 10% reduction in SKUs across our apparel brands. And for spring 2017, we are on track to achieve over a 20% reduction. And for Fall 2017, we're on the way to further SKU reductions.
The style and SKU reduction frees up time, resources and creativity to focus on and evolve our core icons, leading to a more productive and desirable assortment. Our improved discipline in assortment creation enables us to buy closer to market and reduce early commitments. We continue to expect to be halfway to our goal of a 9-month lead time by the end of this fiscal year and 90% there by the end of next fiscal year. 
The key unlock for our shorter lead times is the fabric platforming for our core styles. We made significant progress in this area during the quarter. Almost all of our core fabrics will be platformed by the end of this month. This enables us to increase the quality of our fabric, secure better prices and decrease our lead times and increase our flexibility to react to selling-in season. We can now, for the first time, work in partnership with our big customers and move from buying blind before their buys to buying our inventory based on their buys and therefore significantly improve matching our inventory to the real demand.
In the second quarter, we continue to drive down inventory levels across the company to get closer to matching inventory with demand. In addition to our inventory restructuring actions, I'm pleased with our meaningful progress to reduce inventory buys. Although we are still in the early stages of this journey, optimizing our buys should improve sell-throughs and gross margin rate.
Now I want to share our plan to come back to high performance in North America. North America is our largest market and one where it's essential for us to return to profitable growth. The plan is based on leveraging our unique brand strength, solid market position and strong relationships with our wholesale partners. 
As we mentioned on our last call, Jeff Kuster joined in July as our new Group President for the Americas. Together with his team, Jeff has worked through a detailed, fact-based assessment of our North American challenges. From that assessment, we have built a plan that will take us back to strength. 
And strength in North America starts with our U.S. wholesale business. The challenges we face there are similar to our overall challenges as a company that we shared during our Investor Day in June. We have been buying too much inventory, letting that overflow to value channels, buying too much in the product tail, buying too early before the customers have bought, not created room to chase in season and distributed too much in the low-volume shops and promoted too deep and too frequently.
To start building strength back, we will work even more closely with our biggest wholesale customers, partnering together with them to build strength that will make us both drive high performance. Together, we will, first, reduce our overall buys to better match demand. This will reduce the overflow of inventory going to value channels. Second, cut the product tail and refocus investments in the evolved core. This will improve inventory productivity. Third, we will cut supplier lead times. This will allow our customers to buy much closer in and improve the flexibility to chase in season. Fourth, we will refocus our marketing efforts in line with our Way Forward Plan to develop cut-through marketing campaigns for our main brands. This will be targeted to drive traffic and conversion. Our first initiatives will start with Polo in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Fifth and finally, working in collaboration with our partners, we will reduce and close the tail of our distribution, which accounts for 20% to 25% of the total distribution points. 
These shops represent a very small share of sales and profit for us as well as our partners. Just as with assortment, we will refocus on and evolve from the core, which means the top-selling doors, and invest in refreshing and rebuilding the store experience. This will create an exciting shopping experience and supercharge the evolved assortment strategy. 
It's worth mentioning again that we believe in a strong wholesale channel and a well-executed department store. We believe a well-curated department store offers a convenient and exciting shopping experience that saves the consumer time while also bringing them into the brand. Our distribution plan will follow the consumer. And department stores, off and online, represent one of the largest channels the full-price consumer shops today and in the near future.
Parallel to strengthening our wholesale efforts, we're also strengthening our e-commerce presence. But even though department stores represent one of the biggest channels for our consumers, the e-commerce channel has the highest growth rate and is increasingly important. Our assessment of our e-commerce challenges and our plan to strengthen e-commerce are also very much in line with our overall Way Forward assessment and plan. We are reducing the overall buys. We are reducing the promotions. We are reducing the product tail. We are refocusing on and evolving our core products and we'll start to present them in an evolved and refreshed way. 
We have taken the first steps here. And you can now see our refreshed landing pages on both our mobile as well as our desktop site. We recently launched our redesigned mobile site, which features significant improvements in functionality. We improved the checkout process, navigation and creative execution, and many more steps to follow on that. 
Finally, a few words on marketing. In September, we held our first-ever, see-now-buy-now runway show for the women's collection. The show was held in a glass structure on the sidewalk outside of our Madison Avenue flagship. We even managed to close down Madison Avenue for a few hours. It was a big success and generated more than twice the global media value compared to the previous season's show.
We also recently launched the Ralph Lauren Icons campaign in our women's luxury business. It's built on our Way Forward goal to refocus on and evolve from core iconic products to make them even more desirable to today's consumer. The response so far has been very positive. 
In conclusion, we are making good progress against our Way Forward Plan. While most of it is still to be done, I'm excited with what I see. During the last 3 months, while we have been getting ready to execute the holiday season, I've been traveling extensively and spent much time with our teams and our biggest customers. From my perspective, whether I'm in Little Rock, Arkansas with our friends at Dillard's or seeing our newly renovated flagship store come to life on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills or visiting our new Polo store on Regent Street in London, I feel the excitement from our teams and partners that we are starting to move towards unlocking the true potential of this great brand that Ralph started almost 50 years ago. 
So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Jane."

It's great to be with all of you and to be a part of the Ralph Lauren team. I'm excited about executing our Way Forward Plan and sharing our progress with you.

I'm excited about executing our Way Forward Plan and sharing our progress with you. 
Second quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion were down 8% to last year on both a reported and constant currency basis. This reflects our quality of sales initiatives starting to take hold and is in line with the guidance we provided in August of mid- to high single-digit revenue decline. Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on revenue growth in the second quarter. 
On an adjusted basis, gross margin was 56.9% in the second quarter, excluding noncash inventory-related charges of $81 million associated with our restructuring activities. This was 40 basis points above prior year, primarily driven by favorable geographic and channel mix shifts, improved product costing and initiatives to improve quality of sales, primarily to reduce promotional activity in our international businesses. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects of approximately 80 basis points. 
Operating expenses on an adjusted basis were $809 million, excluding $69 million in restructuring and other related charges. These expenses were down 4% compared to last year, primarily as a result of expense initiatives under the Way Forward Plan, including headcount reductions and 7 store closures.
Store closures in the second quarter were lower than expectations. We delayed closures to take advantage of the peak holiday shopping period and to minimize store closure costs through negotiations with our landlords. 
Adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 12.4%, excluding $150 million in restructuring and other related charges. This was 110 basis points below last year due to fixed cost expense deleverage on lower net revenues, which was partially offset by our improved gross margin. 
The adjusted operating margin performance was better than the outlook we provided in August of a 200 to 250 basis point decline. This was primarily driven by improved gross margin in our international markets and a change in the timing of about $12 million of planned SG&A expense, which benefited the second quarter and will shift into the third quarter. Adjusted net income for the second quarter was $158 million or $1.90 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and other related charges.
On a reported basis, net income in the second quarter was $45 million or $0.55 per diluted share. 
The effective tax rate was 29% in the second quarter on an adjusted basis, similar to the effective tax rate of 29% in the prior year period.
Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues decreased 10% to $831 million on both a reported and constant currency basis in the second quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in North America, as shipments were strategically reduced as a part of the Way Forward Plan. This was partially offset by wholesale revenue growth in Europe. 
Adjusted wholesale operating margin in the second quarter was 26.4%, excluding restructuring and other related charges. This was 40 basis points below prior year.
Retail segment sales decreased 5% to $942 million on a reported basis and were down 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by a comparable store sales decline. Consolidated comparable store sales decreased 9% in constant currency and 8% as reported, primarily due to challenging traffic and average dollar transaction trends.
Similarly, global e-commerce revenues declined 7% during the quarter on a reported basis and 6% in constant currency, driven by our price harmonization initiatives. 
Retail operating margin in the second quarter, excluding restructuring and other related charges, was 11.8%, which was 100 basis points below the prior year period. 
Licensing revenues increased 2% on a reported basis and were flat in constant currency. Licensing segment operating income increased 5% in the second quarter compared with the prior year period.
Turning to distribution. At the end of the second quarter, we had 485 directly operated stand-alone stores and 620 concessions globally. Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the company had 5 net new directly operated stores and 44 net new concession shops at the end of the second quarter. In addition, our international licensing partners operated 102 Ralph Lauren stores and 20 dedicated shops as well as 59 Club Monaco stores and 77 Club Monaco concession shops at the end of the second quarter.
We continue to close underperforming doors that we identified as a part of the Way Forward Plan. In the second quarter, we closed 7 stand-alone stores, bringing the total for the first half to 15 store closures as a part of our restructuring activity. These stores were geographically dispersed and primarily in our full-price concept. 
For the full year, we still expect to close approximately 50 stores. More of the closures are now slated for the fourth quarter after the holiday period. We continue to take a pragmatic approach to closures, balancing closure timing with realizing peak holiday season sales volume and minimizing door closure costs. Additionally, we continue to rightsize our cost structure and expect to make continued progress as we close out our fiscal year.
Now let me provide you with an update on our restructuring activities related to the Way Forward Plan. The company continues to expect restructuring activities to result in approximately $180 million to $220 million of annualized expense savings related to its initiatives to streamline the organization structure and rightsize the cost structure and our efforts to optimize the real estate portfolio. We continue to expect restructuring charges of about $400 million as a result of our Way Forward Plan and about $150 million in inventory charges related to our restructuring activities. These charges are expected to be substantially realized by the end of fiscal 2017. In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company recorded $150 million in restructuring-related impairment and inventory charges. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory was $1.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, down 15% or $200 million compared to the end of the prior year period. The reduction was attributable to both restructuring actions and about 40% due to our operating process initiatives to reduce inventory, including a proactive pullback in receipts and our early efforts to move towards a demand-driven supply chain. Our progress in the second quarter increases our confidence that inventory will continue to show double-digit declines for the remainder of the year and inventory quality will continue to improve. 
Moving on to capital expenditures. We spent $87 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $134 million in the prior year period, mostly to support our retail store network and infrastructure projects. 
During the second quarter, approximately 80,000 shares of Class A common stock were retired as a part of the $100 million accelerated share repurchase program the company initiated in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. There were no new share repurchases in the second quarter. At the end of the second quarter, $200 million remained available for future share repurchases. 
We ended the second quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $692 million of total debt. 
I'd like to now turn to guidance for fiscal 2017. As a reminder, this guidance excludes the restructuring and other related charges in connection with the company's Way Forward Plan. For fiscal 2017, we are maintaining our guidance. We continue to expect consolidated net revenue to decrease at a low double-digit rate as we execute our Way Forward Plan. Key elements include a proactive pullback in inventory receipts, store closures, pricing harmonization and quality of sale initiatives. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2017. 
The company continues to expect operating margin for fiscal 2017 to be approximately 10%, as cost savings are expected to be offset by growth in new store expenses, unfavorable foreign currency impacts in gross margin and SG&A, infrastructure investments and fixed expense deleverage. Fiscal 2017 tax rate is expected to be approximately 29%. 
For the third quarter, the company expects consolidated net revenues to be down low double digits to down low teens on a reported basis. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to have a minimal impact on revenue growth but should pressure gross margin by at least 120 basis points.
Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be approximately 200 to 225 basis points below the comparable year prior period. Key pressure points are FX pressures to gross margin and the shift in timing of about $12 million in planned operating expenses from the second to the third quarter. 
In addition, savings initiatives from the Way Forward Plan will be more fully realized in the fourth quarter, as more store closures are slated for after the holiday period. The third quarter tax rate is estimated at 29%. 
In closing, we are pleased with the progress we are making on our Way Forward Plan. We have the key elements in place to ensure continued progress. We have strong and collaborative relationships with our wholesale partners, a strong brand, a strong balance sheet and a motivated and committed team of over 25,000 Ralph Lauren employees around the globe. 
With that, I'd like to open up the call for your questions."

But with some of the store closures pushing into fourth quarter, I think it's important to kind of think about the change in the cadence in terms of what that means looking out past your fiscal '17. It probably means we expect to see some of the year-over-year impact of those closures more focused in the first half of 2018, if that's safe to assume. Can you help us fine-tune the guidance for revenues that were going to be stabilizing in fiscal '18 based on that change, and how we could think about magnitude? And then just on the gross margin for our models in the third quarter, can the gross margin in the third quarter actually be positive year-over-year if we include that 120 basis point drag from currency that you mentioned, Jane?"

As I said, we're going to be very pragmatic about capturing holiday season sales and negotiating the best deals possible with our landlords. Obviously, if we close at the end of the year, there will be a spillover effect on growth into FY '18 from store closures. But remember, those stores are our smallest and least productive doors. So while that will be a factor and we'll play that into our initiatives, overall, our guidance for FY '18 that we will see stabilization, is still intact. As we did with the North America comeback plan, we are working through '18 on an initiative-by-initiative basis, and we'll come back to you in the fourth quarter, as is our practice, and give you much more specific guidance on that. And then as you look at the third quarter overall in terms of gross margin, here's what I see in terms of headwinds and tailwinds. The tailwinds that we saw in the second quarter of the benefit of product and channel mix and the benefit of markdown rates, notably in our international markets, those are going to be intact as we see -- as we move into quarters 3 and 4. The headwind, as you saw in Q2, will be FX, and it will increase. We were at 80 basis points in Q2, it's going to go up to about 120 basis points in Q3. But I still remain optimistic about our ability to move through, on a conservative basis, to hold or even grow gross margin."

So we increase quality, we increase our ability to negotiate a better cost price for that fabric, and we increase our flexibility and can shorten our lead times dramatically.

Since we last spoke on our earnings call in August, the team and I have continued our intense focus on driving the execution of our Way Forward Plan. The Way Forward Plan, as a reminder, is our multiyear strategy to build on the unique brand strengths we have, go back to the core of what made Ralph Lauren iconic, evolve from that core and build the business back to sustainable, profitable growth. We are 2 quarters into executing on the plan, and my focus is leading our teams to ensure that every action we take today drives towards our long-term Way Forward goals, while at the same time optimizing near-term performance. 
Today, I will share my key learnings from the second quarter and then provide an update on our progress in driving the execution of our Way Forward Plan. Then I'm excited about having Jane here with me and will turn it over to her to review the details of the company's quarterly financial performance and our outlook for fiscal 2017. 
In the second quarter, we continued to deliver against our expectations. Our performance keeps us on track to achieve our full year fiscal 2017 guidance, with some changes in the quarterly flow. In the second quarter, revenue of $1.8 billion was consistent with our plan, while operating margin was ahead of our target, driven by higher gross margins in our international markets, quality of sales initiatives starting to get traction and planned SG&A expenses shifting into the third quarter. Jane will take you through these in detail. 
Our revenue in the quarter declined in line with our plan, down 8% versus prior year, with continued and expected larger decline in wholesale than retail. Consistent with our Way Forward Plan, we continue to drive the quality of our sales up by moderating discount rates, tightening inventory buys and closing another 7 underperforming stores in the quarter. These initiatives successfully reduced inventories, which were down 15% to last year at the end of the quarter. 
North America continues to be our most challenged market, where revenue declined 12% in the quarter. As I shared on our last call, assessing our North American challenge, which to a large extent is self-induced, and building and executing a plan to get back to winning in North America, is one of our biggest priorities. 
In our international markets, revenue increased 2% in the second quarter. Our teams there continue to drive up quality of sales, rightsize the inventory and optimize the store fleets to build the foundation for profitable growth.
In Asia, we continue to see encouraging results of our proactive quality of sales actions. Over the last 9 months, our team has now closed a total of 72 points of distribution that weakened the brand and opened 159 new high-quality points of sale. The new points of distribution have better locations, improved adjacencies and refreshed store environments relative to the locations we closed. 
In addition, we continue to reduce the length of the sale periods and significantly decrease the depth of markdown rates. We continue to see the positive impact of our initiatives on profitability. Over the past 9 months, our average unit retail prices are up 10% in constant currency, and our gross profit margin continues to expand.
In Europe, growth remained solid in the second quarter, and our team is centered on tighter inventory management, strengthening the assortment and resulting in improved margins. 
Now let me give you a few important updates on our progress on the execution of the Way Forward Plan. As we are still early in the execution of the plan, there will often be a lag time between when we take a Way Forward action and when it shows up in the P&L. However, I do see early indicators of success, and I will use these calls to give you updates on the progress points of our execution. 
The Way Forward Plan is built on 2 key parts. The first is consumer-facing, where we're going to focus on and evolve from the core in product, marketing and the shopping experience. The second part is about evolving the operating model, where we are developing 4 business engines: a systematic repeatable way of building a stronger assortment, a demand-driven supply chain, a best-in-class sourcing capability and a multichannel global expansion strategy. Underlying both of these 2 parts is the foundation of strengthening the leadership team and culture as well as developing a strong economic model.
With the addition of Jane Nielsen from Coach and Bill Campbell from Amazon last quarter, we are now very close to having our full operations team in place. The only outstanding role to fill is the Global Chief Marketing Officer, and we are underway with that search.
Delivering on our objective to increase our focus and resources on our core brands, we recently announced our decision to discontinue the Denim & Supply brand. We will address the denim market more effectively through our Polo brand by leveraging the brand strength of Polo. 
Moving on to the work of evolving the assortment and product. I'm excited about the work that Valerie and her team are driving in cutting the product tail, refocusing our core product offering and evolving from that core. In the second quarter, we continue to make good progress in identifying and cutting the long tail of unproductive styles, leading to a big reduction in the number of SKUs.
For Fall 2016, we achieved a 10% reduction in SKUs across our apparel brands. And for spring 2017, we are on track to achieve over a 20% reduction. And for Fall 2017, we're on the way to further SKU reductions.
The style and SKU reduction frees up time, resources and creativity to focus on and evolve our core icons, leading to a more productive and desirable assortment. Our improved discipline in assortment creation enables us to buy closer to market and reduce early commitments. We continue to expect to be halfway to our goal of a 9-month lead time by the end of this fiscal year and 90% there by the end of next fiscal year. 
The key unlock for our shorter lead times is the fabric platforming for our core styles. We made significant progress in this area during the quarter. Almost all of our core fabrics will be platformed by the end of this month. This enables us to increase the quality of our fabric, secure better prices and decrease our lead times and increase our flexibility to react to selling-in season. We can now, for the first time, work in partnership with our big customers and move from buying blind before their buys to buying our inventory based on their buys and therefore significantly improve matching our inventory to the real demand.
In the second quarter, we continue to drive down inventory levels across the company to get closer to matching inventory with demand. In addition to our inventory restructuring actions, I'm pleased with our meaningful progress to reduce inventory buys. Although we are still in the early stages of this journey, optimizing our buys should improve sell-throughs and gross margin rate.
Now I want to share our plan to come back to high performance in North America. North America is our largest market and one where it's essential for us to return to profitable growth. The plan is based on leveraging our unique brand strength, solid market position and strong relationships with our wholesale partners. 
As we mentioned on our last call, Jeff Kuster joined in July as our new Group President for the Americas. Together with his team, Jeff has worked through a detailed, fact-based assessment of our North American challenges. From that assessment, we have built a plan that will take us back to strength. 
And strength in North America starts with our U.S. wholesale business. The challenges we face there are similar to our overall challenges as a company that we shared during our Investor Day in June. We have been buying too much inventory, letting that overflow to value channels, buying too much in the product tail, buying too early before the customers have bought, not created room to chase in season and distributed too much in the low-volume shops and promoted too deep and too frequently.
To start building strength back, we will work even more closely with our biggest wholesale customers, partnering together with them to build strength that will make us both drive high performance. Together, we will, first, reduce our overall buys to better match demand. This will reduce the overflow of inventory going to value channels. Second, cut the product tail and refocus investments in the evolved core. This will improve inventory productivity. Third, we will cut supplier lead times. This will allow our customers to buy much closer in and improve the flexibility to chase in season. Fourth, we will refocus our marketing efforts in line with our Way Forward Plan to develop cut-through marketing campaigns for our main brands. This will be targeted to drive traffic and conversion. Our first initiatives will start with Polo in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Fifth and finally, working in collaboration with our partners, we will reduce and close the tail of our distribution, which accounts for 20% to 25% of the total distribution points. 
These shops represent a very small share of sales and profit for us as well as our partners. Just as with assortment, we will refocus on and evolve from the core, which means the top-selling doors, and invest in refreshing and rebuilding the store experience. This will create an exciting shopping experience and supercharge the evolved assortment strategy. 
It's worth mentioning again that we believe in a strong wholesale channel and a well-executed department store. We believe a well-curated department store offers a convenient and exciting shopping experience that saves the consumer time while also bringing them into the brand. Our distribution plan will follow the consumer. And department stores, off and online, represent one of the largest channels the full-price consumer shops today and in the near future.
Parallel to strengthening our wholesale efforts, we're also strengthening our e-commerce presence. But even though department stores represent one of the biggest channels for our consumers, the e-commerce channel has the highest growth rate and is increasingly important. Our assessment of our e-commerce challenges and our plan to strengthen e-commerce are also very much in line with our overall Way Forward assessment and plan. We are reducing the overall buys. We are reducing the promotions. We are reducing the product tail. We are refocusing on and evolving our core products and we'll start to present them in an evolved and refreshed way. 
We have taken the first steps here. And you can now see our refreshed landing pages on both our mobile as well as our desktop site. We recently launched our redesigned mobile site, which features significant improvements in functionality. We improved the checkout process, navigation and creative execution, and many more steps to follow on that. 
Finally, a few words on marketing. In September, we held our first-ever, see-now-buy-now runway show for the women's collection. The show was held in a glass structure on the sidewalk outside of our Madison Avenue flagship. We even managed to close down Madison Avenue for a few hours. It was a big success and generated more than twice the global media value compared to the previous season's show.
We also recently launched the Ralph Lauren Icons campaign in our women's luxury business. It's built on our Way Forward goal to refocus on and evolve from core iconic products to make them even more desirable to today's consumer. The response so far has been very positive. 
In conclusion, we are making good progress against our Way Forward Plan. While most of it is still to be done, I'm excited with what I see. During the last 3 months, while we have been getting ready to execute the holiday season, I've been traveling extensively and spent much time with our teams and our biggest customers. From my perspective, whether I'm in Little Rock, Arkansas with our friends at Dillard's or seeing our newly renovated flagship store come to life on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills or visiting our new Polo store on Regent Street in London, I feel the excitement from our teams and partners that we are starting to move towards unlocking the true potential of this great brand that Ralph started almost 50 years ago. 
So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Jane."

I'm excited about executing our Way Forward Plan and sharing our progress with you. 
Second quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion were down 8% to last year on both a reported and constant currency basis. This reflects our quality of sales initiatives starting to take hold and is in line with the guidance we provided in August of mid- to high single-digit revenue decline. Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on revenue growth in the second quarter. 
On an adjusted basis, gross margin was 56.9% in the second quarter, excluding noncash inventory-related charges of $81 million associated with our restructuring activities. This was 40 basis points above prior year, primarily driven by favorable geographic and channel mix shifts, improved product costing and initiatives to improve quality of sales, primarily to reduce promotional activity in our international businesses. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects of approximately 80 basis points. 
Operating expenses on an adjusted basis were $809 million, excluding $69 million in restructuring and other related charges. These expenses were down 4% compared to last year, primarily as a result of expense initiatives under the Way Forward Plan, including headcount reductions and 7 store closures.
Store closures in the second quarter were lower than expectations. We delayed closures to take advantage of the peak holiday shopping period and to minimize store closure costs through negotiations with our landlords. 
Adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 12.4%, excluding $150 million in restructuring and other related charges. This was 110 basis points below last year due to fixed cost expense deleverage on lower net revenues, which was partially offset by our improved gross margin. 
The adjusted operating margin performance was better than the outlook we provided in August of a 200 to 250 basis point decline. This was primarily driven by improved gross margin in our international markets and a change in the timing of about $12 million of planned SG&A expense, which benefited the second quarter and will shift into the third quarter. Adjusted net income for the second quarter was $158 million or $1.90 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and other related charges.
On a reported basis, net income in the second quarter was $45 million or $0.55 per diluted share. 
The effective tax rate was 29% in the second quarter on an adjusted basis, similar to the effective tax rate of 29% in the prior year period.
Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues decreased 10% to $831 million on both a reported and constant currency basis in the second quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in North America, as shipments were strategically reduced as a part of the Way Forward Plan. This was partially offset by wholesale revenue growth in Europe. 
Adjusted wholesale operating margin in the second quarter was 26.4%, excluding restructuring and other related charges. This was 40 basis points below prior year.
Retail segment sales decreased 5% to $942 million on a reported basis and were down 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by a comparable store sales decline. Consolidated comparable store sales decreased 9% in constant currency and 8% as reported, primarily due to challenging traffic and average dollar transaction trends.
Similarly, global e-commerce revenues declined 7% during the quarter on a reported basis and 6% in constant currency, driven by our price harmonization initiatives. 
Retail operating margin in the second quarter, excluding restructuring and other related charges, was 11.8%, which was 100 basis points below the prior year period. 
Licensing revenues increased 2% on a reported basis and were flat in constant currency. Licensing segment operating income increased 5% in the second quarter compared with the prior year period.
Turning to distribution. At the end of the second quarter, we had 485 directly operated stand-alone stores and 620 concessions globally. Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the company had 5 net new directly operated stores and 44 net new concession shops at the end of the second quarter. In addition, our international licensing partners operated 102 Ralph Lauren stores and 20 dedicated shops as well as 59 Club Monaco stores and 77 Club Monaco concession shops at the end of the second quarter.
We continue to close underperforming doors that we identified as a part of the Way Forward Plan. In the second quarter, we closed 7 stand-alone stores, bringing the total for the first half to 15 store closures as a part of our restructuring activity. These stores were geographically dispersed and primarily in our full-price concept. 
For the full year, we still expect to close approximately 50 stores. More of the closures are now slated for the fourth quarter after the holiday period. We continue to take a pragmatic approach to closures, balancing closure timing with realizing peak holiday season sales volume and minimizing door closure costs. Additionally, we continue to rightsize our cost structure and expect to make continued progress as we close out our fiscal year.
Now let me provide you with an update on our restructuring activities related to the Way Forward Plan. The company continues to expect restructuring activities to result in approximately $180 million to $220 million of annualized expense savings related to its initiatives to streamline the organization structure and rightsize the cost structure and our efforts to optimize the real estate portfolio. We continue to expect restructuring charges of about $400 million as a result of our Way Forward Plan and about $150 million in inventory charges related to our restructuring activities. These charges are expected to be substantially realized by the end of fiscal 2017. In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company recorded $150 million in restructuring-related impairment and inventory charges. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory was $1.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, down 15% or $200 million compared to the end of the prior year period. The reduction was attributable to both restructuring actions and about 40% due to our operating process initiatives to reduce inventory, including a proactive pullback in receipts and our early efforts to move towards a demand-driven supply chain. Our progress in the second quarter increases our confidence that inventory will continue to show double-digit declines for the remainder of the year and inventory quality will continue to improve. 
Moving on to capital expenditures. We spent $87 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $134 million in the prior year period, mostly to support our retail store network and infrastructure projects. 
During the second quarter, approximately 80,000 shares of Class A common stock were retired as a part of the $100 million accelerated share repurchase program the company initiated in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. There were no new share repurchases in the second quarter. At the end of the second quarter, $200 million remained available for future share repurchases. 
We ended the second quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $692 million of total debt. 
I'd like to now turn to guidance for fiscal 2017. As a reminder, this guidance excludes the restructuring and other related charges in connection with the company's Way Forward Plan. For fiscal 2017, we are maintaining our guidance. We continue to expect consolidated net revenue to decrease at a low double-digit rate as we execute our Way Forward Plan. Key elements include a proactive pullback in inventory receipts, store closures, pricing harmonization and quality of sale initiatives. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2017. 
The company continues to expect operating margin for fiscal 2017 to be approximately 10%, as cost savings are expected to be offset by growth in new store expenses, unfavorable foreign currency impacts in gross margin and SG&A, infrastructure investments and fixed expense deleverage. Fiscal 2017 tax rate is expected to be approximately 29%. 
For the third quarter, the company expects consolidated net revenues to be down low double digits to down low teens on a reported basis. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to have a minimal impact on revenue growth but should pressure gross margin by at least 120 basis points.
Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be approximately 200 to 225 basis points below the comparable year prior period. Key pressure points are FX pressures to gross margin and the shift in timing of about $12 million in planned operating expenses from the second to the third quarter. 
In addition, savings initiatives from the Way Forward Plan will be more fully realized in the fourth quarter, as more store closures are slated for after the holiday period. The third quarter tax rate is estimated at 29%. 
In closing, we are pleased with the progress we are making on our Way Forward Plan. We have the key elements in place to ensure continued progress. We have strong and collaborative relationships with our wholesale partners, a strong brand, a strong balance sheet and a motivated and committed team of over 25,000 Ralph Lauren employees around the globe. 
With that, I'd like to open up the call for your questions."

But with some of the store closures pushing into fourth quarter, I think it's important to kind of think about the change in the cadence in terms of what that means looking out past your fiscal '17. It probably means we expect to see some of the year-over-year impact of those closures more focused in the first half of 2018, if that's safe to assume. Can you help us fine-tune the guidance for revenues that were going to be stabilizing in fiscal '18 based on that change, and how we could think about magnitude? And then just on the gross margin for our models in the third quarter, can the gross margin in the third quarter actually be positive year-over-year if we include that 120 basis point drag from currency that you mentioned, Jane?"

As I said, we're going to be very pragmatic about capturing holiday season sales and negotiating the best deals possible with our landlords. Obviously, if we close at the end of the year, there will be a spillover effect on growth into FY '18 from store closures. But remember, those stores are our smallest and least productive doors. So while that will be a factor and we'll play that into our initiatives, overall, our guidance for FY '18 that we will see stabilization, is still intact. As we did with the North America comeback plan, we are working through '18 on an initiative-by-initiative basis, and we'll come back to you in the fourth quarter, as is our practice, and give you much more specific guidance on that. And then as you look at the third quarter overall in terms of gross margin, here's what I see in terms of headwinds and tailwinds. The tailwinds that we saw in the second quarter of the benefit of product and channel mix and the benefit of markdown rates, notably in our international markets, those are going to be intact as we see -- as we move into quarters 3 and 4. The headwind, as you saw in Q2, will be FX, and it will increase. We were at 80 basis points in Q2, it's going to go up to about 120 basis points in Q3. But I still remain optimistic about our ability to move through, on a conservative basis, to hold or even grow gross margin."

So not a material amount of sales. And obviously, it's not a material amount of sales, and it's our least profitable points of distribution in the wholesale doors. And we've really taken time to look across the wholesale doors and look at points of distribution. Obviously, we have a portfolio of brand, look at points of distribution within the department store and go in surgically to eliminate the least profitable and lowest sales points of distribution, even within the door."

And one way of improving the quality of sales and improving the full-price channel's performance is to reduce the buys. So it's the #1 driver in the North American comeback, is to reduce our overall inventory buys to better match demand. And the way we reduce them is -- one is reducing them to demand and buying closer in as a way of reducing and being more accurate than having to buy less. So our idea is to buy less and sell more at the higher AUR."

So one very concrete progress that we have made there is to platform our fabrics. So when we platform and consolidate our fabric of our core products, we can get a number of benefits at the same time. We increase the quality, to start with, because quality -- we are going to compete with quality. So we increase quality, we increase our ability to negotiate a better cost price for that fabric, and we increase our flexibility and can shorten our lead times dramatically. So that's just one of a number of sourcing initiatives that we are driving that have -- will have a direct impact on the P&L over time."

Improved product costing was our second most favorable impact, followed by initiatives to reduce markdowns, especially in our international market. I do view this as a long-term tailwind for us.
