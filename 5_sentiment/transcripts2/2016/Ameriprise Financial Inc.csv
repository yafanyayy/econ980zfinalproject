4165019,321212808,922585,"Ameriprise Financial, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Executives","Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our earnings call. This morning, I'll provide my perspective on the business and Walter will discuss our financials.

This morning, I'll provide my perspective on the business and Walter will discuss our financials. 
Ameriprise, like the industry, was impacted by a more volatile market environment during the second half of 2015. Overall, our fourth quarter results were solid. We're executing our strategy and have work to continue to do in certain areas that I'll discuss. 
For the quarter, operating net revenues and operating earnings were largely flat, with operating EPS up 7% and for the full year, operating net revenues were up 1%, operating earnings grew 3% and operating EPS increased 9%. 
In terms of operating return on equity, Ameriprise continues to deliver a differentiated level. We generated a new record return at 24.3%, up 130 basis points, which is one of the best in the industry. 
Ameriprise continues to demonstrate strength in our ability to return capital to shareholders, returning another $569 million in the quarter. In fact, 2015 represented the fifth consecutive year we returned more than 100% of operating earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, while investing for growth and maintaining our capital strength and flexibility. 
Very clearly, our financial foundation remains in excellent shape. In total, assets under management and administration were $777 billion, a solid Ameriprise retail client flows were dampened by Asset Management outflows, market depreciation and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. 
Let's move to the business results in the quarter. In Advice & Wealth Management, we have strong business and I feel good about our ability to help advisers build productive practices. The strength of our advice value proposition is even more attractive in this environment. Ameriprise is well-positioned to help clients and prospects in every stage of their lives and to address the full spectrum of their needs across both market cycles and their lifetimes. We're helping advisers uptake the extension of our successful Confident Retirement approach that we launched last quarter for those who are still building their wealth. Wealth builders, as we call them, represent more than half of our target market, consumers are $500,000 to $5 million in investable assets, and they value our financial planning relationship, so this is a real opportunity for us going forward as we introduce it to our entire field force over the coming months. 
We continue to invest significantly on our brand of marketing programs that help our advisers spend more time with their clients and grow their practices. Our Be Brilliant advertising campaign tells our story by illustrating the everyday moments of brilliance that they can realize by working with the right adviser and the right firm. The campaign is doing well and outperforming competitive norms with all of our key audiences, consumers, clients and advisers. We're complementing our broadcast activity with digital channels like social media and online ads to expand the Ameriprise message in increasing engagement with our brand. Our advisers are taking advantage of Be Brilliant in their local communities and online to gain new clients and assets. Overall, client assets remain strong at $447 billion. We also had solid flows into fee-based investment advisory counts and cash positions increased to more than $23 billion. Clients are naturally taking a more consecutive position, which is a typical patent in this environment. 
With regard to our advisers, Ameriprise's value proposition and culture's attractive in the industry. It was another strong quarter for recruiting as more advisers are recognized in the strengthening Ameriprise's value proposition. 82 new experienced advisers moved their practices to Ameriprise. For the year, nearly 350 advisers are showing Ameriprise in both the franchise and the employee channels and so far, the pipeline for this year looks strong. Adviser practices are more productive because of the combination of excellent retention of our most productive advisers, very strong recruiting results and our investments in growth. Adviser productivity and metric that we consistently grow and increase 4% year-over-year to $514,000 on a 12-month basis. 
We're well-positioned in the marketplace and generating good profitability. In this environment, we are working closely with our advisers to handle the effects of market volatility with clients. As clients pull back, it's important to keep them focused and engaged on their goals. People need to plan for their future and that doesn't change based on market conditions. As we look ahead, the U.S. Department of Labor's pending fiduciary rule will add additional requirements that will have implications for our industry, as well as Ameriprise. We're hearing the deal well will be issuing the new regulation in the coming months. With that in mind, we're very much focused on putting together our plans and resources to effectively meet the DOL's requirements, but we need to understand what the final rule will be and how it will impact our clients. We have the resources, compliance infrastructure and capabilities to respond to the DOL's objectives, and we believe that our value proposition, satisfying client needs for the long-term, has been, and will continue to be, very appropriate. 
Let's move to Annuities and Protection. I'll focus more on the underlying business and Walter will cover the financials. In terms of Annuities, we continue to see solid sales on our variable annuities with and without living benefits in our channel, while we are in outflows that reflects our closed third-party book and we remain focused on serving our clients. Within fixed annuities, we continue to have a level of outflows, given the book is in run off as we have not been adding to it given the  current rate environment. Our focus remains in working with advisers to help clients understand the importance of guaranteed income in a well diversified plan. It's integrated within our Confident Retirement framework and I feel good about how we are managing the business, developing and enhancing our competitive products and features, while managing risk. Within Protection and Life & Health, we closed the year with a nice increase in sales, driven by UL products. And while life claims were higher than a year ago, we recognize there will be fluctuations quarter-to-quarter and these movements are within our planned ranges. We have a good book and we're working with our advisers to serve clients protection needs. The environment does create growth challenges for these longer-term products, but at the same time, it reinforces the importance of protecting what matters most to clients. In [indiscernible] home, we're disappointed with the financial results in the quarter. As you saw, we did increase reserves this quarter for higher claims experienced in some of the older business. New business is performing in line with our expectations. Walter will explain that in more detail. 
We continue to make a number of enhancements to improve the financial performance and risk characteristics of the business. We brought in significant resources and leadership to continue to enhance our pricing, underwriting and claims management. We feel that we're making the progress necessary, but we recognize will take time for the benefits to work through the book and be fully realized. Importantly, we continue to maintain our strong client satisfaction of FINRA relationships in Auto & Home. 
In Asset Management, we're generating solid financial results and executing our strategy, focused on gaining market share and profitable flows. With $472 billion in assets under management, we have been at scale business with a diversified base of assets and earnings and we're focused on serving more individual and institutional clients in key markets globally. For the quarter, operating earnings were $193 million, as revenues are largely flat and earnings were down a bit year-over-year from the timing of the few expense items and investments in the business, including supporting our new Columbia Threadneedle Investments brand in our key regions of the U.S., U.K., Europe and Asia. 
Investment performance remains quite strong. I'd highlight U.S. and European equities, asset allocation and tax exempt fixed income as particular strengths. Our investment teams in the U.S., one that in Singapore, are demonstrating the importance of active management, both in terms of capital appreciation, as well as preservation, given the volatility we're experiencing. 
On the product front, in Europe, we're seeing good sales in our U.K. and European equity products. Here in the U.S., we've had good traction with sales and large-cap equity products, as well as in our strategic income fund and within the solution space, our [indiscernible] strategy continues to gain interest. From an overall flows perspective, we had about $700 million of net outflows in the quarter with reinvested dividends. This did include a higher level of outflows at U.S. Trust. However, underlying flow trends are improving, and I'll take you through it. 
Let's start with institutional. Total outflows were driven by about $6 billion in net outflows of former parent assets, largely driven by outflows of low fee fixed income common trust funds and IMA's at U.S. Trust, given the changes they have made. We mentioned this last quarter and expect to continue IMA outflows of several billion dollars at U.S. Trust in the first half of 2016. In addition, we and others in the industry continue to experience outflows from a large client who redeem from strong performing strategies to address liquidity concerns. That was approximately $1.4 billion in the quarter and we expect at least $1 billion of additional outflow in the first quarter. These 2 components, low fee former parent assets and a single large client muted continued progress and third-party institutional flows. We have strong client and consultant relationships, a solid list of one not funded mandates and a good pipeline, which we expect will drive flows this year. 
Let's now move to retail. In the U.S., we're seeing positive trends from the work the team has done to focus our sales strategy. However, this was muted from a flows perspective, given continued outflows in the Acorn fund. The fund's short-term performance has improved from the changes we've made, including adding an experienced lead PM who came on board at year-end. We expect the outflows will continue in the near term as the team reestablishes the fund's longer-term track record. In addition, in the quarter, we made the decision to end the sub-advisory relationship [indiscernible] capital management, given the strength of our global investment capabilities. This resulted in a few hundred million of outflows in the fourth quarter. We plan to ask shareholders to support our plans to merge certain funds in 2016. In addition, we expect outflows of about $700 million in Moscow managed institutional SMAs in the first quarter. Based upon the previous servicing relationship with them, these outflows will have no financial impact. Overall, we've been able to grow gross sales and market share in the larger broker-dealer and independent channel in the past year, at a time when gross sales declined for the industry. This bodes well as industry sales may pick up down the line. We recognize we need to do more to increase both gross and net sales in U.S. retail, but I feel good about the business, the team in place and our strategy, we're seeing early results. 
With regard to European retail. We continue to build on our strong presence in the U.K. and serve more clients in key markets on the continent. At $1.4 billion in the quarter, European retail flows bounced back strongly from a tough third quarter. The market environment so far this year is clearly challenging, but we're focused on what we can control. We've generated strong performance for clients. We have a good product line and distribution. I feel good about the team in place, the moves we're making and the traction we're having in key initiatives in Asset Management. 
Overall, the company is performing well and our core businesses are strong. Ameriprise delivered solid earnings in a more difficult environment. Higher market volatility in the clients have clearly shaped the start of 2016. We've managed through difficult market cycles before and we're very much focused on executing our strategy, connecting with clients and advisers and driving results. Ameriprise has the ability and long-term perspective to continue to invest as we navigate the environment, capture opportunities and generate shareholder value. We have a strong track record of returning capital to shareholders and intend to continue to return to shareholders as we have, as well as maintain our excellent financial foundation. We're focused on keeping the company strong as we look for further growth opportunities. 
With that, I'd like to hand things over to Walter to review the numbers."

I'd like to build on what Jim shared with you as we review the financial results. 
As context, markets were volatile and in a downward trend in the second half of 2015, which impacted revenues for our growth businesses. However, the results we delivered in the quarter were strong. The one exception is Auto & Home business where we were disappointed with the results, which we will cover in more detail when I review the segments. 
We remained optimistic in repurchasing our stock in an elevated level in the quarter, given the pullback in the valuation and still believe our stock is undervalued. Our capacity to buy back stock remains strong, given our balance sheet fundamentals and the business mix generates strong free cash. We are committed to maintaining a differentiated level of capital return. 
Let's turn to Slide 4. Macro conditions impact revenue in a few ways. We had limited equity appreciation, which impacted asset under management. Volatility also suppress client activity and contributed to Asset Management outflows. Low-interest rates remained a headwind for our insurance and annuity businesses and foreign exchange translation impacted asset levels and earnings. These impacts were felt across all financial services companies and we're not unique in this regard. 
As you can see, total revenue growth was not at the level we have seen in the past. Volatile markets and lower interest rates, which decreased AUM and client activity, slowed. This muted the impact of [indiscernible], where we successfully built the Wealth Management business through increased RAP flows, growth in insurance and annuity sales and building cash [indiscernible] levels as clients wait for a less volatile environment to make investment decisions. 
Let's turn to Slide 5. Ameriprise delivered solid growth in EPS and return on equity, demonstrating the multiple leverage we have to manage the business from a variety of market environments. Specifically, we managed G&A expenses, investing for growth in targeted areas, but remaining disciplined. This, combined with solid tax planning and share repurchase, supported good 7% EPS growth. The operating effective tax rate was 20.1% in the quarter, which is lower than we had anticipated, driven by the level of dividends received deduction coming in higher than we expected. 
Turning to segment performance, starting with AWM on Slide 6. The Advice & Wealth Management business continues to perform well, delivering solid financial results. Operating net revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 1% from last year. Our revenue growth slowed due to the impact of market levels and volatility, and didn't experience the typical lift we have seen from markets. Wrapping outflows were quite good at $2.1 billion, despite a deterioration in the markets and flat client activity levels. Total expenses increased 2% year-over-year, driven by higher distribution expense. G&A expenses in the quarter were flat year-over-year and also flat for the full year 2015 versus full year 2014. On a sequential basis, we had a normal uptick in G&A related to elevated advertising spend and other timing-related items in the quarter. This resulted in earnings of $210 million and a strong margin of 16.6%. Margin for the full year was up to 17.1% from 16.5% in the prior year. Results were achieved of little benefit of increasing shortage [indiscernible]. We had a $23.5 billion of brokerage cash balances. We anticipate a more material benefit in the first quarter from this February hike, with the majority of the first 25 basis point increase flowing to the bottom line. 
Asset Management continues to provide a solid contribution to our revenue and earnings, as you'll see on Slide 7. Operating net revenue was essentially flat at $833 million, reflecting marginal growth in equity markets and the cumulative impact of net outflows, partially offset by stronger CLO benefits and the performance fees in the quarter. Expenses were up due to elevated performance fee compensation, as well as the timing of certain project related costs. We remain committed to delivering strong profitability by tightly managing expenses. Pretax operating earnings were $193 million, down 3% from last year. Again, this reflects the impact of markets and outflows, partially offset by elevated performance fees. 
Turning to Annuities on Slide 8. The segment is performing in line with our expectation. [indiscernible] annuity pretax earnings increased $6 million from a year ago to $129 million. We are maintaining good profitability in this book. Fixed annuity pretax earnings declined to $23 million due to elevated lapses as the block runs off as it comes out of the surrender charge period. Given the current interest rate environment, very limited new sales and as a result, this book is expected to gradually run off and earnings will trend down. 
Turning to the Protection segment on the next slide. Pretax operating earnings were $35 million during the quarter. 
Let's focus on Life & Health first. Pretax operating earnings benefited from $28 million from an assumption change related to our waiver reserve. Underlying earnings were pressured by elevated life and long-term care clients, which were at the higher end of our expectations, as well as continued low interest rates and the mix shift from VUL to RUL. 
Moving to Auto & Home. We were disappointed with the results in the quarter. We built reserves by $57 million, primarily in the order book from the 2014 and prior accident years. Driving this was elevated frequency and severity experience for auto injury claims, which is in line with the trends the industry has experienced. Additionally, we did not see the level of impact in improving the outcome of 2014 and prior accident year existing claims as much as we'd previously expected. We have been focused on operational improvements this year, including our pricing to risk. We have begun rate actions on almost 95% of the auto base and approximately 80% of the home, which will take time to be seen in the financial results. These actions have been effective in slowing sales across product lines and performance for 2015 accident year is in line with our expectations. While results in the quarter did not meet our expectations, we are aggressively pursuing additional business improvements to anticipate better profitability in 2016. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong. Our excess capital is approximately $2.5 billion, with an RBC ratio of approximately 640%. Our hedging program has been quite effective and the investment portfolio remains strong, and I will get into our energy exposure momentarily. 
We continued to return over 100% of operating earnings to shareholders, with $569 million distributed through dividends and share repurchase in the quarter. For the year, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders, which was 125% of operating earnings. 
Looking into 2016, we plan to return 90% to 100% of earnings to shareholders as a baseline, but we will be opportunistic based on valuation. 
There's been a lot of interest in the energy sector, given our oil prices. So I'd like to take a few minutes to give you more detail on our portfolio. As you'll see on Slide 11, we have approximately $3.3 billion of energy sector exposure. The duration is short on these energy holdings, with over 35% maturing in less than 3 years. We feel quite comfortable with our holdings for the following reasons: we have a consistent rigorous research process behind our investment decisions; as we analyze investment opportunities, we consider low commodity prices when we analyze, stress test and purchase energy company bonds; our analysis focuses on key variables such as a company's cost structure, balance sheet health, flexibility of CapEx budget, asset coverage and our assessment of management quality and behaviors. Approximately $1.2 billion of our energy exposure is to pipelines which are essentially the infrastructure to move oil, oil products and natural gas from the producer to the end-users. The vast majority of our exposure is with a handful of the largest U.S. pipeline operators. These pipeline operators are highly regulated and receive most of their revenues from contracts where the customers pay a reservation charge regardless of the quantity and price of product being moved. In many cases, these pipeline assets originate at the wellhead, making this pipeline infrastructure essential to the producers. Additionally, contract terms with producers and customers are generally multiyear in duration. The risk of our energy exposure's focused on large diversified North American based companies. While we anticipate that some investment grade holdings may be downgraded to high yield by the rating agencies, we do believe that these companies have the financial flexibility to weather this extreme pricing environment. We have already seen these management teams taking aggressive actions that we would expect of them. Reducing their core structures, cutting capital expenditures related to future production growth, reducing or eliminating dividends, undertaking asset sales and even issuing equity, all with an eye towards living within cash flow as these distressed commodity prices continue. So far, we have only 2 downgrades from investment grade to high yield in the energy space. 
The last thing I'll mention is that the team we have in place today is the same team that managed our portfolio well during the global financial crisis. In fact, approximately 30% of our overall energy exposure was purchased in 2008 and 2009 when commodity and bond prices were last near these levels. 
Overall, I feel very good about our financial performance in the quarter and in the year. We delivered solid earnings growth in the face of challenging market conditions. 2016 is off to a difficult start, with continued market deterioration and volatility, which will pressure results if it persist. However, we've managed through challenging environments in the past and we have the levers to do so this year. We have an excellent track record of returning capital to shareholders in a meaningful way and we'll continue to do so opportunistically. 
With that, we will take your questions."

Again, I can't really take you through what we see in the industry statistics and other things like, but when we look at [indiscernible], as you look at BI, under shirt and physical damage, what you're seeing there is, we had clients on the books looking at this, and this is typical, I think, for the industry. And as they go through their ages cycle, the environments become a lot more [indiscernible] and I think that's not just [indiscernible] for us. I think that is an overall situation. And basically, assessing as we look at it, we added the staff and certainly started looking at the claims, performance and aspects. We realized that this was more and more about our case reserves where we need to be bolstered as it relates to the 2014 and prior. And again, if you look at up to 2014, you're looking at probably more severity. And in 2014, a combination of severity and frequency. So we, therefore, had to increase our case reserves to do that. We now believe, certainly assessing the situation, that we're more confident that these reserves will be adequate and certainly, with the amount of staff. But I think [indiscernible], even though, again, we talked about claims on liability deteriorated, I think there are other firms probably had higher reserve capabilities in through basically weather that situation and we did not as we were building it.

You have some -- in our case, we run a lot of assets in the managed fee based business, and so you have that depreciation at the end of the third quarter. But as you saw, we still got $2 billion into our RAP flows. Our cash balances increased by a few billion. So I think at the end of the day, activity's still going on. I think people are just like  you and I, probably looking and saying, is there another like down, what is the level of volatility. I think on the other side, we're not seeing wholesale changes to client activity or people pulling money or anything like that, but I think people are more stay in tuned.

I think one of the things people have identified is, the idea that if they're unable to sell REITs, et cetera, or some of the type of broker transactions into the qualified accounts and what would that do to revenue. I would just, over the course of this year, based on changes in regulations and other things and where the market was, our advisers pulled back from that. So I think the pullback from that's going to be less significant because it was already occurred in our numbers in 2015 in a large way. Because you know, there are a level of changes happening there already. I think in regard to the business overall, it really depends on where the deal all comes out with their best interest contract exemption. And if they truly are giving you the ability to do commission based business within that and to satisfy your obligations there, that's one method. If they are saying, no, we don't like that. We want to move more to fee based. Yes, we can accommodate that as well. We're try to figure out which way that as far as the actual final rule. You would imagine that there's going to be some increase in compliance and cost disclosure and various things like that. But over time, we'll get everything adjusted for it. It's hard to really say. We probably see some adjustments that would happen in the idea of the commission type business for these accounts. We do see that a lot of our annuity business, I know that was one of the things that people mentioned, but a lot of our annuity business today, very, very little, almost none of it, is done without the extra debt benefits or living guarantees or something that, again, the administration has said, that's still important. So we're still under the impression that under the best interest contract, you can still actually do those things as long as you satisfy the requirements of the value provided and what that is and how you disclosed it, et cetera. So that's why I'm saying, it's kind of hard to give you an adjustment, but we have all the what if's depending on where we go, what we're planning on doing is as soon as we get that information, we'll come out in a more informed way and let you know what that is. We already know that there are a number of offsets that we can do by adjusting things, including what fees we charge and don't charge and where we do it. On the other side of it, it's hard to tell exactly what is permissible at this point. I hope that -- I wish -- but I don't want to get ahead of my SKUs on this."

I mean, our overall revenue stayed and didn't go down or anything like that. But we had an impact because of lower markets at the end of the third quarter. And as our RAP fee business builds at the beginning of that quarter through the quarter, you saw that it would be impacted because assets are depreciated by, it was 8%, 10%, whatever it was, from the beginning of the end of the third quarter. So it did have some impact in the revenue based on the billions from the depreciation that occurred. The transaction activity was pretty much consistent with the previous quarter's. It didn't necessarily go down in the fourth quarter. We usually see a little more activity happening at the end of the year. The way of our expenses sort of accrue, particularly as we do our advertising, because that's really a fall campaign, as an example, advertising expects us pick up in the quarter, but that's consistent with the prior year, the year before that, et cetera. So expenses always go up a little in the quarter. On a full year basis, was still only relatively flat in G&A. And year-over-year,  G&A is consistent because of quarterly accruals. So I would just say, what happens is, you always have that little extra expense coming in the fourth quarter because our advertising campaign, there was an extra payroll week, et cetera, pay period and things like that. But we didn't increase expenses at all. And what happened was, we didn't get the lift of revenue, from all the RAP balances coming in the previous quarters because the market depreciated. So that's where the margin compressed. Now going forward, I think, if you said market's off 10% from where we are in the equities, it's going to impact our fees. I mean, we run a very large fee-based business. So I would say, margins would compress if the markets don't bounce back, only because that's going to take a chunk out of your revenue. Now, we'll adjust and think about expenses but again, you can only adjust expenses going out, not necessarily for what's there today."

We won't have to raise equity in a difficult market, which doesn't make us a lot of sense. And over time, we also can return back in a more, what I would call a stronger way, so that you always have something there in addition to whether you're in a weak market requirement to buy back more. So that's the way we thought about it. I mean, I remember before the financial crisis, a number of investors asked us to -- and analysts, why aren't we returning more? Why aren't we going out the risk curve? Why don't we get more higher-yielding instruments, et cetera, et cetera? And I think they thanked me afterward in a sense that we kept the company on a consistent path. We did appropriately, having the flexibility and the means to navigate, and we did have the opportunity then to do a bigger deal even though we had to do because it was a little big a deal because the environment was so unsettled. We actually just did some equity at the same time. So I would just say, Ameriprise is very well situated. And as this market gets even more difficult, I think we're actually one of the stronger players to actually be able to capitalize on. If it doesn't, we'll be able to continue to buy back our stock at good numbers and still be able to keep the company strong, not knowing what the next step or the turn of environment or an M&A comes along. So I actually think we're situated well in this actually kind of good environment for Ameriprise in that sense."

But again, you're talking about margin. So the question is really getting to base profitability and then -- because remember, revenue's going to be moving and also, our profitability and the actions that we then take. I think the elements, the moving parts of the market, both interest and with equity, certainly compounds a little. But then, the actions we will be taking on as we look at that and the interest lift. The underlying direction of the business is solid, so I think, again. but the question is client behavior. So it is a difficult question. The fundamentals are there, but we do get impacted by these variables that we just can't control. That's the noncontrollable side, then we get to the actions that we take to manage the business. So margins are tough one because you got a lot of moving parts on it. But profitability, certainly, will be impacted by the drop in the equity markets, offset by the interest lift and then, it's a matter of how it affects the client activity, both from the level and then the shifting, right? So that's why it's a tough one. It really is. But on the fundamentals of where we're going is solid, certainly, from that standpoint.

We were doing the business that was part of an in-house",731,"Yes. So let me just say a few things on that. And I know that was a bit of a sizable number. And as you sort of came out of the institutional section. So this is a very, very low fee type of assets. We were doing the business that was part of an in-house operation, et cetera, that we have as part of Columbia, always supporting the U.S. Trust business. And it's unfortunate that they're taking a back in-house actually to manage it. And it's all fixed income assets. Having said that, even though we don't like to lose it, it's a very different on a fee basis than the business that we are writing and continue to do. I think -- so it will be another few billion. [indiscernible]. We don't know exactly. I mean, they're not sitting here and saying, we're taking these accounts and different clients, et cetera. But we can say, it could be another few billion. Having said that, I will be very clear, our stronger business, the U.S. Trust is our funds business and an equity products and all those various things, and those continue on. It would be nice if I was able to just not just report flows as a flow number in total but again, this is part of when you do a deal that has a proprietary business and you're taking it over, you're going to have some of those of things. We still have it for Zurich, and we still have good account, good relationship, good overall fee basis. So what I would say in looking through this, and I'll just give you some numbers, and as you know, the fourth quarter wasn't a great quarter for the industry in outflows because of what's happening. But I would say, if you take out the U.S. Trust particularly around this and the normal Zurich, that was $6.6 billion of our outflow, okay? And even though we don't like that per se, it was the lower fee end of the spectrum there in that regard. If you then look at all of retail. Retail would've only been out $1.6 billion. This is before reinvested dividends and all of that was the Acorn fund. So if we can continue to improve that performance, et cetera, and they're steady, we're actually moved to almost a net neutral on our retail. And we're making some good progress in growing in the core retail channels and Europe continues to be good for us. Then you look at institutional and here again, you take out the U.S. Trust, which was buried in there and at the end of the day, what you really have is a net $1 billion out. And that's on a tough market where institutions aren't necessarily funding at this point in time. And that $1 billion, 1 4 of it was 1 client as -- and that client has taken a lot more out of the industry. So as I'm looking at this, and it's hard to see based on you've seen in the total number, we actually are making some underlying progress. The industry, in total, last year, in active funds have been out $200 billion of numbers and so we're starting to gain traction in the areas that are important for us, that are higher fee, more consistent with where our good investment product is, et cetera. But it is a tough environment. So the U.S. Trust, listen, we love that relationship, et cetera, but they're going to make the adjustments as they need to. And right now, some of these lower fee stuff is going away. But we still have a very good relationship with very good product in there with some of the stronger activity and the types of areas we wanted. And Zurich will be Zurich, but it's a great ongoing account for us, but it's going to be an outflow because part of that book is pretty closed. So I don't know how to describe it any different for you. What I'm trying to say more importantly is we're focused on those things that we would really grow. We got a good diversified business and if the environment continues where money gets put back to work, I think we'll be in even better than we were going in to 2015 that we're coming out of 2015."

First, with respect to the margin in brokerage business, in the Advice & Wealth Management, I thought I heard you say that activity levels, while depressed from where they were at their peak, were roughly in line, did not change much from the activity levels in the September quarter. So my question is, if activity levels were in fact unchanged, if expenses were well-controlled and if the stock market, I'm looking at the average level of the S&P and I believe I have it right when I say that it was actually up modestly compared to the average in 2014's fourth quarter, if the stock -- if you got a little bit of a lift from the stock market, would expense control and stable client activity, why did that combination not lead to a further improvement in profit margins?"

There are 2 things. One is, revenue would have been higher if at the end of the third quarter, the market didn't pull back. Remember, the markets went into 1,800's at the -- in August, September. And so what happens is, you have all your RAP assets under management that you built fees starting in October, beginning of October through the quarter. And so some of those fees being built, were at lower absolute production because the fee level that was based on the asset level and that just climbed back towards the quarter to the end of the quarter, so you don't just build at the end of the quarter. So that was really what took out some of the production that happens on the asset side of the equation, right? And so that's part. The second part of it, very clearly is, we had it in the fourth quarter, is we do have some of the G&A expense, even though we manage the G&A expense flat over the year, when we put our advertising campaigns, we usually go on the air at the end of September, with the bulk of that being October, November, beginning of December. And so we accrue for that expense when we're actually on the air, and that's millions of dollars to run that campaign, which is not in the third and second quarter. Now over the course of the year, since we didn't increase our advertising year-over-year, it's the same, fourth quarter to fourth quarter. If you look at the expenses and the supplemental, you'll see that expenses did not go up and for the full year, we're pretty flat on G&A."

What I said is, I think when some people have come out publicly earlier in '15 and said, it will only be x or it is x because of REITs, et cetera, and this is the percentage over the business I do in that. What I said is, a lot of that business actually reduced tremendously for us in 2015. And so I don't have the exact number, maybe Alicia has it. But I think we did not do a lot of production in REITs, and it wasn't necessarily in that production, we did a lot in the qualified area, but she can give you the numbers on it. So what I said is, they were identifying a little more of that if that went away. We say, looking and reading the deal well proposal before all the commentary, there are a number of things that are going to be affected. The question is, they also said that they would allow for certain business to be done under our best interest exemption standard that you would apply for and you would actually adhere to and you will disclose on, et cetera. Depending on what they finalize there will depend on whether you can continue to do a lot of the business you're currently doing today under greater disclosure and a contract and et cetera, et cetera. Or that, that would have to be adjusted to more of a fee-based type of basis, in which case, you would have to figure out with those clients whether it's appropriate to move. So I can't give you what that would look like yet until I know it. What I'm saying is, there are different ways that we think we can manage and lead the business through if those exceptions are there and if you were able to execute appropriately against them. And if not, there are some alternatives. Part of the activity would be, do you serve some of those a smaller accounts? Again, smaller accounts are a little more coarsely. So part of that is you got to look at your business model appropriately in that regard. So I don't have a perfect answer to you. That's all I said is, it will have an effect on the industry. It will increase some costs. The question is, what do you do over time and can you offset some of that? And on the revenue side, again, I think there are some alternatives, but I don't know until the final rule. And if the final rule says you can't do a certain business, so a certain business has to be done at a certain rate, then there will be some adjustments there coming from the adviser, apart from the firm."

This morning, I'll provide my perspective on the business, and Walter will discuss our financials.
Ameriprise, like the industry, was impacted by a more volatile market environment during the second half of 2015. Overall, our fourth quarter results were solid. We're executing on our strategy and have work to continue to do in certain areas that I'll discuss.
For the quarter, operating net revenues and operating earnings were largely flat, with operating EPS up 7%. And for the full year, operating net revenues were up 1%, operating earnings grew 3% and operating EPS increased 9%. In terms of operating return on equity, Ameriprise continues to deliver on a differentiated level. We generated a new record return at 24.3%, up 130 basis points, which is one of the best in the industry. Ameriprise continues to demonstrate strength in our ability to return capital to shareholders, returning another $569 million in the quarter. In fact, 2015 represented the fifth consecutive year we returned more than 100% of operating earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while investing for growth and maintaining our capital strength and flexibility.
Very clearly, our financial foundation remains in excellent shape. In total, assets under management and administration were $777 billion, as solid Ameriprise retail client flows were dampened by asset management outflows, market depreciation and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact.
Let's move to the business results in the quarter.
In Advice & Wealth Management, we have a strong business, and I feel good about our ability to continue to help advisers build productive practices. The strength of our advice value proposition is even more attractive in this environment. Ameriprise is well positioned to help clients and prospects in every stage of their lives and to address the full spectrum of their needs across both market cycles and their lifetimes. We're helping advisers uptake the extension of our successful Confident Retirement approach that we launched last quarter for those who are still building their wealths. Wealth builders, as we call them, represent more than half of our target market, consumers with $500,000 to $5 million in investable assets. And they value a financial planning relationship, so this is a real opportunity for us going forward as we introduce it to our entire field force over the coming months.
We continue to invest significantly on our brand and marketing programs that help our advisers spend more time with their clients and grow their practices. Our Be Brilliant advertising campaign tells our story by illustrating the everyday moments of brilliance that they can realize by working with the right adviser and the right firm. The campaign is doing well and outperforming competitive norms with all of our key audiences: consumers, clients and advisers. We're complementing our broadcast activity with digital channels like social media and online ads to expand the Ameriprise message and increase engagement with our brands. Our advisers are taking advantage of Be Brilliant in their local communities and online to gain new clients and assets.
Overall, client assets remained strong at $447 billion. We also had solid flows into fee-based investment advisory accounts, and cash positions increased to more than $23 billion. Clients are naturally taking a more consecutive position, which is a typical pattern in this environment.
With regard to our advisers, Ameriprise's value proposition and culture is attractive in the industry. It was another strong quarter for recruiting, as more advisers are recognizing the strength of the Ameriprise value proposition. 82 new experienced advisers moved their practices to Ameriprise. For the year, nearly 350 advisers joined Ameriprise in both the franchise and the employee channels, and so far, the pipeline for this year looks strong. Adviser practices are more productive because of the combination of excellent retention of our most productive advisers, very strong recruiting results and our investments in growth. And adviser productivity, a metric that we're consistently growing, increased 4% year-over-year to $514,000 on a 12-month basis.
We're well positioned in the marketplace and generating good profitability. In this environment, we're working closely with our advisers to handle the effects of market volatility with clients. As clients pull back, it's important to keep them focused and engaged on their goals. People need to plan for their future, and that doesn't change based on market conditions. As we look ahead, the U.S. Department of Labor's pending fiduciary rule will add additional requirements that will have implications for our industry as well as Ameriprise. We're hearing the DOL will be issuing the new regulation in the coming months. With that in mind, we're very much focused on putting together our plans and resources to effectively meet the DOL's requirements, but we need to understand what the final rule will be and how it will impact our clients. We have the resources, compliance infrastructure and capabilities to respond to the DOL's objectives. And we believe that our value proposition, satisfying client needs for the long term, has been and will continue to be very appropriate.
Let's move to Annuities and Protection. I'll focus more on the underlying business, and Walter will cover the financials.
In terms of Annuities, we continue to see solid sales of our variable annuities with and without living benefits in our channel, while we were -- in outflows have reflexed [ph] our closed third-party boo and we remain focused on serving our clients. Within fixed annuities, we continue to have a level of outflows given the book is in runoff, as we have not been adding to it given the current rate environment. Our focus remains on working with advisers to help clients understand the importance of guaranteed income in a well-diversified plan. It's integrated within our Confident Retirement framework. And I feel good about how we're managing the business, developing and enhancing our competitive products and features while managing risk.
Within Protection, in Life and Health, we closed the year with a nice increase in sales driven by UL products. And while life claims were higher than a year ago, we recognize there will be fluctuations quarter to quarter, and these movements are within our planned ranges. We have a good book, and we're working with our advisers to serve clients' protection needs. The environment does create growth challenges for these longer-term products, but at the same time, it reinforces the importance of protecting what matters most to clients.
In Auto and Home, we're disappointed with the financial results in the quarter. And as you saw, we did increase reserves this quarter for higher claims experienced in some of the older business. New business is performing in line with our expectations. Walter will explain that in more detail. We continue to make a number of enhancements to improve the financial performance and risk characteristics of the business. We brought in significant resources and leadership to continue to enhance our pricing, underwriting and claims management. We feel that we are making the progress necessary, but we recognize it will take time for the benefits to work through the book and be fully realized. Importantly, we continue to maintain our strong client satisfaction of and affinity relationships in Auto and Home.
In Asset Management, we're generating solid financial results and executing on our strategy focused on gaining market share and profitable flows. With $472 billion in assets under management, we have an at-scale business with a diversified base of assets and earnings, and we are focused on serving more individual and institutional clients in key markets globally. For the quarter, operating earnings were $193 million, as revenues are largely flat and earnings were down a bit year-over-year from the timing of the few expense items and investments in the business, including supporting our new Columbia Threadneedle Investments brand in our key regions of the U.S., U.K., Europe and Asia. Investment performance remains quite strong. I'd highlight U.S. and European equities, asset allocation and tax-exempt fixed income as particular strengths. Our investment teams in the U.S., London and Singapore are demonstrating the importance of active management both in terms of capital appreciation as well as preservation given the volatility we're experiencing.
On the product front, in Europe, we're seeing good sales in our U.K. and European equity products. Here in the U.S., we've had good traction with sales in large-cap equity products as well as in our strategic income fund. And within the solutions space, our CARA [ph] strategy continues to gain interest.
From an overall flows perspective, we had about $700 million of net outflows in the quarter with reinvested dividends. This did include a higher level of outflows at U.S. Trust. However, underlying flow trends are improving, and I'll take you through it.
Let's start with institutional. Total outflows were driven by about $6 billion in net outflows of former parent assets largely driven by outflows of low-fee fixed-income common trust funds and IMAs at U.S. Trust given the changes they have made. We mentioned this last quarter and expect continued IMA outflows of several billion dollars at U.S. Trust in the first half of 2016. In addition, we and others in the industry continue to experience outflows from a large client who redeem from strong-performing strategies to address liquidity concerns. That was approximately $1.4 billion in the quarter, and we expect at least $1 billion of additional outflow in the first quarter. These 2 components, low-fee former parent assets and a single large client, muted continued progress in third-party institutional flows. We have strong client and consultant relationships, a solid list of won-not-funded mandates and a good pipeline, which we expect will drive flows this year.
Let's now move to retail. In the U.S., we're seeing positive trends from the work the team has done to focus our sales strategy. However, this was muted from a flows perspective given continued outflows in the Acorn fund. The fund's short-term performance has improved from the changes we've made, including adding an experienced lead PM who came onboard at year-end. We expect outflows will continue in the near term as the team reestablishes the fund's longer-term track record. In addition, in the quarter, we made the decision to end the subadvisory relationship with Marsico Capital Management given the strength of our global investment capabilities. This resulted in a few hundred million of outflows in the fourth quarter. We plan to ask shareholders to support our plans to merge certain funds in 2016. In addition, we expect outflows of about $700 million in Marsico-managed institutional SMAs in the first quarter. Based upon the previous servicing relationship with them, these outflows will have no financial impact.
Overall, we've been able to grow gross sales and market share in the larger broker-dealer and independent channel in the past year at a time when gross sales declined for the industry. This bodes well, as industry sales may pick up down the line. We recognize we need to do more to increase both gross and net sales in U.S. retail, but I feel good about the business, the team in place and our strategy. We're seeing early results.
With regard to European retail. We continue to build on our strong presence in the U.K. and serve more clients in key markets on the continent. At $1.4 billion in the quarter, European retail flows bounced back strongly from a tough third quarter. The market environment, so far this year, is clearly challenging, but we're focused on what we can control. We're generating strong performance for clients. We have a good product line and distribution. I feel good about the team in place, the moves we're making and the traction we have in key initiatives in Asset Management.
Overall, the company is performing well and our core businesses are strong. Ameriprise delivered solid earnings in a more difficult environment. Higher market volatility and declines have clearly shaped the start of 2016. We've managed through difficult market cycles before. And we're very much focused on executing on our strategy, connecting with clients and advisers and driving results. Ameriprise has the ability and long-term perspective to continue to invest as we navigate the environment, capture opportunities and generate shareholder value. We have a strong track record of returning capital to shareholders and intend to continue to return to shareholders as we have, as well as maintain our excellent financial foundation. We're focused on keeping the company strong as we look for further growth opportunities. 
With that, I'd like to hand things over to Walter to review the numbers."

However, the res",1654,"Thank you, Jim.
I'd like to build on what Jim shared with you as we review the financial results.
As context: Markets were volatile and are in downward trend in the second half of 2015, which impacted revenues for our growth businesses. However, the results we delivered in the quarter were strong. The one exception is Auto and Home business where we were disappointed with the results, which we will cover in more detail when I review the segments. We remained opportunistic in repurchasing our stock at an elevated level in the quarter, given the pullback in the valuation, and still believe our stock is undervalued. Our capacity to buy back stock remains strong given our balance sheet fundamentals and the business mix generates strong free cash. We are committed to maintaining a differentiated level of capital return.
Let's turn to Slide 4. Macro conditions impact revenue in a few ways. We had limited equity appreciation, which impacted asset under management. Volatility also suppressed client activity and contributed to Asset Management outflows. Low interest rates remained a headwind for our insurance and annuity businesses, and foreign exchange translation impacted asset levels and earnings. These impacts were felt across all financial services companies, and we were not unique in this regard. As you can see, total revenue growth was not at the level we have seen in the past. Volatile markets and lower interest rates, which -- decreased AUM, and client activity slowed. This muted the impact of areas where we successfully built the wealth management business through increased wrap flows, growth in insurance and annuity sales and building cash sweep levels as clients wait for a less-volatile environment to make investment decisions.
Let's turn to Slide 5. Ameriprise delivered solid growth in EPS and return on equity, demonstrating the multiple levers we have to manage the business in a variety of market environments. Specifically, we manage G&A expenses, investing for growth in targeted areas, but remaining disciplined. This, combined with solid tax planning and share repurchase, supported good 7% EPS growth. The operating effective tax rate was 20.1% in the quarter, which is lower than we had anticipated, driven by the level of dividends received deduction coming in higher than we expected.
Turning to segment performance, starting with AWM on Slide 6.
The Advice & Wealth Management business continues to perform well, delivering solid financial results. Operating net revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 1% from last year. Our revenue growth slowed due to the impact of market levels of volatility and didn't experience the typical lift we have seen from markets. Wrap net flows were quite good at $2.1 billion despite the deterioration in the markets and flat client activity levels.
Total expenses increased 2% year-over-year, driven by higher distribution expense. G&A expenses in the quarter were flat year-over-year and also flat for the full year 2015 versus full year 2014. On a sequential basis, we had a normal uptick in G&A related to elevated advertising spend and other timing-related items in the quarter. This resulted in earnings of $210 million and a strong margin of 16.6%. Margin for the full year was up to 17.1% from 16.5% in the prior year. Results were achieved with little benefit of increasing short interest rates.
We had a $23.5 billion of brokerage cash balances. We anticipate a more material benefit in the first quarter from this fed rate hike, with the majority of the first 25 basis point increase flowing to the bottom line.
Asset Management continues to provide a solid contribution to our revenue and earnings, as you'll see on Slide 7. Operating net revenue was essentially flat at $833 million, reflecting marginal growth in equity markets and the cumulative impact of net outflows, partially offset by strong CLO benefits and the performance fees in the quarter. Expenses were up due to elevated performance fee compensation, as well as the timing of certain project-related costs. We remain committed to delivering strong profitability by tightly managing expenses.
Pretax operating earnings were $193 million, down 3% from last year. Again, this reflects the impact of marks and outflows, partially offset by elevated performance fees.
Turning to Annuities on Slide 8. The segment is performing in line with our expectations. Variable annuity pretax earnings increased $6 million from a year ago to $129 million. We are maintaining good profitability in this book. Fixed annuity pretax earnings declined to $23 million due to elevated lapses as the block runs off as it comes out of the surrender charge period. Given the current interest rate environment, there are limited new sales. And as a result, this book is expected to gradually run off and earnings will trend down.
Turning to the Protection segment on the next slide. Pretax operating earnings were $35 million in the quarter.
Let's focus on Life and Health first. Pretax operating earnings benefited from $28 million from an assumption change related to our waiver reserve. Underlying earnings were pressured by elevated life and long-term care clients, which were at the higher end of our expectations; as well as continued low interest rates; and the mix shift from VUL to iUL.
Moving to Auto and Home. We were disappointed with the results in the quarter. We built reserves by $57 million, primarily in the auto book from the 2014 and prior accident years. Driving this was elevated frequency and severity experience for auto injury claims, which is in line with the trends the industry has experienced. Additionally, we did not see the level of impact in improving the outcome of 2014 and prior accident year existing claims as much as we'd previously expected. We have been focused on operational improvements this year, including our pricing to risk. We have begun rate actions on almost 95% of the auto base and approximately 80% of the home, which will take time to be seen in the financial results. These actions have been effective in slowing sales across product lines, and performance for 2015 accident year is in line with our expectations. While results in the quarter did not meet our expectations, we are aggressively pursuing additional business improvements and anticipate better profitability in 2016.
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Slide 10.
Our balance sheet fundamentals remained strong. Our excess capital was approximately $2.5 billion, with an RBC ratio of approximately 640%. Our hedging program has been quite effective. And the investment portfolio remained strong, and I will get into our energy exposure momentarily. We continued to return over 100% of operating earnings to shareholders, with $569 million distributed through dividends and share repurchase in the quarter. For the year, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders, which was 125% of operating earnings. Looking into 2016, we plan to return 90% to 100% of earnings to shareholders as a baseline, but we will be opportunistic based on valuation.
There has been a lot of interest in the energy sector given oil prices, so I'd like to take a few minutes to give you more detail on our portfolio. As you'll see on Slide 11, we have approximately $3.3 billion of energy sector exposure. The duration is short on these energy holdings, with over 35% maturing in less than 3 years. We feel quite comfortable with our holdings for the following reasons: We have a consistent, rigorous research process behind our investment decisions. As we analyze investment opportunities, we consider low commodity prices when we analyze, stress test and purchase energy company bonds. Our analysis focuses on key variables such as a company's cost structure, balance sheet health, flexibility of CapEx budget, assets coverage and our assessment of management quality and behaviors.
Approximately $1.2 billion of our energy exposure is to pipelines which are essentially the infrastructure to move oil, oil products and natural gas from the producer to the end users. The vast majority of our exposure is with a handful of the largest U.S. pipeline operators. These pipeline operators are highly regulated and receive most of their revenues from contracts where the customers pay a reservation charge regardless of the quantity and price of product being moved. In many cases, these pipeline assets originate at the wellhead, making this pipeline infrastructure essential to the producers. Additionally, contract terms with producers and customers are generally multiyear in duration.
The rest of our energy exposure is focused on large, diversified North American-based companies. While we anticipate that some investment-grade holdings may be downgraded to high yield by the rating agencies, we do believe that these companies have the financial flexibility to weather this extreme pricing environment. We have already seen these management teams taking aggressive actions that we would expect of them: reducing their core structures, cutting capital expenditures related to future production growth, reducing or eliminating dividends, undertaking asset sales and even issuing equity, all with an eye towards living within cash flow as these distressed commodity prices continue. So far, we have only 2 downgrades from investment grade to high yield in the energy space.
The last thing I'll mention is that the team we have in place today is the same team that managed our portfolio well during the global financial crisis. In fact, approximately 30% of our overall energy exposure was purchased in 2008 and 2009, when commodity and bond prices were last near these levels.
Overall, I feel very good about our financial performance in the quarter and in the year. We delivered solid earnings growth in the face of challenging market conditions. 2016 is off to a difficult start with continued market deterioration and volatility, which will pressure results if it persists. However, we have managed through challenging environments in the past, and we have the levers to do so this year. We have an excellent track record of returning capital to shareholders in a meaningful way and will continue to do so opportunistically.
With that, we will take your questions."

Again, I can only take you through what I, we see in the industry statistics and things like it, but what you're looking at is long dated as you look at BI, underinsured and -- what do you -- physical damage. What you're seeing there is we had clients on the books looking at this. And this is typical, I think, for the industry. And as they go through their aging cycle, the environments become a lot more litigious, and I think that's not just exclusively for us. I think that is an overall situation. And the -- basically assessing it as we looked at it, we added the staff and certainly started looking at the claims performance and aspects and realized that this was more and more about our case reserves where we need to be bolstered as it relates to the 2014 and prior. And again, if you look at up to 2014, you're looking at probably more severity; and in 2014, a combination of severity and frequency. So we therefore had to increase our case reserves to do that. We now believe, certainly assessing the situation, that we're more confident in that these reserves will be adequate and certainly with the amount of staff. But I think what you -- the reason why you don't see some of it even though, again, we talk about claims of -- on liability deteriorated, I think there -- other firms probably had higher reserve capabilities then to basically weather that situation, and we did not as we were building it. Last year, when we built the reserves, we have built-in more to it. When we went into '14, we record that what we're reserving in that year, as we indicated, was -- when we assessed it at the end of the day, it was not adequate. And that's where the majority of that money went. It's we've seen for every deterioration, like I said, in BI and UIM and UM."

But as you saw, we still got $2 billion into our wrap flows. Our cash balances increased by a few billion. So I think, at the end of the day, activity is still going on. I think people are, just like you and I, probably looking and saying, ""Is there another lag down? What's the level of volatility?"" I think, on the other side, we're not seeing wholesale changes to client activity or people pulling money or anything like that, but I think people are more stayed in-tune. There's still money going to work, and some people are using this as an opportunity, but I think -- at the end of the day, I think increased volatility always gives people a little pause."

I think one of the things people have identified is the idea that, if they're unable to sell REITs et cetera or some of the type of brokerage transactions into the qualified accounts, and what would that do to revenue, I would just, over the course of this year, based on changes in regulations and other things and where the market was, our advisers pulled back from that. So I think the pullback from that is going to be less significant because it was -- already occurred in our numbers in 2015 in a large way because there are a level of changes happening there already. I think, in regard to the business overall, it really depends on where the DOL comes out with their ""best interest contract exemption."" And if they truly are giving you the ability to do commission-based business within that and to satisfy your obligations there, that's one method. If they're saying, ""No, we don't like that and we want to move more to fee based,"" yes, we can accommodate that as well. We're trying to figure out which way that -- as far as the actual final rule. You would imagine that there's going to be some increase in compliance and cost disclosure and various things like that, but over time, we'll get everything adjusted for it. It's hard to really say. We probably see some adjustments that would happen in the idea of the commission-type business for these accounts. We do see that a lot of our annuity business -- I know that was one of the things that people mentioned, but a lot of -- our annuity business today, very, very little or almost none of it is done without the extra death benefits or living guarantees or something, that again the administration has said that's still important. So we're still under the impression that, under the best interest contract, you can still actually do those things as long as you satisfy the requirements of the value provided and what that is and how you disclose it et cetera. So that's why I'm saying it's kind of hard to give you an adjustment, but we have all the what-if's. Depending on where we go, what we're planning on doing is, as soon as we get that information, we'll come out in a more informed way and let you know what that is. We already know that there are a number of offsets that we can do by adjusting things, including what fees we charge and don't charge and where we do it. On the other side of it, it's hard to tell exactly what is permissible at this point. I hope that -- I wish I -- but I don't want to get ahead of my skis on this."

If you look at the fourth quarter, actually, the fourth quarter margin is pretty good. I mean our overall revenue stayed. It didn't go down or anything like that, but we had an impact because of lower markets at the end of the third quarter. And as our wrap fee business builds at the beginning of that quarter, through the quarter, you saw that it would be impacted because assets are depreciated by, it was, 8%, 10%, whatever it was, from the beginning -- the end of the third quarter. So it did have some impact on the revenue based on the billings from a lower- -- from the depreciation that occurred. The transaction activity was pretty much consistent with the previous quarters. It didn't necessarily go down in the fourth quarter. We usually see a little more activity happening at the end of the year. The way of our expenses sort of accrue, particularly as we do our advertising because that's really a fall campaign, as an example, advertising expenses picked up in the quarter but that's consistent with the prior year and the year before that et cetera. So expenses always go up a little in the quarter. On a full year basis, we're still only relatively flat in G&A. And year-over-year, G&A is consistent because of the quarterly accruals. So I would just say what happens is you always have that little extra expense coming in the fourth quarter because of our advertising campaign. There is an extra payroll week, et cetera, pay period and things like that, but we didn't increase expenses at all. And what happened was we didn't get the lift to revenue that you did from all the wrap balances coming in, in previous quarters because the market depreciated. So that's why the margin compressed. Now going forward, I think, if you'd say the market's off 10% from where we were in the equities, it's going to impact our fees. I mean we run a very large fee-based business. So I would say margins would compress if the markets don't bounce back only because that's going to take a chunk out of your revenue. Now we'll adjust and think about expenses, but again you can only adjust expenses going out, not necessarily for what's there today."

We wouldn't have to go raise equity in a difficult market, which doesn't make a lot of sense. And over time, we also can return back in a more what I would call stronger way so that you always have something there, in addition to whether you're in a weak market environment, to buy back more. So that's the way we thought about it. I mean I remember, before the financial crisis, a number of investors asked us too, and analysts, why aren't we returning more. Why don't we go out on the risk curve? Why don't we get more higher-yielding instruments, et cetera, et cetera? And I think they thanked me afterward in the sense that we kept the company on a consistent path. We did appropriately, having the flexibility and the means to navigate. And we did have the opportunity then to do a bigger deal even though we had to do because it was a little big a deal because the environment was so unsettled. We actually just did some equity at the same time. So I would just say Ameriprise is very well situated. And if this market gets even more difficult, I think we're actually one of the stronger players to actually be able to capitalize on it. But if it doesn't, we'll be able to continue to buy back our stock at good numbers and still be able to keep the company strong, not knowing what the next step or the turn of the environment or an M&A comes along.

The underlying direction of the business is solid, so -- I think, in the end, but the question is client behavior. So it is a difficult question. The fundamentals are there, but we do get impacted by these variables that we just can't control. That's the noncontrollable side, then we get to the actions that we take to manage the business. So margins are tough, one, because you've got moving -- a lot of moving parts on it. But profitability certainly will be impacted by the drop in the equity markets, offset by the interest lift. And then we -- it's a matter of how it affects the client activity and both from the level and then the shifting, all right? So that's why it's a tough one. It really is.

So let me just say a few things on that. And I know that was a bit of a sizable number. And as you saw, it came out of the institutional section. So this is a very, very low-fee type of assets. We were doing the business that was part of an in-house",738,"Yes. So let me just say a few things on that. And I know that was a bit of a sizable number. And as you saw, it came out of the institutional section. So this is a very, very low-fee type of assets. We were doing the business that was part of an in-house operation, et cetera that we had as part of Columbia and are always supporting in the U.S. Trust business. And it's unfortunate that they're taking it back in-house, actually, to manage it. And it's all fixed-income assets. Having said that, even though we don't like to lose it, it's very different on a fee basis than the business that we are writing and continue to do, I think. So it will be another few billion, we understand. We don't know exactly. I mean they're not sitting here and saying, ""We're taking these accounts in different clients, et cetera,"" but it -- we can say it could be another few billion. Having said that, I will be very clear. Our stronger business with U.S. Trust is a funds business and then equity products and all those various things, and those continue on. It would be nice if I was able to just -- not just report flows as a flow number in total, but again this is part of, when you do a deal that has a proprietary business and you're taking it over, you're going to have some of those things. We still have it for Zurich; and we still have a good account, a good relationship, good overall fee basis. So what I would say in looking through this, and I'll just give you some numbers, and as you know, the fourth quarter wasn't a great quarter for the industry in outflows because of what's happening. But I would say, if you take out the U.S. Trust, particularly around this, and the normal Zurich, that was $6.6 billion of our outflow, okay? And even though we don't like that per se, it was the lower-fee end of the spectrum there in that regard. If you then look at all of retail, retail would have only been out $1.6 billion. This is before reinvested dividends. And all of that was the Acorn fund. So if we can continue to improve that performance, et cetera, and they're steady, we're actually moved to almost a net neutral on our retail. And we're making some good progress in growing in the core retail channels, and Europe is -- continues to be good for us. Then you look at institutional, and here again you take out the U.S. Trust which was buried in there. And at the end of the day, what you really have is a net $1 billion out. And that's in a tough market where institutions aren't necessarily funding at this point in time. And that $1 billion, 1/4 of it was one client as -- and that client took -- has taken a lot more out of the industry. So as I'm looking at this, and it's hard to see based on you see in the total number, we actually are making some underlying progress. The industry in total, last year, in active funds have been out $200 billion of numbers. And so we're starting to gain traction in the areas that are important for us; that are higher fee, more consistent with where our good investment product is; et cetera, but it is a tough environment. So the U.S. Trust, listen, we love that relationship, et cetera, but they're going to make the adjustments as they need to. And right now, some of this lower-fee stuff is going away, but we still have a very good relationship, with a very good product in there with some of the stronger activity and the types of areas we wanted. And Zurich will be Zurich, but it's a great ongoing account for us but it's going to be in outflows because part of that book is pretty closed. So I don't know how to describe it any different for you. What I'm trying to say more importantly is we're focused on those things that we would really grow. We got a good, diversified business. And if the environment continues where money gets put back to work, I think we'll be in even better stead than we were going into 2015 that we're coming out of 2015."

First, with respect to the margin in the brokerage business in the Advice & Wealth Management, I thought I heard you say that activity levels, while depressed from where they were at their peak, were roughly in-line, did not change much from the activity levels in the September quarter. So my question is, if activity levels were in fact unchanged, if expenses were well controlled and if the stock market -- I'm looking at the average level of the S&P, and I believe I have it right when I say that it was actually up modestly compared to the average in 2014's fourth quarter. If the stock -- if you got a little bit of a lift from the stock market, good expense control and stable client activity, why did that combination not lead to a further improvement in profit margins?"

There are 2 things. One is it -- revenue would have been higher if, at the end of the third quarter, the markets didn't pull back. You'll remember the markets went into 1,800's at the -- in August, September. And so what happened is you have all your wrap assets under management that you built fees, starting in October, beginning of October, through the quarter. And so some of those fees being built were at lower absolute production because, the fee level, that was based on the asset level. And that just climbed back towards the quarter, to the end of the quarter, so you don't just build at the end of the quarter. So that was really what took out some of the production that happens on the asset side of the equation, right? And so that's part. The second part of it, very clearly, is -- and we've had it in the fourth quarters, is we do have some of a G&A expense even though we manage the G&A expense flat over the year. When we put our advertising campaigns, we usually go on the air at the end of September, with the bulk of that being October, November, beginning of December; and so we accrue for that expense when we're actually on the air. And that's millions of dollars to run that campaign, which is not in the third and second quarter. Now over the course of the year, since we didn't increase our advertising year-over-year, it's the same fourth quarter to fourth quarter. If you look at the expenses in the supplemental, you'll see that expenses did not go up, and for the full year, we're pretty flat on G&A."

And this is the percentage over the business I'd do in that,"" what I said is a lot of that business actually reduced tremendously for us in 2015. And so I don't have the exact number. Maybe Alicia has it, but I think we did not do a lot of production in REITs. And it wasn't necessarily in that production. We did a lot in the qualified area. But she can give you the numbers on it. So what I said is they were identifying a little more of that if that went away. We say, looking and reading the DOL's proposal before all the commentary, there are a number of things that are going to be affected. The question is they also said that they would allow for certain business to be done under a ""best interest exemption"" standard that you would apply for and you would absolutely adhere to and you will disclose on et cetera. Depending on what they finalize there will depend on whether you can continue to do a lot of the business you're currently doing today under greater disclosure and a contract and et cetera et cetera; or that, that would have to be adjusted to more of a fee-based type of basis, in which case you would have to figure out with those clients whether it's appropriate to move. So I can't give you what that would look like yet until I know it. What I'm saying is there are different ways that we think that we can manage and lead the business through if those exceptions are there and if you were able to execute appropriately against them. And if not, there are some alternatives. Part of the activity would be do you serve some of the smaller accounts? Again, smaller accounts are a little more costly, so part of that is you've got to look at your business model appropriately in that regard. So I don't have a perfect answer to you. That's all I said, is it will have an effect on the industry. It will increase some costs. The question is what do you do over time. And can you offset some of that? And on the revenue side, again I think there are some alternatives, but I don't know until the final rule. And if the final rule says you can't do certain business or a certain business has to be done at a certain rate, then there will be some adjustments there part coming from the adviser, part from the firm."

This morning, I'll provide my perspective on the business, and Walter will discuss our financials.
Ameriprise, like the industry, was impacted by a more volatile market environment during the second half of 2015. Overall, our fourth quarter results were solid. We're executing on our strategy and have work to continue to do in certain areas that I'll discuss.
For the quarter, operating net revenues and operating earnings were largely flat, with operating EPS up 7%. And for the full year, operating net revenues were up 1%, operating earnings grew 3% and operating EPS increased 9%. In terms of operating return on equity, Ameriprise continues to deliver at a differentiated level. We generated a new record return at 24.3%, up 130 basis points, which is one of the best in the industry. Ameriprise continues to demonstrate strength in our ability to return capital to shareholders, returning another $569 million in the quarter. In fact, 2015 represented the fifth consecutive year we returned more than 100% of operating earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while investing for growth and maintaining our capital strength and flexibility.
Very clearly, our financial foundation remains in excellent shape. In total, assets under management and administration were $777 billion, as solid Ameriprise retail client flows were dampened by asset management outflows, market depreciation and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact.
Let's move to the business results in the quarter.
In Advice & Wealth Management, we have a strong business, and I feel good about our ability to continue to help advisers build productive practices. The strength of our advice value proposition is even more attractive in this environment. Ameriprise is well positioned to help clients and prospects in every stage of their lives and to address the full spectrum of their needs across both market cycles in their lifetimes. We're helping advisers uptake the extension of our successful Confident Retirement approach that we launched last quarter for those who are still building their wealth.  Wealth builders, as we call them, represent more than half of our target market, consumers with $500,000 to $5 million in investable assets. And they value a financial planning relationship.  So this is a real opportunity for us going forward as we introduce it to our entire field force over the coming months.
We continue to invest significantly in our brand and marketing programs that help our advisers spend more time with their clients and grow their practices. Our Be Brilliant advertising campaign tells our story by illustrating the everyday moments of brilliance that they can realize by working with the right adviser and the right firm. The campaign is doing well and outperforming competitive norms with all of our key audiences: consumers, clients and advisers. We're complementing our broadcast activity with digital channels like social media and online ads that expand the Ameriprise message and increase engagement with our brand.  Our advisers are taking advantage of Be Brilliant in their local communities and online to gain new clients and assets.
Overall, client assets remained strong at $447 billion. We also had solid flows into fee-based investment advisory accounts, and cash positions increased to more than $23 billion. Clients are naturally taking a more consecutive position, which is a typical pattern in this environment.
With regard to our advisers, Ameriprise's value proposition and culture is attractive in the industry. It was another strong quarter for recruiting, as more advisers are recognizing the strength of the Ameriprise value proposition. 82 new experienced advisers moved their practices to Ameriprise. For the year, nearly 350 advisers joined Ameriprise in both the franchise and the employee channels, and so far, the pipeline for this year looks strong. Adviser practices are more productive because of the combination of excellent retention of our most productive advisers, very strong recruiting results and our investments in growth.  Adviser productivity, a metric that we're consistently growing, increased 4% year-over-year to $514,000 on a 12-month basis.
We're well positioned in the marketplace and generating good profitability. In this environment, we're working closely with our advisers to handle the effects of market volatility with clients. As clients pull back, it's important to keep them focused and engaged on their goals. People need to plan for their future, and that doesn't change based on market conditions. As we look ahead, the U.S. Department of Labor's pending fiduciary rule will add additional requirements that will have implications for our industry as well as Ameriprise. We're hearing the DOL will be issuing the new regulation in the coming months. With that in mind, we're very much focused on putting together our plans and resources to effectively meet the DOL's requirements, but we need to understand what the final rule will be and how it will impact our clients. We have the resources, compliance infrastructure and capabilities to respond to the DOL's objectives. And we believe that our value proposition, satisfying client needs for the long term, has been and will continue to be very appropriate.
Let's move to Annuities and Protection. I'll focus more on the underlying business, and Walter will cover the financials.
In terms of Annuities, we continue to see solid sales of our variable annuities with and without living benefits in our channel.  While we are in the outflows, it reflects our closed third-party book, and we remain focused on serving our clients. Within fixed annuities, we continue to have a level of outflows given the book is in runoff, as we have not been adding to it given the current rate environment. Our focus remains on working with advisers to help clients understand the importance of guaranteed income in a well-diversified plan. It's integrated within our Confident Retirement framework, and I feel good about how we're managing the business; developing and enhancing our competitive products and features while managing risk.
Within Protection, in Life and Health, we closed the year with a nice increase in sales driven by UL products. And while life claims were higher than a year ago, we recognize there will be fluctuations quarter to quarter, and these movements are within our planned ranges. We have a good book, and we're working with our advisers to serve clients' protection needs. The environment does create growth challenges for these longer-term products, but at the same time, it reinforces the importance of protecting what matters most to clients.
In Auto and Home, we're disappointed with the financial results in the quarter. And as you saw, we did increase reserves this quarter for higher claims experienced in some of the older business. New business is performing in line with our expectations. Walter will explain that in more detail. We continue to make a number of enhancements to improve the financial performance and risk characteristics of the business. We brought in significant resources and leadership to continue to enhance our pricing, underwriting and claims management. We feel that we are making the progress necessary, but we recognize it will take time for the benefits to work through the book and be fully realized. Importantly, we continue to maintain our strong client satisfaction and affinity relationships in Auto and Home.
In Asset Management, we're generating solid financial results and executing on our strategy focused on gaining market share and profitable flows. With $472 billion in assets under management, we have an at-scale business with a diversified base of assets and earnings, and we are focused on serving more individual and institutional clients in key markets globally. For the quarter, operating earnings were $193 million, as revenues were largely flat and earnings were down a bit year-over-year from the timing of a few expense items and investments in the business, including supporting our new Columbia Threadneedle Investments brand in our key regions of the U.S., U.K., Europe and Asia. Investment performance remains quite strong. I'd highlight U.S. and European equities, asset allocation and tax-exempt fixed income as particular strengths. Our investment teams in the U.S., London and Singapore are demonstrating the importance of active management, both in terms of capital appreciation as well as preservation given the volatility we're experiencing.
On the product front, in Europe, we're seeing good sales in our U.K. and European equity products. Here in the U.S., we've had good traction with sales in large-cap equity products as well as in our strategic income fund. And within the solutions space, our CARA [ph] strategy continues to gain interest.
From an overall flows perspective, we had about $700 million of net outflows in the quarter with reinvested dividends. This did include a higher level of outflows at U.S. Trust. However, underlying flow trends are improving, and I'll take you through it.
Let's start with institutional. Total outflows were driven by about $6 billion in net outflows of former parent assets largely driven by outflows of low-fee fixed-income common trust funds and IMAs at U.S. Trust given the changes they have made. We mentioned this last quarter and expect continued IMA outflows of several billion dollars at U.S. Trust in the first half of 2016. In addition, we and others in the industry continue to experience outflows from a large client who redeemed from strong-performing strategies to address liquidity concerns. That was approximately $1.4 billion in the quarter, and we expect at least $1 billion of additional outflow in the first quarter. These 2 components, low-fee former parent assets and a single large client, muted continued progress in third-party institutional flows. We have strong client and consultant relationships, a solid list of won-not-funded mandates and a good pipeline, which we expect will drive flows this year.
Let's now move to retail. In the U.S., we're seeing positive trends from the work the team has done to focus our sales strategy. However, this was muted from a flows perspective given continued outflows in the Acorn fund. The fund's short-term performance has improved from the changes we've made, including adding an experienced lead PM who came onboard at year-end. We expect outflows will continue in the near term as the team reestablishes the fund's longer-term track record. In addition, in the quarter, we made the decision to end the subadvisory relationship with Marsico Capital Management given the strength of our global investment capabilities. This resulted in a few hundred million of outflows in the fourth quarter. We plan to ask shareholders to support our plans to merge certain funds in 2016. In addition, we expect outflows of about $700 million in Marsico-managed institutional SMAs in the first quarter. Based upon the previous servicing relationship with them, these outflows will have no financial impact.
Overall, we've been able to grow gross sales and market share in the larger broker-dealer and independent channel in the past year at a time when gross sales declined for the industry. This bodes well, as industry sales may pick up down the line. We recognize we need to do more to increase both gross and net sales in U.S. retail, but I feel good about the business, the team in place and our strategy. We're seeing early results.
With regard to European retail. We continue to build on our strong presence in the U.K. and serve more clients in key markets on the continent. At $1.4 billion in the quarter, European retail flows bounced back strongly from a tough third quarter. The market environment, so far this year, is clearly challenging, but we're focused on what we can control. We're generating strong performance for clients. We have a good product line and distribution. I feel good about the team in place, the moves we're making and the traction we have in key initiatives in Asset Management.
Overall, the company is performing well and our core businesses are strong. Ameriprise delivered solid earnings in a more difficult environment. Higher market volatility and declines have clearly shaped the start of 2016. We've managed through difficult market cycles before, and we're very much focused on executing on our strategy, connecting with clients and advisers and driving results. Ameriprise has the ability and long-term perspective to continue to invest as we navigate the environment, capture opportunities and generate shareholder value. We have a strong track record of returning capital to shareholders and intend to continue to return to shareholders as we have, as well as maintain our excellent financial foundation. We're focused on keeping the company strong as we look for further growth opportunities. 
With that, I'd like to hand things over to Walter to review the numbers."

However, the",1653,"Thank you, Jim.
I'd like to build on what Jim shared with you as we review the financial results.
As context, markets were volatile and were in a downward trend in the second half of 2015, which impacted revenues for our growth businesses. However, the results we delivered in the quarter were strong. The one exception is Auto and Home business where we were disappointed with the results, which we will cover in more detail when I review the segments. We remained opportunistic in repurchasing our stock at an elevated level in the quarter, given the pullback in the valuation, and still believe our stock is undervalued. Our capacity to buy back stock remains strong given our balance sheet fundamentals and the business mix generates strong free cash. We are committed to maintaining a differentiated level of capital return.
Let's turn to Slide 4. Macro conditions impact revenue in a few ways. We had limited equity appreciation, which impacted asset under management. Volatility also suppressed client activity and contributed to Asset Management outflows. Low interest rates remained a headwind for our insurance and annuity businesses, and foreign exchange translation impacted asset levels and earnings. These impacts were felt across all financial services companies, and we are not unique in this regard. As you can see, total revenue growth was not at the level we have seen in the past. Volatile markets and lower interest rates, which -- decreased AUM, and client activity slowed. This muted the impact of areas where we successfully built the wealth management business through increased wrap flows, growth in insurance and annuity sales, and building cash sweep levels as clients wait for a less-volatile environment to make investment decisions.
Let's turn to Slide 5. Ameriprise delivered solid growth in EPS and return on equity, demonstrating the multiple levers we have to manage the business in a variety of market environments. Specifically, we managed G&A expenses, investing for growth in targeted areas, but remaining disciplined. This, combined with solid tax planning and share repurchase, supported good 7% EPS growth. The operating effective tax rate was 20.1% in the quarter, which is lower than we had anticipated, driven by the level of dividends received deduction coming in higher than we expected.
Turning to segment performance, starting with AWM on Slide 6.
The Advice & Wealth Management business continues to perform well, delivering solid financial results. Operating net revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 1% from last year. Our revenue growth slowed due to the impact of market levels of volatility and didn't experience the typical lift we have seen from markets. Wrap net flows were quite good at $2.1 billion despite the deterioration in the markets and flat client activity levels.
Total expenses increased 2% year-over-year, driven by higher distribution expense. G&A expenses in the quarter were flat year-over-year and also flat for the full year 2015 versus full year 2014. On a sequential basis, we had a normal uptick in G&A related to elevated advertising spend and other timing-related items in the quarter. This resulted in earnings of $210 million and a strong margin of 16.6%. Margin for the full year was up to 17.1% from 16.5% in the prior year. Results were achieved with little benefit of increasing short interest rates.
We had $23.5 billion of brokerage cash balances. We anticipate a more material benefit in the first quarter from this fed rate hike, with the majority of the first 25 basis point increase flowing to the bottom line.
Asset Management continues to provide a solid contribution to our revenue and earnings, as you'll see on Slide 7. Operating net revenue was essentially flat at $833 million, reflecting marginal growth in equity markets and the cumulative impact of net outflows, partially offset by strong CLO benefits and the performance fees in the quarter. Expenses were up due to elevated performance fee compensation, as well as the timing of certain project-related costs. We remain committed to delivering strong profitability by tightly managing expenses.
Pretax operating earnings were $193 million, down 3% from last year. Again, this reflects the impact of marks and outflows, partially offset by elevated performance fees.
Turning to Annuities on Slide 8. The segment is performing in line with our expectations. Variable annuity pretax earnings increased $6 million from a year ago to $129 million. We are maintaining good profitability in this book. Fixed annuity pretax earnings declined to $23 million due to elevated lapses as the block runs off as it comes out of the surrender charge period. Given the current interest rate environment, there are limited new sales, and as a result, this book is expected to gradually run off and earnings will trend down.
Turning to the Protection segment on the next slide. Pretax operating earnings were $35 million in the quarter.
Let's focus on Life and Health first. Pretax operating earnings benefited from $28 million from an assumption change related to our waiver reserve. Underlying earnings were pressured by elevated life and long-term care claims, which were at the higher end of our expectations; as well as continued low interest rates; and the mix shift from VUL to iUL.
Moving to Auto and Home. We were disappointed with the results in the quarter. We built reserves by $57 million, primarily in the auto book from the 2014 and prior accident years. Driving this was elevated frequency and severity experience for auto injury claims, which is in line with the trends the industry has experienced. Additionally, we did not see the level of impact in improving the outcome of 2014 and prior accident year existing claims as much as we'd previously expected. We have been focused on operational improvements this year, including our pricing to risk. We have begun rate actions on almost 95% of the auto base and approximately 80% of the home, which will take time to be seen in the financial results. These actions have been effective in slowing sales across product lines, and performance for 2015 accident year is in line with our expectations. While results in the quarter did not meet our expectations, we are aggressively pursuing additional business improvements and anticipate better profitability in 2016.
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Slide 10.
Our balance sheet fundamentals remained strong. Our excess capital was approximately $2.5 billion, with an RBC ratio of approximately 640%. Our hedging program has been quite effective, and the investment portfolio remained strong.  I will get into our energy exposure momentarily. We continued to return over 100% of operating earnings to shareholders, with $569 million distributed through dividends and share repurchase in the quarter. For the year, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders, which was 125% of operating earnings. Looking into 2016, we plan to return 90% to 100% of earnings to shareholders as a baseline, but we will be opportunistic based on valuation.
There has been a lot of interest in the energy sector given oil prices, so I'd like to take a few minutes to give you more detail on our portfolio. As you'll see on Slide 11, we have approximately $3.3 billion of energy sector exposure. The duration is short on these energy holdings, with over 35% maturing in less than 3 years. We feel quite comfortable with our holdings for the following reasons: We have a consistent, rigorous research process behind our investment decisions. As we analyze investment opportunities, we consider low commodity prices when we analyze, stress test, and purchase energy company bonds. Our analysis focuses on key variables such as a company's cost structure, balance sheet health, flexibility of CapEx budget, asset coverage and our assessment of management quality and behaviors.
Approximately $1.2 billion of our energy exposure is to pipelines which are essentially the infrastructure to move oil, oil products and natural gas from the producer to the end users. The vast majority of our exposure is with a handful of the largest U.S. pipeline operators. These pipeline operators are highly regulated and receive most of their revenues from contracts where the customers pay a reservation charge regardless of the quantity and price of product being moved. In many cases, these pipeline assets originate at the wellhead, making this pipeline infrastructure essential to the producers. Additionally, contract terms with producers and customers are generally multiyear in duration.
The rest of our energy exposure is focused on large, diversified North American-based companies. While we anticipate that some investment-grade holdings may be downgraded to high yield by the rating agencies, we do believe that these companies have the financial flexibility to weather this extreme pricing environment. We have already seen these management teams taking aggressive actions that we would expect of them: reducing their core structures, cutting capital expenditures related to future production growth, reducing or eliminating dividends, undertaking asset sales and even issuing equity, all with an eye towards living within cash flow as these distressed commodity prices continue. So far, we have only 2 downgrades from investment grade to high yield in the energy space.
The last thing I'll mention is that the team we have in place today is the same team that managed our portfolio well during the global financial crisis. In fact, approximately 30% of our overall energy exposure was purchased in 2008 and 2009, when commodity and bond prices were last near these levels.
Overall, I feel very good about our financial performance in the quarter and in the year. We delivered solid earnings growth in the face of challenging market conditions. 2016 is off to a difficult start with continued market deterioration and volatility, which will pressure results if it persists. However, we have managed through challenging environments in the past, and we have the levers to do so this year. We have an excellent track record of returning capital to shareholders in a meaningful way and will continue to do so opportunistically.
With that, we will take your questions."

Again, I can only take you through what we see in the industry statistics and other things like it.  But when you look at this long date is you look at BI, underinsured and -- what do you -- physical damage. What you're seeing there is we had clients on the books looking at this; and this is typical, I think, for the industry. And as they go through their aging cycle, the environments become a lot more litigious, and I think that's not just exclusively for us. I think that is an overall situation. And the -- basically assessing as we looked at it, we added the staff and certainly started looking at the claims, performance and aspects, and realized that this was more and more about -- our case reserves were going to need to be bolstered as it relates to the 2014 and prior. And again, if you look at up to 2014, you're looking at probably more severity; and in 2014, a combination of severity and frequency. So we therefore had to increase our case reserves to do that. We now believe, certainly assessing the situation, that we're more confident in that these reserves will be adequate and certainly with the amount of staff. But I think what you -- the reason why you don't see some of it even though, again, we talk about claims of -- on liability deteriorated, I think there -- other firms probably had higher reserve capabilities to basically weather that situation, and we did not as we were building it. Last year, when we built the reserves, we built it more to it -- when we went into '14, we record what we were reserving in that year, as we indicated, was -- when we assessed it at the end of the day, it was not adequate. And that's where the majority of that money went. It's -- we've seen further deterioration, like I said, in BI and UIM and UM."

But as you saw, we've still got $2 billion into our wrap flows. Our cash balances increased by a few billion. So I think, at the end of the day, activity is still going on. I think people are, just like you and I, probably looking and saying, ""Is there another leg down? What is it?  What's the level of volatility?"" I think, on the other side, we're not seeing wholesale changes to client activity or people pulling money or anything like that, but I think people have more stayed in-tune.

I think one of the things people have identified is the idea that, if they're unable to sell REITs, et cetera, or some of the type of broker transactions into the qualified accounts, and what would that do to revenue.  I would just say, over the course of this year, based on changes in regulations and other things and where the market was, our advisers pulled back from that. So I think the pullback from that is going to be less significant because it was already incurred in our numbers in 2015 in a large way.  Because you know there is a level of changes happening there already. I think, in regard to the business overall, it really depends on where the DOL comes out with their ""best interest contract exemption."" And if they truly are giving you the ability to do commission-based business within that and to satisfy your obligations there, that's one method. If they're saying, ""No, we don't like that and we want to move more to fee based,"" yes, we can accommodate that as well. We're trying to figure out which way that -- as far as the actual final rule. You would imagine that there's going to be some increase in compliance and cost disclosure and various things like that, but over time, we'll get everything adjusted for it. It's hard to really say. We probably see some adjustments that would happen in the idea of the commission-type business for these accounts. We do see that -- a lot of our annuity business -- I know that was one of the things that people mentioned, but a lot of -- our annuity business today, very, very little, almost none of it is done without extra death benefits or living guarantees or something, that again, the administration has said that's still important. So we're still under the impression that under the best interest contract you can still actually do those things as long as you satisfy the requirements of the value provided and what that is and how you disclose it, et cetera. So that's why I'm saying it's kind of hard to give you an adjustment, but we have all the what-if's, depending on where we go.  What we're planning on doing is, as soon as we get that information, we'll come out in a more informed way and let you know what that is. We already know that there are a number of offsets that we can do by adjusting things, including what fees we charge and don't charge and where we do it. On the other side of it, it's hard to tell exactly what is permissible at this point. I hope that -- I wish I -- but I don't want to get ahead of my skis on this."

I mean our overall revenue stayed, it didn't go down or anything like that.   But we had an impact because of lower markets at the end of the third quarter. And as our wrap fee business builds at the beginning of that quarter, through the quarter, you saw that it would be impacted because assets are depreciated by, it was, 8%, 10%, whatever it was, from the beginning -- or the end of the third quarter. So it did have some impact in the revenue based on the billings from a lower- -- from the depreciation that occurred. The transaction activity was pretty much consistent with the previous quarters. It didn't necessarily go down in the fourth quarter. We usually see a little more activity happening at the end of the year. The way our expenses sort of accrue, particularly as we do our advertising because that's really a fall campaign.  As an example, advertising expenses picked up in the quarter, but that's consistent with the prior year and the year before that, et cetera. So expenses always go up a little in the quarter. On a full year basis, we're still only relatively flat in G&A. And year-over-year, G&A is consistent because of the quarterly accruals. So I would just say what happens is you always have that little extra expense coming in the fourth quarter because of our advertising campaign, there is an extra payroll week, et cetera, pay period and things like that, but we didn't increase expenses at all. And what happened was we didn't get the lift -- the revenue that you did from all the wrap balances coming in previous quarters because the market depreciated. So that's why the margin compressed. Now going forward, I think, if you'd say the market's off 10% from where we were in the equities, it's going to impact our fees. I mean we run a very large fee-based business. So I would say margins would compress if the markets don't bounce back only because that's going to take a chunk out of your revenue. Now we'll adjust and think about expenses, but again you can only adjust expenses going out, not necessarily for what's there today."

We wouldn't have to go raise equity in a difficult market, which doesn't make a lot of sense. And over time, we also can return back in a more what I would call stronger way so that you always have something there in addition to whether you're in a weak market environment, to buy back more. So that's the way we thought about it. I mean I remember before the financial crisis, a number of investors asked us too -- and analysts, why aren't we returning more. Why don't we go out on the risk curve? Why don't we get more higher-yielding instruments, et cetera, et cetera? And I think they thanked me afterward in the sense that we kept the company on a consistent path. We did appropriately, having the flexibility and the means to navigate. And we did have the opportunity then to do a bigger deal even though we had to do -- because it was a little bigger a deal because the environment was so unsettled, we actually just did some equity at the same time.  So I would just say Ameriprise is very well situated. And if this market gets even more difficult, I think we're actually one of the stronger players to actually be able to capitalize on it. But if it doesn't, we'll be able to continue to buy back our stock at good numbers and still be able to keep the company strong, not knowing what the next step or the turn of the environment or an M&A comes along. So I actually think we're situated well, and this is actually a kind of good environment for Ameriprise in that sense."

I think the elements -- the moving parts of the market, both interest and with equity, certainly compounds a little, but then the actions we will be taking as we look at that and the interest lift, the underlying direction of the business is solid I think, in the end. But the question is client behavior. So it is a difficult question. The fundamentals are there, but we do get impacted by these variables that we just can't control. That's the noncontrollable side.  Then we get to the actions that we take to manage the business. So margins are tough, one, because you've got moving -- a lot of moving parts on it. But profitability certainly will be impacted by the drop in the equity markets, offset by the interest lift. And then we -- it's a matter of how it affects the client activity, both from the level and then the shifting, all right? So that's why it's a tough one. It really is.

So let me just say a few things on that. And I know that was a bit of a sizable number. And as you saw, it came out of the institutional section. So this is a very, very low-fee type of asset.  We were doing the business, it was part of an in-house o",741,"Yes. So let me just say a few things on that. And I know that was a bit of a sizable number. And as you saw, it came out of the institutional section. So this is a very, very low-fee type of asset.  We were doing the business, it was part of an in-house operation, et cetera, that we had as part of Columbia or were supporting in the U.S. Trust business. And it's unfortunate that they're taking it back in-house, actually, to manage it. And it's all fixed-income assets. Having said that, even though we don't like to lose it, it's a very different -- on a fee basis, than the business that we are writing and continue to do, I think. So it will be another few billion, we understand. We don't know exactly. I mean they're not sitting here and saying, ""We're taking these accounts and different clients, et cetera,"" but it -- we can say it could be another few billion. Having said that, I will be very clear. Our stronger business with U.S. Trust is a funds business and our equity products and all those various things, and those continue on. It would be nice if I was able to just -- not just report flows as a flow number in total, but again this is part of when you do a deal that has a proprietary business and you're taking it over, you're going to have some of those things. We still have it from Zurich; and we still have a good account, a good relationship, good overall fee basis. So what I would say in looking through this, and I'll just give you some numbers, and as you know, the fourth quarter wasn't a great quarter for the industry in outflows because of what's happening. But I would say, if you take out the U.S. Trust, particularly around this, and the normal Zurich, that was $6.6 billion of our outflow, okay? And even though we don't like that per se, it was the lower-fee end of the spectrum there in that regard. If you then look at all of retail, retail would have only been out $1.6 billion. This is before reinvested dividends. And all of that was the Acorn fund. So if we can continue to improve that performance, et cetera, and it's steady, we're actually moved to almost a net neutral on our retail. And we're making some good progress in growing in the core retail channels, and Europe is -- continues to be good for us. Then you look at institutional, and here again you take out the U.S. Trust which was buried in there. And at the end of the day, what you really have is a net $1 billion out. And that's in a tough market where institutions aren't necessarily funding at this point in time. And that $1 billion, 1/4 of it was one client as -- and that client took -- has taken a lot more out of the industry. So as I'm looking at this, and it's hard to see based on -- and you see in the total number, we actually are making some underlying progress. The industry in total, last year, in active funds, have been out $200 billion of numbers. And so we're starting to gain traction in the areas that are important for us; that are higher fee, more consistent with where our good investment product is; et cetera, but it is a tough environment. So the U.S. Trust, listen, we love that relationship, et cetera, but they're going to make the adjustments as they need to. And right now, some of this lower-fee stuff is going away, but we still have a very good relationship, with a very good product in there with some of the stronger activity in the types of areas we wanted. And Zurich will be Zurich, but it's a great ongoing account for us, but it's going to be in outflows because part of that book is pretty closed. So I don't know how to describe it any different for you. What I'm trying to say more importantly is we're focused on those things that we would really grow. We've got a good, diversified business. And if the environment continues where money gets put back to work, I think we'll be in even better stead than we were going into 2015 than we're coming out of 2015."

First, with respect to the margin in the brokerage business, in the Advice & Wealth Management, I thought I heard you say that activity levels, while depressed from where they were at their peak, were roughly in-line, did not change much from the activity levels in the September quarter. So my question is, if activity levels were in fact unchanged, if expenses were well controlled, and if the stock market -- I'm looking at the average level of the S&P, and I believe I have it right when I say that it was actually up modestly compared to the average in 2014's fourth quarter. If the stock -- if you got a little bit of a lift from the stock market, good expense control and stable client activity, why did that combination not lead to a further improvement in profit margins?"

There are 2 things. One is it -- the revenue would have been higher if, at the end of the third quarter, the markets didn't pull back. You'll remember the markets went into 1,800's at the -- in August, September. And so what happened is you have all your wrap assets under management that you bill fees, starting in October, beginning of October, through the quarter. And so some of those fees being billed were at lower absolute production because, the fee level was based on the asset level. And that just climbed back towards the quarter, to the end of the quarter.  So you don't just build at the end of the quarter. So that was really what took out some of the production that happens on the asset side of the equation, right? And so that's part. The second part of it, very clearly, is -- and we've had it in the fourth quarters, is we do have some of a G&A expense, even though we manage the G&A expense flat over the year. When we put on our advertising campaigns, we usually go on the air at the end of September, with the bulk of that being October, November, beginning of December; and so we accrue for that expense when we're actually on the air. And that's millions of dollars to run that campaign, which is not in the third and second quarter. Now over the course of the year, since we didn't increase our advertising year-over-year, it's the same, fourth quarter to fourth quarter. If you look at the expenses in the supplemental, you'll see that expenses did not go up, and for the full year, we're pretty flat on G&A."

And this is the percentage over the business I'd do in that,"" what I said is a lot of that business actually reduced tremendously for us in 2015. And so I don't have the exact number, maybe Alicia has it, but I think we did not do a lot of production in REITs. And it wasn't necessarily in that production. We did a lot in the qualified area. But she can give you the numbers on it. So what I said is, they were identifying a little more of that if that went away. We say, looking and reading the DOL's proposal before all the commentary, there are a number of things that are going to be affected. The question is, they also said that they would allow for certain business to be done under a ""best interest exemption"" standard that you would apply for and you would absolutely adhere to and you will disclose on, et cetera. Depending on what they finalize there will depend on whether you can continue to do a lot of the business you're currently doing today under greater disclosure and a contract and et cetera et cetera; or that that would have to be adjusted to more of a fee-based type of basis, in which case you would have to figure out with those clients -- whether it's appropriate to move. So I can't give you what that would look like yet until I know it. What I'm saying is, there are different ways that we think that we can manage and lead the business through if those exceptions are there and if you are able to execute appropriately against them. And if not, there are some alternatives. Part of the activity would be do you serve some of the smaller accounts? Again, smaller accounts are a little more costly, so part of that is you've got to look at your business model appropriately in that regard. So I don't have a perfect answer to you. That's all I said, is it will have an effect on the industry. It will increase some costs. The question is what do you do over time, and can you offset some of that? And on the revenue side, again I think there are some alternatives, but I don't know until the final rule. And if the final rule says you can't do certain business or a certain business has to be done at a certain rate, then there will be some adjustments there, part coming from the adviser, part from the firm."

Clearly, it was a difficult market environment for the industry. Volatility was high with significant declines in the average equity markets during the quarter. 
Our internal index that aligns to our assets under management characteristics was down 8% on average year-over-year and 6% on average sequentially, which impacted client activity, assets under management and fees given we bill through the quarter. 
Total assets under management and administration ended the quarter at $773 billion. 
Across the firm, we focus on executing our existing strategy and managing expenses as we invest in the business and navigate these conditions. 
With regard to our financial results for the quarter, on an operating basis, revenues reflected a tougher environment and were down 4% to $2.8 billion, earnings per share were relatively flat at $2.17, and our return on equity ex-AOCI remains very strong at 24.2%, up 110 basis points from a year ago. 
Because of our ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow, we were able to return to shareholders at a significant level while maintaining our excellent capital position. 
During the quarter, we nearly doubled the number of shares we repurchased from a year ago to 5.1 million shares. 
In total, we returned about 150% of our earnings to shareholders. 
And yesterday, we added to our regular quarterly dividend announcing a 12% increase, the ninth increase over the last 7 years. 
Very few financial services companies are generating our level of return on equity and capital return. And core to our long-term approach, our financial foundation remains in excellent shape enabling us to consistently invest in the business and return capital to shareholders in a meaningful way. 
Let's move to an overview of the business in the quarter. 
In Advice & Wealth Management, we have a strong business and a significant and growing opportunity to serve more consumers with advice. The strength of our advice value proposition is how we help people navigate environments like this and help them to plan for their long-term needs and goals. 
Ameriprise is well positioned to help our clients and investors address the full spectrum of their needs across market cycles and their lifetimes. 
The strength of the Ameriprise brand and our reputation is an important differentiator. We're back on the air with our successful Be Brilliant advertising. Consumers, advisors and employee reaction remains very positive. As a result, Ameriprise brand awareness hit an all-time high in the quarter. Delivering strong client service is key to our reputation and how we run the business. 
I was pleased to see in a recent industry survey, Ameriprise ranked fifth out of 20 full-service firms overall investor satisfaction. 
In terms of client assets under management, overall client assets remain strong at $451 billion. The market volatility in the quarter continued to affect investor behavior and clients remain conservative. 
Cash balances remain elevated at $23 billion, and we had solid flows into fee-based investment advisory where we have one of the largest platforms. 
I'm feeling good about the strength of our field force. The Ameriprise value proposition and culture is attractive to our advisors and in the industry. We continue to maintain very good advisor satisfaction and retention. And another 70 experienced advisors joined Ameriprise in the quarter, and our pipeline going forward looks good. 
Overall given market pressures, advisors maintain good productivity at $510,000 on a 12-month basis. 
And in the current environment, comprehensive advice and our confident retirement approach resonates strongly. 
Our extensive consumer research confirms that advice is what clients in our target market are seeking and they're not getting it from their current financial services provider, so we're focused on this opportunity. 
This also extends to younger generations as many are looking to work with an advisor who will meet with them personally, reinforcing the value of the human perspective and personal interaction when saving and investing. 
With the volatility earlier in the quarter, we increased our market commentary and communications for the field to equip advisors to have meaningful conversations with their clients. 
Overall, we're delivering good profitability with margins of 17.1% in the quarter, up 50 basis points on a sequential basis. 
We remain well positioned in the marketplace to take advantage of the opportunity for further growth as conditions settle. 
Let's move to annuities and protection. In terms of annuities, we have a consistent story. We continue to see good solid sales of our variable annuity products, which are appropriate solutions for clients to meet their long-term goals. 
While we're experiencing outflows, it primarily reflects our close third-party book. And in fixed annuities, the level of outflows has slowed in recent quarters. 
Overall, though, the book is performing as expected in this low rate environment. 
Annuities and their unique benefits are integrated within our Confident Retirement framework. I feel good about how we're managing the business, developing and enhancing our competitive products and features while managing risk. 
Within protection, in Life & Health our UL products have been our sales leaders of late, becoming a larger portion of our balance book with VUL. 
Claims experienced in the quarter was also within our expectations. Overall, we have a good book and we're working with our advisors to serve clients protection needs. 
And in Auto & Home, we're making good progress as we enhance our pricing, underwriting and claims management. 
Our improved results were masked a bit in the quarter due to higher CAT losses, which we preannounced. 
In Asset Management, we're executing our strategy focused on gaining market share and generating profitable net flows. 
Similar to our wealth management business in Asset Management, the market declines during the quarter challenged flows in assets under management. 
We ended the quarter with assets under management at $464 billion. Investment performance remains quite strong. We have a broad portfolio of strong performing equity and fixed-income products, and I was pleased to see Colombia funds were recognized with Lipper Fund Awards in 2016. 
Overall, outflows were $7.5 billion in the quarter, but [ph] $5.8 billion of the outflows were in lower fee portfolios or areas we've highlighted. 
Fixed income IMAs at U.S. Trust, which is a continuation of our fourth quarter outflows as U.S. Trust has taken a portion of this business back in-house. 
Former parent and other insurance portfolios in the U.K. and in sub advised funds where we had ended the relationship and are merging assets into existing Columbia funds, importantly, there's very little revenue impact to this move. 
Outflows also include a single large institutional client who has again redeemed for liquidity purposes. 
Overall, though, there are positive themes across the business. 
Let me start with third-party institutional. We're continuing to see good interest in a number of our strategies, including high yield. We're winning mandates across our key regions of the U.S., Europe and Asia. That includes in Korea where we've opened an office last year. Our new business pipeline remains healthy, and we expect to see the one not funded mandates come through later in the year. 
In terms of retail, in the U.S., it was a particularly challenging January, but net sales improved in February and again in March. We made meaningful market share gains over the past year at nearly all the major players in the broker dealer and the independent channels and at a time when gross sales for the industry are down. 
With regard to the Acorn Fund, outflows have slowed. And if industry flows pick up in the U.S., we expect to build on these positive trends. 
With regard to retail flows in Europe, we're continuing to reinforce our strong presence in the U.K. and serve more clients in key markets on the continent, including in Germany, Italy and Spain. 
European retail net flows in the quarter was similar to the U.S., but they picked up nicely to end the quarter almost slightly negative. 
As we've said before, U.K. and European retail sentiment can turn quickly with the markets, and that has been true in recent weeks as markets have rallied. 
So overall, we are comfortable with the performance of the business. And a challenging market remain focused on providing important perspective to investors and delivering competitive performance. 
There are positive themes within our flow trends that are consistent with the strategy we're executing. 
As I look at the company overall, we have a good combination of businesses and people to continue to execute the strategy we have in place. Our diversified business generates good earnings and strong free cash flow that we reinvest in the business return to shareholders. 
Our return on equity remains strong and is one of the strongest across financial services. And I feel good about our ability to continue to navigate the market and consistently generate shareholder value. 
Now let me turn to the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule that came out a few weeks ago. As America's leader in financial planning, we take our fiduciary responsibility very seriously and put our client's interest first. 
As you know, while the government remove some of the more onerous elements of the initial rule, what remains is a rule that is comprehensive and complex. It's hundreds of pages long and it's a principal-based regulation that requires very detailed analysis. 
Clearly, it will require a changed agenda for firms across the industry to execute it and be compliant within the timeframe provided. We will take the time necessary to understand it and get it right. It wouldn't be prudent to try to oversimplify the rule for you today. But I know you have questions. And based on what we understand today, we believe that the impacts will be manageable. We're operating from a position of strength. We have the experience and the capabilities that will allow us to adopt and comply with the new rule. 
Consistent with our financial planning leadership, we are one of the largest providers of fee-based investment advice. And as I mentioned, we already operate as a fiduciary under the very high standard of care. 
We also benefit from investments we've made to establish a strong compliance foundation, including our infrastructure, policies, supervision and disclosures. 
Underpinning all of this, our clients and advisors are highly satisfied with the experience we provide. We have a proven track record of navigating through change, and we'll build on that experience, enhancing our processes and capabilities where necessary to effectively comply with the new DOL rule. 
With regard to some products you had questions about, we are confident that our advisors will still be able to recommend the products that they do today in qualified accounts, including annuities and affiliated products, which are expressly permitted under the rule. In short, we will continue to offer a full solution set. 
Today, we apply a rigorous degree of review and due diligence to the products we offer, and we have extensive disclosures in place. 
And while there will likely be additional disclosures and documentation required going forward, based on what we know at this time, we believe that these requirements will be manageable. And while we cannot predict client advisor behavior and response to the rule, our business model has proven to be adaptable. We can make adjustments prudently to respond to the evolving market environment. 
Yes, there will be added cost that we will address through expense reengineering and other means to position the firm for continued growth and margin expansion over the long term. 
I should also note that during this period of disruption, we see potential opportunities. For example, the regulatory environment will likely lead to consolidation within the industry, which we've already seen. Independent advisors or independent broker dealers may lack the resources or the scale to navigate the changes required and seek a strong partner like Ameriprise. 
The financial foundation we've built allows us to remain opportunistic while also making the necessary investments to comply with the rule. 
So in closing, this is a large changed agenda for the industry. And at a high level, given what we know, we feel very comfortable that we can effectively navigate through it and we'll keep you apprised as we move forward. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Walter to take you through the numbers for the quarter."

Ameriprise delivered solid results in the quarter despite market disruptions. However, we successfully navigated these conditions, and results in the quarter were overall quite good, as well as within each of the business segments. 
We continue to believe our stock is undervalued, which you can see by the elevated level of repurchase in the quarter. 
Our capacity of buyback stock remains strong given our balance sheet fundamentals, and our business mix generates strong free cash flow. We are committed to maintaining a differentiated level of capital return. 
Let's turn to Slide 4. Macro conditions impacted revenue in a few ways. Our weighted equity index, the proxy for equity market movements on AUM declined 8% on average year-over-year and 6% on average sequentially. This affected average AUM and thereby fees, which we collected based upon average daily assets. 
Continued dislocation also muted client activity and contributed to Asset Management outflows. Sequential results demonstrated a similar dynamic from a market and flows perspective. 
The last quarter had strong asset management performance fees and a CDO liquidation. Low interest rates remained a headwind for our insurance and annuity businesses, and foreign exchange translations impacted asset levels and earnings. This is an industry-wide trend felt across financial services companies. 
Let's turn to Slide 5. Ameriprise delivered stable earnings per share and continued return on equity expansion in a challenging revenue environment. This clearly demonstrated our ability to navigate across business cycles using the multiple strong levers in our business model. 
Our business model generates significant free cash flow, and our valuation allowed us to opportunistically repurchase stock at this depressed level. 
Additionally, we are telling management expenses were making the right investments to address regulatory changes and grow. We initiated an additional expense reengineering assessment in the quarter and identified good opportunities for the balance of the year. 
This way, if market disruptions persist, we'll be able to effectively manage our margins. 
Let's turn to segment performance, starting with AWM on Slide 6. The Advice & Wealth Management business continues to perform well, delivering solid results. Leading indicators for the business were good. We brought in 70 [ph] experienced advisors in the quarter, and the advisors we've on boarded over the past 12 to 24 months are ramping up nicely. 
Our advisor retention was also strong at over 90% in both channels. Product flows were solid for this environment with $1.8 billion of wrap net inflows. 
Operating net revenues was $1.2 billion in the quarter, down almost 3% from last year, driven by market dislocation even after the benefit of the increase in the fed funds rate in December. 
The market dislocation impacted PTI in a similar manner. 
Operating margin in the quarter was strong at 17.1%, up 50 basis points sequentially. 
Outside of significant market disruption, we expect future margin expansion to continue over time. 
Asset Management continues to provide a solid contribution to our revenue and earnings, as you'll see on Slide 7. 
Clearly, we faced 2 external headwinds in the quarter. First, the average WEI, down 8% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. And second, foreign exchange translation was unfavorable. These impacted both revenue and pretax operating earnings. 
Operating net revenue was down 10% to $724 million. Over 50% of the decline was related to markets and foreign exchange, with the balance largely related to the cumulative impact of net outflow. 
Pretax operating earnings were down 22% to $149 million, with over 60% of the decline related to markets and FX. 
We are prudently managing expenses with overall expenses down 7% and G&A down 3%. The results in the quarter were in line with our expectations in this environment. 
However, we began additional expense management actions in the quarter and have the capacity to further reduce expenses to support margin improvement. 
Turning to annuities on Slide 8. The segment is performing in line with our expectations. Variable annuity pretax operating earnings were $100 million, down from $144 million a year ago. This business was also impacted by market dislocation in the quarter, both in terms of the direct impact on account values and lower asset earning rate as well as the impact on DAC and DSIC and SOP reserves. This non-cash impact was about 60% [ph] of the decline in the quarter. 
The underlying business is solid and the risk are well-managed. 
Fixed annuity pretax operating earnings declined to $24 million due to the elevated lapses as the blocks run off. The earnings in the quarter also benefited from a couple of million dollars of onetime items. 
Given the current interest rate environment, there are limited new sales. And as a result, this book is expected to gradually run off and earnings will trend down during the year. 
Turning to the protection segment on next slide. Pretax operating earnings were $69 million in the quarter. Let's focus on Life & Health first, which is in line with expectations. 
Pretax operating earnings benefited from stable claims experience and the recapture of a reinsurance treaty, but continues to be pressured by low interest rates. 
Our Auto & Hom was certainly impacted by elevated CAT losses in the quarter. We were pleased to see early indications of improvement in the underlying loss trends in the operating results. The changes we have been making to enhance pricing, underwriting, claims and operations are taking hold. 
New business is moderated in targeted areas as a result of prudent rate taking and additional underwriting discipline. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Slide 10. As we have told you before, Ameriprise maintains a strong balance sheet that we'll use opportunistically. In the quarter, we returned 150% of operating earnings to shareholders at the dividends and share repurchase. 
We repurchased 5.1 million shares in the quarter, almost double the number of shares repurchased a year ago. 
Additionally, we announced a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend of [ph] $0.75 per share. 
Our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong. We have more than $2 billion of excess capital and an RBC ratio of approximately 550%. 
Our hedging program is working well. And the investment portfolio is diversified. 
We feel good about our energy exposure, and it was in a net unrealized gain position at the end of the quarter. 
Our strategy is consistent and we are well positioned to navigate challenging environments using the various levers to continue to deliver excellent results. 
With that, we will take your questions."

This would be no difference in the sense of let's say we're offering 1 mutual fund versus the other in compensation differences or anything like that, which we do today.

And even if you look at annuities today, we do a very detailed review before every any annuity is sold, whether in the qualified or in the nonqualified, to ensure that it meets the standards appropriate in regard to that there are real appropriate benefits that are right solutions for the client versus alternatives, and we will carry that into what we do here moving forward.

I doubt very much that a small broker dealer or even independents in general or advisors on their own are going to have means by which they can navigate this, both from a legal, a regulatory compliance, a technology, a support, a servicing, an education, a training, we have mobilized our field resources, the company resources. We're going to be doing extensive training where technology is underway. So we have the ability to do this, and we will. And it's not just incremental costs.

In the first quarter, we incurred a couple of million dollars as it relates to it. But again, that's in the context of the original publication on the regulation, which was a lot of comprehensive in the timeframes a lot more compressed.

And obviously, that would, we believe, result in with the gated timeframes and less basic change factors that we're assessing at this stage we believe are there. That number will be adjusted.

We sell a combination of funds and share classes today for different reasons. We're doing 2 things.

And those funds still which 12B1s are appropriate and again, it's typical that you would have to evaluate because everything moving into an investment advisory is not necessarily a right as appropriate even from the SEC's perspective and the BIC does allow it. Second, regarding our various activities and platforms, we are actually and we've been underway for this for last year and a half before this even occurred to actually build our lifetime account infrastructure. And what that will allow us to do is, of course, all the various platforms in our investment advisory that we can have one seamless way of operating, and therefore, we can actually as the various share classes are introduced appropriately move and migrate and are -- will give our advisors the ability to use the most appropriate and for the type of investment that's out in the marketplace. And so we're migrating that, anyway. We think that's appropriate longer term. And based on our ability to do that would satisfy the DOL's regulation of what they're looking for from a fee and a leveling and transparency. So that's underway, and that's a very large investment.

Within that, we also -- within qualified, have a very large substantial business and investment advisory, and Columbia is part of that as they are in individual sales for a transaction on the brokerage side, but it's no more in qualified than it is across the house per se. And the percentage is small. So if you look at what make go on within the BIC side of it or a transaction side of it, you're talking about low mid-single digits. And so it's not that substantial -- is not different than other large providers in our system. And again, Columbia has some excellent product with excellent performance and the fees are below average in general. Then when you take -- just because the next question whether from you or somebody else will be annuities and similar, so let me answer that one for you. Annuities is only in -- roughly in the qualified business of the total sales we do of across the Ameriprise family here within the Wealth Management is only in the mid-single digits. So if all annuities went away from -- what we're talking about mid-single digits of sales, but it's not going to occur because based on the reviews we do today and how substantial they are in preclearance, we think that will continue. Now could some of it -- could some of the shift, the next question, from an upfront load to a level load? Yes, we have the ability to do that. Those products are there. So if the advisors says you wanted to ship some behavior and just one of upfront load, they have the ability to just like on the reps to the level load. And so to our perspective, we don't think there's a substantial. And even the changes by a few percent, I guess I heard from many of you over the times as why am I in the annuity business? Or so if it shifted away, I'll just go into investment advisory and I'll still generate good profitability and good margins. So we're not concerned. We like the solution of the annuities because it fits a solution set for Confident Retirement and longevity of income, and that need will still be there and our advisors will still determine appropriately whether it fits. So whether it's Columbia product or it's annuities as an example, we think there is a critical need. Columbia has excellent product we don't sell it differently. We don't pay differently. So we actually believe that -- and the BIC does allow for it. So if we didn't have what we had in place, the due diligence, the disclosures, the review processes, appropriate compensation, we would probably have a different concern, but we don't in this case. But again, we will adjust. And if there is a migration in anything, we have different alternatives and we make those adjustments. And I think from a perspective, we'll be in good shape."

It requires a higher level of analysis, documentations and disclosures to determine that it's in the best interest of the client. And today, we do something very similar. Rollovers are now considered part of the fiduciary advice. So formally, it's required that you do a number of things necessary to truly show what that is and it builds upon, for us, what we already have in place is very strong comprehensive rollover education and disclosure materials. And we think those and whatever we need to enhance to them would meet some of the things, but that review process would be necessary. We have a program in place called Leave It or Roll It Over Already, which evaluates the various options for retirement plan assets. And we're going to enhance those where appropriate. But I would say that the rule does not prohibit it, but it does make sure that you're analyzing appropriately to make sure that that is appropriately for the client for a number of reasons. And again, I think that is some of the things that we do today and will continue to do and if that enhances, we'll be able to accommodate. Once that the longer-term to behavior, I can't sit here. As I said, I can't predict what happens longer term and why, but I would say that the client needs the ability to determine whether they should be managing the assets differently. They should consolidate them. They should develop the various ways of getting streams of income, whether the plan does provide that to them or not, those are all things that will have to be evaluated on an individual basis."

Since the rule came out, what it said is that the period was extended a bit and it was less onerous for some of the requirements, particularly that you would have to do with calculations and data and are all that stuff. So as we now look at it, some of the incremental that we thought would either ramp up a lot more is not going to be as necessary. But the expenses we're talking about are incremental. As I said, internally, particularly in AWM, but in other places in the company, we are redeploying significant resources that is within the AWM expense base. So even though we've tightened expenses, we could have probably to tighten a bit more, but we're now ensuring that we do that. But I would consider that more of a redeployment rather than an incremental. There will be some more incremental. Walter is working on what that would look like and we'll give it to you in the second quarter. But as we said, a lot of it will be from redeploying what we do."

We think that some other people will be impacted a lot or in general, of course, the industry. So I would just say is we will be impacted. There's no doubt about it. This will cause a level of disruption change, a focus on moving and migrating where necessary, changing people's behavior a bit, but we will get that done. Now what that will probably mean is there'll be some adjustment and whether there'll be cost or revenue in some fashion over a number of periods, but it will work its way through. I would not say that it would be significant, that's why we say it's manageable, but I can't say it will be anything. So longer term, we do feel that we have good value proposition. There's a real need for our services. We will put in place the necessary things appropriately to help our advisors continue to build their business. And with that, we will get back on track to the margins that we said we were targeting, but more important than the margins, the growth of the business. And from the growth of the business, the margins will occur. So I can't sit here and tell you that no, we've changed the strategy. We haven't. And I can't say that we see something that would take us off of our costs longer term, but I could probably say that maybe just a seamless idea that you're going to continue to do everything in the next periods where that's not going to translate to some change I can say that at all. Longer term, we'll see what happens. But this is an environment that has changed. But Ameriprise has the capability. We have a good value proposition, good foundation, and that's the way we're going to navigate. So I'm not here to give you a perfect science. What I'm telling you is we're not falling off a cliff. We're in good shape. We have the means. We have the ability. We are -- we have great client satisfaction.

Clearly, it was a difficult market environment for the industry. Volatility was high with significant declines in the average equity markets during the quarter. Our internal index that aligns to our assets under management characteristics was down 8% on average year-over-year and 6% on average sequentially, which impacted client activity, assets under management and fees given we bill through the quarter. Total assets under management and administration ended the quarter at $773 billion. Across the firm, we're focused on executing our existing strategy and managing expenses as we invest in the business and navigate these conditions. 
With regard to our financial results for the quarter, on an operating basis, revenues reflected a tougher environment and were down 4% to $2.8 billion, earnings per share were relatively flat at $2.17, and our return on equity ex-AOCI remains very strong at 24.2%, up 110 basis points from a year ago. Because of our ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow, we were able to return to shareholders at a significant level while maintaining our excellent capital position. During the quarter, we nearly doubled the number of shares we repurchased from a year ago to 5.1 million shares. In total, we returned about 150% of our earnings to shareholders. 
And yesterday, we added to our regular quarterly dividend announcing a 12% increase, the ninth increase over the past 7 years. Very few financial services companies are generating our level of return on equity and capital return. And core to our long-term approach, our financial foundation remains in excellent shape enabling us to consistently invest in the business and return capital to shareholders in a meaningful way. 
Let's move to an overview of the business in the quarter. In Advice & Wealth Management, we have a strong business and a significant and growing opportunity to serve more consumers with advice. The strength of our advice value proposition is how we help people navigate environments like this and help them to plan for their long-term needs and goals.  Ameriprise is well positioned to help our clients and investors address the full spectrum of their needs across market cycles and their lifetimes. The strength of the Ameriprise brand and our reputation is an important differentiator. We're back on the air with our successful Be Brilliant advertising. Consumers, advisers and employee reaction remains very positive. As a result, Ameriprise brand awareness hit an all-time high in the quarter. 
Delivering strong client service is key to our reputation and how we run the business. I was pleased to see in a recent industry survey, Ameriprise ranked fifth out of 20 full-service firms for overall investor satisfaction. In terms of client assets under management, overall client assets remained strong at $451 billion. The market volatility in the quarter continued to affect investor behavior and clients remain conservative.  Cash balances remain elevated at $23 billion and we had solid flows into fee-based investment advisory where we have one of the largest platforms. 
I'm feeling good about the strength of our field force. The Ameriprise value proposition and culture is attractive to our advisers and in the industry. We continue to maintain very good adviser satisfaction and retention. And another 70 experienced advisers joined Ameriprise in the quarter and our pipeline going forward looks good.  Overall given market pressures, advisers maintain good productivity at $510,000 on a 12-month basis.  
And in the current environment, comprehensive advice and our confident retirement approach resonates strongly. Our extensive consumer research confirms that advice is what clients in our target market are seeking and they're not getting it from their current financial services provider, so we're focused on this opportunity. This also extends to younger generations as many are looking to work with an adviser who will meet with them personally, reinforcing the value of the human perspective and personal interaction when saving and investing. 
With the volatility earlier in the quarter, we increased our market commentary and communications for the field to equip advisers to have meaningful conversations with their clients. Overall, we're delivering good profitability with margins of 17.1% in the quarter, up 50 basis points on a sequential basis. We remain well positioned in the marketplace to take advantage of the opportunity for further growth as conditions settle. 
Let's move to annuities and protection. In terms of annuities, we have a consistent story. We continue to see good solid sales to our variable annuity products which are appropriate solutions for clients to meet their long-term goals. While we're experiencing outflows, it primarily reflects our close third-party book. 
And in fixed annuities, the level of outflows has slowed in recent quarters.  Overall, though, the book is performing as expected in this low rate environment. Annuities and their unique benefits are integrated within our Confident Retirement framework. I feel good about how we're managing the business, developing and enhancing our competitive products and features while managing risk. 
Within Protection and Life and Health, our UL products have been our sales leaders of late, becoming a larger portion of our balance book with VUL. Claims experienced in the quarter was also within our expectations. Overall, we have a good book and we're working with our advisers to serve clients protection needs. And in Auto and Home, we're making good progress as we enhance our pricing, underwriting and claims management. Our improved results were masked a bit in the quarter due to higher cat losses, which we preannounced. 
In Asset Management, we're executing our strategy focused on gaining market share and generating profitable net flows. Similar to our Wealth Management business, in Asset Management, the market declines during the quarter challenged flows and assets under management. We ended the quarter with assets under management at $464 billion. Investment performance remains quite strong. We have a broad portfolio of strong performing equity and fixed-income products, and I was pleased to see 5 of our Colombia funds were recognized with Lipper Fund Awards in 2016. 
Overall, outflows were $7.5 billion in the quarter, but $5.8 billion of the outflows were in lower fee portfolios or areas we've highlighted: Fixed income IMAs at U.S. Trust, which is a continuation of our fourth quarter outflows as U.S. Trust has taken a portion of this business back in-house; former parent and other insurance portfolios in the U.K. and in sub-advised funds where we had ended the relationship and are merging assets into existing Columbia funds. Importantly, there's very little revenue impact to this move. Outflows also include a single large institutional client who has again redeemed for liquidity purposes. Overall, though, there are positive themes across the business. 
Let me start with third-party institutional. We're continuing to see good interest in a number of our strategies, including high yield. We're winning mandates across our key regions of the U.S., Europe and Asia. That includes in Korea where we've opened an office last year. Our new business pipeline remains healthy and we expect to see the one not-funded mandates come through later in the year. 
In terms of retail, in the U.S., it was a particularly challenging January, but net sales improved in February and again in March. We made meaningful market share gains over the past year at nearly all the major players in the broker-dealer and the independent channels, and at a time when gross sales for the industry are down. With regard to the Acorn Fund, outflows have slowed. And if industry flows pick up in the U.S., we expect to build on these positive trends. 
With regard to retail flows in Europe, we're continuing to reinforce our strong presence in the U.K. and serve more clients in key markets on the continent, including in Germany, Italy and Spain.  European retail net flows in the quarter were similar to the U.S., but they picked up nicely to end the quarter almost slightly negative. As we've said before, U.K. and European retail sentiment can turn quickly with the markets. And that has been true in recent weeks as markets have rallied. 
So overall, we are comfortable with the performance of the business. In a challenging market, remain focused on providing important perspective to investors and delivering competitive performance.  There are positive themes within our flow trends that are consistent with the strategy we're executing. 
As I look at the company overall, we have a good combination of businesses and people to continue to execute the strategy we have in place. Our diversified business generates good earnings and strong free cash flow that we reinvest in the business and return to shareholders. Our return on equity remains strong and is one of the strongest across financial services. And I feel good about our ability to continue to navigate the market and consistently generate shareholder value. 
Now let me turn to the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule that came out a few weeks ago. As America's leader in financial planning, we take our fiduciary responsibility very seriously and put our client's interest first. As you know, while the government removed some of the more onerous elements of the initial rule, what remains is a rule that is comprehensive and complex. It's hundreds of pages long and it's a principle-based regulation that requires very detailed analysis. 
Clearly, it will require a changed agenda for firms across the industry to execute it and be compliant within the time frame provided. We will take the time necessary to understand it and get it right. It wouldn't be prudent to try to oversimplify the rule for you today, but I know you have questions. And based on what we understand today, we believe that the impacts will be manageable. We're operating from a position of strength. We have the experience and the capabilities that will allow us to adopt and comply with the new rule. 
Consistent with our financial planning leadership, we are one of the largest providers of fee-based investment advice. And as I mentioned, we already operate as a fiduciary under the very high standard of care. We also benefit from investments we've made to establish a strong compliance foundation, including our infrastructure, policies, supervision and disclosures. Underpinning all of this, our clients and advisers are highly satisfied with the experience we provide. We have a proven track record of navigating through change and we'll build on that experience enhancing our processes and capabilities where necessary to effectively comply with the new DOL rule. 
With regard to some products you had questions about, we are confident that our advisers will still be able to recommend the products that they do today in qualified accounts, including annuities and affiliated products which are expressly permitted under the rule. In short, we will continue to offer a full solution set. 
Today, we apply a rigorous degree of review and due diligence to the products we offer, and we have extensive disclosures in place. And while there will likely be additional disclosures and documentation required going forward, based on what we know at this time, we believe that these requirements will be manageable. And while we cannot predict client-adviser behavior, in response to the rule, our business model has proven to be adaptable. We can make adjustments prudently to respond to the evolving market environment. Yes, there will be added cost that we will address through expense reengineering and other means to position the firm for continued growth and margin expansion over the long term. 
I should also note that during this period of disruption, we see potential opportunities. For example, the regulatory environment will likely lead to consolidation within the industry, which we've already seen. Independent advisers or independent broker-dealers may lack the resources or the scale to navigate the changes required and seek a strong partner like Ameriprise the financial foundation we've built allows us to remain opportunistic while also making the necessary investments to comply with the rule. 
So in closing, this is a large changed agenda for the industry. And at a high level, given what we know, we feel very comfortable that we can effectively navigate through it and we'll keep you apprised as we move forward. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Walter to take you through the numbers for the quarter."

Ameriprise delivered solid results in the quarter despite market disruptions. However, we successfully navigated these conditions and results in the quarter were overall quite good, as well as within each of the business segments. We conti",1066,"Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered solid results in the quarter despite market disruptions. However, we successfully navigated these conditions and results in the quarter were overall quite good, as well as within each of the business segments. We continue to believe our stock is undervalued, which you can see by the elevated level of repurchase in the quarter. Our capacity to buy back stock remains strong given our balance sheet fundamentals and our business mix generates strong free cash flow. We are committed to maintaining a differentiated level of capital return. 
Let's turn to Slide 4. Macro conditions impacted revenue in a few ways. Our weighted equity index, the proxy for equity market movements on AUM declined 8% on average year-over-year and 6% on average, sequentially. This affected average AUM and thereby fees, which we collected based upon average daily assets. Continued dislocation also muted client activity and contributed to Asset Management outflows. 
Sequential results demonstrated a similar dynamic from a market and flows perspective. The last quarter had strong asset management performance fees and a CDO liquidation. Low interest rates remained a headwind for our insurance and annuity businesses, and foreign exchange translations impacted asset levels and earnings. This is an industry-wide trend felt across financial services companies. 
Let's turn to Slide 5. Ameriprise delivered stable earnings per share and continued return on equity expansion in a challenging revenue environment. This clearly demonstrated our ability to navigate across business cycles using the multiple strong levers in our business model. Our business model generates significant free cash flow and our valuation allowed us to opportunistically repurchase stock at this depressed level. 
Additionally, we are tightly managing expenses while making the right investments to address regulatory changes and grow. We initiated an additional expense reengineering assessment in the quarter and identified good opportunities for the balance of the year. This way, if market disruptions persist, we'll be able to effectively manage our margins. 
Let's turn to segment performance, starting with AWM on Slide 6. The Advice & Wealth Management business continues to perform well delivering solid results. Leading indicators for the business were good. We brought in 70 experienced advisers in the quarter. And the advisers we've on boarded over the past 12 to 24 months are ramping up nicely. Our adviser retention was also strong at over 90% in both channels. Product flows were solid for this environment with $1.8 billion of wrap net inflows. 
Operating net revenues was $1.2 billion in the quarter, down almost 3% from last year driven by market dislocation even after the benefit of the increase in the fed funds rate in December. The market dislocation impacted PTI in a similar manner. Operating margin in the quarter was strong at 17.1%, up 50 basis points sequentially. Outside of significant market disruption, we expect future margin expansion to continue over time. 
Asset Management continues to provide a solid contribution to our revenue and earnings, as you'll see on Slide 7. Clearly, we faced 2 external headwinds in the quarter. First, the average WEI, down 8% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. And second, foreign exchange translation was unfavorable. These impacted both revenue and pretax operating earnings. 
Operating net revenue was down 10% to $724 million. Over 50% of the decline was related to markets and foreign exchange, with the balance largely related to the cumulative impact of net outflows. Pretax operating earnings were down 22% to $149 million, with over 60% of the decline related to markets and FX. We are prudently managing expenses with overall expenses down 7% and G&A down 3%. The results in the quarter were in line with our expectations in this environment. However, we began additional expense management actions in the quarter and have the capacity to further reduce expenses to support margin improvement. 
Turning to annuities on Slide 8. The segment is performing in line with our expectations. Variable annuity pretax operating earnings were $100 million, down from $144 million a year ago. This business was also impacted by market dislocation in the quarter, both in terms of the direct impact on account values and lower asset earning rate, as well as the impact on DAC and DSIC and SOP reserves. This non-cash impact was about 60% of the decline in the quarter.  The underlying business is solid and the risk are well-managed. 
Fixed annuity pretax operating earnings declined to $24 million due to the elevated lapses as the blocks run off. The earnings in the quarter also benefited from a couple of million dollars of onetime items. Given the current interest rate environment, there are limited new sales. And as a result, this book is expected to gradually run off and earnings will trend down during the year. 
Turning to the Protection segment on next slide. Pretax operating earnings were $69 million in the quarter. Let's focus on Life and Health first, which is in line with expectations. Pretax operating earnings benefited from stable claims experience and the recapture of a reinsurance treaty, but continues to be pressured by low interest rates. 
Our Auto and Home was certainly impacted by elevated cat losses in the quarter. We were pleased to see early indications of improvement in the underlying loss trends in the operating results. The changes we have been making to enhance pricing, underwriting, claims and operations are taking hold. New business is moderated in targeted areas as a result of prudent rate taking and additional underwriting discipline. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Slide 10. As we have told you before, Ameriprise maintains a strong balance sheet that we'll use opportunistically. In the quarter, we returned 150% of operating earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. We repurchased 5.1 million shares in the quarter, almost double the number of shares repurchased a year ago. Additionally, we announced a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.75 per share. 
Our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong. We have more than $2 billion of excess capital and an RBC ratio of approximately 550%. Our hedging program is working well and the investment portfolio is diversified. We feel good about our energy exposure and it was in a net unrealized gain position at the end of the quarter. Our strategy is consistent and we are well positioned to navigate challenging environments using the various levers to continue to deliver excellent results. 
With that, we will take your questions."

And even if you look at annuities today, we do a very detailed review before every -- any annuity is sold, whether in the qualified or in the nonqualified, to ensure that it meets the standards appropriate.

I doubt very much that a small broker-dealer or even independents in general or advisers on their own are going to have the means by which they can navigate this, both from a legal, a regulatory compliance, a technology, a support, a servicing, an education, a training. We have mobilized our field resources, the company resources, we're going to be doing extensive training where technology is underway. So we have the ability to do this, and we will.

And so we're migrating that anyway and we think that's appropriate longer term.

But as I always said to you, its low double digits in total sales across qualified, n",552,"So when we look at our sales and across the business and then what goes into qualified, as we said to you before, Columbia is one of the strong providers in our channel. But as I always said to you, its low double digits in total sales across qualified, nonqualified, the whole house. Within that, we also -- within qualified, have a very large substantial business and investment advisory, and Columbia is part of that as they are in individual sales for a transaction on the brokerage side. But it's no more in qualified than it is across the house per se and the percentage is small. So if you look at what may go on within the BIC side of it or a transaction side of it, you're talking about low mid-single digits. And so it's not that substantial -- and it's not different than other large providers in our system. And again, Columbia has some excellent product with excellent performance and the fees are below average in general. Then when you take -- and I'll just -- because the next question, whether from you or somebody else, will be annuities and similar, so let me answer that one for you. Annuities is only in, roughly, in the qualified business of the total sales we do across the Ameriprise family here within the Wealth Management, is only in the mid-single digits. So if all annuities went away from -- we're talking mid-single digits of sales and -- but it's not going to occur, because based on the reviews we do today and how substantial they are in preclearance, we think that will continue. Now could some of it -- could some of it shift, the next question, from an upfront load to a level load? Yes. And we have the ability to do that, those products are there. So if the advisers, as you said, wanted to shift some behavior and didn't want to put an upfront load, they have the ability just like on the wrap to do the level load. And so to our perspective, we don't think this is substantial. And even the changes by a few percent, I guess I heard from many of you over the times as why am I in the annuity business, so if it shifted away, I'll just go into investment advisory and I'll still generate good profitability and good margins. So we're not concerned. We like the solution of the annuities because it fits a solution set for Confident Retirement and longevity of income and that need will still be there, and our advisers will still determine appropriately whether it fits. So whether it's Columbia product or it's annuities, as an example, we think there is a critical need. Columbia has excellent product. We don't sell it differently. We don't pay differently. So we actually believe that -- and the BIC does allow for it, so if we didn't have what we had in place, the due diligence, the disclosures, the review processes, appropriate compensation, we would probably have a different concern, but we don't in this case. But again, we will adjust. And if there is a migration in anything, we have different alternatives and we make those adjustments. And I think, from a perspective, we'll be in good shape."

It requires a higher level of analysis, documentation and disclosures to determine that it's in the best interest of the client. And today, we do something very similar. Rollovers are now considered part of the fiduciary advice. So formally, it's required that you do a number of things necessary to truly show what that is and it builds upon, for us, what we already have in place is a very strong comprehensive rollover education and disclosure materials. And we think those, whatever we need to enhance to them, would meet some of the things but that review process would be necessary. We have a program in place called leave it or roll it over already which evaluates the various options for retirement plan assets, and we're going to enhance those where appropriate. But I would say that the rule does not prohibit it, but it does make sure that you're analyzing appropriately to make sure that that is appropriate for the client for a number of reasons. And again, I think that is some of the things that we do today and will continue to do and if that enhances, we'll be able to accommodate. What that does longer term to behavior, I can't sit here, as I said, I can't predict what happens longer term and why. But I would say that the client needs the ability to determine whether they should be managing the assets differently, they should consolidate them, they should develop the various ways of getting streams of income, whether the plan does provide that to them or not, those are all things that would have to be evaluated on an individual basis."

Since the rule came out, what it said is that the period was extended a bit and it was less onerous for some of the requirements particularly that you would have to do with calculations and data and all that stuff. So as we now look at it, some of the incremental that we thought would either ramp-up a lot more is not going to be as necessary. But the expenses we're talking about are incremental. As I said, internally, particularly in AWM, but in other places in the company, we are redeploying significant resources that is within the AWM's expense base. So even though we've tightened expenses, we could have probably tightened them a bit more, but we're now ensuring that we do that. But I would consider that more of a redeployment rather than an incremental. There will be some more incremental, Walter is working on what that would look like and we'll give it to you in the second quarter, but as we said a lot of it will be from redeploying what we do."

This will cause a level of disruption change, a focus on moving and migrating where necessary, changing people's behavior a bit, but we will get that done. Now what that would probably mean is there will be some adjustment and whether there will be cost or revenue in some fashion over the number of periods, but it will work its way through. I would not say that it would be significant, that's why we say manageable, but I can't say it won't be anything. Longer term, we do feel that we have good value proposition. There's a real need for our services. We will put in place the necessary things appropriately to help our advisers continue to build their businesses. And with that, we will get back on track to the margins that we said we were targeting, but more important than the margins, the growth of the business.

Clearly, it was a difficult market environment for the industry. Volatility was high with significant declines in the average equity markets during the quarter. Our internal index that aligns to our assets under management characteristics was down 8% on average year-over-year and 6% on average sequentially, which impacted client activity, assets under management and fees, given we billed through the quarter. Total assets under management and administration ended the quarter at $773 billion. Across the firm, we're focused on executing our existing strategy and managing expenses as we invest in the business and navigate these conditions. 
With regard to our financial results for the quarter, on an operating basis, revenues reflected the tougher environment and were down 4% to $2.8 billion, earnings per share were relatively flat at $2.17, and our return on equity ex AOCI remains very strong at 24.2%, up 110 basis points from a year ago. Because of our ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow, we were able to return to shareholders at a significant level while maintaining our excellent capital position. During the quarter, we nearly doubled the number of shares we repurchased from a year ago to 5.1 million shares. In total, we returned about 150% of our earnings to shareholders. 
And yesterday, we added to our regular quarterly dividend announcing a 12% increase, the ninth increase over the past 7 years. Very few financial services companies are generating our level of return on equity and capital return. And core to our long-term approach, our financial foundation remains in excellent shape enabling us to consistently invest in the business and return capital to shareholders in a meaningful way. 
Let's move to an overview of the business in the quarter. In Advice & Wealth Management, we have a strong business and a significant and growing opportunity to serve more consumers with advice. The strength of our advice value proposition is how we help people navigate environments like this and help them to plan for their long-term needs and goals.  Ameriprise is well positioned to help our clients and investors address the full spectrum of their needs across market cycles and their lifetimes. The strength of the Ameriprise brand and our reputation is an important differentiator. We're back on the air with our successful Be Brilliant advertising. Consumers, advisers and employee reaction remains very positive. As a result, Ameriprise brand awareness hit an all-time high in the quarter. 
Delivering strong client service is key to our reputation and how we run the business. I was pleased to see in a recent industry survey, Ameriprise ranked fifth out of 20 full-service firms for overall investor satisfaction. In terms of client assets under management, overall client assets remained strong at $451 billion. The market volatility in the quarter continued to affect investor behavior and clients remain conservative.  Cash balances remain elevated at $23 billion and we had solid flows into fee-based investment advisory where we have one of the largest platforms. 
I'm feeling good about the strength of our field force. The Ameriprise value proposition and culture is attractive to our advisers and in the industry. We continue to maintain very good adviser satisfaction and retention. And another 70 experienced advisers joined Ameriprise in the quarter and our pipeline going forward looks good.  Overall given market pressures, advisers maintain good productivity at $510,000 on a 12-month basis.  
And in the current environment, comprehensive advice and our confident retirement approach resonates strongly. Our extensive consumer research confirms that advice is what clients in our target market are seeking and they're not getting it from their current financial services provider, so we're focused on this opportunity. This also extends to younger generations as many are looking to work with an adviser who will meet with them personally, reinforcing the value of the human perspective and personal interaction when saving and investing. 
With the volatility earlier in the quarter, we increased our market commentary and communications for the field to equip advisers to have meaningful conversations with their clients. Overall, we're delivering good profitability with margins of 17.1% in the quarter, up 50 basis points on a sequential basis. We remain well positioned in the marketplace to take advantage of the opportunity for further growth as conditions settle. 
Let's move to annuities and protection. In terms of annuities, we have a consistent story. We continue to see good solid sales of our variable annuity products which are appropriate solutions for clients to meet their long-term goals. While we're experiencing outflows, it primarily reflects our close third-party book. 
And in fixed annuities, the level of outflows has slowed in recent quarters.  Overall, though, the book is performing as expected in this low rate environment. Annuities and their unique benefits are integrated within our Confident Retirement framework. I feel good about how we're managing the business, developing and enhancing our competitive products and features while managing risk. 
Within Protection and Life and Health, our UL products have been our sales leaders of late, becoming a larger portion of our balance book with VUL. Claims experienced in the quarter was also within our expectations. Overall, we have a good book and we're working with our advisers to serve clients protection needs. And in Auto and Home, we're making good progress as we enhance our pricing, underwriting and claims management. Our improved results were masked a bit in the quarter due to higher cat losses, which we preannounced. 
In Asset Management, we're executing our strategy focused on gaining market share and generating profitable net flows. Similar to our Wealth Management business,  in Asset Management the market declines during the quarter challenged flows and assets under management. We ended the quarter with assets under management at $464 billion. Investment performance remains quite strong. We have a broad portfolio of strong performing equity and fixed-income products, and I was pleased to see 5 of our Colombia funds were recognized with Lipper Fund Awards in 2016. 
Overall, outflows were $7.5 billion in the quarter, but $5.8 billion of the outflows were in lower fee portfolios or areas we've highlighted: fixed income IMAs at U.S. Trust, which is a continuation of our fourth quarter outflows as U.S. Trust has taken a portion of this business back in-house; former parent and other insurance portfolios in the U.K.; and in sub-advised funds where we had ended the relationship and are merging assets into existing Columbia funds. Importantly, there's very little revenue impact to this move. Outflows also include a single large institutional client who has again redeemed for liquidity purposes. Overall, though, there are positive themes across the business. 
Let me start with third-party institutional. We're continuing to see good interest in a number of our strategies, including high yield. We're winning mandates across our key regions of the U.S., Europe and Asia. That includes in Korea where we've opened an office last year. Our new business pipeline remains healthy and we expect to see the won-not-funded mandates come through later in the year. 
In terms of retail, in the U.S., it was a particularly challenging January, but net sales improved in February and again in March. We made meaningful market share gains over the past year at nearly all the major players in the broker-dealer and the independent channels, and at a time when gross sales for the industry are down. With regard to the Acorn Fund, outflows have slowed. And if industry flows pick up in the U.S., we expect to build on these positive trends. 
With regard to retail flows in Europe, we're continuing to reinforce our strong presence in the U.K. and serve more clients in key markets on the continent, including in Germany, Italy and Spain.  European retail net flows in the quarter were similar to the U.S., but they picked up nicely to end the quarter only slightly negative. As we've said before, U.K. and European retail sentiment can turn quickly with the markets. And that has been true in recent weeks as markets have rallied. 
So overall, we are comfortable with the performance of the business. In a challenging market, we remain focused on providing important perspective to investors and delivering competitive performance.  There are positive themes within our flow trends that are consistent with the strategy we're executing. 
As I look at the company overall, we have a good combination of businesses and people to continue to execute the strategy we have in place. Our diversified business generates good earnings and strong free cash flow that we reinvest in the business and return to shareholders. Our return on equity remains strong and is one of the strongest across financial services. And I feel good about our ability to continue to navigate the market and consistently generate shareholder value. 
Now let me turn to the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule that came out a few weeks ago. As America's leader in financial planning, we take our fiduciary responsibility very seriously and put our clients' interests first. As you know, while the government removed some of the more onerous elements of the initial rule, what remains is a rule that is comprehensive and complex. It's hundreds of pages long and is a principle-based regulation that requires very detailed analysis. 
Clearly, it will require a change agenda for firms across the industry to execute it and be compliant within the time frame provided. We will take the time necessary to understand it and get it right. It wouldn't be prudent to try to oversimplify the rule for you today, but I know you have questions. And based on what we understand today, we believe that the impacts will be manageable. We're operating from a position of strength. We have the experience and the capabilities that will allow us to adopt and comply with the new rule. 
Consistent with our financial planning leadership, we are one of the largest providers of fee-based investment advice. And as I mentioned, we already operate as a fiduciary under the very high standard of care. We also benefit from investments we've made to establish a strong compliance foundation, including our infrastructure, policies, supervision and disclosures. Underpinning all of this, our clients and advisers are highly satisfied with the experience we provide. We have a proven track record of navigating through change and we'll build on that experience enhancing our processes and capabilities where necessary to effectively comply with the new DOL rule. 
With regard to some products you had questions about, we are confident that our advisers will still be able to recommend the products that they do today in qualified accounts, including annuities and affiliated products, which are expressly permitted under the rule. In short, we will continue to offer a full solution set. 
Today, we apply a rigorous degree of review and due diligence to the products we offer, and we have extensive disclosures in place. And while there will likely be additional disclosures and documentation required going forward, based on what we know at this time we believe that these requirements will be manageable. And while we cannot predict client-adviser behavior in response to the rule, our business model has proven to be adaptable. We can make adjustments prudently to respond to the evolving market environment. Yes, there will be added cost that we will address through expense reengineering and other means to position the firm for continued growth and margin expansion over the long term. 
I should also note that during this period of disruption, we see potential opportunities. For example, the regulatory environment will likely lead to consolidation within the industry, which we're already seeing. Independent advisers or independent broker-dealers may lack the resources or the scale to navigate the changes required and seek a strong partner like Ameriprise. The financial foundation we've built allows us to remain opportunistic while also making the necessary investments to comply with the rule. 
So in closing, this is a large change agenda for the industry. And at a high level, given what we know, we feel very comfortable that we can effectively navigate through it and we'll keep you apprised as we move forward. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Walter to take you through the numbers for the quarter."

Ameriprise delivered solid results in the quarter despite market disruptions. However, we successfully navigated these conditions and results in the quarter were overall quite good, as well as within each of the business segments. We conti",1065,"Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered solid results in the quarter despite market disruptions. However, we successfully navigated these conditions and results in the quarter were overall quite good, as well as within each of the business segments. We continue to believe our stock is undervalued, which you can see by the elevated level of repurchase in the quarter. Our capacity to buy back stock remains strong given our balance sheet fundamentals and our business mix generates strong free cash flow. We are committed to maintaining a differentiated level of capital return. 
Let's turn to Slide 4. Macro conditions impacted revenue in a few ways. Our weighted equity index, the proxy for equity market movements on AUM declined 8% on average year-over-year and 6% on average, sequentially. This affected average AUM and thereby fees, which we collected based upon average daily assets. Continued dislocation also muted client activity and contributed to Asset Management outflows. 
Sequential results demonstrated a similar dynamic from a market and flows perspective. The last quarter had strong asset management performance fees and a CDO liquidation. Low interest rates remained a headwind for our insurance and annuity businesses, and foreign exchange translations impacted asset levels and earnings. This is an industry-wide trend felt across financial services companies. 
Let's turn to Slide 5. Ameriprise delivered stable earnings per share and continued return on equity expansion in a challenging revenue environment. This clearly demonstrated our ability to navigate across business cycles using the multiple strong levers in our business model. Our business model generates significant free cash flow and our valuation allowed us to opportunistically repurchase stock at this depressed level. 
Additionally, we are tightly managing expenses while making the right investments to address regulatory changes and grow. We initiated an additional expense reengineering assessment in the quarter and identified good opportunities for the balance of the year. This way, if market disruptions persist, we'll be able to effectively manage our margins. 
Let's turn to segment performance, starting with AWM on Slide 6. The Advice & Wealth Management business continues to perform well delivering solid results. Leading indicators for the business were good. We brought in 70 experienced advisers in the quarter. And the advisers we've onboarded over the past 12 to 24 months are ramping up nicely. Our adviser retention was also strong at over 90% in both channels. Product flows were solid for this environment with $1.8 billion of wrap net inflows. 
Operating net revenues was $1.2 billion in the quarter, down almost 3% from last year driven by market dislocation even after the benefit of the increase in the fed funds rate in December. The market dislocation impacted PTI in a similar manner. Operating margin in the quarter was strong at 17.1%, up 50 basis points sequentially. Outside of significant market disruption, we expect future margin expansion to continue over time. 
Asset Management continues to provide a solid contribution to our revenue and earnings, as you'll see on Slide 7. Clearly, we faced 2 external headwinds in the quarter. First, the average WEI, down 8% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. And second, foreign exchange translation was unfavorable. These impacted both revenue and pretax operating earnings. 
Operating net revenue was down 10% to $724 million. Over 50% of the decline was related to markets and foreign exchange, with the balance largely related to the cumulative impact of net outflows. Pretax operating earnings were down 22% to $149 million with over 60% of the decline related to markets and FX. We are prudently managing expenses with overall expenses down 7% and G&A down 3%. The results in the quarter were in line with our expectations in this environment. However, we began additional expense management actions in the quarter and have the capacity to further reduce expenses to support margin improvement. 
Turning to annuities on Slide 8. The segment is performing in line with our expectations. Variable annuity pretax operating earnings were $100 million, down from $144 million a year ago. This business was also impacted by market dislocation in the quarter, both in terms of the direct impact on account values and lower asset earning rate, as well as the impact on DAC and DSIC and SOP reserves. This non-cash impact was about 60% of the decline in the quarter.  The underlying business is solid and the risks are well-managed. 
Fixed annuity pretax operating earnings declined to $24 million due to the elevated lapses as the blocks run off. The earnings in the quarter also benefited from a couple of million dollars of onetime items. Given the current interest rate environment, there are limited new sales. And as a result, this book is expected to gradually run off and earnings will trend down during the year. 
Turning to the Protection segment on next slide. Pretax operating earnings were $69 million in the quarter. Let's focus on Life and Health first, which is in line with expectations. Pretax operating earnings benefited from stable claims experience and the recapture of a reinsurance treaty, but continues to be pressured by low interest rates. 
Our Auto and Home was certainly impacted by elevated cat losses in the quarter. We were pleased to see early indications of improvement in the underlying loss trends in the operating results. The changes we have been making to enhance pricing, underwriting, claims and operations are taking hold. New business is moderated in targeted areas as a result of prudent rate taking and additional underwriting discipline. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Slide 10. As we have told you before, Ameriprise maintains a strong balance sheet that we'll use opportunistically. In the quarter, we returned 150% of operating earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. We repurchased 5.1 million shares in the quarter, almost double the number of shares repurchased a year ago. Additionally, we announced a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.75 per share. 
Our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong. We have more than $2 billion of excess capital and an RBC ratio of approximately 550%. Our hedging program is working well and the investment portfolio is diversified. We feel good about our energy exposure and it was in a net unrealized gain position at the end of the quarter. Our strategy is consistent and we are well positioned to navigate challenging environments using the various levers to continue to deliver excellent results. 
With that, we will take your questions."

I doubt very much that a small broker-dealer or even independents in general or advisers on their own are going to have the means by which they can navigate this, both from a legal, a regulatory, a compliance, a technology, a support, a servicing, an education, a training. We have mobilized our field resources, the company resources. We're going to be doing extensive training where technology is underway. So we have the ability to do this, and we will. And it's not just incremental costs. We're devoting and rechanneling our resources so that we redeploy to get this done appropriately.

And therefore, we can actually, as the various share classes are introduced, appropriately move and migrate and are -- we will give our advisers the ability to use the most appropriate -- and for the type of investment that's out in the marketplace. And so we're migrating that anyway, and we think that's appropriate longer term. And based on our ability to do that would satisfy the DOL's regulation of what they're looking for from a fee and a leveling and transparency. So that's underway, and that's a very large investment. But we have that underway to begin with and it's good that we're -- we have the infrastructure that we're going to be completing in '17."

But as I always said to you, it's low double digits in total sales across qualified,",555,"So when we look at our sales and across the business and then what goes into qualified, as we said to you before, Columbia is one of the strong providers in our channel. But as I always said to you, it's low double digits in total sales across qualified, nonqualified, the whole house. Within that, we also -- within qualified, have a very large substantial business and investment advisory, and Columbia is part of that as they are in individual sales for a transaction on the brokerage side. But it's no more in qualified than it is across the house per se and the percentage is small. So if you look at what may go on within the BIC side of it or a transaction side of it, you're talking about low mid-single digits. And so it's not that substantial -- and it's not different than other large providers in our system. And again, Columbia has some excellent product with excellent performance and their fees are below average in general. Then when you take -- and I'll just -- because the next question whether from you or somebody else will be annuities and they're similar, so let me answer that one for you. Annuities is only in, roughly, in the qualified business of the total sales we do across the Ameriprise family here within the Wealth Management, is only in the mid-single digits. So if all annuities went away from -- we're talking mid-single digits of sales and -- but it's not going to occur, because based on the reviews we do today and how substantial they are in preclearance, we think that will continue. Now could some of it -- could some of it shift, the next question, from an upfront load to a level load? Yes. And we have the ability to do that. Those products are there. So if the advisers, as you said, wanted to shift some behavior and didn't want to put an upfront load, they have the ability just like on the wrap to do the level load. And so to our perspective, we don't think this is substantial. And even if it changes by a few percent -- I guess I heard from many of you over the times as why am I in the annuity business. So if it shifted away I'll just go into investment advisory, and I'll still generate good profitability and good margins. So we're not concerned. We like the solution of the annuities because it fits a solution set for Confident Retirement and longevity of income and that need will still be there, and our advisers will still determine, appropriately, whether it fits. So whether it's Columbia product or it's annuities, as an example, we think there is a critical need. Columbia has excellent product. We don't sell it differently. We don't pay differently. So we actually believe that -- and the BIC does allow for it, so if we didn't have what we had in place, the due diligence, the disclosures, the review processes, appropriate compensation, we would probably have a different concern, but we don't in this case. But again, we will adjust. And if there is a migration in anything, we have different alternatives and we make those adjustments. And I think, from a perspective, we'll be in good shape."

It requires a higher level of analysis, documentation and disclosures to determine that it's in the best interest of the client. And today, we do something very similar. Rollovers are now considered part of the fiduciary advice. So formally, it's required that you do a number of things necessary to truly show what that is. And it builds upon, for us, what we already have in place is very strong comprehensive rollover education and disclosure materials. And we think those -- whatever we need to enhance to them would meet some of the things, but that review process would be necessary. We have a program in place called leave it or roll it over already, which evaluates the various options for retirement plan assets, and we're going to enhance those where appropriate. But I would say that the rule does not prohibit it, but it does make sure that you're analyzing appropriately to make sure that, that is appropriate for the client for a number of reasons.

What that does longer term to behavior, I can't sit here, as I said, I can't predict what happens longer term and why.

Since the rule came out, what it said is that the period was extended a bit and it was less onerous for some of the requirements, particularly, that you would have to do with calculations and data and all that stuff. So as we now look at it, some of the incremental that we thought would even ramp-up a lot more is not going to be as necessary. But the expenses we're talking about are incremental. As I said, internally, particularly in AWM, but in other places in the company we are redeploying significant resources that is within the AWM's expense base. So even though we've tightened expenses, we could have probably tightened them a bit more, but we're now ensuring that we do that. But I would consider that more of a redeployment rather than an incremental. There will be some more incremental. Walter is working on what that would look like, and we'll give it to you in the second quarter, but as we said a lot of it will be from redeploying what we do."

And I can't -- I wish I could give you more perfect science, I can't. I would say this, I know people who have looked at us and said we are going to be more significantly impacted from the industry, et cetera. We don't believe that. We think that some other people will be impacted a lot or in general across the industry. So what I would just say is, we will be impacted. There's no doubt about it. This will cause a level of disruption, change, a focus on moving and migrating where necessary, changing people's behavior a bit. But we will get that done. Now what that would probably mean is there will be some adjustment and whether there will be cost or revenue in some fashion over the number of periods, but it will work its way through. I would not say that it would be significant. That's why we say manageable, but I can't say it won't be anything. Longer term, we do feel that we have a good value proposition. There's a real need for our services. We will put in place the necessary things, appropriately, to help our advisers continue to build their businesses. And with that, we will get back on track to the margins that we said we were targeting, but more important than the margins, the growth of the business. And from the growth of the business, the margins will occur. So I can't sit here and tell you that, no, we've changed the strategy. We haven't. And I can't say that we see something that would take us off of our costs longer term. But I could probably say that, maybe, just a seamless idea that you're going to continue to do everything in the next periods where that's not going to translate to some change, I can't say that at all. Longer term, we'll see what happens. But this is an environment that does change. But Ameriprise has the capability. We have a good value proposition, good foundation and that's the way we're going to navigate. So I'm not here to give you a perfect science. What I'm telling you is we're not falling off a cliff. We are in good shape. We have the means. We have the ability. We are -- we have great client satisfaction.

I'll provide my perspective on the business, Walter will discuss our financials and then we'll answer your questions. Domestic equity markets improved in the quarter, However internationally markets remain quiet week year-over-year-year, volatility spiked in June, which was reflected in slower client activity. Post Brexit the British pound is a significantly, and difficult foreign exchange translation. Our our internal liberated equity index was domestic and international assets under management characteristics was down 5% on average year-over-year. We ended the quarter with $777 billion in assets under management and administration, which was down a bit year-over-year. And as you're well aware there to lower interest rate remains persistent to headwind. These are external factors that we can't control, that said it, we've focused on what we can control, serving our clients, executing a strategy strategy, managing expenses, wealth as we invest in the business and navigating this market movements. So how did that translate into our performance? Overall, Ameriprise delivered solid second quarter results. On an operating basis, net revenues reflected tougher market environment and was down 4% to $2.9 billion. 
Earnings per diluted share were also down 4% to $2.23, but that includes certain items in the quarter that we highlighted and our return on equity, excluding AOCI remained very strong at 23.9%, this is a 40 basis points from a year ago. Both our financial foundation and ability to consistently generate good free cash flow remains strong. And we increased number of shares we repurchased year-over-year to 4.7 million shares, in total, we returned about about 150% of earnings to shareholders, the second consecutive quarter. We've returned at that level. 
Let's move to our business results. And advised Wealth Management our advice value proposition is strong and we continue to generate good earnings with very good margin. Our are working closely with her at build them understand current and moment and importantly, ensure long-term goals. Naturally the market volatility in general, on the it investor behavior. with this volatility one at a rate of increase the market commentary and communications for the field, to help equip our advice is to have meaningful conversations with their clients. As you expect, clients are corsets and transaction remain muted. In the quarter we continue to grow our client base in terms of retail clients assets under management, assets grew to an all-time high in the quarter to $462 billion. 
We continue to have solid flows in the fee-based investment advisory, another $2.3 billion in the quarter, while we have one of the largest platforms in the industry. However given the market volatility brokerage cash balances continue to rise up 17% from year ago, to more than $23 billion, which can be redeployed in the future. 
I'm feeling good about the strength of our field force. Our take pride in and appreciate the Ameriprise value proposition and strong culture. That's also very attractive to advisors in the industry. We continue to have terrific advises satisfaction I spent time with many of our top conference in May and feeling good about value and the support and the growth opportunity they have year. 
I'll be brilliant advertising campaign is on the airways and being positive we see TV aren't as well as our Ameriprise brand  is also remains quite strong. The industry recruiting slow, this was one of the best quarters for recruiting for Ameriprise. Another 98 experienced advisors with good productivity joined Ameriprise and our pipeline for rest of the year looks good. 
Overall, given market presence advisors maintain good productivity with operating net revenue per adviser, at $5,700 from 12-month basis. From a metrics perspective we're delivering good profitability with margins increasing to a strong in the quarter. We remain well positioned in the marketplace to take advantage of the growth opportunity, as conditions settle. Clearly, the department of fiduciary to remains a top priority for us. As I discussed with you I believe Ameriprise is well positioned to handle the changes required. We have the experience, capabilities,, infrastructure and dedicated teams to ensure we comply with new role. As we and others in the industry noted, this is a highly complex role that requires a thoughtful rigorous approach. Of course, we'll  also be factoring and the partners guidance which will be coming in the near future. Since the rules and introduction we've been working closely with our advisors and the field leaders to help them understand the requirements and the adjustments we're working to implement effectively. We're conducting comprehensive ongoing series of webcasts, workshops and local training sessions to help them prepare to operate in compliance with the rule. 
We'll continue to deliver the high level of support throughout this transition which is consistent with our commitment to help our advisors grow their practices. Advice as I been very appreciative of the level and support we're providing. Given what we know, we feel comfortable that we can effectively navigate through it and we'll keep you as we move forward. 
Let's move to annuities protection. The new and Health's insurance business are performing as we would expect on low-interest rate environment. With regard to annuities and earnings get in line even rates and equity markets present an account balances. On the the variable side, account balances declined slightly to to $75 million ants sales slowed year-over-year which is selling to the sentence pick a year ago we have dais noon that will well received with the plans and advises pics keep in mind that variable annuity sales-in flows reflect both our current block of business and close legacy blogs. On the fixed side, the book is performing as expected in the slow interest rate environment. 
In Life and Health, overall business results are within our expectations including our claims experience. Sales slowed a bit in the quarter consistent with transactional activity. We continue to focus on the asset accumulation portion of the business, primarily in VUL and and provided I training service and support. With regard to Auto and Home, consistent with the PNC industry, we're experienced a high level of cat losses in the quarter primarily driven by win and House Thompson southern and central regions of the country. and Auto and Home, we're making more strategic can be changes in our business lines, to tighten our barriers where we're die year loss levels. This is an addition to the pricing underwriting claims and organizational changes we're making. And we're seeing improvements that will translate into improved financial results in the coming quarters. In Asset Management we're executing focused strategy for long-term growth. 
Clearly, the market environment was challenging in the quarter with about market declines, high volatility in June and the pound dropping to lowest point against thus dollar more than 30 years. In this environment, Assets Under Management decline to $460 billion, and also a one-time expenses which we previously noted that impacted earnings in the quarter. Underlying expenses have remained well controlled as we work to preserve margins in the current environment  and we also have one-time expenses which we previously noted that impacted earnings in the quarter. Underlying expenses remained well controlled as we worked to preserve margins in the current environment. In terms of investment performance we continue to generate good long-term performance track records many asset classes and this performance looks relatively strong as industry peers. 
Regarding the U.K. referendum, I'm pleased with how we're implementing our initial plans to manage the Post U.K. referendum period effectively and providing support and perspective to our clients and investors. The transition will take time and we have been reinforcing with clients that there is no in investors should need to take make. As you would expect we're monitoring the decisions in Britain and the EU as we in the industry determine next steps. We have a strong an important business in the U.K., Europe and we're committed to serving the needs of all of our investors and feel comfortable with our ability to do, so going forward. We also have operations in lug some work and are ready fund range that we sell in Europe and we'll continue to build upon. Now let's move to floors, in the quarter we've experienced $4.7 billion in outflows. About half were driven by lower field form a payment related flows that we discussed with you. All of the remainder several of the institutional for next expected in the second quarter were delayed due to Brexit, well we should come through in the second half of the 
year of the timing expect resulted in $2.6 billion and institutional net outflows in the quarter with approximately $2 billion of very low fee short duration fixed income mandates. Overall, our institutional pipeline remains strong. Global retail flows were modestly positive and included investor dividends. In the U.S. we continue to focus on improving market share, and while the industry growth were down our flows improved a bit. And in U.K. and European retail we saw outflows leading up to the port as investors were cautious and this turned negative after the vote. Based on our initial of flows in the third quarter this pressure appears to be subsiding. 
I'd like to point out a number of developments in the quarter in the U.S. We announced the acquisition of emerging global advisors, the smock data provider focused on the emerging markets and we've also launched 3 new equity income ETFs data is a long-term opportunity for us. It's a natural complement to our traditional active business, as we take the necessary steps to advance the business. 
In addition, shareholders supported fund mergers that further strengthen our U.S. product line. And we also launched a new adviser website for Columbia enhancing the online experience. So  overall, I feel good about how we're managing tough and uncertain market environment. The actions we're taking to drive long-term growth of the right ones. We're managing the business prudently to preserve profitability, while investing initiatives to compete in our key regions. 
As I look at the company overall, Ameriprise is a strong company in a good position with significant opportunities for growth when conditions settles. We're focused on what we can't control in delivering strong client experience. We have the financial stability and capital to navigate the headwinds to continue to invest for growth and return to shareholders at a very attractive level.  And I'd add that very few financial services companies are generating in this level of return on equity and returning to shareholders as strongly as Ameriprise. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Walter to discuss the numbers for the quarter in more detail."

Ameriprise continues to navigate the macro conditions well, delivering solid financial results in the quarter. Given the revenue challenges related to the macro environment, we're selectively investing for growth, while managing expenses tigh",1070,"Thanks, Jim. Ameriprise continues to navigate the macro conditions well, delivering solid financial results in the quarter. Given the revenue challenges related to the macro environment, we're selectively investing for growth, while managing expenses tightly. We believe our stock continues to be undervalued. The valuation combined with our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation. Allowed us to be opportunistic in the quarter in our share repurchase. 
Let's turn to consolidated results beginning on Slide 6. Macro conditions impacted revenue in a few ways. A weighted equity index our proxy for equity market movements on AUM, declined 5% on average year-over-year, but was up 6% on average sequentially. This affected average AUM and fees, which are collected based on average daily assets. The dislocation over the past few quarters as muted client activity contributed to asset management outflows. Lower interest rates remained a headwind for our insurance and annuity businesses. And the pound fell at the end of the quarter following the U.K. referendum to leave the European Union. So the foreign exchange translation impacted ending asset levels. 
With that, as a backdrop, you can see how this macro environment impacted operating net revenue, which were down 4% year-over-year. Lower, average equity markets reduced revenue by approximately $50 million and also suppressed client transactional activity. On a sequential basis, we saw revenues improved in the quarter up 2%, reflecting improvement in the market index. 
Let's turn to Slide 7. Ameriprise delivered good underlying business performance and EPS in a challenging revenue environment. Demonstrating our ability to navigate through business cycles. We're tightly managing expenses, while making the right investments to adjust to regulatory and geopolitical changes and support future growth. We're seeing the results of our target reengineering initiatives, which we expect to be realized more in the second half of the year. Pretax earnings declined substantially driven by market dislocation. However, EPS was only down 4%, reflecting effective tax planning and are significant share repurchase program. Our business model built generate significant free cash flow and our valuation provided a good opportunity to repurchase shares at a discounted level.  In the quarter, we delivered strong 23.9% return on equity. 
Let's turn to segment performance. Starting on Slide 8. First, the advice on Wealth Management business continues to perform very well. Delivering solid results in the face of the challenging environment. Jim, spoke about the strong leading indicators we're seeing in this business. Excellent EAR recruiting, strong adviser and client retention, and record client asset levels. Financial results are also good in this context., while operating net revenue was down about 2% from last year to $1.3 billion in the quarter, it was driven by lower average equity markets and slower transactional activity. These dynamics impacted PTI as well, but PTI was also benefited from our disciplined expense management. It should be noted that earnings in this segment improved sequentially due to better equity markets and transactional activity levels, which grow revenue up 4% and earnings up 8%. 
Operating margin in the quarter was strong at 17.7% up 40 basis points from last year and up 60 basis points sequentially. Outside a significant market disruption, we expect future margin expansion to continue over time. 
Let's turn to Slide 9 on Asset Management. Clearly, we faced external headwinds in the quarter. The average WEI was down 5% year-over-year, which impacted both revenue and pretax operating earnings. Operating net revenue was down 11% to $739 million, but for approximately quarter of the decline related to markets. 
The other primary driver of revenue decline was a cumulative impact of net flows. Pretax operating earnings were down 25% to $148 million, which was impacted by markets, outflows, as well as preannounced resolution of a legal matter. 
I'd like to note that foreign exchange translation impact from Brexit was minimal in the quarter. We're prudently managing expenses with overall expenses down 7% and G&A down 5%. Looking ahead, we see an opportunity to improve margins as we move to more normalized markets. 
Turning to Annuities on Slide 10. The segment is performing in line with our expectation are annuity pretax operating earnings was $180 million, down slightly from $120 million a year ago. This business was also impacted by market dislocation in terms of the direct impact on account values and lower asset earning rates. The underlying business is solid and the risk are well-managed. Fixed annuity pretax operating earnings declined to $28 million due to elevated lapses over the past year, as the blocks has been running off. 
The earnings in the quarter, were a bit better than anticipated due to higher mortality experience among income annuity contract holders. Given the current interest rate environment, there are limited new sales and as a result, this book is expected to gradually run off and earnings will trend down during the year. 
Turning to the Protection segment on Slide 11. Pretax operating earnings were $37 million in the quarter. Let's focus on Life and Health first. Pretax operating earnings were down from last year, largely due to an $18 million long-term care, reserved release in the prior period. Also long-term care claims where elevated in the current year, but remained within expected ranges. Auto and Home an operating loss in the quarter due to be preannounced cap losses of $37 million. The combined ratio was 118% in the quarter, which included 14% from cap losses. 
Underlying results reflected the booking cough accident year 2016, incurred losses at a level consistent with the end of 2015. Management is taking action to enhance underwriting, pricing and claims practices, which are driving improvement in frequency and severity trends in both short and long tailed coverages. As these business trends continue to emerge, we anticipate that they will begin to be reflected in the financial results. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Slide 12. As we have told you before, Ameriprise maintains a strong balance sheet that we'll use opportunistically. We have approximately $2 billion of excess capital and our estimated RBC ratio remains above 500%. Our hedging program continued to work well and the investment portfolio is diversified. We returned approximately 150% of operating earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase again, this quarter, well above our baseline of 90% to 100% of our earnings. We repurchased $4.7 million of shares in the quarter up significantly from a year ago. 
With that, we'll take your questions."

Having said that, the book has been relatively stable, with investments and other things and appreciation where we manage roughly equivalent levels of assets over time, but we always have to book that outflow, it comes to an always looks like a negative. In U.S. Trust as an example, there is always a level of that just because there is as new sales come into U.S. Trust or as their level of sales may have gone down. When we purchased it, it was a larger base of their assets. And so there's always a little difference between a level of redemption and a level of new sales and we expected that and that's normally what occurred. What occurred over the last number of quarters was that U.S. Trust decided to take some of their separate account fixed income business back in house and in that regard, we suffered a little level -- higher level of of outflows from some of the dedicated activities we did for them. That looks like it now has slowed through end of the second quarter and we think that will go back to a more normalized number. But those are the reasons that we had some oversized flows that we experienced there."

So we look at the annuity  part of a broader solution set against our overall account and retirement plan for the client. And there  is sold a solution for a piece of their activities and we really have educated and we work with our advisors to understand where they would provide the essential income as a piece of that income drawdown plan. So that's the way we've done business for a while and as you can see, our business has been pretty stable in the amount of sales that we've been consistently because they're not sold as a just products out there, but as part of the broader solution. Now with that, every sale of our annuity goes to our pre-approval process and upfront review compliance et cetera, to ensure that it is fitting appropriate for that client. So that process that we already have in place will be the same process that will be in place as we move forward. There's always a few things and tweaks that will make sure are complemented there based on any other additional sort of thought process necessary, but we believe that the extent process that we have in place already goes to that level of due diligence and review and where it is appropriate and it's qualified account, that's what we reviewed today in a very rigorous way. So we don't see a fundamental change in the way we do business, regarding the sale of that product. Now could there be adjustment in some of the activity there, the answer is always yes. But that's something we'll see over time where necessary, but we don't see a fundamental change driven by change in fundamental process that we have in place or review that we currently do. In addition, there maybe some move to more of a level load over time rather than upfront commission, but again, that will depend on what circumstances or how the advisor thinks about it, but we're not planning for a fundamental shift in our annuity business."

I'll provide my perspective on the business, Walter will discuss our financials and then we'll answer your questions. Domestic equity markets improved in the quarter. Howev",1823,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. I'll provide my perspective on the business, Walter will discuss our financials and then we'll answer your questions. 
Domestic equity markets improved in the quarter. However, internationally, markets remain quiet weak year-over-year-year. Volatility spiked in June, which was reflected in slower client activity. Post Brexit, the British pound weakened significantly and created a difficult foreign exchange translation. Our internally weighted equity index, which aligns to our domestic and international assets under management characteristics, was down 5% on average year-over-year. We ended the quarter with $777 billion in assets under management and administration, which was down a bit year-over-year. And as you're well aware, the low interest rate environment remains a persistent headwind. These are external factors that we can't control. That said, we focused on what we can control: serving our clients, executing our strategy, managing expenses well as we invest in the business and navigating these market movements. 
So how did that translate into our performance? Overall, Ameriprise delivered solid second quarter results. On an operating basis, net revenues reflected the tougher market environment and were down 4% to $2.9 billion. Earnings per diluted share were also down 4% to $2.23, but that includes certain items in the quarter that we highlighted. And our return on equity, excluding AOCI, remained very strong at 23.9%. This is up 40 basis points from a year ago. Both our financial foundation and ability to consistently generate good free cash flow remains strong, and we increased the number of shares we repurchased year-over-year to 4.7 million shares. In total, we returned about 150% of earnings to shareholders, the second consecutive quarter where we've returned at that level. 
Let's move to our business results. In Advice & Wealth Management, our advice value proposition is strong, and we continue to generate good earnings with very good margin. Our advisors and teams are working closely with clients to help them understand the current environment and importantly, to ensure they remain focused on achieving their long-term goals. Naturally, the market volatility in general [indiscernible] in the quarter continued to affect investor behavior. With this volatility, we increased our market commentary and communications for the field to help equip our advisors to have meaningful conversations with their clients. As you expect, clients are cautious and our lower transaction activity remain muted. In the quarter, we continue to grow our client base. And in terms of retail clients' assets under management, assets grew to an all-time high in the quarter to $462 billion. 
We continue to have solid flows in the fee-based investment advisory, another $2.3 billion in the quarter where we have one of the largest platforms in the industry. However, given market volatility, brokerage cash balances continue to rise, up 17% from year ago, to more than $23 billion, which can be redeployed in the future. 
I'm feeling good about the strength of our field force. Our advisors take pride in and appreciate the Ameriprise value proposition and strong culture, and that's also very attractive to advisors in the industry. We continue to have terrific advisors satisfaction. I spent time with many of our top advisors at our national conference in May, and they're feeling very good about the value, the support and the growth opportunity they have here. Our Be Brilliant advertising campaign is on the airwaves and being positive we see both on TV as well as online. Ameriprise brand awareness has also remained quite strong. Though industry recruiting slowed, this was one of the best quarters for recruiting for Ameriprise. Another 98 experienced advisors with good productivity joined Ameriprise, and our pipeline for rest of the year looks good. Overall, given market pressures, advisors maintain good productivity with operating net revenue per adviser at $5,700 on a 12-month basis. 
From a metrics perspective, we're delivering good profitability, with margins increasing to a strong 17.7% in the quarter. We remain well positioned in the marketplace to take advantage of the growth opportunity as conditions settle. 
Clearly, the Department of Labor fiduciary rule remains a top priority for us. As I've discussed with you, I believe Ameriprise is well positioned to handle the changes required. We have the experience, capabilities, compliance, infrastructure and dedicated teams to ensure we comply with the new rule. As we and others in the industry noted, this is a highly complex rule that requires a thoughtful, rigorous approach. Of course, we'll also be factoring in the department's additional guidance, which they indicated will be coming in the near future. Since the rule's introduction, we've been working closely with our advisors and field leaders to help them understand the requirements and the adjustments we're making to implement them effectively. We're conducting a comprehensive and ongoing series of webcasts, workshops and local training sessions to help them prepare to operate in compliance with the rule. We will continue to deliver a high level of support throughout this transition, which is consistent with our commitment to help our advisors grow their practices. Adivsors have been very appreciative of the level of support we're providing. Given what we know, we feel comfortable that we can effectively navigate through it, and we'll keep you apprised as we move forward. 
Let's move to Annuities and Protection. The Annuities and Life and Health insurance businesses are performing as we would expect in a slow interest rate environment. With regard to Annuities, earnings were in line given rates and the equity market pressure on account balances. On the variable side, account balances declined slightly to $75 million and sales slowed year-over-year, which was similar to recent industry trends. A year ago, we had higher sales from new living benefit riders that were well received by our clients and advisers. Keep in mind that variable annuity sales and flows reflect both our current block of business and closed legacy blocks. On the fixed side, the book is performing as expected in a slow interest rate environment. 
In Life and Health, overall business results are within our expectations, including our claims experience. Sales slowed a bit in the quarter consistent with transactional activity. We continue to focus on the asset accumulation portion of the business, primarily in VUL and UL, and providing a high level advisor training service and support. 
With regard to Auto and Home, consistent with the P&C industry, we experienced a high level of cat losses in the quarter, primarily driven by wind and hale storms in southern and central regions of the country. In Auto and Home, we're making more strategic and impactful changes in our business lines to tighten up areas where we had higher loss levels. This is an addition to the pricing, underwriting claims and organizational changes we're making. And we're seeing improvements that will translate into improved financial results in the coming quarters. 
In Asset Management, we're executing a focused strategy for long-term growth. Clearly, the market environment was challenging in the quarter, with both the average equity market declines, high volatility in June and the pound dropping to lowest point against the U.S. dollar in more than 30 years. In this environment, assets under management declined to $460 billion, and we also have onetime expenses, which we previously noted, that impacted earnings in the quarter. Underlying expenses have remained well controlled as we work to preserve margins in the current environment. In terms of investment performance, we continue to generate good long-term performance track records across many asset classes and styles [ph], and this performance looks relatively strong against industry peers. 
Regarding the U.K. referendum, I'm pleased with how we're implementing our initial plans to manage the post U.K. referendum period effectively and providing support and perspective to our clients and investors. The transition will take time, and we have been reinforcing with clients that there is no immediate decisions investors need to take make. As you would expect, we are monitoring decisions in Britain and the EU as we in the industry determine next steps. We have a strong and important business in the U.K., Europe, and we're committed to serving the needs of all of our investors and feel comfortable with our ability to do so going forward. We also have operations in Luxembourg and already have established that fund range that we sell in Europe and we will continue to build upon. 
Now let's move to flows. In the quarter, we experienced $4.7 billion in outflows. About half were driven by lower fee former parent related flows that we discussed with you. Of the remains in the several of the institutional fundings we expected in the second quarter were delayed due to Brexit. While we should see them come through in the second half of the year, the timing aspect resulted in $2.6 billion in institutional net outflows in the quarter, with approximately $2 billion of very low fee short duration fixed income mandates. 
Overall, our institutional pipeline remains strong. Global retail flows were modestly positive and included invested dividends. In the U.S., we continue to focus on improving market share. And while industry gross sales in the active space were down, our flows improved a bit. And in U.K. and European retail, we saw outflows leading up to the vote as investors were cautious and this turned one negative after the vote. Based on our initial read of flows in the third quarter, this pressure appears to be subsiding. 
I'd like to point out a number of developments in the quarter in the U.S. We announced the acquisition of Emerging Global Advisors, a smart beta provider focused on emerging markets, and we've also launched 3 new equity income smart beta ETFs. Smart beta is a long-term opportunity for us. It's a natural complement to our traditional active business as we take the necessary steps to advance the business. In addition, shareholders supported fund mergers that further strengthened our U.S. product line. And we also launched a new advisor website for Columbia Threadneedle, enhancing the online experience. 
So overall, I feel good about how we're managing a tough and uncertain market environment. The actions we've taken to drive long-term growth are the right ones. We're managing the business prudently to preserve profitability while investing in initiatives to compete in our key regions. As I look at the company overall, Ameriprise is a strong company in a good position with significant opportunity for growth when conditions settle. We're focused on what we can control and delivering a strong client experience. We have the financial stability and capital to navigate the headwinds to continue and invest for growth and return to shareholders at a very attractive level.  And I'd add that very few financial services companies are generating this level of return on equity and returning to shareholders as strongly as Ameriprise. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Walter to discuss the numbers for the quarter in more detail."

Ameriprise continues to navigate the macro conditions well, delivering solid financial results in the quarter. Given the revenue challenges related to the macro environment, we are selectively investing for growth while managing expenses tightly. We believe our stock continues to be undervalued. The valuation combined with our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation allowed us to be opportunistic in the quarter in our share repurchase. 
Let's turn to consolidated results beginning on Slide 6. Macro conditions impacted revenue in a few ways. Our weighted equity index, a proxy for equity market movements on AUM, declined 5% on average year-over-year but was up 6% on average sequentially. This affected average AUM and fees, which are collected based on average daily assets. The dislocation over the past few quarters has muted client activity and contributed to asset management outflows. Low interest rates remained a headwind for our insurance and annuity businesses. And the pound fell at the end of the quarter following the U.K. referendum to leave the European Union, so the foreign exchange translation impacted ending asset levels. With that as a backdrop, you can see how this macro environment impacted operating net revenue, which were down 4% year-over-year. Lower average equity markets reduced revenue by approximately $50 million and also suppressed client transactional activity. On a sequential basis, we saw revenues improved in the quarter up 2%, reflecting improvement in the market index. 
Let's turn to Slide 7. Ameriprise delivered good underlying business performance and EPS in a challenging revenue environment, demonstrating our ability to navigate through business cycles. We're tightly managing expenses while making the right investments to adjust to regulatory and geopolitical changes and support future growth. We're seeing the results of our target reengineering initiatives, which we expect to be realized more in the second half of the year. Pretax earnings declined substantially, driven by market dislocation. However, EPS was only down 4%, reflecting effective tax planning and our significant share repurchase program. Our business model generated significant free cash flow, and our valuation provided a good opportunity to repurchase shares at a discounted level.  In the quarter, we delivered a strong 23.9% return on equity. 
Let's turn to segment performance, starting on Slide 8. First, the advice on Wealth Management business continues to perform very well, delivering solid results in the face of the challenging environment. Jim, spoke about the strong leading indicators we're seeing in this business: excellent EAR recruiting, strong advisor and client retention and record client asset levels. Financial results are also good in this context, while operating net revenue was down about 2% from last year to $1.3 billion in the quarter. It was driven by lower average equity markets and slower transactional activity. These dynamics impacted PTI as well, but PTI also benefited from our disciplined expense management. It should be noted that earnings in this segment improved sequentially due to better equity markets and transactional activity levels, which grew revenue up 4% and earnings up 8%. Operating margin in the quarter was strong at 17.7%, up 40 basis points from last year and up 60 basis points sequentially. Outside of significant market disruption, we expect future margin expansion to continue over time. 
Let's turn to Slide 9 on Asset Management. Clearly, we faced external headwinds in the quarter. The average WEI was down 5% year-over-year, which impacted both revenue and pretax operating earnings. Operating net revenue was down 11% to $739 million, with approximately a quarter of the decline related to markets. The other primary driver of revenue decline was the cumulative impact of net flows. Pretax operating earnings were down 25% to $148 million, which was impacted by markets, outflows as well as the preannounced resolution of a legal matter. I'd like to note that foreign exchange translation impact from Brexit was minimal in the quarter. We are prudently managing expenses, with overall expenses down 7% and G&A down 5%. Looking ahead, we see an opportunity to improve margins as we move to more normalized markets. 
Turning to Annuities on Slide 10. This segment is performing in line with our expectations. Variable annuity pretax operating earnings was $118 million, down slightly from $120 million a year ago. This business was also impacted by market dislocation in terms of the direct impact on account values and lower asset earning rates. The underlying business is solid and the risk are well managed. Fixed annuity pretax operating earnings declined to $28 million due to elevated lapses over the past year as the block has been running off. The earnings in the quarter were a bit better than anticipated due to higher mortality experience among income annuity contract holders. Given the current interest rate environment, there are limited new sales. And as a result, this book is expected to gradually run off and earnings will trend down during the year. 
Turning to the Protection segment on Slide 11. Pretax operating earnings were $37 million in the quarter. Let's focus on Life and Health first. Pretax operating earnings were down from last year, largely due to an $18 million long-term care reserve release in the prior period. Also long-term care claims were elevated in the current year but remained within expected ranges. Auto and Home had an operating loss in the quarter due to preannounced cat losses of $37 million. The combined ratio was 118% in the quarter, which included 14% from cat losses. Underlying results reflect the booking of accident year 2016 incurred losses at a level consistent with the end of 2015. Management has taken action to enhance underwriting, pricing and claims practices, which are driving improvement in frequency and severity trends in both short and long tailed coverages. As these business trends continue to emerge, we anticipate that they will begin to be reflected in the financial results. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Slide 12. As we have told you before, Ameriprise maintains a strong balance sheet that we will use opportunistically. We have approximately $2 billion of excess capital, and our estimated RBC ratio remains above 500%. Our hedging program continues to work well, and the investment portfolio is diversified. We returned approximately 150% of operating earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase again this quarter, well above our baseline of 90% to 100% of earnings. We repurchased 4.7 million shares in the quarter, up significantly from a year ago. 
With that, we will take your questions."

We always mentioned that there would be a normal outflow from our arrangements with Zurich and U.S. Trust over time, just as Zurich is closed book. We constantly get a level of outflows. Having said that, the book has been relatively stable with reinvestments and other things and appreciation, where we manage roughly equivalent levels of assets over time but we always have to book that outflow as it comes through and that always looks like a negative. In U.S. Trust, as an example, there is always a level of that just because there's a -- as new sales come into U.S. Trust or as their level of sales may have gone down, when we purchased it, it was a larger base of their assets. And so there's always a little difference between a level of redemption and a level of new sales, and we expected that. And that's normally what occurred. What occurred over the last number of quarters was that U.S. Trust decided to take some of their separate account fixed income business back in-house and in that regard, we suffered a little level -- higher level of outflows from some of the dedicated activities we did for them. That looks like it now has slowed through the end of the second quarter, and we think that will go back to a more normalized number. But those are the reasons that we had of some oversized flows that we experienced there."

So we look at the annuity as part of a broader solution set against our overall account and retirement plan for the client. And they're really sold as a solution for a piece of their activities, and we really have educated and we work with our advisors to understand where they would provide the essential income as a piece of that income drawdown plan. So that's the way we've done business for a while. And as you can see, our business has been pretty stable in the amount of sales that we've been consistently because they're not sold as just a product out there but as part of the broader solution. Now with that, every sale of our annuity goes through a preapproval process and an upfront review compliance, et cetera, to ensure that it is fit and appropriate for that client. So that process that we already have in place will be the same process that will be in place as we move forward. There's always a few things and tweaks that we'll make sure are complemented there based on any other additional sort of thought process necessary. But we believe that the extent process that we have in place already goes to that level of due diligence and review. And where it is appropriate as a qualified account, that's what we'll review today in a very rigorous way. So we don't see a fundamental change in the way we do business regarding the sale of that product. Now could there be adjustment in some of the activity there, the answer is always yes. But that's something we'll see over time where necessary, but we don't see a fundamental change driven by a change in a fundamental process that we have in place or review that we currently do. In addition, there maybe some move to more of a level load over time rather than upfront commission. But again, that will depend on what circumstances or how the advisor thinks about it, but we're not planning for a fundamental shift in our annuity business."

We're working very closely with what is the level of support our advisors need, the training, what is the level of, what we will call, activities necessary for them to truly serve these people more fully. And we feel like we have a very strong business model in place that can respond to whether it's both the regulatory but also the consumer dynamics that the consumer is interested in. And the more we speak to the consumer and do research, whether even with millennials or not, they're asking and want more personal advice. They like working in an engaged world and using the digital, et cetera, and we have some of the better digital capabilities. And we've been recognized out as one they want to continue to invest in them, and that includes digital advice. But they want more than something called robo, and they want more than something than a computer model. And so we do feel that we have the ability with our planning model to actually serve this universe. And therefore, we think we continue to be attractive to advisors, particularly, based on a combination and our culture here, built around how the advisor needs to serve the client and how we, as Ameriprise, also interact and connect to help the advises serve the client. So I think there will be some people evaluating going through the deal well. I think our pipeline has been good because we're actually working day to day with our advisors to help them handle this, and we have the compliance and the infrastructure necessary. And I think people will evaluate that over time, particularly, if they're dependent or if they feel like the advice model would work for them a little better as they go forward. So I can't predict what that will ideally look like, but I think we're able to serve them. As far as transition comp, et cetera, we're looking at all the various things. But again, we feel like the way we have set that up and what we can do or even adjust for it, we'll be done in a way that we think can satisfy some of those requirements."

Reconciliation of the non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials. Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and operating plans and performance.

A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in today's earnings release, our 2015 annual report to shareholders, our 2015 10-K report and the first quarter of 2016 10-Q report.  We take no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.

I'll provide my perspective on the business, Walter will discuss our financials and then we'll answer your questions. Domestic equity markets improved in the quarter. Howev",1821,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. I'll provide my perspective on the business, Walter will discuss our financials and then we'll answer your questions. 
Domestic equity markets improved in the quarter. However, internationally, markets remain quiet weak year-over-year-year. Volatility spiked in June, which was reflected in slower client activity. Post Brexit, the British pound weakened significantly and created a difficult foreign exchange translation. Our internally weighted equity index, which aligns to our domestic and international assets under management characteristics, was down 5% on average year-over-year. We ended the quarter with $777 billion in assets under management and administration, which was down a bit year-over-year. And as you're well aware, the low interest rate environment remains a persistent headwind. These are external factors that we can't control. That said, we focused on what we can control: serving our clients, executing our strategy, managing expenses well as we invest in the business and navigating these market movements. 
So how did that translate into our performance? Overall, Ameriprise delivered solid second quarter results. On an operating basis, net revenues reflected the tougher market environment and were down 4% to $2.9 billion. Earnings per diluted share were also down 4% to $2.23, but that includes certain items in the quarter that we highlighted. And our return on equity, excluding AOCI, remained very strong at 23.9%. This is up 40 basis points from a year ago. Both our financial foundation and ability to consistently generate good free cash flow remains strong, and we increased the number of shares we repurchased year-over-year to 4.7 million shares. In total, we returned about 150% of earnings to shareholders, the second consecutive quarter where we've returned at that level. 
Let's move to our business results. In Advice & Wealth Management, our advice value proposition is strong, and we continue to generate good earnings with very good margin. Our advisors and teams are working closely with clients to help them understand the current environment and importantly, to ensure they remain focused on achieving their long-term goals. Naturally, the market volatility in general [indiscernible] in the quarter continued to affect investor behavior. With this volatility, we increased our market commentary and communications for the field to help equip our advisors to have meaningful conversations with their clients. As you expect, clients are cautious and overall transaction activity remain muted. In the quarter, we continue to grow our client base. And in terms of retail clients' assets under management, assets grew to an all-time high in the quarter to $462 billion. 
We continue to have solid flows in the fee-based investment advisory, another $2.3 billion in the quarter where we have one of the largest platforms in the industry. However, given market volatility, brokerage cash balances continue to rise, up 17% from year ago, to more than $23 billion, which can be redeployed in the future. 
I'm feeling good about the strength of our field force. Our advisors take pride in and appreciate the Ameriprise value proposition and strong culture, and that's also very attractive to advisors in the industry. We continue to have terrific advisor satisfaction. I spent time with many of our top advisors at our national conference in May, and they're feeling very good about the value, the support and the growth opportunity they have here. Our Be Brilliant advertising campaign is on the airwaves and being positive we see both on TV as well as online. Ameriprise brand awareness also remains quite strong. Though industry recruiting slowed, this was one of the best quarters for recruiting for Ameriprise. Another 98 experienced advisors with good productivity joined Ameriprise, and our pipeline for rest of the year looks good. Overall, given market pressures, advisors maintain good productivity with operating net revenue per adviser at $5,700 on a 12-month basis. 
From a metrics perspective, we're delivering good profitability, with margins increasing to a strong 17.7% in the quarter. We remain well positioned in the marketplace to take advantage of the growth opportunity as conditions settle. 
Clearly, the Department of Labor fiduciary rule remains a top priority for us. As I've discussed with you, I believe Ameriprise is well positioned to handle the changes required. We have the experience, capabilities, compliance, infrastructure and dedicated teams to ensure we comply with the new rule. As we and others in the industry noted, this is a highly complex rule that requires a thoughtful, rigorous approach. Of course, we'll also be factoring in the department's additional guidance, which they indicated will be coming in the near future. Since the rule's introduction, we've been working closely with our advisors and field leaders to help them understand the requirements and the adjustments we're making to implement them effectively. We're conducting a comprehensive and ongoing series of webcasts, workshops and local training sessions to help them prepare to operate in compliance with the rule. We will continue to deliver a high level of support throughout this transition, which is consistent with our commitment to help our advisors grow their practices. Advisors have been very appreciative of the level of support we're providing. Given what we know, we feel comfortable that we can effectively navigate through it, and we'll keep you apprized as we move forward. 
Let's move to Annuities and Protection. The Annuities and Life and Health insurance businesses are performing as we would expect in a slow interest rate environment. With regard to Annuities, earnings were in line given rates and the equity market pressure on account balances. On the variable side, account balances declined slightly to $75 million and sales slowed year-over-year, which was similar to recent industry trends. A year ago, we had higher sales from new living benefit riders that were well received by our clients and advisers. Keep in mind that variable annuity sales and flows reflect both our current block of business and closed legacy blocks. On the fixed side, the book is performing as expected in a slow interest rate environment. 
In Life and Health, overall business results are within our expectations, including our claims experience. Sales slowed a bit in the quarter consistent with transactional activity. We continue to focus on the asset accumulation portion of the business, primarily in VUL and UL, and providing a high level advisor training service and support. 
With regard to Auto and Home, consistent with the P&C industry, we experienced a high level of cat losses in the quarter, primarily driven by wind and hail storms in southern and central regions of the country. In Auto and Home, we're making more strategic and impactful changes in our business lines to tighten up areas where we had higher loss levels. This is an addition to the pricing, underwriting claims and organizational changes we're making. And we're seeing improvements that will translate into improved financial results in the coming quarters. 
In Asset Management, we're executing a focused strategy for long-term growth. Clearly, the market environment was challenging in the quarter, with both the average equity market declines, high volatility in June and the pound dropping to lowest point against the U.S. dollar in more than 30 years. In this environment, assets under management declined to $460 billion, and we also have onetime expenses, which we previously noted, that impacted earnings in the quarter. Underlying expenses have remained well controlled as we work to preserve margins in the current environment. In terms of investment performance, we continue to generate good long-term performance track records across many asset classes and styles [ph], and this performance looks relatively strong against industry peers. 
Regarding the U.K. referendum, I'm pleased with how we're implementing our initial plans to manage the post U.K. referendum period effectively and providing support and perspective to our clients and investors. The transition will take time, and we have been reinforcing with clients that there is no immediate decisions investors need to take make. As you would expect, we are monitoring decisions in Britain and the EU as we in the industry determine next steps. We have a strong and important business in the U.K., Europe, and we're committed to serving the needs of all of our investors and feel comfortable with our ability to do so going forward. We also have operations in Luxembourg and already have established that fund range that we sell in Europe and we will continue to build upon. 
Now let's move to flows. In the quarter, we experienced $4.7 billion in outflows. About half were driven by lower fee former parent related flows that we discussed with you. Of the remainder in the several of the institutional fundings we expected in the second quarter were delayed due to Brexit. While we should see them come through in the second half of the year, the timing aspect resulted in $2.6 billion in institutional net outflows in the quarter, with approximately $2 billion of very low fee short duration fixed income mandates. 
Overall, our institutional pipeline remains strong. Global retail flows were modestly positive and included invested dividends. In the U.S., we continued to focus on improving market share. And while industry gross sales in the active space were down, our flows improved a bit. And in U.K. and European retail, we saw outflows leading up to the vote as investors were cautious and this turned one negative after the vote. Based on our initial read of flows in the third quarter, this pressure appears to be subsiding. 
I'd like to point out a number of developments in the quarter in the U.S. We announced the acquisition of Emerging Global Advisors, a smart beta provider focused on emerging markets, and we've also launched 3 new equity income smart beta ETFs. Smart beta is a long-term opportunity for us. It's a natural complement to our traditional active business as we take the necessary steps to advance the business. In addition, shareholders supported fund mergers that further strengthened our U.S. product line. And we also launched a new advisor website for Columbia Threadneedle, enhancing the online experience. 
So overall, I feel good about how we're managing a tough and uncertain market environment. The actions we've taken to drive long-term growth are the right ones. We're managing the business prudently to preserve profitability while investing in initiatives to compete in our key regions. As I look at the company overall, Ameriprise is a strong company in a good position with significant opportunity for growth when conditions settle. We're focused on what we can control and delivering a strong client experience. We have the financial stability and capital to navigate the headwinds to continue and invest for growth and return to shareholders at a very attractive level.  And I'd add that very few financial services companies are generating this level of return on equity and returning to shareholders as strongly as Ameriprise. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Walter to discuss the numbers for the quarter in more detail."

Ameriprise continues to navigate the macro conditions well, delivering solid financial results in the quarter. Given the revenue challenges related to the macro environment, we are selectively investing for growth while managing expenses tigh",1074,"Thanks, Jim. Ameriprise continues to navigate the macro conditions well, delivering solid financial results in the quarter. Given the revenue challenges related to the macro environment, we are selectively investing for growth while managing expenses tightly. We believe our stock continues to be undervalued. The valuation combined with our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation allowed us to be opportunistic in the quarter in our share repurchase. 
Let's turn to consolidated results beginning on Slide 6. Macro conditions impacted revenue in a few ways. Our weighted equity index, a proxy for equity market movements on AUM, declined 5% on average year-over-year but was up 6% on average sequentially. This affected average AUM and fees, which are collected based on average daily assets. The dislocation over the past few quarters has muted client activity and contributed to asset management outflows. Low interest rates remained a headwind for our insurance and annuity businesses. And the pound fell at the end of the quarter following the U.K. referendum to leave the European Union, so the foreign exchange translation impacted ending asset levels. With that as a backdrop, you can see how this macro environment impacted operating net revenue, which were down 4% year-over-year. Lower average equity markets reduced revenue by approximately $50 million and also suppressed client transactional activity. On a sequential basis, we saw revenues improve in the quarter up 2%, reflecting improvement in the market index. 
Let's turn to Slide 7. Ameriprise delivered good underlying business performance and EPS in a challenging revenue environment, demonstrating our ability to navigate through business cycles. We're tightly managing expenses while making the right investments to adjust to regulatory and geopolitical changes and support future growth. We're seeing the results of our target reengineering initiatives, which we expect to be realized more in the second half of the year. Pretax earnings declined substantially, driven by market dislocation. However, EPS was only down 4%, reflecting effective tax planning and our significant share repurchase program. Our business model generated significant free cash flow, and our valuation provided a good opportunity to repurchase shares at a discounted level.  In the quarter, we delivered a strong 23.9% return on equity. 
Let's turn to segment performance, starting on Slide 8. First, the advice on Wealth Management business continues to perform very well, delivering solid results in the face of the challenging environment. Jim, spoke about the strong leading indicators we're seeing in this business: excellent EAR recruiting, strong advisor and client retention and record client asset levels. Financial results are also good in this context, while operating net revenue was down about 2% from last year to $1.3 billion in the quarter. It was driven by lower average equity markets and slower transactional activity. These dynamics impacted PTI as well, but PTI also benefited from our disciplined expense management. It should be noted that earnings in this segment improved sequentially due to better equity markets and transactional activity levels, which grew revenue up 4% and earnings up 8%. Operating margin in the quarter was strong at 17.7%, up 40 basis points from last year and up 60 basis points sequentially. Outside of significant market disruption, we expect future margin expansion to continue over time. 
Let's turn to Slide 9 on Asset Management. Clearly, we faced external headwinds in the quarter. The average WEI was down 5% year-over-year, which impacted both revenue and pretax operating earnings. Operating net revenue was down 11% to $739 million, with approximately a quarter of the decline related to markets. The other primary driver of revenue decline was the cumulative impact of net flows. Pretax operating earnings were down 25% to $148 million, which was impacted by markets, outflows as well as the preannounced resolution of a legal matter. I'd like to note that foreign exchange translation impact from Brexit was minimal in the quarter. We are prudently managing expenses, with overall expenses down 7% and G&A down 5%. Looking ahead, we see an opportunity to improve margins as we move to more normalized markets. 
Turning to Annuities on Slide 10. This segment is performing in line with our expectations. Variable annuity pretax operating earnings was $118 million, down slightly from $120 million a year ago. This business was also impacted by market dislocation in terms of the direct impact on account values and lower asset earning rates. The underlying business is solid and the risk are well managed. Fixed annuity pretax operating earnings declined to $28 million due to elevated lapses over the past year as the block has been running off. The earnings in the quarter were a bit better than anticipated due to higher mortality experience among income annuity contract holders. Given the current interest rate environment, there are limited new sales. And as a result, this book is expected to gradually run off and earnings will trend down during the year. 
Turning to the Protection segment on Slide 11. Pretax operating earnings were $37 million in the quarter. Let's focus on Life and Health first. Pretax operating earnings were down from last year, largely due to an $18 million long-term care reserve release in the prior period. Also long-term care claims were elevated in the current year but remained within expected ranges. Auto and Home had an operating loss in the quarter due to preannounced cat losses of $37 million. The combined ratio was 118% in the quarter, which included 14% from cat losses. Underlying results reflect the booking of accident year 2016 incurred losses at a level consistent with the end of 2015. Management has taken action to enhance underwriting, pricing and claims practices, which are driving improvement in frequency and severity trends in both short and long tailed coverages. As these business trends continue to emerge, we anticipate that they will begin to be reflected in the financial results. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Slide 12. As we have told you before, Ameriprise maintains a strong balance sheet that we will use opportunistically. We have approximately $2 billion of excess capital, and our estimated RBC ratio remains above 500%. Our hedging program continues to work well, and the investment portfolio is diversified. We returned approximately 150% of operating earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase again this quarter, well above our baseline of 90% to 100% of earnings. We repurchased 4.7 million shares in the quarter, up significantly from a year ago. 
With that, we will take your questions."

We'll go through that review as we are now, consistent with any changes necessary, required by the department in that -- under the exemption, et cetera. So we might tighten the range a little bit. We might tighten things more formally against the entire platform. But we don't see a radical shift at this point in time for what we're offering, because we already put those products and services through a level of due diligence appropriate. We may look to things, ensure that they're more equalized than any other offerings and some of the services rendered and the commission structure on them. That's what we're reviewing right now. As far as the platform fees, again, we will look to make sure that, that is very consistent and within tight ranges appropriate, so that there is no differences that would in any way influence even from an objective view in the offering. And so those are the things that we're working on right now, but we don't see a dramatic shift for what we've been doing."

We always mentioned that there would be a normal outflow from our arrangements with Zurich and U.S. Trust over time, just as Zurich is closed book. We constantly get a level of outflows. Having said that, the book has been relatively stable with reinvestments and other things and appreciation, where we manage roughly equivalent levels of assets over time but we always have to book that outflow as it comes through and that always looks like a negative. In U.S. Trust, as an example, there is always a level of that just because there's a -- as new sales come into U.S. Trust or as their level of sales may have gone down, when we purchased it, it was a larger base of their assets. And so there's always a little difference between a level of redemption and a level of new sales, and we expected that. And that's normally what occurred. What occurred over the last number of quarters was that U.S. Trust decided to take some of their separate account fixed income business back in-house and in that regard, we suffered a little level -- higher level of outflows from some of the dedicated activities we did for them. That looks like it now has slowed through the end of the second quarter, and we think that will go back to a more normalized number.

So we look at the annuity as part of a broader solution set against our overall account and retirement plan for the client. And they're really sold as a solution for a piece of their activities, and we really have educated and we work with our advisors to understand where they would provide the essential income as a piece of that income drawdown plan. So that's the way we've done business for a while. And as you can see, our business has been very stable in the amount of sales that we've been consistently because they're not sold as just a product out there but as part of the broader solution. Now with that, every sale of our annuity goes through a pre-approval process and an upfront review compliance, et cetera, to ensure that it is fit and appropriate for that client. So that process that we already have in place will be the same process that will be in place as we move forward. There's always a few things and tweaks that we'll make sure are complemented there based on any other additional sort of thought process necessary. But we believe that the extent of the process that we have in place already goes to that level of due diligence and review. And where it is appropriate in a qualified account, that's what we'll review today in a very rigorous way. So we don't see a fundamental change in the way we do business regarding the sale of that product. Now could there be adjustment in some of the activity there, the answer is always yes. But that's something we'll see over time where necessary, but we don't see a fundamental change driven by a change in a fundamental process that we have in place or review that we currently do. In addition, there maybe some move to more of a level load over time rather than upfront commission. But again, that will depend on what circumstances or how the advisor thinks about it, but we're not planning for a fundamental shift in our annuity business."

And we feel like we have a very strong business model in place that can respond to whether it's both the regulatory but also the consumer dynamics that the consumer is interested in. And the more we speak to the consumer and do research, whether even with millennials or not, they're asking and want more personal advice. They like working in an engaged world and using the digital, et cetera, and we have some of the better digital capabilities.

So I think there will be some people evaluating going through the deal well. I think our pipeline has been good because we're actually working day to day with our advisors to help them handle this, and we have the compliance and the infrastructure necessary. And I think people will evaluate that over time, particularly, if they're independent or if they feel like the advice model would work for them a little better as they go forward.

But with that, we are still very open to look at complementary acquisitions as this world continues to change and if consolidation continues to occur. And I think we have the wherewithal to do that. I think we've shown that we can do that successfully, and that we would look for other activities or companies that would fit in what we're trying to orchestrate and find that as an opportunity. So we're very much open to that as the world continues. And as I said, we still have a very strong capital base. We're not over-leveraged. We have the ability to do that while at the same time, we have the ability to return to shareholders."

Slide 2 of the earnings presentation material available on our website includes the discussion of forward-looking statements, specifically, that during the call, you will hear reference to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials. Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in today's earnings release, our 2015 annual report to shareholders, our 2015 10-K report and the first quarter of 2016 10-Q report. We take no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements. 
Turning to Slide 3. You see our GAAP financial results for the second quarter. Below that, you see our operating results, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. The comments that management make on the call today will focus on operating financial results.

I'll provide my perspective on the business, Walter will discuss our financials and then we'll answer your questions. Domestic equity markets improved in the quarter. Howev",1821,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. I'll provide my perspective on the business, Walter will discuss our financials and then we'll answer your questions. 
Domestic equity markets improved in the quarter. However, internationally, markets remain quiet weak year-over-year-year. Volatility spiked in June, which was reflected in slower client activity. Post Brexit, the British pound weakened significantly and created a difficult foreign exchange translation. Our internally weighted equity index, which aligns to our domestic and international assets under management characteristics, was down 5% on average year-over-year. We ended the quarter with $777 billion in assets under management and administration, which was down a bit year-over-year. And as you're well aware, the low interest rate environment remains a persistent headwind. These are external factors that we can't control. That said, we focused on what we can control: serving our clients, executing our strategy, managing expenses well as we invest in the business and navigating these market movements. 
So how did that translate into our performance? Overall, Ameriprise delivered solid second quarter results. On an operating basis, net revenues reflected the tougher market environment and were down 4% to $2.9 billion. Earnings per diluted share were also down 4% to $2.23, but that includes certain items in the quarter that we highlighted. And our return on equity, excluding AOCI, remained very strong at 23.9%. This is up 40 basis points from a year ago. Both our financial foundation and ability to consistently generate good free cash flow remains strong, and we increased the number of shares we repurchased year-over-year to 4.7 million shares. In total, we returned about 150% of earnings to shareholders, the second consecutive quarter where we've returned at that level. 
Let's move to our business results. In Advice & Wealth Management, our advice value proposition is strong, and we continue to generate good earnings with very good margin. Our advisors and teams are working closely with clients to help them understand the current environment and importantly, to ensure they remain focused on achieving their long-term goals. Naturally, the market volatility in general [indiscernible] in the quarter continued to affect investor behavior. With this volatility, we increased our market commentary and communications for the field to help equip our advisors to have meaningful conversations with their clients. As you expect, clients are cautious and overall transaction activity remain muted. In the quarter, we continue to grow our client base. And in terms of retail clients' assets under management, assets grew to an all-time high in the quarter to $462 billion. 
We continue to have solid flows in the fee-based investment advisory, another $2.3 billion in the quarter where we have one of the largest platforms in the industry. However, given market volatility, brokerage cash balances continue to rise, up 17% from year ago, to more than $23 billion, which can be redeployed in the future. 
I'm feeling good about the strength of our field force. Our advisors take pride in and appreciate the Ameriprise value proposition and strong culture, and that's also very attractive to advisors in the industry. We continue to have terrific advisor satisfaction. I spent time with many of our top advisors at our national conference in May, and they're feeling very good about the value, the support and the growth opportunity they have here. Our Be Brilliant advertising campaign is on the airwaves and being positive we see both on TV as well as online. Ameriprise brand awareness also remains quite strong. Though industry recruiting slowed, this was one of the best quarters for recruiting for Ameriprise. Another 98 experienced advisors with good productivity joined Ameriprise, and our pipeline for rest of the year looks good. Overall, given market pressures, advisors maintain good productivity with operating net revenue per adviser at $5,700 on a 12-month basis. 
From a metrics perspective, we're delivering good profitability, with margins increasing to a strong 17.7% in the quarter. We remain well positioned in the marketplace to take advantage of the growth opportunity as conditions settle. 
Clearly, the Department of Labor fiduciary rule remains a top priority for us. As I've discussed with you, I believe Ameriprise is well positioned to handle the changes required. We have the experience, capabilities, compliance, infrastructure and dedicated teams to ensure we comply with the new rule. As we and others in the industry noted, this is a highly complex rule that requires a thoughtful, rigorous approach. Of course, we'll also be factoring in the department's additional guidance, which they indicated will be coming in the near future. Since the rule's introduction, we've been working closely with our advisors and field leaders to help them understand the requirements and the adjustments we're making to implement them effectively. We're conducting a comprehensive and ongoing series of webcasts, workshops and local training sessions to help them prepare to operate in compliance with the rule. We will continue to deliver a high level of support throughout this transition, which is consistent with our commitment to help our advisors grow their practices. Advisors have been very appreciative of the level of support we're providing. Given what we know, we feel comfortable that we can effectively navigate through it, and we'll keep you apprized as we move forward. 
Let's move to Annuities and Protection. The Annuities and Life and Health insurance businesses are performing as we would expect in a slow interest rate environment. With regard to Annuities, earnings were in line given rates and the equity market pressure on account balances. On the variable side, account balances declined slightly to $75 million and sales slowed year-over-year, which was similar to recent industry trends. A year ago, we had higher sales from new living benefit riders that were well received by our clients and advisers. Keep in mind that variable annuity sales and flows reflect both our current block of business and closed legacy blocks. On the fixed side, the book is performing as expected in a slow interest rate environment. 
In Life and Health, overall business results are within our expectations, including our claims experience. Sales slowed a bit in the quarter consistent with transactional activity. We continue to focus on the asset accumulation portion of the business, primarily in VUL and UL, and providing a high level advisor training service and support. 
With regard to Auto and Home, consistent with the P&C industry, we experienced a high level of cat losses in the quarter, primarily driven by wind and hail storms in southern and central regions of the country. In Auto and Home, we're making more strategic and impactful changes in our business lines to tighten up areas where we had higher loss levels. This is an addition to the pricing, underwriting claims and organizational changes we're making. And we're seeing improvements that will translate into improved financial results in the coming quarters. 
In Asset Management, we're executing a focused strategy for long-term growth. Clearly, the market environment was challenging in the quarter, with both the average equity market declines, high volatility in June and the pound dropping to lowest point against the U.S. dollar in more than 30 years. In this environment, assets under management declined to $460 billion, and we also have onetime expenses, which we previously noted, that impacted earnings in the quarter. Underlying expenses have remained well controlled as we work to preserve margins in the current environment. In terms of investment performance, we continue to generate good long-term performance track records across many asset classes and styles [ph], and this performance looks relatively strong against industry peers. 
Regarding the U.K. referendum, I'm pleased with how we're implementing our initial plans to manage the post U.K. referendum period effectively and providing support and perspective to our clients and investors. The transition will take time, and we have been reinforcing with clients that there is no immediate decisions investors need to take make. As you would expect, we are monitoring decisions in Britain and the EU as we in the industry determine next steps. We have a strong and important business in the U.K., Europe, and we're committed to serving the needs of all of our investors and feel comfortable with our ability to do so going forward. We also have operations in Luxembourg and already have established that fund range that we sell in Europe and we will continue to build upon. 
Now let's move to flows. In the quarter, we experienced $4.7 billion in outflows. About half were driven by lower fee former parent related flows that we discussed with you. Of the remainder in the several of the institutional fundings we expected in the second quarter were delayed due to Brexit. While we should see them come through in the second half of the year, the timing aspect resulted in $2.6 billion in institutional net outflows in the quarter, with approximately $2 billion of very low fee short duration fixed income mandates. 
Overall, our institutional pipeline remains strong. Global retail flows were modestly positive and included invested dividends. In the U.S., we continued to focus on improving market share. And while industry gross sales in the active space were down, our flows improved a bit. And in U.K. and European retail, we saw outflows leading up to the vote as investors were cautious and this turned one negative after the vote. Based on our initial read of flows in the third quarter, this pressure appears to be subsiding. 
I'd like to point out a number of developments in the quarter in the U.S. We announced the acquisition of Emerging Global Advisors, a smart beta provider focused on emerging markets, and we've also launched 3 new equity income smart beta ETFs. Smart beta is a long-term opportunity for us. It's a natural complement to our traditional active business as we take the necessary steps to advance the business. In addition, shareholders supported fund mergers that further strengthened our U.S. product line. And we also launched a new advisor website for Columbia Threadneedle, enhancing the online experience. 
So overall, I feel good about how we're managing a tough and uncertain market environment. The actions we've taken to drive long-term growth are the right ones. We're managing the business prudently to preserve profitability while investing in initiatives to compete in our key regions. As I look at the company overall, Ameriprise is a strong company in a good position with significant opportunity for growth when conditions settle. We're focused on what we can control and delivering a strong client experience. We have the financial stability and capital to navigate the headwinds to continue and invest for growth and return to shareholders at a very attractive level. And I'd add that very few financial services companies are generating this level of return on equity and returning to shareholders as strongly as Ameriprise. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Walter to discuss the numbers for the quarter in more detail."

Ameriprise continues to navigate the macro conditions well, delivering solid financial results in the quarter.

Ameriprise continues to navigate the macro conditions well, delivering solid financial results in the quarter. Given the revenue challenges related to the macro environment, we are selectively investing for growth while managing expenses tightly. We believe our stock continues to be undervalued. The valuation combined with our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation allowed us to be opportunistic in the quarter in our share repurchase. 
Let's turn to consolidated results beginning on Slide 6. Macro conditions impacted revenue in a few ways. Our weighted equity index, a proxy for equity market movements on AUM, declined 5% on average year-over-year but was up 6% on average sequentially. This affected average AUM and fees, which are collected based on average daily assets. The dislocation over the past few quarters has muted client activity and contributed to asset management outflows. Low interest rates remained a headwind for our insurance and annuity businesses. And the pound fell at the end of the quarter following the U.K. referendum to leave the European Union, so the foreign exchange translation impacted ending asset levels. With that as a backdrop, you can see how this macro environment impacted operating net revenue, which were down 4% year-over-year. Lower average equity markets reduced revenue by approximately $50 million and also suppressed client transactional activity. On a sequential basis, we saw revenues improve in the quarter up 2%, reflecting improvement in the market index. 
Let's turn to Slide 7. Ameriprise delivered good underlying business performance and EPS in a challenging revenue environment, demonstrating our ability to navigate through business cycles. We're tightly managing expenses while making the right investments to adjust to regulatory and geopolitical changes and support future growth. We're seeing the results of our target reengineering initiatives, which we expect to be realized more in the second half of the year. Pretax earnings declined substantially, driven by market dislocation. However, EPS was only down 4%, reflecting effective tax planning and our significant share repurchase program. Our business model generated significant free cash flow, and our valuation provided a good opportunity to repurchase shares at a discounted level. In the quarter, we delivered a strong 23.9% return on equity. 
Let's turn to segment performance, starting on Slide 8. First, the advice on Wealth Management business continues to perform very well, delivering solid results in the face of the challenging environment. Jim, spoke about the strong leading indicators we're seeing in this business: excellent EAR recruiting, strong advisor and client retention and record client asset levels. Financial results are also good in this context, while operating net revenue was down about 2% from last year to $1.3 billion in the quarter. It was driven by lower average equity markets and slower transactional activity. These dynamics impacted PTI as well, but PTI also benefited from our disciplined expense management. It should be noted that earnings in this segment improved sequentially due to better equity markets and transactional activity levels, which grew revenue up 4% and earnings up 8%. Operating margin in the quarter was strong at 17.7%, up 40 basis points from last year and up 60 basis points sequentially. Outside of significant market disruption, we expect future margin expansion to continue over time. 
Let's turn to Slide 9 on Asset Management. Clearly, we faced external headwinds in the quarter. The average WEI was down 5% year-over-year, which impacted both revenue and pretax operating earnings. Operating net revenue was down 11% to $739 million, with approximately a quarter of the decline related to markets. The other primary driver of revenue decline was the cumulative impact of net flows. Pretax operating earnings were down 25% to $148 million, which was impacted by markets, outflows as well as the preannounced resolution of a legal matter. I'd like to note that foreign exchange translation impact from Brexit was minimal in the quarter. We are prudently managing expenses, with overall expenses down 7% and G&A down 5%. Looking ahead, we see an opportunity to improve margins as we move to more normalized markets. 
Turning to Annuities on Slide 10. This segment is performing in line with our expectations. Variable annuity pretax operating earnings was $118 million, down slightly from $120 million a year ago. This business was also impacted by market dislocation in terms of the direct impact on account values and lower asset earning rates. The underlying business is solid and the risk are well managed. Fixed annuity pretax operating earnings declined to $28 million due to elevated lapses over the past year as the block has been running off. The earnings in the quarter were a bit better than anticipated due to higher mortality experience among income annuity contract holders. Given the current interest rate environment, there are limited new sales. And as a result, this book is expected to gradually run off and earnings will trend down during the year. 
Turning to the Protection segment on Slide 11. Pretax operating earnings were $37 million in the quarter. Let's focus on Life and Health first. Pretax operating earnings were down from last year, largely due to an $18 million long-term care reserve release in the prior period. Also long-term care claims were elevated in the current year but remained within expected ranges. Auto and Home had an operating loss in the quarter due to preannounced cat losses of $37 million. The combined ratio was 118% in the quarter, which included 14% from cat losses. Underlying results reflect the booking of accident year 2016 incurred losses at a level consistent with the end of 2015. Management has taken action to enhance underwriting, pricing and claims practices, which are driving improvement in frequency and severity trends in both short and long tailed coverages. As these business trends continue to emerge, we anticipate that they will begin to be reflected in the financial results. 
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Slide 12. As we have told you before, Ameriprise maintains a strong balance sheet that we will use opportunistically. We have approximately $2 billion of excess capital, and our estimated RBC ratio remains above 500%. Our hedging program continues to work well, and the investment portfolio is diversified. We returned approximately 150% of operating earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase again this quarter, well above our baseline of 90% to 100% of earnings. We repurchased 4.7 million shares in the quarter, up significantly from a year ago. 
With that, we will take your questions."

We always mentioned that there would be a normal outflow from our arrangements with Zurich and U.S. Trust over time, just as Zurich is closed book. We constantly get a level of outflows. Having said that, the book has been relatively stable with reinvestments and other things and appreciation, where we manage roughly equivalent levels of assets over time but we always have to book that outflow as it comes through and that always looks like a negative. In U.S. Trust, as an example, there is always a level of that just because there's a -- as new sales come into U.S. Trust or as their level of sales may have gone down, when we purchased it, it was a larger base of their assets. And so there's always a little difference between a level of redemption and a level of new sales, and we expected that. And that's normally what occurred. What occurred over the last number of quarters was that U.S. Trust decided to take some of their separate account fixed income business back in-house and in that regard, we suffered a little level -- higher level of outflows from some of the dedicated activities we did for them. That looks like it now has slowed through the end of the second quarter, and we think that will go back to a more normalized number.

So we look at the annuity as part of a broader solution set against our overall account and retirement plan for the client. And they're really sold as a solution for a piece of their activities, and we really have educated and we work with our advisors to understand where they would provide the essential income as a piece of that income drawdown plan. So that's the way we've done business for a while. And as you can see, our business has been very stable in the amount of sales that we've been consistently because they're not sold as just a product out there but as part of the broader solution. Now with that, every sale of our annuity goes through a pre-approval process and an upfront review compliance, et cetera, to ensure that it is fit and appropriate for that client. So that process that we already have in place will be the same process that will be in place as we move forward. There's always a few things and tweaks that we'll make sure are complemented there based on any other additional sort of thought process necessary. But we believe that the extent of the process that we have in place already goes to that level of due diligence and review. And where it is appropriate in a qualified account, that's what we'll review today in a very rigorous way. So we don't see a fundamental change in the way we do business regarding the sale of that product. Now could there be adjustment in some of the activity there, the answer is always yes. But that's something we'll see over time where necessary, but we don't see a fundamental change driven by a change in a fundamental process that we have in place or review that we currently do. In addition, there may be some move to more of a level load over time rather than upfront commission.

We're working very closely with what is the level of support our advisors need, the training, what is the level of, what we will call, activities necessary for them to truly serve these people more fully. And we feel like we have a very strong business model in place that can respond to whether it's both the regulatory but also the consumer dynamics that the consumer is interested in. And the more we speak to the consumer and do research, whether even with millennials or not, they're asking and want more personal advice. They like working in an engaged world and using the digital, et cetera, and we have some of the better digital capabilities. And we've been recognized out there and we're continuing to invest in them, and that includes digital advice. But they want more than something called robo, and they want more than something than a computer model. And so we do feel that we have the ability with our planning model to actually serve this universe. And therefore, we think we continue to be attractive to advisors, particularly, based on a combination of that and our culture here, built around how the advisor needs to serve the client and how we, as Ameriprise, also interact and connect to help the advises serve the client. So I think there will be some people evaluating going through the deal well. I think our pipeline has been good because we're actually working day to day with our advisors to help them handle this, and we have the compliance and the infrastructure necessary. And I think people will evaluate that over time, particularly, if they're independent or if they feel like the advice model would work for them a little better as they go forward. So I can't predict what that will ideally look like, but I think we're able to serve them. As far as transition comp, et cetera, we're looking at all the various things. But again, we feel like the way we have set that up and what we can do or even adjust for it, will be done in a way that we think can satisfy some of those requirements."

Specifically, that during the call, you will hear reference to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials. Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

We take no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.
Turning to Slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results for the third quarter. Below that, you see our operating results, which management believes enhance the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. Additionally, we completed our annual noncash unlocking and long-term security in the third quarter. We included operating results, excluding unlocking, for additional transparency. The comments of management makes on the call today will focus on operating financial results as well as results excluding unlocking.

I'll provide my perspective on the business and the progress we're making, and Walt will discuss our financials, including the noncash impact of annual unlocking. 
Regarding Ameriprise overall, like others, we're experiencing headwinds in the operating environment from industry trends, the regulatory change agenda globally as well as geopolitical volatility. During the time of change for the industry, I feel good about how Ameriprise is positioned in our focus on serving our clients and advisers. The current environment amplifies the value of the advising solutions that Ameriprise provides. Today, I'll cover our underlying operating results, excluding unlocking. Total assets under management, administration increased nicely to $796 billion, and that includes the typical foreign exchange translation and asset management. Financially, earnings were down a bit, while earnings per diluted share, excluding unlocking, increased 4%. As always, we're closely managing our expenses while continuing to invest for growth. Return on equity, excluding unlocking and AOCI, was a healthy 23.8%. Our business generates good free cash flow. And as you know, maintaining our excellent financial foundation is core to how we operate the company. These consistent management principles enable Ameriprise to navigate this time of change and invest in the business as well as return capital to shareholders at a meaningful level. For the third quarter, we returned more than $500 million to shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total return for 2016 so far to more than $1.6 billion. 
Let's move to the businesses. In Advice & Wealth Management, we're situated well with our strong advice positioning and value proposition. I spent a lot of time during the year with our advisers and just returned from our private wealth advisers conference with over our 900 of our top producers are gathered. They're feeling good about their ability to run strong practices and the growth opportunity at Ameriprise as well as the way we support them during times of change. We believe more than ever our advice value proposition is strong and desirable. Personnel comprehensive advice is critical in handling the volatility and issues facing consumers as they look to achieve their long-term goals. For the quarter, retail client assets grew nicely, up 10%, and we had nearly $3 billion in net inflows in fee-based investment event advisory accounts in the quarter. Our investment advisory platform is in the top 5 of mutual fund adviser and consistent growth driver for Ameriprise. In addition, we delivered operating earnings of $231 million, up 5% from a year ago; and our margin increased to 18.2% for the quarter. 
As we continue to serve more clients in fee-based relationships, transactional business represents less of our total production. As an example, more than 70% of our gross deal concession is asset-based. Average advice productivity is holding strong at over $500,000 on a trailing 12-month basis. As we look to grow the business, we're ensuring advisers fully benefit from the investments we've made, including our technology platforms, our e-tools and online. Our advisers are more efficient when they use capabilities like our e-file delivery and e-signature tools and more productive when they use our aggregation tool like Total View. We're meeting more and more clients online, and visits to ameriprise.com are up significantly year-over-year. And engagement with clients and prospects on social media is a continued strength of ours. Brand awareness is another component for growth. We're back on the air with our Be Brilliant advertising. And the next chapter of our Be Brilliant ads will be live in January as we continue to reinforce the confidence clients can realize from working with Ameriprise adviser. In addition to focusing on client growth, recruiting is going well. We added another 80 experienced, productive advisers, bring us to about 250 advisers year-to-date. And our pipeline is looking good into the next quarter and next year as Ameriprise stands out as a destination for successful advisers who appreciate our advice value proposition and supportive culture.
Now let's turn to the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule. Clearly, it's a significant change for the industry and a top priority for us. I believe Ameriprise is well positioned to handle the changes required to respond to the rule and to help advisers do the same. Frankly, this is a complex change, and it will continue to consume a lot of our energy. We're dedicating significant resources and leadership them to manage it in a regimented way. 
Consistent with our financial planning leadership, Ameriprise is one of the largest providers of fee-based investment advice, and we already operate as a fiduciary after a very high standard of care. In terms of our product offering, we're focused on minimizing disruption to our clients and ensuring our advisers continue to have a broad suite of solutions to help meet client needs, grow and protect the assets and achieve their goals. We continue to believe providing the best of choice is important, and therefore, we've been hard at work to enable both advisory and brokerage options for clients and advisers. Ameriprise has a very strong client's foundation and conducts robust due diligence of the product and platforms we offer. We've always been although able to operate in a heavily regulated environment and comply with the requirements while also delivering an excellent client experience as we focus on helping our clients achieving their financial goals over a lifetime. Because of our robust position and compliant processes and training already in place, we're operating from a position of strength relative to many others in the industry. As a company, we think all of these elements very seriously and worked to integrate compliance and supervision throughout our business processes across the firm. Here's how we're approaching the rule and the support we're providing our advisers to adopt to the new landscape. Let's start with our investment advisory business. 
We're making the choice to use long-standing exemptions under for our investment advisory business, and we believe this is the most appropriate way to continue to offer clients more flexibility and investment choices while offering our advice the most protection and flexibility. The adjustments necessary to comply with this rule will be fully executed by the end of the first quarter of next year to be ready for the April deadline, and we're working with advisers now to help them execute the changes. 
With that, I'll turn to brokerage and our commission business. We intend to use the exception for brokerage and other commission-based recommendations. The deal will introduce the BIC and large part to address your challenges for brokerage and other commission-based accounts under the framework. The big exception amid compensation that varies by product as long as the requirements of the exemption are met. This is an area where we are starting to see some changes across the industry relating to product availability and product compensation as it would apply to products like mutual funds and annuities. Ameriprise, like others in the industry, will likely need to their offering help advisers meet the rules and duties of prudence and loyalty. Similar to the approach we're taking in an advisory, we want to continue to offer flexibility  and choice. In addition, we have best-in-class due diligence and strong supervision, which will further enhance, where necessary, with both qualitative, quantitative filters to ensure the country to have robust solutions that will be appropriate in the qualified market. As you know, there will also be new requirements for IRA [indiscernible]. Today, we have industry-leading [indiscernible] or approach that help clients evaluate their options for the retirement plan assets and working right now to determine how we will enhance that as appropriate. We will also build on our already strong and comprehensive rollover education disclosure materials and documentation to meet the given expectations. As you would expect, it's very important to us to bring this to life for advisers to support them to comply with the new rule. Last April, we began executing our comprehensive communications and training plan, including holding a series of webcasts that continue to throughout the remainder of the year. Throughout the first quarter, we'll be conducting extensive local in-person training to help our advisers and the teams prepare to comply for the initial effect of the date of April 10. Clearly, this is a large change agenda for the industry. We have devoted tremendous resources and are making progress and have a lot of work to do, and you'll see that across the industry whether or how they decide to do business. We continue to review the regulation in all of its intricacies to ensure we can meet all the requirements of the new fiduciary standards to minimize potential exposure to the firm and our advisers for having due diligence, analysis and documentation as well as the appropriate supervision necessary. Given what we know, we feel comfortable that we can effectively navigate through it. Next quarter, I will share even more about our compliance approach and progress and our training and implementation. Again, we feel comfortable that we will continue to offer a broad suite of products with the necessary oversight. As I stated earlier, we already apply a rigorous review and due diligence on products we offer and have extensive disclosures in place. While there'll be additional disclosures and documentation for our adviser going forward, based on what we know at this time, we believe these requirements will be manageable. In this regulatory environment, the importance of delivering advice is even more significant than ever. We know clients and consumers are looking for us to serve them holistically. The growth opportunity we have is compelling. 
To summarize, we're delivering nice growth and profitability in Advice & Wealth Management. We're working closely and comprehensively with advisers to manage the overall change ahead. And we feel good about our near- and long-term opportunity to serve even more consumers with advice. 
Let's move to annuities and protection. I'll focus more on the underlying businesses, and Walt will cover the financials. In annuities, DA account balance is about 4% year-over-year. And while our DA sales are down year-over-year, we look to be better than the industry given our financial planning focus. We're helping our advisers meet their clients' retirement income needs to make it easier for clients and advisers to conduct business. As an example, we've seen good results from the adviser workshops we held, which focus on the new challenges for today's retirement. And we've seen good uptake on our enhanced digital tools that help advisers present retirement solutions. On the fix side, the story remains the same. The overall book is performing as expected in the slow interest rate environment, and we're not adding to it at this time.
In life insurance, the UL, UL account balances were up 5%, and overall sales were down like others in the industry. Overall, claims experience remain within an expected range. During the quarter, we launched an index account for our VUL product that provides the benefits of accumulating cash value with the added safety of an index core, and we're seeing a nice initial response by clients and advisers. 
Finally, in auto and home, we begin to see improvements in business results from the changes we've been making. Both current and our accident year loss trends are showing solid improvement. As I shared previously, we're taking a number of actions, including enhanced pricing sophistication and raising rates in both Auto and Home all the lines, with improved risk quality through tighter underwriting and more disciplined exposure management. We also enhanced our claims organization, and as a result, we're seeing better outcomes that will contribute to a higher-performing portfolio over time. 
With regard to the quarter, in leading with many industry players, we have higher-than-expected capital as we're making systemic changes to lessen the impact of cats on our results, including improving cats-related pricing and strengthening the team handling cats claims, including adding more field adjusters. Overall, we're making good progress. I feel more confident in the team we now have in place and the actions that we're taking to bring the business back to historical profitability. 
Let's turn to asset management. During this significant period change for the industry, we're managing headwinds and had a good level of scale, capabilities and distributions to navigate this period well. For the quarter, assets under management declined slightly to $468 billion. However, that included an unfavorable foreign exchange translation, which impacted assets under management by about $14 billion year-over-year. In terms of [indiscernible] we had a little over $4 billion out in the quarter compared to more than $7 billion at this time last year. Global retail outflows improved substantially to $1.9 billion in the quarter, excluding former parent company-related flows and inflows from acquisitions. In the U.S. retail, we're seeing some improvement. While we're in outflows, we've improved gross sales by nearly 10% over the past 12 months. We're also earning a higher market share on many of our key intermediary distribution platforms. This is at a time when overall industry sales in the active space are down and we're all facing slower activity on the equity side of the business. Overall, redemptions have slowed, and that includes in the Acorn fund, which was about $600 million out in the quarter. Performance versus peers has improved with the changes that we made, and we're focused on continuing to generate competitive performance to strengthen long-term numbers and helping the turnaround of this product line. 
In the U.K. and European retail, as you know, retail outflows spiked in June and July because of Brexit. As we moved through the quarter, the level of redemptions slowed to end the quarter largely neutral. Our teams have done an excellent job navigating this environment, including in the property space where we preserved value for investors and has moved the reopening of our fund. If market conditions remain stable for the remainder of the year, we expect better results in the fourth quarter. In terms of institutional, we and others industry have experienced a slowdown in the rate of funding, which contributed to about $2 billion in outflows in the quarter. That included a loss of one of the remaining Acorn mandates around $700 million in the quarter. We feel good about the rest of '16 and into '17 as our list of one not funded mandates is good, with wins in both domestic and international that should fund in the fourth quarter and into next year. Our win rate remains strong, and we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities in a number of equity credit and solution multi-asset strategies. Consistent with our normal level of outflows in the form of parent portfolios, we had about $1.4 billion of lower fee outflows with the majority from Zürich. Outflows in U.S. Trust IMA significantly slowed as we moved through the quarter. I would also note, we had about $1 billion of inflows from the EGA acquisition. 
Regarding performance, we're very focused on ensuring we have a strong performing credit lines to serve individual and institutional investor needs that includes delivering consistent performance expectations in existing products and developing new product and strategies as we look forward. With a 110 foreign five-star Morningstar-rated funds, Colombia Threadneedle as an excellent track record of generating competitive performance across asset classes and stocks. We have particular strong performance in a number of funds in domestic and international equities as well as across taxable and tax-exempt fixed income at Colombia and asset allocation products globally. 
In regard to U.K. and Europe, we've been able to remain focused on our business and feel we're in a good position to manage the change related to Brexit in what will be a multiyear transition. Colombia Threadneedle already has an established fund range and presence in Europe, and we're in a good position to continue to serve European investors going forward. We're focused on expanding the scope of our Luxembourg-based management company. We plan to further replicate a more complete product line and establish a broader asset management presence in the EU post-Brexit. Importantly, we have a well-resourced and experienced product development team with a capacity to ensure the needs of our clients are met in an efficient and transparent manner. Like the industry, we'll be looking for further clarification that will inform us and others on how to manage the transition of our clients. Again, this will take time, but I feel that we're in a good position.
As we look forward, we're doing a number of things on the product development side to capture flows. In addition to enhancements to our traditional mutual fund product line, we're further building out our managed account and solution businesses. We're seeing good interest in our multi-asset, tax-efficient and adaptive-risk products. In fact, our U.S. retail product has grown to north of $1 billion in assets under management. We've also completed the EGA acquisition that strengthened our strategic data and ETF capabilities and complements multi-products we developed and launched earlier this year. This is a long-term growth opportunity in the U.S. that we're beginning to build upon. 
Finally, we are a recognized leader in the U.K. for responsible investment, and we're working to expand that capability here in the United States. Our U.S. social bond fund is a unique product, and our recently launched strategic data products include a sustainability screen. Similar to strategic data work, it's an initiative that we intend to grow more fully over time. 
Our asset management business is and at scale business, and we're generating competitive margin in a challenging period. We're managing expenses well, knowing we have revenue pressure from the level of outflows we've experienced. We're seeing some nice underlying trends in domestic and international. We have more work to do, and I feel good about the teams in place and their execution focus. 
Now for Ameriprise overall, we have a strong base and a good track record for handling periods of industry change. Ameriprise has always been able to operate in a heavily regulated environment, strongly compliant, delivering excellent experience as we help clients achieve their financial goals. Our excellent capital position provides flexibility for both organic growth and inorganic opportunities in both wealth management and asset management. We also have a very solid annuities and protections business. We're bringing in a very strong focus so that we can navigate the current environment. As we look forward, I feel good about the long-term opportunity Ameriprise has in the marketplace as we focus on delivering for our clients. 
Now Walt will cover the financials, and I'll be back to take your questions."

And as the management remains impacted by industry trends away from active management, but we're seeing good traction in few areas that Jim discussed and maintaining our focus on sustaining a good level of profitability.
Annuities and life and health insurance underlying profitability remains stable, but with slower growth in the short term given the environment and regulatory changes. This remains a strong source of capital generation. Our trends continue to emerge in Auto and Home, and we began to recognize them in their financial results this quarter, potentially with more to come as we evaluate loss performance. Our balance sheet is strong, and we returned over $500 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter.
Let's turn to consolidated results beginning on Slide 6. Revenue was up slightly from last year to $2.9 billion. Excluding the impact of unlocking in both years, Advice & Wealth Management represents more than 40% of overall revenues and continues to trend up given our good growth in client assets. This was offset by pressure from outflows and asset management and insurance and annuities interest rate pressure. Auto and Home has had a nice revenue growth from the rate actions taken, with rate increases in about 3/4 of the states we do business with during 2016.
Let's turn to Slide 7. Ameriprise continues to demonstrate our ability to navigate across business cycles and deliver a solid EPS growth and a strong return on equity. Operating performance in the quarter included a net negative $0.12 of items. First, we had $29 million pretax or $0.11 of total catastrophic losses in the quarter, of which $0.03 was above our expectations. Additionally, we had $0.11 on favorable long-term care model corrections and $0.06 of unusual corporate items related to low-income housing and DOL implementation, partially offset by a positive $0.08 from [indiscernible] and in Auto and Home reserve release. Excluding these items, underlying EPS was $2.41, up 4%. We're managing expenses while making the right investments to adjust the regulatory changes and support future growth. We would expect the overall expenses to ramp up as we approach of the DOL implementation date in April.
Our business continues to generate significant free cash flow, and disciplined capital management has driven EPS and return on equity growth. 
Let's turn to segment performance, starting on Slide 8. First, the advice & Wealth Management businesses continues to perform very well, delivering solid financial results and strong business metrics. Jim spoke about a strong leading indicators we see in this business. Excellent recruiting, stronger advisory retention and client acquisition are all contributing to record client asset levels. Operating net revenue was up 2% from last year to $1.3 billion in the quarter from solid rap net inflows, higher earnings on brokerage cash and asset base fees. We are continuing to see our business shift more towards advisory, which we would expect to continue and possibly even accelerate with DOL implementation. 
G&A expenses are continuing to be tightly managed, down 1% from last year. We typically see seasonally higher expenses in the fourth quarter where project spending and advertising tend to increase. We delivered a record operating margin in the quarter at 18.2%, up 60 basis points from last year and up 50 basis points sequentially. 
Let's turn to asset management on Slide 9. Operating net revenue was down 5% to $740 million, primarily from net outflows and foreign exchange translation. We are prudently managing expenses for overall expenses, down 3%; and G&A, down 2%. Pretax operating earnings was down 14% to $155 million, largely from outflows. As a reminder, the impact of foreign exchange translation is immaterial to earnings. The adjusted margin in the quarter was in our expected range at 36%.
Turning to Annuities on Slide 10. This segment is performing in line with our expectations. Variable annuity pretax operating earnings was $114 [ph] million, essentially flat to a year ago, excluding unlocking and remuneration in both periods. Variable annuities has unfavorable unlocking of $220 million this year due to higher consistency on living benefit contracts and continued low interest rates as you've seen across the industry. Our long-term interest rate assumption remained unchanged, but we extended the period it would take for rates to reach our long-term level to 5.5 years.
As a result of updating the assumption for products with living benefits on our SOP reserves, there will be an ongoing impact of variable annuities earnings going forward. Fixed annuity pretax operating earnings were essentially flat to last year at $24 million, excluding unlocking. Unlocking this year was largely due to good consistency as our clients are lapsing at a slower pace than we previously modeled. I'd also like to note that the underlying profitability in this business has sustained a bit better than we expected this year. This quarter benefited from some gains relating to prepayments of investments. We are continuing to see account decline given minimal sales in this rate environment. 
Turning to the Protection segment on Slide 11. Pretax operating earnings, excluding unlocking, was $31 million in the quarter. There were a number of moving parts in the quarter, some I'm going to address like [indiscernible] long-term care and Auto and Home separately. Let's first focus on life and health, excluding long-term care. Underlying pretax operating earnings were up from last year to $74 million, excluding unlocking, new version and a premium correction in the year-ago period. Unlocking was a favorable $70 [ph] million, primarily from increased value of future reinsurance recoverables due to slightly worse mortality, partially offset by continued low interest rates. Long-term care had a pretax operating loss of $73 million, which included a $37 million of unfavorable impact of our annual LTC review and a negative $29 million from a model correction. The third quarter annual LTC review was negatively impacted by lower interest rates, morbidity trends and elevated reinsurance expense. Underlying results were a loss of $7 million, essentially flat to last year and consistent with our expectations for this block.
Auto and Home had an $8 million operating loss in the quarter, including excess cat losses of $7 million. As we previously told you, the actions we've taken to improve our underwriting, pricing and claims practices are taking hold, and the positive trends have emerged. Therefore, in the third quarter, we lowered at the ratio for the 2016 accident year and released $10 million of prior year reserves. We anticipate being able to make additional adjustments if these positive trends continue.
I will conclude with a few comments on the balance sheet on Slide 12. As we have told you before, Ameriprise maintains a strong balance sheet that we will use opportunistically. We have over $2 billion of excess capital, and our estimate and RBC ratio remains above 500%. Our hedging programs continue to work well, and the investment portfolio is well positioned and diversified. We returned approximately 130% of operating earnings, excluding unlocking, to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This is consistent with the level of shares we repurchased before with significant increase in the first half of the year but remains well above our baseline 90% to 100% of earnings. 
With that, we'll take your questions."

So we look to make sure that the client is getting the right solutions necessary for them to have a complete financial picture. In that regard, we feel that even in the qualified part of the business, other products and services are necessary for them to be appropriate. As an example, we do believe in investment advisory. A lot part of our business is done that way, but investment advisory might not be for all clients based on a combination of the fees for it, based on the size of the account, et cetera, and that there may be more efficient and appropriate products for them, such as the fund in a particular circumstance, so our annuity for retirement income and guarantees. So what we're trying to do is give our advisers as much flexibility as possible with these products. We continue to be appropriate, both in the qualified as well as similar to a non-qualified in that regard. It doesn't mean that more business won't shift to investment advisory as it is today, but we want to give them the flexibility to do that. Now that does require more work on our part. It does require more compliance. In this require more due diligence. It does require more disclosures and documentation for adviser to do that fully funded the BIC.

So culturally, having the right fit appropriate to the quality business, that is what we're looking for. So what whether they be individual firms or advisers that want to join us, we'll be looking for that over time and I think there will be opportunities.

Remember, advisers have to make these changes across their book. And many advisers of 300 or 500 clients, and so it's a big change for them. And so we have the wherewithal and the capabilities to support our advisers through that. So if you look at M&A, it will be along those types of guidelines that we would continue to pursue, firms and people. We also see opportunities in the asset management space. Very clearly, this is a consolidated environment. As you can see, flows are difficult across the business. And you really do need a larger platforms and capabilities to sustain that type of business, put the proper market commensurate at its meeting the criteria that firms like ours are going to have moving forward.

Our return has been higher from a combination of the businesses that we're in. Now we make sure each business is very much focused about it's to deliver and the core value of it. But I feel still, even the changes in the DOL, if you can provide good product, appropriate product consistent with what needs to be delivered to the consumer endpoint in an appropriate and beneficial way, then there's no reason why you can't be in those businesses. And remember, very few business today are just pure distributors. Now you can say, well, in the wealth management, independent space, but they're very tight margins.

So they are finding Ameriprise as a good home for them and appropriate from a cultural and on a support perspective. The people we are losing in those attrition numbers are some lower producers that are not hitting some other standards that we have. It also includes people who are retiring and moving their books to other advisers. So the assets that need, but if they are sort of moving out and transitioning their practices as they have set the successful transition and succession plans that we have our advisers do here. And we are seeing somewhat advisers come back even from the independent space that want more of the support and the value that we can provide to help them build and grow their practices rather than being just more continuing independent that don't get that level of that support out there. I would -- I think we would see a continuation of that pickup over time as more people are evaluating their businesses and their practices. I think even as you move into the RAA space, it's going to be more difficult. All of RAAs, including have to operate under a big standard. There's going to be a lot more compliance and supervision out there. The SEC is a stacking up to do that. They also make arrangements with FINRA to handle some of the activities that they did so that they can really focus on more of the advisory space now that it has grown. So I do believe that people are going to be need support. I think the compliance is going to be very important out there across the industry and the liability the people will have will continue to rise."

We'd make a lot more money, et cetera, just people moving on the other side, some of those clients won't be as served well or advisers would it be as complete for them.

A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in today's earnings release, our 2015 annual report to shareholders, our 2015 10-K report and the first and second quarter of 2016 10-Q reports. We take no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.
Turning to Slide 3. You see our GAAP financial results for the third quarter. Below that, you see our operating result, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Additionally, we completed our annual noncash unlocking and long-term care review in the third quarter. We included operating results, excluding unlocking, for additional transparency. The comments that management makes on the call today will focus on operating financial results as well as results excluding unlocking. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim."

I'll provide my perspective on the business and progress we're making, and Walter will discuss our financials, including the noncash impact of annual unlocking. Regarding Ameriprise overa",3109,"Hello, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. I'll provide my perspective on the business and progress we're making, and Walter will discuss our financials, including the noncash impact of annual unlocking. 
Regarding Ameriprise overall, like others, we're experiencing headwinds in the operating environment from industry trends, the regulatory change agenda globally as well as geopolitical volatility. During a time of change for the industry, I feel good about how Ameriprise is positioned and our focus on serving our clients and advisers. The current environment amplifies the value of the advice and  solutions Ameriprise provides. 
Today, I'll cover our underlying operating results excluding unlocking. Total assets under management and administration increased nicely to $796 billion, and that includes the difficult foreign exchange translation and asset management. Financially, earnings were down a bit, while earnings per diluted share excluding unlocking increased 4%. As always, we're closely managing our expenses while continuing to invest for growth. Return on equity excluding unlocking and AOCI was a healthy 23.8%. 
Our business generates good free cash flow, and as you know, maintaining our excellent financial foundation is core to how we operate the company. These consistent management principles enable Ameriprise to navigate this time of change and invest in the business as well as return capital to shareholders at a meaningful level. For the third quarter, we returned more than $500 million to shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total return for 2016 so far to more than $1.6 billion. 
Let's move to the businesses. In Advice & Wealth Management, we're situated well with our strong advice positioning and value proposition. I spent a lot of time during the year with our advisers and just returned from our private wealth advisers conference, where over 900 of our top producers were gathered. They're feeling good about their ability to run strong practices and the growth opportunity at Ameriprise as well as the way we support them during times of change. We believe, more than ever, our advice value proposition is strong and desirable. Personal comprehensive advice is critical in handling the volatility and issues facing consumers as they look to achieve their long-term goals. 
For the quarter, retail client assets grew nicely, up 10%, and we had nearly $3 billion in net inflows in fee-based investment advisory accounts in the quarter. Our investment advisory platform is in the top 5 of mutual fund advisory and a consistent growth driver for Ameriprise. In addition, we delivered operating earnings of $231 million, up 5% from a year ago, and our margin increased to 18.2% for the quarter. 
As we continue to serve more clients in fee-based relationships, transactional business represents less of our total production. As an example, more than 70% of our gross dealer concession is asset-based. Average advice productivity is holding strong at over $500,000 on a trailing 12-month basis. As we look to grow the business, we're ensuring advisers fully benefit from the investments we've made, including our technology platforms, our e-tools and online. Our advisers are more efficient when they use capabilities like our e-file delivery and e-signature tools and more productive when they use our aggregation tool like Total View. We're meeting more and more clients online, and visits to ameriprise.com are up significantly year-over-year. And engagement with clients and prospects on social media is a continued strength of ours. 
Brand awareness is another important component for growth. We're back on the air with our Be Brilliant advertising. And the next chapter of our Be Brilliant ads will be live in January as we continue to reinforce the confidence clients can realize from working with an Ameriprise adviser. 
In addition to focusing on client growth, recruiting is going well. We added another 80 experienced, productive advisers, bringing us to about 250 advisers year-to-date. And our pipeline is looking good into the next quarter and next year as Ameriprise stands out as a destination for successful advisers who appreciate our advice value proposition and supportive culture.
Now let's turn to the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule. Clearly, it's a significant change for the industry and a top priority for us. I believe Ameriprise is well positioned to handle the changes required to respond to the rule and to help advisers do the same. Frankly, this is a complex change, and it will continue to consume a lot of our energy. We're dedicating significant resources and leadership time to manage it in a regimented way. 
Consistent with our financial planning leadership, Ameriprise is one of the largest providers of fee-based investment advice, and we already operate as a fiduciary under a very high standard of care. In terms of our product offering, we're focused on minimizing disruption to our clients and ensuring our advisers continue to have a broad suite of solutions to help meet client needs, grow and protect their assets and achieve their goals. We continue to believe providing investor choice is important, and therefore, we've been hard at work to enable both advisory and brokerage options for clients and advisers. 
Ameriprise has a very strong compliance foundation and conducts robust due diligence on the products and platforms we offer. We have always been able to operate in a heavily regulated environment and comply with the requirements while also delivering an excellent client experience as we focus on helping our clients achieve their financial goals over a lifetime. Because of our robust supervision, compliance processes and training already in place, we're operating from a position of strength relative to many others in the industry. As a company, we take all these elements very seriously and work to integrate compliance and supervision throughout our business processes across the firm. 
Here's how we're approaching the rule and the support we're providing our advisers to adapt to the new landscape. Let's start with our investment advisory business. We're making the choice to use long-standing exemptions under ERISA for our investment advisory business. We believe this is the most appropriate way to continue to offer clients more flexibility and investment choices while offering our advisers the most protection and flexibility. The adjustments necessary to comply with this rule will be fully executed by the end of the first quarter of next year to be ready for the April deadline, and we're working with advisers now to help them execute the changes. 
With that, I'll turn to brokerage and our commission business. We intend to use the BIC exemption for brokerage and other commission-based recommendations. The DOL introduced the BIC exemption in large part to address unique challenges of brokerage and other commission-based accounts under the ERISA framework. The BIC exemption permits compensation that varies by product as long as the requirements of the exemption are met. This is an area where we're starting to see some changes across the industry relating to product availability and product compensation as it would apply to products like mutual funds and annuities. Ameriprise, like others in the industry, will likely need to narrow the offering, help advisers meet the rule's duties of prudence and loyalty. Similar to the approach we're taking in advisory, we want to continue to offer flexibility and choice. 
In addition, we have best-in-class due diligence standards and strong supervision, which will further enhance, where necessary, the both qualitative and quantitative filters to ensure we continue to have robust solutions that will be appropriate in the qualified market. 
As you know, there will also be new requirements for IRA rollovers. Today, we have industry-leading leave-it-or-roll-it approach that helps clients evaluate their options for their retirement plan assets, and we're working right now to determine how we will enhance that as appropriate. We will also build on our already strong and comprehensive rollover education disclosure materials and documentation to meet the DOL's expectations. 
As you would expect, it's very important to us to bring this to life for advisers and support them to comply with the new rule. Last April, we began executing our comprehensive communications and training plan, including holding a series of webcasts that continue throughout the remainder of the year. Throughout first quarter, we'll be conducting extensive local in-person training to help our advisers and the teams prepare to comply for the initial effective date of April 10. Clearly, this is a large change agenda for the industry. We have devoted tremendous resources and are making progress and have a lot of work to do, and you'll see that across the industry, whether or how they decide to do business. We continue to review the regulation and all of its intricacies to ensure we can meet all the requirements of the new fiduciary standards to minimize potential exposure to the firm and our advisers for having right due diligence, analysis and documentation as well as the appropriate supervision necessary. 
Given what we know, we feel comfortable that we can effectively navigate through it. Next quarter, I will share even more about our compliance approach and progress on our training and implementation. Again, we feel comfortable that we will continue to offer a broad suite of products with the necessary oversight. As I stated earlier, we already apply rigorous degree of review and due diligence on products we offer and have extensive, appropriate disclosures in place. 
While there will be additional disclosures and documentation for our advice required going forward, based on what we know at this time, we believe these requirements will be manageable. In this regulatory environment, the importance of delivering advice is even more significant than ever. We know clients and consumers are looking for us to serve them holistically. The growth opportunity we have is compelling. 
To summarize, we're delivering nice growth and profitability in Advice & Wealth Management. We're working closely and comprehensively with advisers to manage the DOL change ahead. And we feel good about our near- and long-term opportunity to serve even more consumers with advice. 
Let's move to Annuities and Protection. I'll focus more on the underlying businesses, and Walter will cover the financials. In annuities, VA account balance is up about 4% year-over-year. And while our VA sales are down year-over-year, we look to be faring better than the industry given our financial planning focus. We're helping our advisers meet their clients' retirement income needs and continue to make it easier for clients and advisers to conduct business. As an example, we've seen good results from the adviser workshops we held, which focused on the new challenges for today's retirement, and we're seeing good uptake on our enhanced digital tools that help advisers present retirement solutions. 
On the fixed side, the story remains the same. The overall book is performing as expected in a slow interest rate environment, and we're not adding to it at this time.
In life insurance, VUL/UL account balances were up 5%, and overall sales were down, like others in the industry. Overall, claims experience remained within an expected range. During the quarter, we launched an index account for our VUL 5 product that provides the benefits of accumulating cash value with the added safety of an index floor, and we're seeing a nice initial response by clients and advisers. 
Finally, in Auto and Home, we're beginning to see improvements in business results from the changes we've been making. Both current and prior accident year loss trends are showing solid improvement. As I shared previously, we're taking a number of actions, including enhanced pricing sophistication and raising rates in both auto and homeowner lines, with improved risk quality through tighter underwriting and more disciplined exposure management. We also enhanced our claims organization and, as a result, are seeing better loss outcomes that will contribute to a higher-performing portfolio over time. 
With regard to the quarter, in line with many industry players, we have higher-than-expected cat loss as we're making systemic changes to lessen the impact of cats on our results, including improving cats-related pricing and strengthening the team handling cats claims, including adding more field adjusters. Overall, we're making good progress. I feel confident in the team we now have in place and the actions that we're taking to bring the business back to historical profitability. 
Let's turn to Asset Management. During this significant period of change for the industry, we're managing headwinds and have a good level of scale, capabilities and distribution to navigate this period well. For the quarter, assets under management declined slightly to $468 billion. However, that included an unfavorable foreign exchange translation, which impacted assets under management by about $14 billion year-over-year. In terms of flows, we had a little over $4 billion out in the quarter compared to more than $7 billion out this time last year. Global retail outflows improved substantially to $1.9 billion in the quarter, excluding former parent company-related flows and inflows from acquisitions. In U.S. retail, we're seeing some improvement. While we're in outflows, we've improved gross sales by nearly 10% over the past 12 months. We're also earning a higher market share on many of our key intermediary distribution platforms. This is at a time when overall industry sales in the active space are down, and we're all facing slower activity on the equity side of the business. Overall, redemptions have slowed, and that includes in the Acorn fund, which was about $600 million out in the quarter. Performance versus peers has improved with the changes that we made, and we're focused on continuing to generate competitive performance to strengthen long-term numbers and helping the turnaround of this product line. 
In the U.K. and European retail, as you know, retail outflow spiked in June and July because of Brexit. As we moved through the quarter, the level of redemption slowed to end the quarter largely neutral. Our teams have done an excellent job navigating this environment, including the property space where we preserved value for investors and have smoothed reopening of our fund. If market conditions remain stable for the remainder of the year, we expect better results in the fourth quarter. 
In terms of institutional, we and others in the industry have experienced a slowdown in the rate of fundings, which contributed to about $2 billion in outflows in the quarter. That included a loss of one of the remaining Acorn mandates around $700 million in the quarter. We feel good about the rest of '16 and into '17 as our list of won-not-funded mandates is good, with wins in both domestic and international that should fund in the fourth quarter and into next year. Our win rate remains strong, and we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities in a number of equity, credit and solution multi-asset strategies. Consistent with our normal level of outflows in former parent portfolios, we had about $1.4 billion of lower-fee outflows, with the majority from Zürich. Outflows in U.S. Trust IMA significantly slowed as we moved through the quarter. I would also note we had about $1 billion of inflows from the EGA acquisition. 
Regarding performance, we're very focused on ensuring we have a strong-performing credit lines to serve individual and institutional investor needs. That includes delivering consistent performance expectations in existing products and developing new products and strategies as we look forward. With 110 foreign 5-star Morningstar-rated funds, Columbia Threadneedle has an excellent track record of generating competitive performance across asset classes and styles. We have particular strong performance in a number of funds in domestic and international equities as well as across taxable and tax-exempt fixed income at Columbia and asset allocation products globally. 
In regard to U.K. and Europe, we've been able to remain focused on our business and feel we're in a good position to manage the change related to Brexit in what will be a multiyear transition. Columbia Threadneedle already has an established fund range and presence in Europe, and we're in a good position to continue to serve European investors going forward. We're focused now on expanding the scope of our Luxembourg-based management company. We plan to further replicate a more complete product line and establish a broader asset management presence in the EU post Brexit. Importantly, we have a well-resourced and experienced product development team with the capacity to ensure the needs of our clients are met in an efficient and transparent manner. Like the industry, we will be looking for further clarification that will inform us and others how to manage the transition for our clients. Again, this will take time, but I feel that we're in a good position.
As we look forward, we're doing a number of things on the product development side to capture flows. In addition to enhancements to our traditional mutual fund product line, we're further building out our managed account and solution businesses. We're seeing good interest in our multi-asset, tax-efficient and adaptive risk products. In fact, our U.S. retail care product has grown to north of $1 billion in assets under management. We also completed the EGA acquisition that strengthened our strategic beta and ETF capabilities and complements multi-factor products we developed and launched earlier this year. This is a long-term growth opportunity in the U.S. that we're beginning to build upon. 
Finally, we are a recognized leader in the U.K. for responsible investment, and we're working to expand that capability here in the United States. Our U.S. Social Bond Fund is a unique product, and our recently launched strategic beta products include a sustainability screen. Similar to strategic beta work, it's an initiative that we intend to grow more fully over time. 
Our Asset Management business is an at-scale business, and we're generating competitive margin in a challenging period. We're managing expenses well, knowing we have revenue pressure from the level of outflows we've experienced. We're seeing some nice underlying trends in domestic and international. We have more work to do, and I feel good about the teams in place and their execution focus. 
Now for Ameriprise overall, we have a strong base and a good track record for handling periods of industry change. Ameriprise has always been able to operate in a heavily regulated environment, strongly comply and deliver an excellent experience as we help clients achieve their financial goals. Our excellent capital position provides flexibility for both organic growth and inorganic opportunities in both Wealth Management and Asset Management. We also have a very solid Annuities and Protection business. We're bringing a very strong focus so that we can navigate the current environment. As we look forward, I feel good about the long-term opportunity Ameriprise has in the marketplace as we focus on delivering for our clients. 
Now Walter will cover the financials, and I'll be back to take your questions."
4165019,401897414,1062069,"Ameriprise Financial, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered another solid quarter of financial performance on an underlying basis. As you saw in our release, results were impacted negatively by our annual noncash unlocking and unusual items. Advice & Wealth Management continues",1249,"Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered another solid quarter of financial performance on an underlying basis. As you saw in our release, results were impacted negatively by our annual noncash unlocking and unusual items. Advice & Wealth Management continues to be our primary growth segment, with improved wrap net inflows, strong experienced adviser recruiting and excellent margin expansion. And Asset Management remains impacted by industry trends away from active management, but we're seeing good traction in few areas that Jim discussed and maintaining our focus on sustaining a good level of profitability.
Annuities and life and health insurance underlying profitability remains stable but with slower growth in the short term given the environment and regulatory changes. This remains a strong source of capital generation. 
Positive trends continue to emerge in Auto and Home, and we began to recognize them in the financial results this quarter, potentially with more to come as we evaluate loss performance. Our balance sheet is strong and returned over $500 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter.
Let's turn to consolidated results, beginning on Slide 6. Revenue was up slightly from last year to $2.9 billion, excluding the impact of unlocking in both years. Advice & Wealth Management represents more than 40% of overall revenues and continues to trend up given our good growth in client assets. This was offset by pressure from outflows in Asset Management and insurance and annuities interest rate pressure. Auto and Home has had a nice revenue growth from the rate actions taken, with rate increases in about 3/4 of the states we do business with during 2016.
Let's turn to Slide 7. Ameriprise continues to demonstrate our ability to navigate across business cycles and deliver solid EPS growth and strong return on equity. Operating performance in the quarter included a net negative $0.12 of items. First, we had $29 million pretax or $0.11 of total catastrophic losses in the quarter, of which $0.03 was above our expectations. Additionally, we had $0.11 unfavorable long-term care model corrections and $0.06 of unusual corporate items related to low-income housing and DOL implementation, partially offset by a positive $0.08 from mean reversion and in Auto and Home reserve release. Excluding these items, underlying EPS was $2.41, up 4%. We are tightly managing expenses while making the right investments to adjust to regulatory changes and support future growth. We'd expect DOL expenses to ramp up as we approach the DOL implementation date in April.
Our business continues to generate significant free cash flow, and disciplined capital management has driven EPS and return on equity growth. 
Let's turn to segment performance, starting on Slide 8. First, the Advice & Wealth Management businesses continue to perform very well, delivering solid financial results and strong business metrics. Jim spoke about the strong leading indicators we're seeing in this business, excellent recruiting, strong adviser retention and client acquisition, all contributing to record client asset levels. 
Operating net revenue was up 2% from last year to $1.3 billion in the quarter from solid wrap net inflows, higher earnings on brokerage cash and asset-based fees. We are continuing to see our business shift more towards advisory, which we would expect to continue and possibly even accelerate with DOL implementation. 
G&A expenses are continuing to be tightly managed, down 1% from last year. We typically see seasonally higher expenses in the fourth quarter, where project spending and advertising tend to increase. We delivered a record operating margin in the quarter at 18.2%, up 60 basis points from last year and up 50 basis points sequentially. 
Let's turn to asset management on Slide 9. Operating net revenue was down 5% to $740 million, primarily from net outflows and foreign exchange translation. We are prudently managing expenses, with overall expenses down 3% and G&A down 2%. Pretax operating earnings were down 14% to $155 million, largely from outflows. As a reminder, the impact for foreign exchange translation is immaterial to earnings. The adjusted margin in the quarter was in our expected range at 36%.
Turning to Annuities on Slide 10. This segment is performing in line with our expectations. Variable annuity pretax operating earnings was $114 million, essentially flat to a year ago, excluding unlocking and mean reversion in both periods. Variable annuities had an unfavorable unlocking of $220 million this year due to higher persistency on living benefit contracts and continued low interest rates, as you've seen across the industry. Our long-term interest rate assumption remained unchanged, but we extended the period it would take for rates to reach our long-term level to 5.5 years. As a result of updating our persistency assumption for products with living benefits on our SOP reserves, there will be an ongoing impact to variable annuities earnings going forward. 
Fixed annuity pretax operating earnings were essentially flat to last year at $24 million, excluding unlocking. Unlocking this year was largely due to good persistency as our clients are lapsing at a slower pace than we previously modeled. I'd also like to note that underlying profitability in this business has sustained a bit better than we expected this year. This quarter benefited from some gains relating to prepayments of investments. We are continuing to see account values decline given minimum sales in this rate environment. 
Turning to the Protection segment on Slide 11. Pretax operating earnings excluding unlocking was $31 million in the quarter. There were a number of moving parts in the quarter, so I'm going to address life and health, long-term care and Auto and Home separately. Let's first focus on life and health, excluding long-term care. Underlying pretax operating earnings were up from last year to $74 million, excluding unlocking, mean reversion and a premium correction in the year-ago period. Unlocking was a favorable $17 million, primarily from increased value of future reinsurance recoverables due to slightly worse mortality, partially offset by continued low interest rates. Long-term care had a pretax operating loss of $73 million, which included a $37 million unfavorable impact of our annual LTC review and a negative $29 million from a model correction. The third quarter annual LTC review was negatively impacted by low interest rates, morbidity trends and elevated reinsurance expense. Underlying results were a loss of $7 million, essentially flat to last year and consistent with our expectations for this closed block.
Auto and Home had an $8 million operating loss in the quarter, including excess cat losses of $7 million. As we previously told you, the actions we've taken to improve our underwriting, pricing and claims practices are taking hold, and positive trends have emerged. Therefore, in the third quarter, we lowered the PEG ratio for the 2016 accident year and released $10 million of prior year reserves. We anticipate being able to make additional adjustments if these positive trends continue.
I will conclude with a few comments on the balance sheet on Slide 12. As we have told you before, Ameriprise maintains a strong balance sheet that we will use opportunistically. We have over $2 billion of excess capital, and our estimated RBC ratio remains above 500%. Our hedging programs continue to work well, and the investment portfolio is well positioned and diversified. We returned approximately 130% of operating earnings, excluding unlocking, to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This is consistent with the level of shares we repurchased before, with significant increase in the first half of the year but remains well above our baseline 90% to 100% of earnings. 
With that, we'll take your questions."

So seems like we're starting to see some bifurcation in approaches with [ph] strategic views from different advisory businesses, whether to continue to offer flexible options for clients and preserve it. I guess, the flexibility while tweaking product offerings, which seems to be what Ameriprise is doing. And then, those who are maybe taking more drastic measures of exiting the commissions business or the brokerage business altogether. I just want to get a sense, as you are looking at the business and the future with DOL, what gives you comfort that you can continue offering this flexibility today?"

So we look to make sure that the client is getting the right solutions necessary for them to have a complete financial picture. In that regard, we feel that in -- even in the qualified part of the business, other products and services are necessary for them to be appropriate. As an example, we do believe in investment advisory, a large part of our business is done that way. But investment advisory might not be for all clients based on a combination of the fees for it, based on the size of accounts, et cetera, and that there may be more efficient and appropriate products for them, such as the fund in a particular circumstances or an annuity for retirement income and guarantees. So what we're trying to do is give our advisers as much flexibility as possible with these products. We continue to be appropriate, both in the qualified as well as similar to a nonqualified in that regard. It doesn't mean that more business won't shift to investment advisory as it is today, but we want to give them the flexibility to do that. Now that does require more work on our part. It does require more compliance. It does require more due diligence. It does require more disclosures and documentation for adviser to do that fully under the BIC. But we have the ability and the capabilities to support that, and that's what we want to try to do for our advisers, as we move forward."

Now we're looking for people to come to Ameriprise that will fit our culture, fit our advice value proposition that really would continue to build in a way that they do business, our brand equity in the marketplace. So culturally, having the right fit appropriate to the quality business that is what we're looking for. So what whether they'd be individual firms or advisers that want to join us, we'll be looking for that over time, and I think there will be opportunities, because as we're showing to you, we have a firm that has a lot of capability, but we're devoting tremendous resources to this. We have anywhere from 500 to 1,000 people working on this and DOL initiative right now, embedded in our firm, just based on how we're redeploying resources, because the time frame to get this done is pretty short and the amount of effort to get it done is pretty significant. So we feel we do have the ability to do that. Many firms will not have that ability or be able to support their advisers to make that change. Remember, advisers have to make these changes across their book. And many advisers have 300 or 500 clients, and so it's a big change for them. And so we have the wherewithal and the capabilities to help support our advisers through that. So if we look at M&A, it'll be along those types of guidelines that we would continue to pursue, firms and people. We also see opportunities in the Asset Management space. Very clearly, this is a consolidated environment. As you can see, flows are difficult across the business. And you really do need larger platforms and capabilities to sustain the type of business, put the product to market, ensure that its meeting the criteria that firms like ours are going to have moving forward. And we feel that Columbia Threadneedle has a lot of those capabilities, and so we'll continue to look to complement what we have put in place."

So I would say -- I do feel that Ameriprise today is a stronger firm because we have a combination of a very strong distribution as well as manufacturing capabilities. Our manufacturing capabilities and the intellectual know-how and capability we have actually helps us in many regards to think about how our advisers can work better, products and services that are appropriate for them and the capabilities even to manage some of those various assets that we deploy. Now with that, as remember, in our channel, we only sell products consistent with what we offer from an industry perspective. They're very competitive. They operate in the same format, same pricing, same commission structure. Everything in that regard is no different. Having said that, we also, through our manufacturing, have the ability, like through Columbia Threadneedle, because we can serve a certain number of people but to serve more people globally, both retail and institutions and leverage that capability. So I feel like Ameriprise has a number of strong legs to our sort of a foundation and that those complement each other over time. I think as we've proven to you that if you look at our both ability to generate earnings growth, the volatility of our earnings are lower, our return has been higher from a combination of the businesses that we're in. Now we make sure each business is very much focused about what it could deliver and the core value of it. But I feel still, even with the changes with the DOL, if you can provide good product, appropriate product consistent with what needs to be delivered to the consumer endpoint in an appropriate and beneficial way, then there's no reason why you can't be in those businesses. And remember, very few business today are just pure distributors. Now you can say, well, in the [indiscernible] independent space, but they're tight margins.

So the assets don't leave, but they are sort of moving out and transitioning their practices as they have set up successful transition and succession plans that we help our advisers do here. And we are seeing some more advisers come back even from the independent space that want more of the support and the value that we can provide to help them build and grow their practices rather than being just more continued independent that don't get that level of that support out there. I will -- I think we will see a continuation of that pickup over time, as more people are evaluating their businesses and their practices. I think even as you move to the RIA space, it's going to be more difficult. All of RIAs, including rollovers have to operate under a big standard. There's going to be a lot more compliance and supervision out there. The SEC is staffing up to do that. They're also made arrangements with FINRA to handle some of the activities that they did, so that they can really focus on more of the advisory space now, that has grown.

Now with that, it will affect some of the fees the adviser has had in that regard, and they're evaluating their practices. They're evaluating the value and the services that they're render in that regard as well. And in the firm perspective, we're making adjustments for some of the things that we need to do to offset that as from a cost perspective or from a service perspective, as well. Now we feel very appropriate that this is a move across the industry or will be across the industry. I think a number of players have moved that in some of their books, but we'll more fully moved to that over time, and so we think it is reasonable and appropriate to do that. Consistent many of the funds that we offer didn't have these share classes up to this point. And so in those cases, we're waiting for some of them to get those share classes, but our date of execution and the platforms we put in place to handle that will be fully operational by the end of the year, so that we're allowed to be able to do that, but that's really where we've moved, and we will move by the end of January."

But I could say is this, by implementing and executing against the BIC, it does require the firm to put more resources to ensure there is a greater level of what I would call both support compliance changes to products and platforms and capabilities there and then support the advisers and the training, et cetera. And so an easier way for us to do it as well would have been, ""Hey, we're not going to support that and get out."" It would be a lot more efficient for the firm. We'd make a lot more money, et cetera, by just people moving on the other side, some of those clients won't be as served well. Our advisers book wouldn't be as complete for them. It wouldn't be actually helping our advisers achieve what they think they need to achieve from a client, the impact from a client would also be more significant. So I can't talk to them and their book and the size of their activities and how important this is to them. But we do feel that we want to help our advisers as best as we can. We will continue to help our advisers as they want to do more advisory business. Remember, 70% of our fee -- our total GDC already is in fee-based businesses through our financial plan activities and our RAP business, et cetera. And so it's not as though Ameriprise isn't a leader in the advisory business. Having said that, even though this is a smaller part of the business, so you take the 30%, and you take on either piece for qualified which is less -- about 1/2 of that or less, we still feel that we want to provide support necessary for our advisers so that they don't disrupt their client activities or have the clients pay more for services already that for accounts and products that they're already offered. So that's what we're doing. I can't speak to other competitors in that regard. And again, we'll -- we think that we can be in compliance. If we can't, we won't do it. But we feel that we can't be in compliance. And where we can't, we will trend the level of activity.

Turning to Slide 2 of the earnings presentation. Materials that are available on our website includes a discussion of forward-looking statements, specifically, that during the call, you will hear reference to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials. Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in today's earnings release, our 2015 annual report to shareholders, our 2015 10-K report and the first and second quarter of 2016 10-Q reports. We take no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.
Turning to Slide 3. You see our GAAP financial results for the third quarter. Below that, you see our operating result, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Additionally, we completed our annual noncash unlocking and long-term care review in the third quarter. We included operating results, excluding unlocking, for additional transparency. The comments that management makes on the call today will focus on operating financial results as well as results excluding unlocking.

Regarding Ameriprise overa",3109,"Hello, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. I'll provide my perspective on the business and progress we're making, and Walter will discuss our financials, including the noncash impact of annual unlocking. 
Regarding Ameriprise overall, like others, we're experiencing headwinds in the operating environment from industry trends, the regulatory change agenda globally as well as geopolitical volatility. During a time of change for the industry, I feel good about how Ameriprise is positioned and our focus on serving our clients and advisers. The current environment amplifies the value of the advice and  solutions Ameriprise provides. 
Today, I'll cover our underlying operating results excluding unlocking. Total assets under management and administration increased nicely to $796 billion, and that includes the difficult foreign exchange translation and asset management. Financially, earnings were down a bit, while earnings per diluted share excluding unlocking increased 4%. As always, we're closely managing our expenses while continuing to invest for growth. Return on equity excluding unlocking and AOCI was a healthy 23.8%. 
Our business generates good free cash flow, and as you know, maintaining our excellent financial foundation is core to how we operate the company. These consistent management principles enable Ameriprise to navigate this time of change and invest in the business as well as return capital to shareholders at a meaningful level. For the third quarter, we returned more than $500 million to shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total return for 2016 so far to more than $1.6 billion. 
Let's move to the businesses. In Advice & Wealth Management, we're situated well with our strong advice positioning and value proposition. I spent a lot of time during the year with our advisers and just returned from our private wealth advisers conference, where over 900 of our top producers were gathered. They're feeling good about their ability to run strong practices and the growth opportunity at Ameriprise as well as the way we support them during times of change. We believe, more than ever, our advice value proposition is strong and desirable. Personal comprehensive advice is critical in handling the volatility and issues facing consumers as they look to achieve their long-term goals. 
For the quarter, retail client assets grew nicely, up 10%, and we had nearly $3 billion in net inflows in fee-based investment advisory accounts in the quarter. Our investment advisory platform is in the top 5 of mutual fund advisory and a consistent growth driver for Ameriprise. In addition, we delivered operating earnings of $231 million, up 5% from a year ago, and our margin increased to 18.2% for the quarter. 
As we continue to serve more clients in fee-based relationships, transactional business represents less of our total production. As an example, more than 70% of our gross dealer concession is asset-based. Average advised productivity is holding strong at over $500,000 on a trailing 12-month basis. As we look to grow the business, we're ensuring advisers fully benefit from the investments we've made, including our technology platforms, our e-tools and online. Our advisers are more efficient when they use capabilities like our e-file delivery and e-signature tools and more productive when they use our aggregation tool like Total View. We're meeting more and more clients online, and visits to ameriprise.com are up significantly year-over-year. And engagement with clients and prospects on social media is a continued strength of ours. 
Brand awareness is another important component for growth. We're back on the air with our Be Brilliant advertising. And the next chapter of our Be Brilliant ads will be live in January as we continue to reinforce the confidence clients can realize from working with an Ameriprise adviser. 
In addition to focusing on client growth, recruiting is going well. We added another 80 experienced, productive advisers, bringing us to about 250 advisers year-to-date. And our pipeline is looking good into the next quarter and next year as Ameriprise stands out as a destination for successful advisers who appreciate our advice value proposition and supportive culture.
Now let's turn to the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule. Clearly, it's a significant change for the industry and a top priority for us. I believe Ameriprise is well positioned to handle the changes required to respond to the rule and to help advisers do the same. Frankly, this is a complex change, and it will continue to consume a lot of our energy. We're dedicating significant resources and leadership time to manage it in a regimented way. 
Consistent with our financial planning leadership, Ameriprise is one of the largest providers of fee-based investment advice, and we already operate as a fiduciary under a very high standard of care. In terms of our product offering, we're focused on minimizing disruption to our clients and ensuring our advisers continue to have a broad suite of solutions to help meet client needs, grow and protect their assets and achieve their goals. We continue to believe providing investor choice is important, and therefore, we've been hard at work to enable both advisory and brokerage options for clients and advisers. 
Ameriprise has a very strong compliance foundation and conducts robust due diligence on the products and platforms we offer. We have always been able to operate in a heavily regulated environment and comply with the requirements while also delivering an excellent client experience as we focus on helping our clients achieve their financial goals over a lifetime. Because of our robust supervision, compliance processes and training already in place, we're operating from a position of strength relative to many others in the industry. As a company, we take all these elements very seriously and work to integrate compliance and supervision throughout our business processes across the firm. 
Here's how we're approaching the rule and the support we're providing our advisers to adapt to the new landscape. Let's start with our investment advisory business. We're making the choice to use long-standing exemptions under ERISA for our investment advisory business. We believe this is the most appropriate way to continue to offer clients more flexibility and investment choices while offering our advisers the most protection and flexibility. The adjustments necessary to comply with this rule will be fully executed by the end of the first quarter of next year to be ready for the April deadline, and we're working with advisers now to help them execute the changes. 
With that, I'll turn to brokerage and our commission business. We intend to use the BIC exemption for brokerage and other commission-based recommendations. The DOL introduced the BIC exemption in large part to address unique challenges of brokerage and other commission-based accounts under the ERISA framework. The BIC exemption permits compensation that varies by product as long as the requirements of the exemption are met. This is an area where we're starting to see some changes across the industry relating to product availability and product compensation as it would apply to products like mutual funds and annuities. Ameriprise, like others in the industry, will likely need to narrow the offering, help advisers meet the rule's duties of prudence and loyalty. Similar to the approach we're taking in advisory, we want to continue to offer flexibility and choice. 
In addition, we have best-in-class due diligence standards and strong supervision, which will further enhance, where necessary, the both qualitative and quantitative filters to ensure we continue to have robust solutions that will be appropriate in the qualified market. 
As you know, there will also be new requirements for IRA rollovers. Today, we have industry-leading leave-it-or-roll-it approach that helps clients evaluate their options for their retirement plan assets, and we're working right now to determine how we will enhance that as appropriate. We will also build on our already strong and comprehensive rollover education disclosure materials and documentation to meet the DOL's expectations. 
As you would expect, it's very important to us to bring this to life for advisers and support them to comply with the new rule. Last April, we began executing our comprehensive communications and training plan, including holding a series of webcasts that continue throughout the remainder of the year. Throughout first quarter, we'll be conducting extensive local in-person training to help our advisers and the teams prepare to comply for the initial effective date of April 10. Clearly, this is a large change agenda for the industry. We have devoted tremendous resources and are making progress and have a lot of work to do, and you'll see that across the industry, whether or how they decide to do business. We continue to review the regulation and all of its intricacies to ensure we can meet all the requirements of the new fiduciary standards to minimize potential exposure to the firm and our advisers for having right due diligence, analysis and documentation as well as the appropriate supervision necessary. 
Given what we know, we feel comfortable that we can effectively navigate through it. Next quarter, I will share even more about our compliance approach and progress on our training and implementation. Again, we feel comfortable that we will continue to offer a broad suite of products with the necessary oversight. As I stated earlier, we already apply rigorous degree of review and due diligence on products we offer and have extensive, appropriate disclosures in place. 
While there will be additional disclosures and documentation for our advice required going forward, based on what we know at this time, we believe these requirements will be manageable. In this regulatory environment, the importance of delivering advice is even more significant than ever. We know clients and consumers are looking for us to serve them holistically. The growth opportunity we have is compelling. 
To summarize, we're delivering nice growth and profitability in Advice & Wealth Management. We're working closely and comprehensively with advisers to manage the DOL change ahead. And we feel good about our near- and long-term opportunity to serve even more consumers with advice. 
Let's move to Annuities and Protection. I'll focus more on the underlying businesses, and Walter will cover the financials. In annuities, VA account balance is up about 4% year-over-year. And while our VA sales are down year-over-year, we look to be faring better than the industry given our financial planning focus. We're helping our advisers meet their clients' retirement income needs and continue to make it easier for clients and advisers to conduct business. As an example, we've seen good results from the adviser workshops we held, which focused on the new challenges for today's retirement, and we're seeing good uptake on our enhanced digital tools that help advisers present retirement solutions. 
On the fixed side, the story remains the same. The overall book is performing as expected in a slow interest rate environment, and we're not adding to it at this time.
In life insurance, VUL/UL account balances were up 5%, and overall sales were down, like others in the industry. Overall, claims experience remained within an expected range. During the quarter, we launched an index account for our VUL 5 product that provides the benefits of accumulating cash value with the added safety of an index floor, and we're seeing a nice initial response by clients and advisers. 
Finally, in Auto and Home, we're beginning to see improvements in business results from the changes we've been making. Both current and prior accident year loss trends are showing solid improvement. As I shared previously, we're taking a number of actions, including enhanced pricing sophistication and raising rates in both auto and homeowner lines, with improved risk quality through tighter underwriting and more disciplined exposure management. We also enhanced our claims organization and, as a result, are seeing better loss outcomes that will contribute to a higher-performing portfolio over time. 
With regard to the quarter, in line with many industry players, we have higher-than-expected cat loss as we're making systemic changes to lessen the impact of cats on our results, including improving cats-related pricing and strengthening the team handling cats claims, including adding more field adjusters. Overall, we're making good progress. I feel confident in the team we now have in place and the actions that we're taking to bring the business back to historical profitability. 
Let's turn to Asset Management. During this significant period of change for the industry, we're managing headwinds and have a good level of scale, capabilities and distribution to navigate this period well. For the quarter, assets under management declined slightly to $468 billion. However, that included an unfavorable foreign exchange translation, which impacted assets under management by about $14 billion year-over-year. In terms of flows, we had a little over $4 billion out in the quarter compared to more than $7 billion out this time last year. Global retail outflows improved substantially to $1.9 billion in the quarter, excluding former parent company-related flows and inflows from acquisitions. In U.S. retail, we're seeing some improvement. While we're in outflows, we've improved gross sales by nearly 10% over the past 12 months. We're also earning a higher market share on many of our key intermediary distribution platforms. This is at a time when overall industry sales in the active space are down, and we're all facing slower activity on the equity side of the business. Overall, redemptions have slowed, and that includes in the Acorn fund, which was about $600 million out in the quarter. Performance versus peers has improved with the changes that we made, and we're focused on continuing to generate competitive performance to strengthen long-term numbers and helping the turnaround of this product line. 
In the U.K. and European retail, as you know, retail outflow spiked in June and July because of Brexit. As we moved through the quarter, the level of redemption slowed to end the quarter largely neutral. Our teams have done an excellent job navigating this environment, including the property space where we preserved value for investors and have smoothed reopening of our fund. If market conditions remain stable for the remainder of the year, we expect better results in the fourth quarter. 
In terms of institutional, we and others in the industry have experienced a slowdown in the rate of fundings, which contributed to about $2 billion in outflows in the quarter. That included a loss of one of the remaining Acorn mandates around $700 million in the quarter. We feel good about the rest of '16 and into '17 as our list of won-not-funded mandates is good, with wins in both domestic and international that should fund in the fourth quarter and into next year. Our win rate remains strong, and we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities in a number of equity, credit and solution multi-asset strategies. Consistent with our normal level of outflows in former parent portfolios, we had about $1.4 billion of lower-fee outflows, with the majority from Zürich. Outflows in U.S. Trust IMA significantly slowed as we moved through the quarter. I would also note we had about $1 billion of inflows from the EGA acquisition. 
Regarding performance, we're very focused on ensuring we have a strong-performing product line to serve individual and institutional investor needs. That includes delivering consistent performance expectations in existing products and developing new products and strategies as we look forward. With 110 foreign 5-star Morningstar-rated funds, Columbia Threadneedle has an excellent track record of generating competitive performance across asset classes and styles. We have particular strong performance in a number of funds in domestic and international equities as well as across taxable and tax-exempt fixed income at Columbia and asset allocation products globally. 
In regard to U.K. and Europe, we've been able to remain focused on our business and feel we're in a good position to manage the change related to Brexit in what will be a multiyear transition. Columbia Threadneedle already has an established fund range and presence in Europe, and we're in a good position to continue to serve European investors going forward. We're focused now on expanding the scope of our Luxembourg-based management company. We plan to further replicate a more complete product line and establish a broader asset management presence in the EU post Brexit. Importantly, we have a well-resourced and experienced product development team with the capacity to ensure the needs of our clients are met in an efficient and transparent manner. Like the industry, we will be looking for further clarification that will inform us and others how to manage the transition for our clients. Again, this will take time, but I feel that we're in a good position.
As we look forward, we're doing a number of things on the product development side to capture flows. In addition to enhancements to our traditional mutual fund product line, we're further building out our managed account and solution businesses. We're seeing good interest in our multi-asset, tax-efficient and adaptive risk products. In fact, our U.S. retail care product has grown to north of $1 billion in assets under management. We also completed the EGA acquisition that strengthened our strategic beta and ETF capabilities and complements multi-factor products we developed and launched earlier this year. This is a long-term growth opportunity in the U.S. that we're beginning to build upon. 
Finally, we are a recognized leader in the U.K. for responsible investment, and we're working to expand that capability here in the United States. Our U.S. Social Bond Fund is a unique product, and our recently launched strategic beta products include a sustainability screen. Similar to strategic beta work, it's an initiative that we intend to grow more fully over time. 
Our Asset Management business is an at-scale business, and we're generating competitive margin in a challenging period. We're managing expenses well, knowing we have revenue pressure from the level of outflows we've experienced. We're seeing some nice underlying trends in domestic and international. We have more work to do, and I feel good about the teams in place and their execution focus. 
Now for Ameriprise overall, we have a strong base and a good track record for handling periods of industry change. Ameriprise has always been able to operate in a heavily regulated environment, strongly comply and deliver an excellent experience as we help clients achieve their financial goals. Our excellent capital position provides flexibility for both organic growth and inorganic opportunities in both Wealth Management and Asset Management. We also have a very solid Annuities and Protection business. We're bringing a very strong focus so that we can navigate the current environment. As we look forward, I feel good about the long-term opportunity Ameriprise has in the marketplace as we focus on delivering for our clients. 
Now Walter will cover the financials, and I'll be back to take your questions."

Ameriprise delivered another solid quarter of financial performance on an underlying basis. As you saw in our release, results were impacted negatively by our annual noncash unlocking and unusual items. Advice & Wealth Management continues",1249,"Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered another solid quarter of financial performance on an underlying basis. As you saw in our release, results were impacted negatively by our annual noncash unlocking and unusual items. Advice & Wealth Management continues to be our primary growth segment, with improved RAP net inflows, strong experienced adviser recruiting and excellent margin expansion. And Asset Management remains impacted by industry trends away from active management, but we're seeing good traction in few areas that Jim discussed and maintaining our focus on sustaining a good level of profitability.
Annuities and life and health insurance underlying profitability remains stable but with slower growth in the short term given the environment and regulatory changes. This remains a strong source of capital generation. 
Positive trends continue to emerge in Auto and Home, and we began to recognize them in the financial results this quarter, potentially with more to come as we evaluate loss performance. Our balance sheet is strong and returned over $500 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter.
Let's turn to consolidated results, beginning on Slide 6. Revenue was up slightly from last year to $2.9 billion, excluding the impact of unlocking in both years. Advice & Wealth Management represents more than 40% of overall revenues and continues to trend up given our good growth in client assets. This was offset by pressure from outflows in Asset Management and insurance and annuities interest rate pressure. Auto and Home has had a nice revenue growth from the rate actions taken, with rate increases in about 3/4 of the states we do business with during 2016.
Let's turn to Slide 7. Ameriprise continues to demonstrate our ability to navigate across business cycles and deliver solid EPS growth and strong return on equity. Operating performance in the quarter included a net negative $0.12 of items. First, we had $29 million pretax or $0.11 of total catastrophic losses in the quarter, of which $0.03 was above our expectations. Additionally, we had $0.11 unfavorable long-term care model corrections and $0.06 of unusual corporate items related to low-income housing and DOL implementation, partially offset by a positive $0.08 from mean reversion and in Auto and Home reserve release. Excluding these items, underlying EPS was $2.41, up 4%. We are tightly managing expenses while making the right investments to adjust to regulatory changes and support future growth. We'd expect DOL expenses to ramp up as we approach the DOL implementation date in April.
Our business continues to generate significant free cash flow, and disciplined capital management has driven EPS and return on equity growth. 
Let's turn to segment performance, starting on Slide 8. First, the Advice & Wealth Management businesses continue to perform very well, delivering solid financial results and strong business metrics. Jim spoke about the strong leading indicators we're seeing in this business, excellent recruiting, strong adviser retention and client acquisition, all contributing to record client asset levels. 
Operating net revenue was up 2% from last year to $1.3 billion in the quarter from solid RAP net inflows, higher earnings on brokerage cash and asset-based fees. We are continuing to see our business shift more towards advisory, which we would expect to continue and possibly even accelerate with DOL implementation. 
G&A expenses are continuing to be tightly managed, down 1% from last year. We typically see seasonally higher expenses in the fourth quarter, where project spending and advertising tend to increase. We delivered a record operating margin in the quarter at 18.2%, up 60 basis points from last year and up 50 basis points sequentially. 
Let's turn to asset management on Slide 9. Operating net revenue was down 5% to $740 million, primarily from net outflows and foreign exchange translation. We are prudently managing expenses, with overall expenses down 3% and G&A down 2%. Pretax operating earnings were down 14% to $155 million, largely from outflows. As a reminder, the impact for foreign exchange translation is immaterial to earnings. The adjusted margin in the quarter was in our expected range at 36%.
Turning to Annuities on Slide 10. This segment is performing in line with our expectations. Variable annuity pretax operating earnings was $114 million, essentially flat to a year ago, excluding unlocking and mean reversion in both periods. Variable annuities had an unfavorable unlocking of $220 million this year due to higher persistency on living benefit contracts and continued low interest rates, as you've seen across the industry. Our long-term interest rate assumption remained unchanged, but we extended the period it would take for rates to reach our long-term level to 5.5 years. As a result of updating our persistency assumption for products with living benefits on our SOP reserves, there will be an ongoing impact to variable annuities earnings going forward. 
Fixed annuity pretax operating earnings were essentially flat to last year at $24 million, excluding unlocking. Unlocking this year was largely due to good persistency as our clients are lapsing at a slower pace than we previously modeled. I'd also like to note that underlying profitability in this business has sustained a bit better than we expected this year. This quarter benefited from some gains relating to prepayments of investments. We are continuing to see account values decline given minimum sales in this rate environment. 
Turning to the Protection segment on Slide 11. Pretax operating earnings excluding unlocking was $31 million in the quarter. There were a number of moving parts in the quarter, so I'm going to address life and health, long-term care and Auto and Home separately. Let's first focus on life and health, excluding long-term care. Underlying pretax operating earnings were up from last year to $74 million, excluding unlocking, mean reversion and a premium correction in the year-ago period. Unlocking was a favorable $17 million, primarily from increased value of future reinsurance recoverables due to slightly worse mortality, partially offset by continued low interest rates. Long-term care had a pretax operating loss of $73 million, which included a $37 million unfavorable impact of our annual LTC review and a negative $29 million from a model correction. The third quarter annual LTC review was negatively impacted by low interest rates, morbidity trends and elevated reinsurance expense. Underlying results were a loss of $7 million, essentially flat to last year and consistent with our expectations for this closed block.
Auto and Home had an $8 million operating loss in the quarter, including excess cat losses of $7 million. As we previously told you, the actions we've taken to improve our underwriting, pricing and claims practices are taking hold, and positive trends have emerged. Therefore, in the third quarter, we lowered the PEG ratio for the 2016 accident year and released $10 million of prior year reserves. We anticipate being able to make additional adjustments if these positive trends continue.
I will conclude with a few comments on the balance sheet on Slide 12. As we have told you before, Ameriprise maintains a strong balance sheet that we will use opportunistically. We have over $2 billion of excess capital, and our estimated RBC ratio remains above 500%. Our hedging programs continue to work well, and the investment portfolio is well positioned and diversified. We returned approximately 130% of operating earnings, excluding unlocking, to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This is consistent with the level of shares we repurchased before, with significant increase in the first half of the year but remains well above our baseline 90% to 100% of earnings. 
With that, we'll take your questions."

So we look to make sure that the client is getting the right solutions necessary for them to have a complete financial picture. In that regard, we feel that in -- even in the qualified part of the business, other products and services are necessary for them to be appropriate. As an example, we do believe in investment advisory, a large part of our business is done that way. But investment advisory might not be for all clients based on a combination of the fees for it, based on the size of accounts, et cetera, and that there may be more efficient and appropriate products for them, such as the fund in a particular circumstances or an annuity for retirement income and guarantees. So what we're trying to do is give our advisers as much flexibility as possible with these products. We continue to be appropriate, both in the qualified as well as similar to a nonqualified in that regard. It doesn't mean that more business won't shift to investment advisory as it is today, but we want to give them the flexibility to do that. Now that does require more work on our part. It does require more compliance. It does require more due diligence. It does require more disclosures and documentation for adviser to do that fully under the BIC. But we have the ability and the capabilities to support that, and that's what we want to try to do for our advisers, as we move forward."

Now we're looking for people to come to Ameriprise that will fit our culture, fit our advice value proposition that really would continue to build in a way that they do business, our brand equity in the marketplace. So culturally, having the right fit appropriate to the quality business that is what we're looking for. So whether they'd be individual firms or advisers that want to join us, we'll be looking for that over time, and I think there will be opportunities, because as we're showing to you, we have a firm that has a lot of capability, but we're devoting tremendous resources to this. We have anywhere from 500 to 1,000 people working on this and DOL initiative right now, embedded in our firm, just based on how we're redeploying resources, because the time frame to get this done is pretty short and the amount of effort to get it done is pretty significant. So we feel we do have the ability to do that. Many firms will not have that ability or be able to support their advisers to make that change. Remember, advisers have to make these changes across their book. And many advisers have 300 or 500 clients, and so it's a big change for them. And so we have the wherewithal and the capabilities to help support our advisers through that. So if we look at M&A, it'll be along those types of guidelines that we would continue to pursue, firms and people. We also see opportunities in the Asset Management space. Very clearly, this is a consolidated environment. As you can see, flows are difficult across the business. And you really do need larger platforms and capabilities to sustain the type of business, put the product to market, ensure that it's meeting the criteria that firms like ours are going to have moving forward.

So I would say -- I do feel that Ameriprise today is a stronger firm because we have a combination of a very strong distribution as well as manufacturing capabilities. Our manufacturing capabilities and the intellectual know-how and capability we have actually helps us in many regards to think about how our advisers can work better, products and services that are appropriate for them and the capabilities even to manage some of those various assets that we deploy. Now with that, as remember, in our channel, we only sell products consistent with what we offer from an industry perspective. They're very competitive. They operate in the same format, same pricing, same commission structure. Everything in that regard is no different. Having said that, we also, through our manufacturing, have the ability, like through Columbia Threadneedle, because we can serve a certain number of people but to serve more people globally, both retail and institutions and leverage that capability. So I feel like Ameriprise has a number of strong legs to our sort of a foundation and that those complement each other over time. I think as we've proven to you that if you look at our both ability to generate earnings growth, the volatility of our earnings are lower, our return has been higher from a combination of the businesses that we're in. Now we make sure each business is very much focused about what it could deliver and the core value of it. But I feel still, even with the changes with the DOL, if you can provide good product, appropriate product consistent with what needs to be delivered to the consumer endpoint in an appropriate and beneficial way, then there's no reason why you can't be in those businesses. And remember, very few business today are just pure distributors. Now you can say, well, in the wealth management independent space, but they're very tight margins. And in that regard, the sustainability of those businesses over time one can question."

And so those are the 2 exemptions that we will or the way it operate under ERISA that we think is appropriate and has various protections appropriate as long as you satisfy those requirements, and that will be different than operating under the BIC standard which has its own exemption.

So they are finding Ameriprise a good home for them and appropriate from a cultural and a support perspective. The people we are losing in those attrition numbers are some lower producers that are not hitting some of the standards that we have. It also includes people who are retiring and moving their books to other advisers. So the assets don't leave, but they are sort of moving out and transitioning their practices as they have set up successful transition and succession plans that we help our advisers do here. And we are seeing some more advisers come back even from the independent space that want more of the support and the value that we can provide to help them build and grow their practices rather than being just more continued independent that don't get that level of that support out there. I will -- I think we will see a continuation of that pickup over time, as more people are evaluating their businesses and their practices. I think even as you move to the RIA space, it's going to be more difficult. All of RIAs, including rollovers have to operate under a big standard. There's going to be a lot more compliance and supervision out there. The SEC is staffing up to do that. They're also made arrangements with FINRA to handle some of the activities that they did, so that they can really focus on more of the advisory space now, that has grown. So I do believe that people are going to be need more support. I think the compliance is going to be very important out there across the industry and the liability the people will have will continue to rise."

Well, these are our clients. We value our clients. Our advisers value our clients, and they're looking for a holistic value against that in services rendered. And regard to just dealing with people just in an investment advisory, I -- we love that business. We think that business is appropriate for many clients, but it might not be the perfect solution for all clients, particularly with certain products and services that they may need."

On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, our Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. 
Turning to Slide 2 of the earnings presentation. Materials that are available on our website includes a discussion of forward-looking statements, specifically, that during the call, you will hear reference to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials. Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in today's earnings release, our 2015 annual report to shareholders, our 2015 10-K report and the first and second quarter of 2016 10-Q reports. We take no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.
Turning to Slide 3. You see our GAAP financial results for the third quarter. Below that, you see our operating result, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Additionally, we completed our annual noncash unlocking and long-term care review in the third quarter. We included operating results, excluding unlocking, for additional transparency. The comments that management makes on the call today will focus on operating financial results as well as results excluding unlocking. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim."

I'll provide my perspective on the business and progress we're making, and Walter will discuss our financials, including the noncash impact of annual unlocking. Regarding Ameriprise overa",3109,"Hello, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. I'll provide my perspective on the business and progress we're making, and Walter will discuss our financials, including the noncash impact of annual unlocking. 
Regarding Ameriprise overall, like others, we're experiencing headwinds in the operating environment from industry trends, the regulatory change agenda globally as well as geopolitical volatility. During a time of change for the industry, I feel good about how Ameriprise is positioned and our focus on serving our clients and advisers. The current environment amplifies the value of the advice and  solutions Ameriprise provides. 
Today, I'll cover our underlying operating results excluding unlocking. Total assets under management and administration increased nicely to $796 billion, and that includes the difficult foreign exchange translation and asset management. Financially, earnings were down a bit, while earnings per diluted share excluding unlocking increased 4%. As always, we're closely managing our expenses while continuing to invest for growth. Return on equity excluding unlocking and AOCI was a healthy 23.8%. 
Our business generates good free cash flow, and as you know, maintaining our excellent financial foundation is core to how we operate the company. These consistent management principles enable Ameriprise to navigate this time of change and invest in the business as well as return capital to shareholders at a meaningful level. For the third quarter, we returned more than $500 million to shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total return for 2016 so far to more than $1.6 billion. 
Let's move to the businesses. In Advice & Wealth Management, we're situated well with our strong advice positioning and value proposition. I spent a lot of time during the year with our advisers and just returned from our private wealth advisers conference, where over 900 of our top producers were gathered. They're feeling good about their ability to run strong practices and the growth opportunity at Ameriprise as well as the way we support them during times of change. We believe, more than ever, our advice value proposition is strong and desirable. Personal comprehensive advice is critical in handling the volatility and issues facing consumers as they look to achieve their long-term goals. 
For the quarter, retail client assets grew nicely, up 10%, and we had nearly $3 billion in net inflows in fee-based investment advisory accounts in the quarter. Our investment advisory platform is in the top 5 of mutual fund advisory and a consistent growth driver for Ameriprise. In addition, we delivered operating earnings of $231 million, up 5% from a year ago, and our margin increased to 18.2% for the quarter. 
As we continue to serve more clients in fee-based relationships, transactional business represents less of our total production. As an example, more than 70% of our gross dealer concession is asset-based. Average advised productivity is holding strong at over $500,000 on a trailing 12-month basis. As we look to grow the business, we're ensuring advisers fully benefit from the investments we've made, including our technology platforms, our e-tools and online. Our advisers are more efficient when they use capabilities like our e-file delivery and e-signature tools and more productive when they use our aggregation tool like Total View. We're meeting more and more clients online, and visits to ameriprise.com are up significantly year-over-year. And engagement with clients and prospects on social media is a continued strength of ours. 
Brand awareness is another important component for growth. We're back on the air with our Be Brilliant advertising. And the next chapter of our Be Brilliant ads will be live in January as we continue to reinforce the confidence clients can realize from working with an Ameriprise adviser. 
In addition to focusing on client growth, recruiting is going well. We added another 80 experienced, productive advisers, bringing us to about 250 advisers year-to-date. And our pipeline is looking good into the next quarter and next year as Ameriprise stands out as a destination for successful advisers who appreciate our advice value proposition and supportive culture.
Now let's turn to the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule. Clearly, it's a significant change for the industry and a top priority for us. I believe Ameriprise is well positioned to handle the changes required to respond to the rule and to help advisers do the same. Frankly, this is a complex change, and it will continue to consume a lot of our energy. We're dedicating significant resources and leadership time to manage it in a regimented way. 
Consistent with our financial planning leadership, Ameriprise is one of the largest providers of fee-based investment advice, and we already operate as a fiduciary under a very high standard of care. In terms of our product offering, we're focused on minimizing disruption to our clients and ensuring our advisers continue to have a broad suite of solutions to help meet client needs, grow and protect their assets and achieve their goals. We continue to believe providing investor choice is important, and therefore, we've been hard at work to enable both advisory and brokerage options for clients and advisers. 
Ameriprise has a very strong compliance foundation and conducts robust due diligence on the products and platforms we offer. We have always been able to operate in a heavily regulated environment and comply with the requirements while also delivering an excellent client experience as we focus on helping our clients achieve their financial goals over a lifetime. Because of our robust supervision, compliance processes and training already in place, we're operating from a position of strength relative to many others in the industry. As a company, we take all these elements very seriously and work to integrate compliance and supervision throughout our business processes across the firm. 
Here's how we're approaching the rule and the support we're providing our advisers to adapt to the new landscape. Let's start with our investment advisory business. We're making the choice to use long-standing exemptions under ERISA for our investment advisory business. We believe this is the most appropriate way to continue to offer clients more flexibility and investment choices while offering our advisers the most protection and flexibility. The adjustments necessary to comply with this rule will be fully executed by the end of the first quarter of next year to be ready for the April deadline, and we're working with advisers now to help them execute the changes. 
With that, I'll turn to brokerage and our commission business. We intend to use the BIC exemption for brokerage and other commission-based recommendations. The DOL introduced the BIC exemption in large part to address unique challenges of brokerage and other commission-based accounts under the ERISA framework. The BIC exemption permits compensation that varies by product as long as the requirements of the exemption are met. This is an area where we're starting to see some changes across the industry relating to product availability and product compensation as it would apply to products like mutual funds and annuities. Ameriprise, like others in the industry, will likely need to narrow the offering, help advisers meet the rule's duties of prudence and loyalty. Similar to the approach we're taking in advisory, we want to continue to offer flexibility and choice. 
In addition, we have best-in-class due diligence standards and strong supervision, which will further enhance, where necessary, the both qualitative and quantitative filters to ensure we continue to have robust solutions that will be appropriate in the qualified market. 
As you know, there will also be new requirements for IRA rollovers. Today, we have industry-leading leave-it-or-roll-it approach that helps clients evaluate their options for their retirement plan assets, and we're working right now to determine how we will enhance that as appropriate. We will also build on our already strong and comprehensive rollover education disclosure materials and documentation to meet the DOL's expectations. 
As you would expect, it's very important to us to bring this to life for advisers and support them to comply with the new rule. Last April, we began executing our comprehensive communications and training plan, including holding a series of webcasts that continue throughout the remainder of the year. Throughout first quarter, we'll be conducting extensive local in-person training to help our advisers and the teams prepare to comply for the initial effective date of April 10. Clearly, this is a large change agenda for the industry. We have devoted tremendous resources and are making progress and have a lot of work to do, and you'll see that across the industry, whether or how they decide to do business. We continue to review the regulation and all of its intricacies to ensure we can meet all the requirements of the new fiduciary standards to minimize potential exposure to the firm and our advisers for having right due diligence, analysis and documentation as well as the appropriate supervision necessary. 
Given what we know, we feel comfortable that we can effectively navigate through it. Next quarter, I will share even more about our compliance approach and progress on our training and implementation. Again, we feel comfortable that we will continue to offer a broad suite of products with the necessary oversight. As I stated earlier, we already apply rigorous degree of review and due diligence on products we offer and have extensive, appropriate disclosures in place. 
While there will be additional disclosures and documentation for our advice required going forward, based on what we know at this time, we believe these requirements will be manageable. In this regulatory environment, the importance of delivering advice is even more significant than ever. We know clients and consumers are looking for us to serve them holistically. The growth opportunity we have is compelling. 
To summarize, we're delivering nice growth and profitability in Advice & Wealth Management. We're working closely and comprehensively with advisers to manage the DOL change ahead. And we feel good about our near- and long-term opportunity to serve even more consumers with advice. 
Let's move to Annuities and Protection. I'll focus more on the underlying businesses, and Walter will cover the financials. In annuities, VA account balance is up about 4% year-over-year. And while our VA sales are down year-over-year, we look to be faring better than the industry given our financial planning focus. We're helping our advisers meet their clients' retirement income needs and continue to make it easier for clients and advisers to conduct business. As an example, we've seen good results from the adviser workshops we held, which focused on the new challenges for today's retirement, and we're seeing good uptake on our enhanced digital tools that help advisers present retirement solutions. 
On the fixed side, the story remains the same. The overall book is performing as expected in a slow interest rate environment, and we're not adding to it at this time.
In life insurance, VUL/UL account balances were up 5%, and overall sales were down, like others in the industry. Overall, claims experience remained within an expected range. During the quarter, we launched an index account for our VUL 5 product that provides the benefits of accumulating cash value with the added safety of an index floor, and we're seeing a nice initial response by clients and advisers. 
Finally, in Auto and Home, we're beginning to see improvements in business results from the changes we've been making. Both current and prior accident year loss trends are showing solid improvement. As I shared previously, we're taking a number of actions, including enhanced pricing sophistication and raising rates in both auto and homeowner lines, with improved risk quality through tighter underwriting and more disciplined exposure management. We also enhanced our claims organization and, as a result, are seeing better loss outcomes that will contribute to a higher-performing portfolio over time. 
With regard to the quarter, in line with many industry players, we have higher-than-expected cat loss as we're making systemic changes to lessen the impact of cats on our results, including improving cats-related pricing and strengthening the team handling cats claims, including adding more field adjusters. Overall, we're making good progress. I feel confident in the team we now have in place and the actions that we're taking to bring the business back to historical profitability. 
Let's turn to Asset Management. During this significant period of change for the industry, we're managing headwinds and have a good level of scale, capabilities and distribution to navigate this period well. For the quarter, assets under management declined slightly to $468 billion. However, that included an unfavorable foreign exchange translation, which impacted assets under management by about $14 billion year-over-year. In terms of flows, we had a little over $4 billion out in the quarter compared to more than $7 billion out this time last year. Global retail outflows improved substantially to $1.9 billion in the quarter, excluding former parent company-related flows and inflows from acquisitions. In U.S. retail, we're seeing some improvement. While we're in outflows, we've improved gross sales by nearly 10% over the past 12 months. We're also earning a higher market share on many of our key intermediary distribution platforms. This is at a time when overall industry sales in the active space are down, and we're all facing slower activity on the equity side of the business. Overall, redemptions have slowed, and that includes in the Acorn fund, which was about $600 million out in the quarter. Performance versus peers has improved with the changes that we made, and we're focused on continuing to generate competitive performance to strengthen long-term numbers and helping the turnaround of this product line. 
In the U.K. and European retail, as you know, retail outflow spiked in June and July because of Brexit. As we moved through the quarter, the level of redemption slowed to end the quarter largely neutral. Our teams have done an excellent job navigating this environment, including the property space where we preserved value for investors and have smoothed reopening of our fund. If market conditions remain stable for the remainder of the year, we expect better results in the fourth quarter. 
In terms of institutional, we and others in the industry have experienced a slowdown in the rate of fundings, which contributed to about $2 billion in outflows in the quarter. That included a loss of one of the remaining Acorn mandates around $700 million in the quarter. We feel good about the rest of '16 and into '17 as our list of won-not-funded mandates is good, with wins in both domestic and international that should fund in the fourth quarter and into next year. Our win rate remains strong, and we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities in a number of equity, credit and solution multi-asset strategies. Consistent with our normal level of outflows in former parent portfolios, we had about $1.4 billion of lower-fee outflows, with the majority from Zürich. Outflows in U.S. Trust IMA significantly slowed as we moved through the quarter. I would also note we had about $1 billion of inflows from the EGA acquisition. 
Regarding performance, we're very focused on ensuring we have a strong-performing product line to serve individual and institutional investor needs. That includes delivering consistent performance expectations in existing products and developing new products and strategies as we look forward. With 110 foreign 5-star Morningstar-rated funds, Columbia Threadneedle has an excellent track record of generating competitive performance across asset classes and styles. We have particular strong performance in a number of funds in domestic and international equities as well as across taxable and tax-exempt fixed income at Columbia and asset allocation products globally. 
In regard to U.K. and Europe, we've been able to remain focused on our business and feel we're in a good position to manage the change related to Brexit in what will be a multiyear transition. Columbia Threadneedle already has an established fund range and presence in Europe, and we're in a good position to continue to serve European investors going forward. We're focused now on expanding the scope of our Luxembourg-based management company. We plan to further replicate a more complete product line and establish a broader asset management presence in the EU post Brexit. Importantly, we have a well-resourced and experienced product development team with the capacity to ensure the needs of our clients are met in an efficient and transparent manner. Like the industry, we will be looking for further clarification that will inform us and others how to manage the transition for our clients. Again, this will take time, but I feel that we're in a good position.
As we look forward, we're doing a number of things on the product development side to capture flows. In addition to enhancements to our traditional mutual fund product line, we're further building out our managed account and solution businesses. We're seeing good interest in our multi-asset, tax-efficient and adaptive risk products. In fact, our U.S. retail care product has grown to north of $1 billion in assets under management. We also completed the EGA acquisition that strengthened our strategic beta and ETF capabilities and complements multi-factor products we developed and launched earlier this year. This is a long-term growth opportunity in the U.S. that we're beginning to build upon. 
Finally, we are a recognized leader in the U.K. for responsible investment, and we're working to expand that capability here in the United States. Our U.S. Social Bond Fund is a unique product, and our recently launched strategic beta products include a sustainability screen. Similar to strategic beta work, it's an initiative that we intend to grow more fully over time. 
Our Asset Management business is an at-scale business, and we're generating competitive margin in a challenging period. We're managing expenses well, knowing we have revenue pressure from the level of outflows we've experienced. We're seeing some nice underlying trends in domestic and international. We have more work to do, and I feel good about the teams in place and their execution focus. 
Now for Ameriprise overall, we have a strong base and a good track record for handling periods of industry change. Ameriprise has always been able to operate in a heavily regulated environment, strongly comply and deliver an excellent experience as we help clients achieve their financial goals. Our excellent capital position provides flexibility for both organic growth and inorganic opportunities in both Wealth Management and Asset Management. We also have a very solid Annuities and Protection business. We're bringing a very strong focus so that we can navigate the current environment. As we look forward, I feel good about the long-term opportunity Ameriprise has in the marketplace as we focus on delivering for our clients. 
Now Walter will cover the financials, and I'll be back to take your questions."
4165019,401897414,1062677,"Ameriprise Financial, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered another solid quarter of financial performance on an underlying basis. As you saw in our release, results were impacted negatively by our annual noncash unlocking and unusual items. Advice & Wealth Management continues",1249,"Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered another solid quarter of financial performance on an underlying basis. As you saw in our release, results were impacted negatively by our annual noncash unlocking and unusual items. Advice & Wealth Management continues to be our primary growth segment, with improved RAP net inflows, strong experienced adviser recruiting and excellent margin expansion. And Asset Management remains impacted by industry trends away from active management, but we're seeing good traction in few areas that Jim discussed and maintaining our focus on sustaining a good level of profitability.
Annuities and life and health insurance underlying profitability remains stable but with slower growth in the short term given the environment and regulatory changes. This remains a strong source of capital generation. 
Positive trends continue to emerge in Auto and Home, and we began to recognize them in the financial results this quarter, potentially with more to come as we evaluate loss performance. Our balance sheet is strong and returned over $500 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter.
Let's turn to consolidated results, beginning on Slide 6. Revenue was up slightly from last year to $2.9 billion, excluding the impact of unlocking in both years. Advice & Wealth Management represents more than 40% of overall revenues and continues to trend up given our good growth in client assets. This was offset by pressure from outflows in Asset Management and insurance and annuities interest rate pressure. Auto and Home has had a nice revenue growth from the rate actions taken, with rate increases in about 3/4 of the states we do business with during 2016.
Let's turn to Slide 7. Ameriprise continues to demonstrate our ability to navigate across business cycles and deliver solid EPS growth and strong return on equity. Operating performance in the quarter included a net negative $0.12 of items. First, we had $29 million pretax or $0.11 of total catastrophic losses in the quarter, of which $0.03 was above our expectations. Additionally, we had $0.11 unfavorable long-term care model corrections and $0.06 of unusual corporate items related to low-income housing and DOL implementation, partially offset by a positive $0.08 from mean reversion and in Auto and Home reserve release. Excluding these items, underlying EPS was $2.41, up 4%. We are tightly managing expenses while making the right investments to adjust to regulatory changes and support future growth. We'd expect DOL expenses to ramp up as we approach the DOL implementation date in April.
Our business continues to generate significant free cash flow, and disciplined capital management has driven EPS and return on equity growth. 
Let's turn to segment performance, starting on Slide 8. First, the Advice & Wealth Management businesses continue to perform very well, delivering solid financial results and strong business metrics. Jim spoke about the strong leading indicators we're seeing in this business, excellent recruiting, strong adviser retention and client acquisition, all contributing to record client asset levels. 
Operating net revenue was up 2% from last year to $1.3 billion in the quarter from solid RAP net inflows, higher earnings on brokerage cash and asset-based fees. We are continuing to see our business shift more towards advisory, which we would expect to continue and possibly even accelerate with DOL implementation. 
G&A expenses are continuing to be tightly managed, down 1% from last year. We typically see seasonally higher expenses in the fourth quarter, where project spending and advertising tend to increase. We delivered a record operating margin in the quarter at 18.2%, up 60 basis points from last year and up 50 basis points sequentially. 
Let's turn to asset management on Slide 9. Operating net revenue was down 5% to $740 million, primarily from net outflows and foreign exchange translation. We are prudently managing expenses, with overall expenses down 3% and G&A down 2%. Pretax operating earnings were down 14% to $155 million, largely from outflows. As a reminder, the impact for foreign exchange translation is immaterial to earnings. The adjusted margin in the quarter was in our expected range at 36%.
Turning to Annuities on Slide 10. This segment is performing in line with our expectations. Variable annuity pretax operating earnings was $114 million, essentially flat to a year ago, excluding unlocking and mean reversion in both periods. Variable annuities had an unfavorable unlocking of $220 million this year due to higher persistency on living benefit contracts and continued low interest rates, as you've seen across the industry. Our long-term interest rate assumption remained unchanged, but we extended the period it would take for rates to reach our long-term level to 5.5 years. As a result of updating our persistency assumption for products with living benefits on our SOP reserves, there will be an ongoing impact to variable annuities earnings going forward. 
Fixed annuity pretax operating earnings were essentially flat to last year at $24 million, excluding unlocking. Unlocking this year was largely due to good persistency as our clients are lapsing at a slower pace than we previously modeled. I'd also like to note that underlying profitability in this business has sustained a bit better than we expected this year. This quarter benefited from some gains relating to prepayments of investments. We are continuing to see account values decline given minimum sales in this rate environment. 
Turning to the Protection segment on Slide 11. Pretax operating earnings excluding unlocking was $31 million in the quarter. There were a number of moving parts in the quarter, so I'm going to address life and health, long-term care and Auto and Home separately. Let's first focus on life and health, excluding long-term care. Underlying pretax operating earnings were up from last year to $74 million, excluding unlocking, mean reversion and a premium correction in the year-ago period. Unlocking was a favorable $17 million, primarily from increased value of future reinsurance recoverables due to slightly worse mortality, partially offset by continued low interest rates. Long-term care had a pretax operating loss of $73 million, which included a $37 million unfavorable impact of our annual LTC review and a negative $29 million from a model correction. The third quarter annual LTC review was negatively impacted by low interest rates, morbidity trends and elevated reinsurance expense. Underlying results were a loss of $7 million, essentially flat to last year and consistent with our expectations for this closed block.
Auto and Home had an $8 million operating loss in the quarter, including excess cat losses of $7 million. As we previously told you, the actions we've taken to improve our underwriting, pricing and claims practices are taking hold, and positive trends have emerged. Therefore, in the third quarter, we lowered the PEG ratio for the 2016 accident year and released $10 million of prior year reserves. We anticipate being able to make additional adjustments if these positive trends continue.
I will conclude with a few comments on the balance sheet on Slide 12. As we have told you before, Ameriprise maintains a strong balance sheet that we will use opportunistically. We have over $2 billion of excess capital, and our estimated RBC ratio remains above 500%. Our hedging programs continue to work well, and the investment portfolio is well positioned and diversified. We returned approximately 130% of operating earnings, excluding unlocking, to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This is consistent with the level of shares we repurchased before, with significant increase in the first half of the year but remains well above our baseline 90% to 100% of earnings. 
With that, we'll take your questions."

In that regard, we feel that in -- even in the qualified part of the business, other products and services are necessary for them to be appropriate. As an example, we do believe in investment advisory, a large part of our business is done that way. But investment advisory might not be for all clients based on a combination of the fees for it, based on the size of accounts, et cetera, and that there may be more efficient and appropriate products for them, such as the fund in a particular circumstances or an annuity for retirement income and guarantees. So what we're trying to do is give our advisers as much flexibility as possible with these products. We continue to be appropriate, both in the qualified as well as similar to a nonqualified in that regard. It doesn't mean that more business won't shift to investment advisory as it is today, but we want to give them the flexibility to do that. Now that does require more work on our part. It does require more compliance. It does require more due diligence. It does require more disclosures and documentation for adviser to do that fully under the BIC. But we have the ability and the capabilities to support that, and that's what we want to try to do for our advisers, as we move forward."

Now we're looking for people to come to Ameriprise that will fit our culture, fit our advice value proposition that really would continue to build in a way that they do business, our brand equity in the marketplace. So culturally, having the right fit appropriate to the quality business that is what we're looking for. So whether they'd be individual firms or advisers that want to join us, we'll be looking for that over time, and I think there will be opportunities, because as we're showing to you, we have a firm that has a lot of capability, but we're devoting tremendous resources to this. We have anywhere from 500 to 1,000 people working on this and DOL initiative right now, embedded in our firm, just based on how we're redeploying resources, because the time frame to get this done is pretty short and the amount of effort to get it done is pretty significant. So we feel we do have the ability to do that. Many firms will not have that ability or be able to support their advisers to make that change. Remember, advisers have to make these changes across their book. And many advisers have 300 or 500 clients, and so it's a big change for them. And so we have the wherewithal and the capabilities to help support our advisers through that. So if we look at M&A, it'll be along those types of guidelines that we would continue to pursue, firms and people. We also see opportunities in the Asset Management space. Very clearly, this is a consolidated environment. As you can see, flows are difficult across the business. And you really do need larger platforms and capabilities to sustain the type of business, put the product to market, ensure that it's meeting the criteria that firms like ours are going to have moving forward. And we feel that Columbia Threadneedle has a lot of those capabilities, and so we'll continue to look to complement what we have put in place."

So I would say -- I do feel that Ameriprise today is a stronger firm because we have a combination of a very strong distribution as well as manufacturing capabilities. Our manufacturing capabilities and the intellectual know-how and capability we have actually helps us in many regards to think about how our advisers can work better, products and services that are appropriate for them and the capabilities even to manage some of those various assets that we deploy. Now with that, as remember, in our channel, we only sell products consistent with what we offer from an industry perspective. They're very competitive. They operate in the same format, same pricing, same commission structure. Everything in that regard is no different. Having said that, we also, through our manufacturing, have the ability, like through Columbia Threadneedle, because we can serve a certain number of people but to serve more people globally, both retail and institutions and leverage that capability. So I feel like Ameriprise has a number of strong legs to our sort of a foundation and that those complement each other over time. I think as we've proven to you that if you look at our both ability to generate earnings growth, the volatility of our earnings are lower, our return has been higher from a combination of the businesses that we're in. Now we make sure each business is very much focused about what it could deliver and the core value of it. But I feel still, even with the changes with the DOL, if you can provide good product, appropriate product consistent with what needs to be delivered to the consumer endpoint in an appropriate and beneficial way, then there's no reason why you can't be in those businesses. And remember, very few business today are just pure distributors. Now you can say, well, in the wealth management independent space, but they're very tight margins.

It looks like the ones you are losing may be less productive. I mean, are you guys -- in terms of -- what are you -- are you shooting for to try to break even on a net adviser account? Is that a realistic assumption? Or is the -- I guess the leading process where you'll always tend to lose a little bit more less productive advisers than you'll gain in more productive new advisers? And just a quick follow-up to that, has the -- with the more stress in the independent brokerage industry, have you had to maybe pay less to recruit productive advisers given the fact they may have less options now?"

And we've been bringing on, more recently, even many more million-dollars-plus producers and teams. So they are finding Ameriprise a good home for them and appropriate from a cultural and a support perspective. The people we are losing in those attrition numbers are some lower producers that are not hitting some of the standards that we have. It also includes people who are retiring and moving their books to other advisers. So the assets don't leave, but they are sort of moving out and transitioning their practices as they have set up successful transition and succession plans that we help our advisers do here. And we are seeing some more advisers come back even from the independent space that want more of the support and the value that we can provide to help them build and grow their practices rather than being just more continued independent that don't get that level of that support out there. I will -- I think we will see a continuation of that pickup over time, as more people are evaluating their businesses and their practices. I think even as you move to the RIA space, it's going to be more difficult. All of RIAs, including rollovers have to operate under a big standard. There's going to be a lot more compliance and supervision out there. The SEC is staffing up to do that. They're also made arrangements with FINRA to handle some of the activities that they did, so that they can really focus on more of the advisory space now, that has grown. So I do believe that people are going to be need more support. I think the compliance is going to be very important out there across the industry and the liability the people will have will continue to rise."

They're evaluating the value and the services that they're render in that regard as well. And in the firm perspective, we're making adjustments for some of the things that we need to do to offset that as from a cost perspective or from a service perspective, as well.

We'd make a lot more money, et cetera, by just people moving on the other side, some of those clients won't be as served well. Our advisers book wouldn't be as complete for them. It wouldn't be actually helping our advisers achieve what they think they need to achieve from a client, the impact from a client would also be more significant. So I can't talk to them and their book and the size of their activities and how important this is to them. But we do feel that we want to help our advisers as best as we can. We will continue to help our advisers as they want to do more advisory business. Remember, 70% of our fee -- our total GDC already is in fee-based businesses through our financial plan activities and our RAP business, et cetera.

Having said that, even though this is a smaller part of the business, so you take the 30%, and you take on either piece for qualified which is less -- about 1/2 of that or less, we still feel that we want to provide support necessary for our advisers so that they don't disrupt their client activities or have the clients pay more for services already that for accounts and products that they're already offered. So that's what we're doing. I can't speak to other competitors in that regard. And again, we'll -- we think that we can be in compliance. If we can't, we won't do it.
