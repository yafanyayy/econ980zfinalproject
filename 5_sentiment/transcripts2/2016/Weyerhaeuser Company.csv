For the past 2 years, we have been relentlessly focused on making Weyerhaeuser a truly great company by pulling 3-key levers to drive value for shareholders. Portfolio, performance and capital allocation. In 2015,",1138,"Thank you, Denise and welcome, everyone. For the past 2 years, we have been relentlessly focused on making Weyerhaeuser a truly great company by pulling 3-key levers to drive value for shareholders. Portfolio, performance and capital allocation. In 2015, we made significant progress in each of these areas. We announced 2 transformational portfolio changes, a merger with Plum Creek, that will create the world's premier Timberland and force products company and the exploration of strategic alternatives for our Cellulose Fibers business. 
We maintained a relentless focus on improving our relative performance and delivered on our second set of annual operational excellence targets. And importantly, we delivered on our commitment to return cash to shareholders. We increased our dividend by 7% and we've repurchased nearly $520 million of common shares in 2015. Despite ongoing headwinds related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and global macroeconomic uncertainty we remain focused on what we can control. And for the fourth quarter, our business has once again delivered solid operating results. 
Weyerhaeuser reported fourth quarter net earnings of $59 million or $0.11 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $121 million or $0.24 per share. Our primary special items for the fourth quarter was a noncash asset impairment in our new Sprint equity affiliate. Additional items, including cost for the Plum Creek merger and the closure of several distribution centers and a tax benefit from the expiration of our built-in games period. 
I will begin the discussion of our fourth quarter business results with some brief comments about the housing market. The housing market maintained positive momentum in the fourth quarter as favorable weather conditions enabled building activity to continue through December in many areas of the country. Single-family housing starts improved in the quarter and ended the year up 10% compared with 2014. Total U.S. housing starts into 2015 just over 1.1 million, an improvement of 11% compared with last year. 
For 2016, we expect steady moderate growth in the U.S. housing market. We are planning for just over 1.2 million housing starts in an increasing single-family share with improving job growth and historically low interest rates, U.S. economic fundamentals support a continuing recovery. Despite some headwinds from labor constraints and falling oil prices, builder sentiment remains extremely strong. Most of our customers tell us they are planning for 2016 growth rates in the low double-digits. 
Let me now turn to our business segment results starting with Timberlands, Charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $134 million to fourth quarter earnings, an improvement of $8 million compared with the third quarter. In the West, fee harvest volumes rose seasonally as we exited the third quarter fire season and average log realizations increased due to a greater percentage each of our export sales. Each of our export markets improvement in the quarter. 
Log sales volumes to Japan increased and prices rose modestly as a solid Japanese housing market continues to drive demand. For the full year 2015, Japanese wooden housing starts grew by 3%. In China, log inventory at the ports declined throughout the fourth quarter as many suppliers curtailed shipment in response to weak third quarter pricing. Although overall Chinese market demand remain relatively flat compared with the third quarter, average realizations for our China export log increase and sales volumes grows as we reflect volumes to take advantage of opportunities created by the tighter Chinese inventory situation. 
In Western domestic markets, law of supply and demand remain balanced during the quarter. Realizations for our Western domestic logs declined slightly to a greater mix of [indiscernible] and other white wood. The flooding experience in some regions of Washington and in Oregon during December had no significant effect on our operations or infrastructure. In the South, heavy rainfall did affect harvest operations and select wood baskets. The fee harvest declined only 3% compared with third quarter as our Southern Timberlands did an outstanding job of flexing harbor settings in response to weather conditions. 
Although overall market conditions were stable, realizations for our southern logs declined slightly due to a shift in geographic mix. Silviculture and expenses declined due to cost control initiatives and weather-related constraints. Fourth quarter included earnings of $19 million from disposition and nonstrategic Timberlands, an increase of $6 million compared with the third quarter. 
Wood Products, Charts 6 and 7. Wood Products contributed $48 million to fourth quarter earnings before special items, compared with $85 million in the third quarter. Special items for the fourth quarter included a pretax charge of $8 million for the closure of 4 distribution centers as we continue to improve the cost structure of that business. Adjusted EBITDA before special items for the Wood Products segment declined to $75 million in the fourth quarter as seasonally lower sales volumes and lower operating rates more than offset improved realizations for oriented [indiscernible]. 
In lumber, EBITDA was $22 million lower compared with the third quarter. Average realizations declined 3% and sales volumes fell 9%. Operating rates declined and unit manufacture costs rose due to increased downtime, primarily for installation of capital projects that will continue to reduce costs within our southern lumber system. In OSB, EBITDA improved by $13 million, primarily due to a 14% increase in average sales realizations. This improvement was partially offset by 7% reduction in sales volume and higher unit manufacture costs due to planned maintenance downtime. 
Engineered Wood Products reported fourth quarter EBITDA of $14 million compared with $36 million in the third quarter. Operating rates declined due to downtime of a major maintenance, capital projects and seasonal holiday shutdowns. Sales volumes declined seasonably and average realizations were lower due to mix. EBITDA for the Distribution business declined compared with third quarter due to seasonably lower sales volumes. 
Cellulose Fibers, Charts 8 and 9. Cellulose fibers contributed $64 million to fourth quarter earnings before special items, compared with $79 million in the third quarter. Fourth quarter results included a noncash pretax charge of $84 million for the asset impairment in our newsprint equity affiliate. Pulp prices remained under pressure during the fourth quarter due to continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Average pulp realizations declined compared with the third quarter and maintenance expense increased due to additional scheduled maintenance outage dates. 
Fourth quarter included 8 days of scheduled maintenance outages compared with 4 days in the third quarter. These factors were partially offset by improved sales volumes and strong operating performance. Pulp production rose compared with the third quarter despite the increase in scheduled maintenance outage days in several of our mills set operating levels. For example, our Columbus, Mississippi mill operated at nearly 100% reliability in the quarter. 
I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our first quarter outlook and then I'll follow-up with some specific comments on operational excellence."
107633,321351869,927930,"Weyerhaeuser Co., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2016",2016-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the first quarter is summarized on Chart 12. Now this outlook does not incorporate the merger with Plum Creek. We'll include Plum Creek results after the transaction closes. I'll begin my comments",743,"Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the first quarter is summarized on Chart 12. Now this outlook does not incorporate the merger with Plum Creek. We'll include Plum Creek results after the transaction closes. I'll begin my comments with Timberlands. In the West, export demand from Japan is expected to remain strong and we anticipate a slight improvement in pricing. The strength of the U.S. dollar continues to dampen significant price increases. Sales volumes to Japan are expected to increase more than 5% in the quarter. Our volumes and realizations for log sales to China are anticipated to increase modestly. 
We anticipate a slight increase in Western domestic sales realizations as lumber prices are expected to improve later in the quarter. Fee harvest in the West is expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter. In the South, sales realizations are expected to decrease slightly due to mix. Sales volumes will be lower as wet weather contributes to the typical seasonal decline in fee harvest. Earnings from nonstrategic land sales are anticipated to be roughly $10 million lower than the fourth quarter. 
Overall, we expect earnings in our Timberlands segment to be comparable to the fourth quarter. In Wood Products. Lumber average sales realizations are anticipated to increase in the first quarter compared to the fourth, although prices had not improved thus far. Realizations for our other product lines as well as overall sales volumes are expected to be roughly comparable to last quarter. We expect less downtime from planned maintenance and capital projects compared to the fourth quarter. And as a result, average unit manufacture costs should decrease. Channel inventories remain low with customers generally purchasing for immediate needs. As we enter the spring building season, we do expect to see business improve. 
We anticipate that overall earnings in our Wood Products segment will be higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth, and slightly higher than the first quarter of 2015. In Cellulose Fibers, global softwood pulp inventories as of the end of the fourth quarter were at 29 days, down slightly from the 30 days at the end of the third quarter. This is at the high-end of balanced inventory level. We expect that average sales realizations and volumes for our pulp products will weaken during the first quarter due to the continued currency headwinds and the normal effect of the Chinese New Year. 
Our liquid packaging operation will begin its planned maintenance outage this quarter and as a result, we expect maintenance expense for this segment will increase significantly compared to the fourth quarter, which had fewer overall maintenance days. We anticipate that earnings in our cellulose fibers segment will be significantly lower than the fourth quarter of 2015 and roughly comparable to the first quarter of last year. 
Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments, and I'll refer to Chart 11 for this discussion. Cash from operations totaled $339 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $57 million from the third quarter. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $174 million, bringing our total expenditures for the full year to $483 million, well within our earlier guidance of $500 million. 
Looking ahead, to 2016, we expect total expenditures for the full year to be down slightly from 2015, subject to the outcome of the strategic review for Cellulose Fibers and the transaction with Plum Creek. At the end of the quarter, we had cash of just over $1 billion and we do not have any scheduled debt maturities in 2016. Now I'd like to update you on the status of our retirement benefit plans. 
The year end 2015 funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and postemployment retirement plans improved by approximately $400 million compared to year-end 2014. This improvement was primarily the results of the increase in discount rates. We did not make any cash contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan in 2015, and we don't anticipate any cash contributions for that plan this year. Cash paid for all other pension and other postemployment retirement plan in 2015 was approximately $80 million. We expect spending in 2016 to be approximately $60 million. 
Chart 14 in the appendix details the pension expense by business for 2015. Total expense in 2015 was approximately $42 million and in 2016, we expect the total amount will be income of approximately $5 million. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Doyle."

I'd now like to switch gears to provide an update on our operational excellence efforts. Throughout the year, each of our businesses remain relentlessly focused on achieving their respective operational excellence targets. Achieving thes",1360,"Thank you, Patty. I'd now like to switch gears to provide an update on our operational excellence efforts. Throughout the year, each of our businesses remain relentlessly focused on achieving their respective operational excellence targets. Achieving these targets is not easy, they're designed to stretch the business to deliver a step change in relative performance, and that's exactly what is happening through a lot of really good work by our employees. 
Chart 13 highlights our OpEx accomplishments for 2015 and our annual targets for 2016. The Timberland business delivered $39 million of operational excellence improvement in 2015, exceeding its target of $20 million to $30 million. These results were primarily, driven by cost efficiency in 3 key areas. First, harvest in. We are continuing the implementation of centralized dispatch systems to improve the efficiency of logging and clicking contractors and replacing costly cable logging with steep slope technologies. 
Second, spending on forest roads. We're adjusting the volumes of rock related during well construction and the level of road maintenance to match expected vehicle travel patterns and local weather conditions. Finally, silvicultural costs. Data we have collected on tree stand growth patterns, enable us to custom tailor silviculture prescriptions to apply pruning and hardwood control only to acres where those activity generate an optimal financial return. 
With total OpEx improvements of $64 million since 2013, the Timberlands business has achieved the $50 million to $70 million improvement goal we established 2 years ago. However, we're not done. For 2016, we are targeting an additional $20 million to $30 million of OpEx improvements from our existing Timberlands holdings. This does not include the benefit we will get from applying our OpEx efforts to over 6 million acres of Plum Creek lands. 
The lumber business achieved $21 million of improvement in 2015, meeting its target of $20 million to $25 million. Primary drivers improvements in reliability and process efficiency, and rigorous cost management as we continue to drive down our cost net of logs. Each mill is focused on maintaining consistent throughput and improving uptime by resolving process and equipment issues that create bottlenecks for stock production. 
Capital expenditures for the lumber business increased in 2015 as we invested in low risk, high return projects to further improve the cost of our mills. These projects include auto and continued. We will capture the full benefits of several of these investments in 2016. With cumulative improvements of over $40 million since 2013, the lumber business is nearing half way on its journey to $100 million of controllable manufacturing cost reductions. 
For 2016, the business is targeting OpEx improvements of $15 million to $20 million. [indiscernible] delivered $24 million of OpEx improvement in 2015, exceeding its target of $10 million to $15 million. Results were driven by improving reliability as our mills' focused on eliminating sources of downtime and recovering efficiency from outage events. Lowering and revving costs, as we optimize recipes for multiple products and increasing our mix of higher margin products such as flooring. 
For cumulative improvements of $34 million, the OSB business is more than halfway to its 60 million goal. The business is targeting another $15 million to $20 million of OpEx improvements in 2016. For engineered Wood Products and distribution, we set specific bottom line EBITDA improvement targets for 2015 as those businesses remain focused on turnaround performance. Engineered Wood Products improved full year EBITDA by $35 million compared with 2014, significantly exceeding its $15 million to $20 million target. 
Each mill maintain a rigorous focus on reducing manufacturing costs for all products. For example, maintenance team have best practices across the mill system, increasing reliability and reducing costs. Engineered Wood Products has made substantial improvements since 2013. Over the past 2 years, this business has increased annually EBITDA by almost $70 million, proving that it has ability to perform. Our focus now is continuing to improve relative performance versus the competition. The 2016 goal for this business will not be a bottom line EBITDA target, but an OpEx improvement target of $10 million to $15 million. 
Distribution improved full year EBITDA by $8 million in 2015. The business fell short of its $20 million to $30 million improvement target as it was unable to overcome the effects of severe winter weather early in the year and lower-than-expected demand in the first half of 2015. 2015 OpEx improvements were largely attributable to improved product margin and reduction of headcount, warehouse and delivery expenses. 
Improvements made to the distribution cost structure during 2015 have created a stronger foundation for better operating performance next year. In 2016, the Distribution business is targeting bottom line EBITDA improvement of $15 million to $20 million. Cellulose Fibers. Cellulose fibers delivered operational improvement of $47 million, significantly increasing its $30 million to $35 million targets, improvements were primarily attributable to lower energy cost driven by new term in generator at our planned river mill and our water conversion at Columbus and reduced usage of key chemicals at several mills adjusted processes tied to their digesters and place plans. 
During 2016, Cellulose Fibers is targeting improvement of $40 million to $50 million. With OpEx improvements of $75 million to date, this will enable the business to exceed $100 million goal established in 2013. I'll also mention the reduction in our SG&A. Part of our commitment to operational excellence is having the right cost structure across our company. Two years ago, we committed to reduce SG&A by $75 million and achieved that run rate by the end of 2014. Last year, we told you, we had delivered on that commitment and you can see our performance in this year's results. Compared with 2013, we have reduced our SG&A by over $100 million. Success in achieving our OpEx target was a critical component of Weyerhaeuser's 2015 financial performance, enabling us to offset pricing headwinds in many of our markets. 
In Timberlands, weaker year-over-year pricing for Western logs created a headwind of over $100 million. By exceeding its operational excellence target, the Timberland business was able to overcome nearly half of that deficit. Lower year-over-year realizations of11% for lumber and 9% for OSB, created a headwind of over $250 million for Wood Products earnings. However, the salient captured nearly $100 million of operational exhibit significantly mitigating the effect of these lower prices and earnings for Wood Products declined less than $70 million on a year-over-year basis. 
Cellulose Fibers saved a headwind of over $100 million from declining pulp prices, higher-priced costs and the effect of the West Coast port slow down. The business of that nearly half of this amount through its OpEx efforts. Looking forward to 2016, our relentless focus on operational excellence remains a key component of our commitment to improve our relative performance and drive value for shareholders. I will close this morning with some brief comments on our merger with Plum Creek and the strategic review of our cellulose fibers business. 
The joint registration statement associated with our announced merger with Plum Creek was declared effective by the SEC on December 28. Both ISS and, have recommend that shareholders vote in favor of the proposal. The shareholder vote will be held on February 12 and we anticipate closing the merger in the first quarter. Our joint integration team is making excellent progress as we define staffing needs, established plan for cost synergies and position the merged company for a smooth and successful day 1. 
The review of Cellulose Fibers is proceeding well and we look forward to sharing more information with you when that review is complete. As we enter 2016, I'm excited about the opportunities in front of us. Although the first few weeks of the year have been characterized by market turbulence and global macroeconomic concerns, I'm encouraged by the positive trend in U.S. housing and the optimistic tone we are hearing from our customers. 
Our portfolio changes and operational improvements are positioning Weyerhaeuser to drive long-term value for shareholders. We will remain relentlessly focused on operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation and I look forward to sharing our continued progress with you. And now, I'd like to open up the phone for questions."

This year, hey using weather, but weather did have an impact in the first half of the year, lower-than-expected demand and the fact that we had kind of eroding commodity prices throughout the year may be its ability to leverage margin improvements. As we said, we made some significant changes to the cost structure by closing Forsyth to reduce the print -- footprint of the cost structure and really focus on our growth markets going forward. And I'll tell you with those changes, we are confident that we're going to be able to continue to improve our Distribution business. But still a lot of work to do there and still work to do frankly, to prove that we deserve to be in this business long-term. But good progress and again, with the structural changes we made in the fourth quarter, optimistic about that business going forward."

Encouraging prices were up $4, $5 this week, so we'll see where it plays out. But normally, you start to see an inflection point in lumber prices mid- to late-February as the spring season -- as billing season kicks in. And we would hope to see the same type of price inflection or improvement in OSB as we move to the quarter as well, and that's what's baked into -- generally baked into our guidance for the first quarter."

For the past 2 years, we have been relentlessly focused on making Weyerhaeuser a truly great company by pulling 3 key levers to drive value for shareholders: portfolio, performance and capital allocation. In 2015,",1145,"Thank you, Denise, and welcome, everyone. For the past 2 years, we have been relentlessly focused on making Weyerhaeuser a truly great company by pulling 3 key levers to drive value for shareholders: portfolio, performance and capital allocation. In 2015, we made significant progress in each of these areas. We announced 2 transformational portfolio changes: a merger with Plum Creek that will create the world's premier timber, land and forest products company; and the exploration of strategic alternatives for our Cellulose Fibers business. 
We maintained a relentless focus on improving our relative performance and delivered on our second set of annual operational excellence targets. And importantly, we delivered on our commitment to return cash to shareholders. We increased our dividend by 7%, and we've repurchased nearly $520 million of common shares in 2015. Despite ongoing headwinds related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and global macroeconomic uncertainty, we remain focused on what we can control. And for the fourth quarter, our business has once again delivered solid operating results. 
Weyerhaeuser reported fourth quarter net earnings of $59 million or $0.11 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $121 million or $0.24 per share. Our primary special item for the fourth quarter was a noncash asset impairment in our newsprint equity affiliate. Additional items included costs for the Plum Creek merger and the closure of several distribution centers and a tax benefit from the expiration of our built-in-gains period. 
I will begin the discussion of our fourth quarter business results with some brief comments about the housing market. The housing market maintained positive momentum in the fourth quarter as favorable weather conditions enabled building activity to continue through December in many areas of the country. Single-family housing starts improved in the quarter and ended the year up 10% compared with 2014. Total U.S. housing starts ended 2015 at just over 1.1 million, an improvement of 11% compared with last year. 
For 2016, we expect steady moderate growth in the U.S. housing market. We are planning for just over 1.2 million housing starts and an increasing single-family share. With improving job growth and historically low interest rates, U.S. economic fundamentals support a continuing recovery. Despite some headwinds from labor constraints and falling oil prices, builder sentiment remains extremely strong. Most of our customers tell us they are planning for 2016 growth rates in the low double digits. 
Let me now turn to our business segment results, starting with Timberlands, Charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $134 million to fourth quarter earnings, an improvement of $8 million compared with the third quarter. In the West, fee harvest volumes rose seasonally as we exited the third quarter fire season and average log realizations increased due to a greater percentage each of our export sales. Each of our export markets improved in the quarter. 
Log sales volumes to Japan increased and prices rose modestly as a solid Japanese housing market continues to drive demand. For the full year 2015, Japanese wooden housing starts grew by 3%. In China, log inventory at the ports declined throughout the fourth quarter as many suppliers curtailed shipment in response to weak third quarter pricing. Although overall Chinese market demand remained relatively flat compared with the third quarter, average realizations for our China export log increased and sales volumes rose as we flex volumes to take advantage of opportunities created by the tighter Chinese inventory situation. 
In Western domestic markets, law of supply and demand remained balanced during the quarter. Realizations for our Western domestic logs declined slightly to a greater mix of hemlock and other white wood. The flooding experienced in some regions of Washington and in Oregon during December had no significant effect on our operations or infrastructure. In the South, heavy rainfall did affect harvest operations and select wood baskets, but fee harvest declined only 3% compared with third quarter as our Southern Timberlands  team did an outstanding job of flexing harvest settings in response to weather conditions. 
Although overall market conditions were stable, realizations for our southern logs declined slightly due to a shift in geographic mix. Silviculture and forestry expenses declined due to cost control initiatives and weather-related constraints. Fourth quarter included earnings of $19 million from disposition and nonstrategic timberland, an increase of $6 million compared with the third quarter. 
Wood Products, Charts 6 and 7. Wood Products contributed $48 million to fourth quarter earnings before special items, compared with $85 million in the third quarter. Special items for the fourth quarter included a pretax charge of $8 million for the closure of 4 distribution centers as we continue to improve the cost structure of that business. Adjusted EBITDA before special items for the Wood Products segment declined to $75 million in the fourth quarter, as seasonally lower sales volumes and lower operating rates more than offset improved realizations for oriented strand board.
In lumber, EBITDA was $22 million lower compared with the third quarter. Average realizations declined 3% and sales volumes fell 9%. Operating rates declined and unit manufacturing costs rose due to increased downtime, primarily for installation of capital projects that will continue to reduce costs within our southern lumber system. In OSB, EBITDA improved by $13 million, primarily due to a 14% increase in average sales realizations. This improvement was partially offset by a 7% reduction in sales volume and higher unit manufacturing costs due to planned maintenance downtime. 
Engineered wood products reported fourth quarter EBITDA of $14 million compared with $36 million in the third quarter. Operating rates declined due to downtime of a major maintenance, capital projects and seasonal holiday shutdowns. Sales volumes declined seasonably and average realizations were lower due to mix. EBITDA for the Distribution business declined compared with third quarter due to seasonably lower sales volumes. 
Cellulose Fibers, Charts 8 and 9. Cellulose Fibers contributed $64 million to fourth quarter earnings before special items, compared with $79 million in the third quarter. Fourth quarter results included a noncash pretax charge of $84 million for the asset impairment in our newsprint equity affiliate. Pulp prices remained under pressure during the fourth quarter due to continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Average pulp realizations declined compared with the third quarter and maintenance expense increased due to additional scheduled maintenance outage dates. 
Fourth quarter included 8 days of scheduled maintenance outages compared with 4 days in the third quarter. These factors were partially offset by improved sales volumes and strong operating performance. Pulp production rose compared with the third quarter despite the increase in scheduled maintenance outage days, and several of our mills set operating records. For example, our Columbus, Mississippi mill operated at nearly 100% reliability in the quarter. 
I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our first quarter outlook, and then I'll follow up with some specific comments on operational excellence."
107633,321351869,928076,"Weyerhaeuser Co., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2016",2016-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everyone.

We'll include Plum Creek results after the transaction closes. I'll begin my comments with Timberlands. In the West, export demand from Japan is expected to remain strong and we anticipate a slight improvement in pricing. The strength of the U.S. dollar continues to dampen significant price increases. Sales volumes to Japan are expected to increase more than 5% in the quarter. Our volumes and realizations for log sales to China are anticipated to increase modestly. 
We anticipate a slight increase in Western domestic sales realizations as lumber prices are expected to improve later in the quarter. Fee harvest in the West is expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter. In the South, sales realizations are expected to decrease slightly due to mix. Sales volumes will be lower as wet weather contributes to the typical seasonal decline in fee harvest. Earnings from nonstrategic land sales are anticipated to be roughly $10 million lower than the fourth quarter. Overall, we expect earnings in our Timberlands segment to be comparable to the fourth quarter. 
In Wood Products. Lumber average sales realizations are anticipated to increase in the first quarter compared to the fourth, although prices had not improved thus far. Realizations for our other product lines as well as overall sales volumes are expected to be roughly comparable to last quarter. We expect less downtime from planned maintenance and capital projects compared to the fourth quarter and as a result, average unit manufacturing costs should decrease. Channel inventories remain low, with customers generally purchasing for immediate needs. As we enter the spring building season, we do expect to see business improve. We anticipate that overall earnings in our Wood Products segment will be higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth, and slightly higher than the first quarter of 2015. 
In Cellulose Fibers, global softwood pulp inventories as of the end of the fourth quarter were at 29 days, down slightly from the 30 days at the end of the third quarter. This is at the high end of balanced inventory level. We expect that average sales realizations and volumes for our pulp products will weaken during the first quarter due to continued currency headwinds and the normal effect of the Chinese New Year. 
Our liquid packaging operation will begin its planned maintenance outage this quarter and as a result, we expect maintenance expense for this segment will increase significantly compared to the fourth quarter, which had fewer overall maintenance days. We anticipate that earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment will be significantly lower than the fourth quarter of 2015 and roughly comparable to the first quarter of last year. 
Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments, and I'll refer to Chart 11 for this discussion. Cash from operations totaled $339 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $57 million from the third quarter. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $174 million, bringing our total expenditures for the full year to $483 million, well within our earlier guidance of $500 million. 
Looking ahead to 2016, we expect total expenditures for the full year to be down slightly from 2015, subject to the outcome of the strategic review for Cellulose Fibers and the transaction with Plum Creek. At the end of the quarter, we had cash of just over $1 billion and we do not have any scheduled debt maturities in 2016. Now I'd like to update you on the status of our retirement benefit plans. 
The year-end 2015 funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and postemployment retirement plans improved by approximately $400 million compared to year-end 2014. This improvement was primarily the result of the increase in discount rates. We did not make any cash contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan in 2015, and we don't anticipate any cash contributions for that plan this year. Cash paid for all other pension and other postemployment retirement plans in 2015 was approximately $80 million. We expect spending in 2016 to be approximately $60 million. 
Chart 14 in the appendix details the pension expense by business for 2015. Total expense in 2015 was approximately $42 million and in 2016, we expect the total amount will be income of approximately $5 million. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to Doyle."

I'd now like to switch gears and provide an update on our operational excellence efforts. Throughout the year, each of our businesses remain relentlessly focused on achieving their respective operational excellence targets. Achieving these targets is not easy. They're designed to stretch the business to deliver a step change in relative performance, and that's exactly what is happening through a lot of really good work by our employees. 
Chart 13 highlights our OpEx accomplishments for 2015 and our annual targets for 2016. The Timberlands business delivered $39 million of operational excellence improvement in 2015, exceeding its target of $20 million to $30 million. These results were primarily, driven by cost efficiency in 3 key areas. First, harvest and haul cost. We are continuing the implementation of centralized dispatch systems to improve the efficiency of logging and collecting contractors and replacing costly cable logging with steep slope technologies. 
Second, spending on forest roads. We're adjusting the volume of rock we lay during road construction and the level of road maintenance to match expected vehicle travel patterns and local weather conditions. Finally, silvicultural costs. Data we have collected on tree stand growth patterns enable us to custom tailor silviculture prescriptions to apply pruning and hardwood control only to acres where those activity generate an optimal financial return. 
With total OpEx improvements of $64 million since 2013, the Timberlands business has achieved the $50 million to $70 million improvement goal we established 2 years ago. However, we're not done. For 2016, we are targeting an additional $20 million to $30 million of OpEx improvements from our existing Timberlands holdings. This does not include the benefit we will get from applying our OpEx efforts to over 6 million acres of Plum Creek lands. 
The lumber business achieved $21 million of improvements in 2015, meeting its target of $20 million to $25 million. Primary drivers include improvements in reliability and process efficiency, and rigorous cost management as we continue to drive down our cost net of logs. Each mill is focused on maintaining consistent throughput and improving uptime by resolving process and equipment issues that create bottlenecks or stop production. 
Capital expenditures for the lumber business increased in 2015 as we invested in low risk, high-return projects to further improve the cost structure of our mills. These projects include autograders and continuous vacuums [ph]. We will capture the full benefits from several of these investments in 2016. With cumulative improvements of over $40 million since 2013, the lumber business is nearing halfway on its journey to $100 million of controllable manufacturing cost reductions. 
For 2016, the business is targeting OpEx improvements of $15 million to $20 million. Oriented strand board delivered $24 million of OpEx improvement in 2015, exceeding its target of $10 million to $15 million. Results were driven by improving reliability as our mills focus on eliminating sources of downtime and recovering efficiently from outage events. Lowering wax and resin costs as we optimize recipes for multiple products and increasing our mix of higher-margin products such as flooring. 
With cumulative improvements of $34 million, the OSB business is more than halfway to its $60 million goal. The business is targeting another $15 million to $20 million of OpEx improvements in 2016. For engineered wood products and distribution, we set specific bottom line EBITDA improvement targets for 2015 as those businesses remain focused on turnaround performance. Engineered wood products improved full year EBITDA by $35 million compared with 2014, significantly exceeding its $15 million to $20 million target. 
Each mill maintain a rigorous focus on reducing unit manufacturing costs for all products. For example, maintenance teams share best practices across the mill system, increasing reliability and reducing costs. Engineered wood products has made substantial improvements since 2013. Over the past 2 years, this business has increased annual EBITDA by almost $70 million, proving that it has ability to perform. Our focus now is continuing to improve relative performance versus the competition. The 2016 goal for this business will not be a bottom line EBITDA target, but an OpEx improvement target of $10 million to $15 million. 
Distribution improved full year EBITDA by $8 million in 2015. The business fell short of its $20 million to $30 million improvement target as it was unable to overcome the effects of severe winter weather early in the year and lower-than-expected demand in the first half of 2015. 2015 OpEx improvements were largely attributable to improved product margin and reductions in headcount, warehouse and delivery expenses. 
Improvements made to the distribution cost structure during 2015 have created a stronger foundation for better operating performance next year. In 2016, the Distribution business is targeting bottom line EBITDA improvement of $15 million to $20 million. Cellulose Fibers. Cellulose fibers delivered operational excellence improvement of $47 million, significantly exceeding its $30 million to $35 million targets. Improvements were primarily attributable to lower energy cost driven by a new turbine generator at our Flint River mill and a boiler conversion at Columbus and reduced usage of key chemicals as several mills adjusted processes tied to their digesters and bleach plants. 
During 2016, Cellulose Fibers is targeting an improvement of $40 million to $50 million. With OpEx improvements of $75 million to date, this would enable the business to exceed the $100 million goal established in 2013. I'll also mention the reduction in our SG&A. Part of our commitment to operational excellence is having the right cost structure across our company. Two years ago, we committed to reduce SG&A by $75 million and achieved that run rate by the end of 2014. Last year, we told you we had delivered on that commitment, and you can see our performance in this year's results. Compared with 2013, we have reduced our SG&A by over $100 million. Success in achieving our OpEx target was a critical component of Weyerhaeuser's 2015 financial performance, enabling us to offset pricing headwinds in many of our markets. 
In Timberlands, weaker year-over-year pricing for Western logs created a headwind of over $100 million. By exceeding its operational excellence target, the Timberlands business was able to overcome nearly half of that deficit. Lower year-over-year realizations of 11% for lumber and 9% for OSB, created a headwind of over $250 million for Wood Products earnings. However, the segment captured nearly $100 million of operational excellence improvements, significantly mitigating the effect of these lower prices and earnings for Wood Products declined less than $70 million on a year-over-year basis. 
Cellulose Fibers faced a headwind of over $100 million from declining pulp prices, higher fiber costs and the effect of the West Coast port slowdown. The business offset nearly half of this amount through its OpEx efforts. 
Looking forward to 2016, our relentless focus on operational excellence remains a key component of our commitment to improve our relative performance and drive value for shareholders. I will close this morning with some brief comments on our merger with Plum Creek and the strategic review of our cellulose fibers business. 
The joint proxy and registration statement associated with our announced merger with Plum Creek was declared effective by the SEC on December 28. Both ISS and Glass Lewis have recommend that shareholders vote in favor of the proposal. The shareholder vote will be held on February 12, and we anticipate closing the merger in the first quarter. Our joint integration team is making excellent progress as we define staffing needs, establish a plan for cost synergy and position the merged company for a smooth and successful day 1. 
The review of Cellulose Fibers is proceeding well, and we look forward to sharing more information with you when that review is complete. 
As we enter 2016, I'm excited about the opportunities in front of us. Although the first few weeks of the year have been characterized by market turbulence and global macroeconomic concerns, I'm encouraged by the positive trend in U.S. housing and the optimistic tone we are hearing from our customers. 
Our portfolio changes and operational improvements are positioning Weyerhaeuser to drive long-term value for shareholders. We will remain relentlessly focused on operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation and I look forward to sharing our continued progress with you. And now I'd like to open up the phone for questions."

But the encouraging thing about OpEx overall, Anthony, that we've seen is it started off as a top-down effort. But as we defined winning, defined exactly what we mean by OpEx and people are incented to drive OpEx, we are having just more and more ideas bubble up in terms of the opportunities. And Cathy has a full slate of those outlined and proved in 2015, ability to execute on those and more to come in 2016.

But as I've said in response to the earlier question, what I'm really encouraged about and why we're confident we're going to be able to continue to deliver on OpEx target is because it has become part of who we are. It is being done much more from a bottoms-up approach, George. So whereas, previously, it was things that were identified at the top and kind of driven down. And now more and more of these ideas -- to your point, it's a larger funnel -- more and more of our ideas are coming from our employee base -- which they are -- as you pointed out, they're doing the hard work every day. When they understand what the opportunities are, recognize that they are empowered to go do something else and then incented to do that, it's amazing what can happen. So you're right, it is a different approach. But very encouraged by the progress and most importantly, it's becoming part of our culture. And that's why we're -- year after year, we believe we're going to be able to continue to drive operational excellence as we move forward. In terms of distribution. George, it's been -- while we have made -- and I think it's important to highlight we have made improvement there. And if you look at it, we've made $40 million plus improvement over the last few years in bottom line distribution EBITDA. But we're still not where we need to be, to your point. This year, I hate using weather, but weather did have an impact in the first half of the year. Slower-than-expected demand and then the fact that we had kind of eroding commodity prices throughout the year limited the ability to leverage margin improvements. As we said, we made some significant changes to the cost structure by closing 4 sites to reduce the print -- footprint, the cost structure and really focus on our growth markets going forward. And I'll tell you, with those changes, we are confident that we're going to be able to continue to improve our Distribution business. But still a lot of work to do there and still have work to do, frankly, to prove that we deserve to be in this business long term. But good progress and again, with the structural changes we made in the fourth quarter, optimistic about that business going forward."

For the past 2 years, we have been relentlessly focused on making Weyerhaeuser a truly great company by pulling 3 key levers to drive value for shareholders: portfolio, performance and capital allocation. In 2015,",1142,"Thank you, Denise, and welcome, everyone. For the past 2 years, we have been relentlessly focused on making Weyerhaeuser a truly great company by pulling 3 key levers to drive value for shareholders: portfolio, performance and capital allocation. In 2015, we made significant progress in each of these areas. We announced 2 transformational portfolio changes: a merger with Plum Creek that will create the world's premier timber, land and forest products company; and the exploration of strategic alternatives for our Cellulose Fibers business. 
We maintained a relentless focus on improving our relative performance and delivered on our second set of annual operational excellence targets. And importantly, we delivered on our commitment to return cash to shareholders. We increased our dividend by 7%, and we've repurchased nearly $520 million of common shares in 2015. Despite ongoing headwinds related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and global macroeconomic uncertainty, we remain focused on what we can control. And for the fourth quarter, our business has once again delivered solid operating results. 
Weyerhaeuser reported fourth quarter net earnings of $59 million or $0.11 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $121 million or $0.24 per share. Our primary special item for the fourth quarter was a noncash asset impairment in our newsprint equity affiliate. Additional items included costs for the Plum Creek merger and the closure of several distribution centers and a tax benefit from the expiration of our built-in-gains period. 
I will begin the discussion of our fourth quarter business results with some brief comments about the housing market. The housing market maintained positive momentum in the fourth quarter as favorable weather conditions enabled building activity to continue through December in many areas of the country. Single-family housing starts improved in the quarter and ended the year up 10% compared with 2014. Total U.S. housing starts ended 2015 at just over 1.1 million, an improvement of 11% compared with last year. 
For 2016, we expect steady moderate growth in the U.S. housing market. We are planning for just over 1.2 million housing starts and an increasing single-family share. With improving job growth and historically low interest rates, U.S. economic fundamentals support a continuing recovery. Despite some headwinds from labor constraints and falling oil prices, builder sentiment remains extremely strong. Most of our customers tell us they are planning for 2016 growth rates in the low double digits. 
Let me now turn to our business segment results, starting with Timberlands, Charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $134 million to fourth quarter earnings, an improvement of $8 million compared with the third quarter. In the West, fee harvest volumes rose seasonally as we exited the third quarter fire season and average log realizations increased due to a greater percentage of export sales. Each of our export markets improved in the quarter. 
Log sales volumes to Japan increased and prices rose modestly as a solid Japanese housing market continues to drive demand. For the full year 2015, Japanese wooden housing starts grew by 3%. In China, log inventories at the ports declined throughout the fourth quarter as many suppliers curtailed shipment in response to weak third quarter pricing. Although overall Chinese market demand remained relatively flat compared with the third quarter, average realizations for our China export logs increased and sales volumes rose as we flexed volumes to take advantage of opportunities created by the tighter Chinese inventory situation. 
In Western domestic markets, log supply and demand remained balanced during the quarter. Realizations for our Western domestic logs declined slightly to a greater mix of hemlock and other white wood. The flooding experienced in some regions of Washington and in Oregon during December had no significant effect on our operations or infrastructure. In the South, heavy rainfall did affect harvest operations in select wood baskets, but fee harvest declined only 3% compared with third quarter as our Southern Timberlands team did an outstanding job of flexing harvest settings in response to weather conditions. 
Although overall market conditions were stable, realizations for our southern logs declined slightly due to a shift in geographic mix. Silviculture and forestry expenses declined due to cost control initiatives and weather-related constraints. Fourth quarter included earnings of $19 million from disposition of nonstrategic timberlands, an increase of $6 million compared with the third quarter. 
Wood Products, Charts 6 and 7. Wood Products contributed $48 million to fourth quarter earnings before special items, compared with $85 million in the third quarter. Special items for the fourth quarter included a pretax charge of $8 million for the closure of 4 distribution centers as we continue to improve the cost structure of that business. Adjusted EBITDA before special items for the Wood Products segment declined to $75 million in the fourth quarter, as seasonally lower sales volumes and lower operating rates more than offset improved realizations for oriented strand board.
In lumber, EBITDA was $22 million lower compared with the third quarter. Average realizations declined 3% and sales volumes fell 9%. Operating rates declined and unit manufacturing costs rose due to increased downtime, primarily for installation of capital projects that will continue to reduce costs within our southern lumber system. In OSB, EBITDA improved by $13 million, primarily due to a 14% increase in average sales realizations. This improvement was partially offset by a 7% reduction in sales volume and higher unit manufacturing costs due to planned maintenance downtime. 
Engineered wood products reported fourth quarter EBITDA of $14 million compared with $36 million in the third quarter. Operating rates declined due to downtime of a major maintenance, capital projects and seasonal holiday shutdowns. Sales volumes declined seasonably and average realizations were lower due to mix. EBITDA for the Distribution business declined compared with third quarter due to seasonably lower sales volumes. 
Cellulose Fibers, Charts 8 and 9. Cellulose Fibers contributed $64 million to fourth quarter earnings before special items, compared with $79 million in the third quarter. Fourth quarter results included a noncash pretax charge of $84 million for the asset impairment in our newsprint equity affiliate. Pulp prices remained under pressure during the fourth quarter due to continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Average pulp realizations declined compared with the third quarter and maintenance expense increased due to additional scheduled maintenance outage dates. 
Fourth quarter included 8 days of scheduled maintenance outages compared with 4 days in the third quarter. These factors were partially offset by improved sales volumes and strong operating performance. Pulp production rose compared with the third quarter despite the increase in scheduled maintenance outage days, and several of our mills set operating records. For example, our Columbus, Mississippi mill operated at nearly 100% reliability in the quarter. 
I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our first quarter outlook, and then I'll follow up with some specific comments on operational excellence."
107633,321351869,928166,"Weyerhaeuser Co., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2016",2016-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the first quarter is summarized on Chart 12. Now this outlook does not incorporate the merger with Plum Creek. We'll include Plum Creek results after the transaction closes. I'll begin my comments",742,"Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the first quarter is summarized on Chart 12. Now this outlook does not incorporate the merger with Plum Creek. We'll include Plum Creek results after the transaction closes. I'll begin my comments with Timberlands. In the West, export demand from Japan is expected to remain strong and we anticipate a slight improvement in pricing. The strength of the U.S. dollar continues to dampen significant price increases. Sales volumes to Japan are expected to increase more than 5% in the quarter. Our volumes and realizations for log sales to China are anticipated to increase modestly. 
We anticipate a slight increase in Western domestic sales realizations as lumber prices are expected to improve later in the quarter. Fee harvest in the West is expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter. In the South, sales realizations are expected to decrease slightly due to mix. Sales volumes will be lower as wet weather contributes to the typical seasonal decline in fee harvest. Earnings from nonstrategic land sales are anticipated to be roughly $10 million lower than the fourth quarter. Overall, we expect earnings in our Timberlands segment to be comparable to the fourth quarter. 
In Wood Products. Lumber average sales realizations are anticipated to increase in the first quarter compared to the fourth, although prices had not improved thus far. Realizations for our other product lines as well as overall sales volumes are expected to be roughly comparable to last quarter. We expect less downtime from planned maintenance and capital projects compared to the fourth quarter and as a result, average unit manufacturing costs should decrease. Channel inventories remain low, with customers generally purchasing for immediate needs. As we enter the spring building season, we do expect to see business improve. We anticipate that overall earnings in our Wood Products segment will be higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth, and slightly higher than the first quarter of 2015. 
In Cellulose Fibers, global softwood pulp inventories as of the end of the fourth quarter were at 29 days, down slightly from the 30 days at the end of the third quarter. This is at the high end of balanced inventory level. We expect that average sales realizations and volumes for our pulp products will weaken during the first quarter due to continued currency headwinds and the normal effect of the Chinese New Year. 
Our liquid packaging operation will begin its planned maintenance outage this quarter and as a result, we expect maintenance expense for this segment will increase significantly compared to the fourth quarter, which had fewer overall maintenance days. We anticipate that earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment will be significantly lower than the fourth quarter of 2015 and roughly comparable to the first quarter of last year. 
Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments, and I'll refer to Chart 11 for this discussion. Cash from operations totaled $339 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $57 million from the third quarter. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $174 million, bringing our total expenditures for the full year to $483 million, well within our earlier guidance of $500 million. 
Looking ahead to 2016, we expect total expenditures for the full year to be down slightly from 2015, subject to the outcome of the strategic review for Cellulose Fibers and the transaction with Plum Creek. At the end of the quarter, we had cash of just over $1 billion and we do not have any scheduled debt maturities in 2016. Now I'd like to update you on the status of our retirement benefit plans. 
The year-end 2015 funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and post-employment retirement plans improved by approximately $400 million compared to year-end 2014. This improvement was primarily the result of the increase in discount rates. We did not make any cash contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan in 2015, and we don't anticipate any cash contributions for that plan this year. Cash paid for all other pension and other post-employment retirement plans in 2015 was approximately $80 million. We expect spending in 2016 to be approximately $60 million. 
Chart 14 in the appendix details the pension expense by business for 2015. Total expense in 2015 was approximately $42 million and in 2016, we expect the total amount will be income of approximately $5 million. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to Doyle."
107633,321351869,928166,"Weyerhaeuser Co., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2016",2016-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thank you, Patty. I'd now like to switch gears to provide an update on our operational excellence efforts. Throughout the year, each of our businesses remain relentlessly focused on achieving their respective operational excellence targets. Achieving thes",1378,"Thank you, Patty. I'd now like to switch gears to provide an update on our operational excellence efforts. Throughout the year, each of our businesses remain relentlessly focused on achieving their respective operational excellence targets. Achieving these targets is not easy. They are designed to stretch a business to deliver a step change in relative performance, and that's exactly what is happening through a lot of really good work by our employees. 
Chart 13 highlights our OpEx accomplishments for 2015 and our annual targets for 2016. The Timberlands business delivered $39 million of operational excellence improvement in 2015, exceeding its target of $20 million to $30 million. These results were primarily, driven by cost efficiency in 3 key areas. First, harvest and haul cost. We are continuing the implementation of centralized dispatch systems to improve the efficiency of logging and trucking contractors and replacing costly cable logging with steep slope technologies. 
Second, spending on forest roads. We're adjusting the volume of rock we lay during road construction and the level of road maintenance to match expected vehicle travel patterns and local weather conditions. Finally, silvicultural costs. Data we have collected on tree stand growth patterns enable us to custom tailor silviculture prescriptions to apply pruning and hardwood control only to acres where those activity generate an optimal financial return. 
With total OpEx improvements of $64 million since 2013, the Timberlands business has achieved the $50 million to $70 million improvement goal we established 2 years ago. However, we are not done. For 2016, we are targeting an additional $20 million to $30 million of OpEx improvements from our existing Timberlands holdings. This does not include the benefit we will get from applying our OpEx efforts to over 6 million acres of Plum Creek lands. 
The lumber business achieved $21 million of improvements in 2015, meeting its target of $20 million to $25 million. Primary drivers include improvements in reliability and process efficiency, and rigorous cost management as we continue to drive down our cost net of logs. Each mill is focused on maintaining consistent throughput and improving uptime by resolving process and equipment issues that create bottlenecks or stop production. 
Capital expenditures for the lumber business increased in 2015 as we invested in low risk, high-return projects to further improve the cost structure of our mills. These projects include autograders and continuous dry kilns. We will capture the full benefits from several of these investments in 2016. With cumulative improvements of over $40 million since 2013, the lumber business is nearing halfway on its journey to $100 million of controllable manufacturing cost reductions. 
For 2016, the business is targeting OpEx improvements of $15 million to $20 million. 
Oriented strand board delivered $24 million of OpEx improvement in 2015, exceeding its target of $10 million to $15 million. Results were driven by improving reliability as our mills focus on eliminating sources of downtime and recovering efficiently from outage events. Lowering wax and resin costs as we optimize recipes for multiple products and increasing our mix of higher-margin products such as flooring. 
With cumulative improvements of $34 million, the OSB business is more than halfway to its $60 million goal. The business is targeting another $15 million to $20 million of OpEx improvements in 2016. 
For engineered wood products and distribution, we set specific bottom line EBITDA improvement targets for 2015 as those businesses remain focused on turnaround performance. Engineered wood products improved full year EBITDA by $35 million compared with 2014, significantly exceeding its $15 million to $20 million target. 
Each mill maintained a rigorous focus on reducing unit manufacturing costs for all products. For example, maintenance teams share best practices across the mill system, increasing reliability and reducing costs. 
Engineered wood products has made substantial improvements since 2013. Over the past 2 years, this business has increased annual EBITDA by almost $70 million, proving that it has ability to perform. Our focus now is continuing to improve relative performance versus the competition. The 2016 goal for this business will not be a bottom line EBITDA target, but an OpEx improvement target of $10 million to $15 million. 
Distribution improved full-year EBITDA by $8 million in 2015. The business fell short of its $20 million to $30 million improvement target as it was unable to overcome twin effects of severe winter weather early in the year and lower-than-expected demand in the first half of 2015. 2015 OpEx improvements were largely attributable to improved product margin and reductions in headcount, warehouse and delivery expenses. 
Improvements made to the distribution cost structure during 2015 have created a stronger foundation for better operating performance next year. In 2016, the Distribution business is targeting bottom line EBITDA improvement of $15 million to $20 million. 
Cellulose Fibers. Cellulose fibers delivered operational excellence improvement of $47 million, significantly exceeding its $30 million to $35 million targets. Improvements were primarily attributable to lower energy cost driven by a new turbine generator at our Flint River mill and a boiler conversion at Columbus and reduced usage of key chemicals as several mills adjusted processes tied to their digesters and bleach plants. 
During 2016, Cellulose Fibers is targeting an improvement of $40 million to $50 million. With OpEx improvements of $75 million to date, this would enable the business to exceed the $100 million goal established in 2013. 
I'll also mention the reduction in our SG&A. Part of our commitment to operational excellence is having the right cost structure across our company. Two years ago, we committed to reduce SG&A by $75 million and achieved that run rate by the end of 2014. Last year, we told you we had delivered on that commitment, and you can see our performance in this year's results. Compared with 2013, we have reduced our SG&A by over $100 million. Success in achieving our OpEx targets was a critical component of Weyerhaeuser's 2015 financial performance, enabling us to offset pricing headwinds in many of our markets. 
In Timberlands, weaker year-over-year pricing for Western logs created a headwind of over $100 million. By exceeding its operational excellence target, the Timberlands business was able to overcome nearly half of that deficit. Lower year-over-year realizations of 11% for lumber and 9% for OSB, created a headwind of over $250 million for Wood Products earnings. However, the segment captured nearly $100 million of operational excellence improvements, significantly mitigating the effect of these lower prices, and earnings for Wood Products declined less than $70 million on a year-over-year basis. 
Cellulose Fibers faced a headwind of over $100 million from declining pulp prices, higher fiber costs and the effect of the West Coast port slowdown. The business offset nearly half of this amount through its OpEx efforts. 
Looking forward to 2016, our relentless focus on operational excellence remains a key component of our commitment to improve our relative performance and drive value for shareholders. 
I will close this morning with some brief comments on our merger with Plum Creek and the strategic review of our cellulose fibers business. 
The joint proxy and registration statement associated with our announced merger with Plum Creek was declared effective by the SEC on December 28. Both ISS and Glass Lewis have recommend that shareholders vote in favor of the proposal. The shareholder vote will be held on February 12, and we anticipate closing the merger in the first quarter. Our joint integration team is making excellent progress as we define staffing needs, establish a plan for cost synergy and position the merged company for a smooth and successful day 1. 
The review of Cellulose Fibers is proceeding well, and we look forward to sharing more information with you when that review is complete. 
As we enter 2016, I'm excited about the opportunities in front of us. Although the first few weeks of the year have been characterized by market turbulence and global macroeconomic concerns, I'm encouraged by the positive trend in U.S. housing and the optimistic tone we are hearing from our customers. 
Our portfolio changes and operational improvements are positioning Weyerhaeuser to drive long-term value for shareholders. We will remain relentlessly focused on operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation and I look forward to sharing our continued progress with you. And now I'd like to open up the phone for questions."

But the encouraging thing about OpEx overall, Anthony, that we've seen is it started off as a top-down effort. But as we defined winning, defined exactly what we mean by OpEx and people are incented to drive OpEx, we are having just more and more ideas bubble up in terms of the opportunities.

But as I've said in response to the earlier question, what I'm really encouraged about and why we're confident we're going to be able to continue to deliver on OpEx target is because it has become part of who we are. It is being done much more from a bottoms-up approach, George. So whereas, previously, it was things that were identified at the top and kind of driven down. And now more and more of these ideas -- to your point, it's a larger funnel -- more and more of our ideas are coming from our employee base, which they are the one's out there doing the hard work every day. When they understand what the opportunities are, recognize that they are empowered to go do something in those and then incented to do that, it's amazing what can happen. So you're right, it is a different approach. But very encouraged by the progress and most importantly, it's becoming part of our culture. And that's why we're -- year after year, we believe we're going to be able to continue to drive operational excellence as we move forward. 
In terms of distribution. George, it's been -- while we have made -- and I think it's important to highlight we have made improvement there. And if you look at it, we've made a $40-million-plus improvement over the last few years in bottom line Distribution EBITDA. But we're still not where we need to be, to your point. This year, I hate using weather, but weather did have an impact in the first half of the year, slower-than-expected demand and then the fact that we had kind of eroding commodity prices throughout the year limited the ability to leverage margin improvements. As we said, we made some significant changes to the cost structure by closing 4 sites to reduce the print -- footprint and the cost structure and really focus on our growth markets going forward. And I'll tell you, with those changes, we are confident that we're going to be able to continue to improve our Distribution business. But still a lot of work to do there and still have work to do, frankly, to prove that we deserve to be in this business long term. But good progress and again, with the structural changes we made in the fourth quarter, optimistic about that business going forward."

In terms of pricing, as Patty outlined, we anticipate prices will, in fact, be higher in lumber in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter, however, that's still in front of us. If you look at it currently, quarter-to-date prices for lumber are down approximately $7 versus the fourth quarter average. Encouragingly, prices were up $4, $5 this week, so we'll see where it plays out. But normally, you start to see an inflection point in lumber prices mid to late-February as the spring building season kicks in. And we would hope to see the same type of price inflection -- or improvement in OSB as we move through the quarter as well. And that's what's baked into -- generally baked into our guidance for the first quarter."

This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter net earnings of $70 million or $0.11 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $150 million or $0.24 per diluted share. Our first quarter earnings included results from Plum Creek for the period February 19 through March 31.
Special items for the first quarter included integration and restructuring charges related to the Plum Creek merger and the strategic review of our Cellulose Fibers business, partially offset by gain on the sale of our corporate campus. 
I'm extremely proud of the work of our employees in the quarter as we closed the Plum Creek merger, delivered solid operating performance across each of our businesses and took significant steps towards achieving the commitments that will drive long-term value for shareholders of our merged company including, we have specific plans in place to capture $100 million of hard dollar cost synergies, and I am highly confident that we will meet or exceed this run rate target by the end of year 1. 
As part of that, we made and announced nearly all our personnel decisions in the 41 days between merger close and the end of the first quarter. We raised $2.5 billion of attractively-priced term loan financing and began to aggressively execute against our $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization.  
At the end of the first quarter, we had repurchased approximately $860 million or 35% of our authorization at an average price of $27.49 per share. And we closed the sale of our corporate campus for $70 million in cash with our move to Seattle on track and scheduled for September. 
We have continued to execute against our goals as the second quarter has progressed. On April 1, we closed the Twin Creeks transaction announced by Plum Creek in September 2015, receiving $440 million in cash in a transaction that value 260,000 acres of Plum Creek Southern Timberlands at $2,150 per acre. 
As of the end of April, our share repurchase program was 50% complete, with cumulative repurchases of $1.25 billion or nearly 44 million shares at an average price of $28.62. And finally, earlier this week, we announced the conclusion of a portion of our Cellulose Fibers business strategic review with the sale of our pulp mills to International Paper for $2.2 billion.
I will turn now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin with some brief comments about the housing market. The U.S. housing market continues to grow at a moderate pace, supported by continuing job growth and historically low interest rates. As of March, total housing starts had improved 14% year-to-date compared with 2015. 
Single-family starts have grown even more and are up 23% year-to-date. Although multifamily activity, which is typically more volatile, has driven some choppiness in monthly indicators, first quarter housing activity has been consistent with our expectations and those of our customers. Despite some headwinds in labor constraints, builder sentiment remains extremely strong. We continue to plan for just over 1.2 million housing starts in 2016.
Let me now turn to our business segments. Following the merger, we realigned our management structure and our business segments to incorporate the increased scale of our Timberlands operations as well as the addition of Plum Creek's Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources expertise. For the first quarter, Weyerhaeuser is reporting 4 business segments: Timberlands; Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources; Wood Products; and Cellulose Fibers. To make it easier to compare current and historical results, business segment results for prior periods have been adjusted to reflect our new segment definitions. 
We have also revised our definition of adjusted EBITDA to add back the noncash basis of Real Estate sold. With this change, EBITDA for the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment will better reflect the cash generated by those activities. Going forward, we will focus on adjusted EBITDA for all our businesses.
I will now begin the discussion with Timberlands, Charts 3 to 5. In Timberlands, we are reporting EBITDA by 3 primary geographies: Western Timberlands includes Washington and Oregon; Southern Timberlands includes all southern states; and Northern Timberlands includes operations in Montana, the Lake states, New England and West Virginia. Results from Canada and Uruguay are reported in Other Timberlands. Recreational lease activities continues to be reported within the Timberlands segment and volumes and realizations for our Timberlands business are now reported in tons.
Timberlands contributed $129 million to first quarter earnings, an improvement of $22 million compared with the fourth quarter. These results included higher noncash depletion and amortization costs due to the step-up in timberland bases associated with acquisition accounting and the alignment of our accounting policies. Adjusted EBITDA for Timberlands increased by $39 million to $199 million. Approximately 12% of Timberlands' first quarter EBITDA is attributable to the addition of Plum Creek operations.
Western Timberlands contributed $118 million to first quarter EBITDA, an improvement of $15 million compared with the fourth quarter. Western fee harvest volumes increased due to slightly higher harvest for legacy Weyerhaeuser land and a partial quarter of Plum Creek harvest. Average realizations for Western logs declined slightly due to a shift in mix from export to domestic markets. 
Average realizations for export logs improved, and export sales volumes were comparable to the fourth quarter. Sales volume to Japan increased and pricing improved modestly due to continued strong demand. Japanese wooden housing starts have improved slightly compared with 2015 as mortgage rates remain low, and we see some pull forward in advance of a scheduled increase in the consumption tax next year. 
Volumes to China declined seasonally compared with our fourth quarter as construction activity during fell the Lunar New Year period. Average realizations improved slightly. Log inventory to Chinese ports rose during the first quarter but remained within a normal range for the season and well below the elevated levels experienced during the first quarter of 2015. With inventories in line and slightly improved construction activity, our customers are optimistic regarding current market conditions. In Western domestic markets, log supply and demand remains balanced and realizations improved slightly.
Southern Timberlands contributed $77 million to first quarter EBITDA, $21 million more than the fourth quarter. This improvement was attributable to a partial quarter of Plum Creek operations. A partial quarter of harvest from Plum Creek's 3.4 million Southern acres increased Southern harvest by 40% and more than offset a small seasonal decline in harvest from legacy Weyerhaeuser land. 
Realizations for Southern logs declined slightly, primarily due to mix. Silviculture cost and forestry costs declined as activity was delayed due to wet weather. A partial quarter results from Plum Creek's Northern Timberlands contributed $3 million to first quarter EBITDA.
Operational excellence initiatives continued to contribute to Timberlands' results. On our fourth quarter earnings call, we set a target of $20 million to $30 million of OpEx improvements from legacy Weyerhaeuser holdings. Following the merger, we have now increased the Timberlands 2016 OpEx target to $30 million to $50 million to incorporate $10 million to $20 million of operational synergies we expect to achieve from the merger this year. 
The multiyear OpEx targets for Timberlands has also increased to $200 million, including the $64 million achieved in 2014 and '15 to incorporate operational synergy opportunity from the merger. Timberlands has begun an internal benchmarking exercise to identify best practices in silviculture, logging and transportation and leverage those learnings across the entire Timberlands portfolio. Although this work is still in the early stages, I'm pleased by the level of energy and teamwork in identifying opportunities across the business.
Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, Charts 6 and 7. The Real Estate and ENR segment includes sales of HBU and noncore timberland property as well as please and royalty income from minerals, aggregates and oil and gas. These activities were formerly reported within Weyerhaeuser's Timberlands segment. 
Real Estate and ENR contributed $15 million to first quarter earnings, $12 million lower than the fourth quarter. However, EBITDA increased by $1 million to $34 million as lower EBITDA from legacy Weyerhaeuser operations was more than offset by a partial quarter of Plum Creek results. 
Total acreage sold increased in the first quarter compared with the fourth due to a conservation sale of over 8,000 acres of main timberland. Although a partial quarter of Plum Creek's operations contributed significantly to the segment's EBITDA, the Plum Creek contribution to earnings was minimal because Plum Creek land was marked up to fair value as part of the merger purchase price allocation. 
Operational excellence for the Real Estate and ENR business will be based on the premium to timberland values captured from the sale of HBU properties. The first step in defining the size of this opportunity is applying Plum Creek asset value optimization or AVO process across Weyerhaeuser's 6.9 million acres of legacy timberlands. This process is underway and we anticipate it will be substantially complete in about 1 year.
Wood Products, Charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $87 million to first quarter earnings compared with earnings before special items of $48 million in the fourth quarter. Results fromPlum Creek to lumber mills are recorded as part of the lumber business, and results for Plum Creek's plywood and medium density fiber board or MBF facilities are reported with Engineered Wood Products. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the Wood Products segment increased to $117 million, primarily due to improved unit manufacturing costs and seasonally higher sales volume. Approximately 4% of Wood Products' first quarter EBITDA is attributable to the addition of Plum Creek operations. 
In lumber, EBITDA improved $18 million compared with fourth quarter. Average realizations improved 1% and sales volumes increased 3%. Unit manufacturing costs declined due to higher operating rate and strong operating performance. Fourth quarter included downtime for installation of capital projects. 
In OSB, EBITDA increased to $31 million, $6 million higher than the fourth quarter and $27 million higher than the first quarter of last year. Unit manufacturing costs improved due to strong operating performance and reduced downtime for plant maintenance. This more than offset a 3% decrease in average sales realizations. Sales volumes increased 5%. 
Engineered Wood Products EBITDA more than doubled to $31 million compared with $14 million in the fourth quarter. Operating rate and unit manufacturing costs improved due to higher demand, strong operating performance and reduced downtime for maintenance and capital projects. Sales volumes increased seasonally and average realizations declined slightly due to mix.
EBITDA for the Distribution business improved to $4 million, $2 million more than the fourth quarter and $7 million more than the first quarter of 2015. This business benefited from improved margins and lower operating costs. Operational excellence continues to contribute to Wood Products results as all 4 businesses gained leverage from ongoing improvements in controllable costs. The businesses are collectively targeting $55 million to $75 million of operational excellence improvements in 2016. Each business remains relentlessly focused on its initiatives and is on track to achieve its target.
Cellulose Fibers, Charts 10 and 11. Cellulose Fibers contributed $28 million to first quarter earnings compared with earnings before special items of $64 million in the fourth quarter. Average sales realizations for pulp and liquid packaging declined as prices remained under pressure. Sales volumes declined only slightly as demand for our pulp remained strong despite the seasonally weak Lunar New Year period. Maintenance expense increased due to additional scheduled maintenance outage days. First quarter included 16 days of scheduled maintenance outages compared with 8 days in the fourth quarter.
As I noted earlier, we have announced the sale of our pulp mills to International Paper in a $2.2 billion cash transaction. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory review, and we expect it to close in the fourth quarter. This transaction delivers compelling value for our shareholders, and we expect to use a substantial portion of the $1.6 billion after-tax proceeds for repayment of the 18-month term loan raised during the first quarter.
I want to thank the employees of our Cellulose Fibers business for their dedication and professionalism as they have continued to operate safely and deliver an exceptional customer experience through this strategic review process. As noted in Monday's press release, the strategic review of our liquid packaging business and newsprint and publication venture is ongoing, and we look forward to sharing more information with you when that review is complete.
I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook."

The overall outlook for the second quarter is summarized on Chart 16 of the earnings slides. Please note that the second quarter will include a full quarter of Plum Creek operations.
Starting with Timberlands. We expect second quarter EBITDA to come in approximately 10% higher than first quarter, with second quarter earnings comparable to the first quarter. It is important to note that as part of the purchase price allocation, the Plum Creek Timberland basis was stepped up to reflect fair value. As a result, new depletion rates were established for the combined Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek Timberlands. 
In addition to changes in the depletion rate, the accounting policies for amortization of road and other related expenses have been aligned. These changes will result in total amortization and depletion expense of approximately $90 million for the second quarter.
In our Western Timberlands operations, log export volume is expected to improve in the second quarter as volumes to China increased following the seasonally low Lunar New Year period. Japanese export volumes were elevated in the first quarter and are expected to return to more normal seasonal levels in the second quarter. We anticipate stable pricing for our Japanese and Chinese export logs, with a slight decline in overall export price realizations due to the higher proportion of Chinese volume. 
Domestic log volumes will increase, with the addition of the Plum Creek activity but prices remain stable quarter-over-quarter. Costs will be higher due to shifting harvest activity to higher elevation, which is typical during the spring season. 
In the South, harvest volumes will increase approximately 40% as we benefit from the full quarter of Plum Creek operations. We expect average log prices will decrease modestly as the harvest mix will include a higher proportion of pulpwood logs. In addition, forestry expenses will be higher due to increased seasonal spending.
In the North, harvest volumes will be above first quarter levels with the inclusion of a full quarter of Plum Creek operations. The second quarter typically has the lowest harvest levels of the year because the spring weather conditions with the mud season, which limits access to harvest sites in the northern operating region. Average sales realizations will be comparable to first quarter levels. Note that prior to the merger, Plum Creek included their Oregon and Washington activity in their Northern segment. 
Moving on to our full year timber harvest outlook. We expect our combined 2016 fee harvest will be 40 million to 42 million tons. The 2016 fee harvest is comparable to the combined Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek 2015 harvest levels after adding Plum Creek's harvest for the January 1 through February 19 premerger period. 
Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources second quarter EBITDA and earnings are expected to be similar to the first quarter. Higher and better use markets remain active in the southern states, and we expect similar transaction activity in second quarter as compared to the first quarter. 
In the second half of the year, we expect transaction counts to increase as more higher and better use properties are identified through our process and brought to market. For the remainder of the year, we estimate the sales mix will be evenly split between Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek lands, with an average basis of 50%. 
For Wood Products, inventories throughout the supply chain remain relatively low as buyers continue to meet their purchasing needs on a just-in-time basis. Prices for lumber have improved in the second half for the first quarter, and that trend continued into the second quarter. Average April sales realizations were $30 higher than the first quarter average. 
OSB prices have also rallied, with average April sales realizations approximately $15 higher than the first quarter averages. We anticipate prices will continue to strengthen during the second quarter as building activity increases. Sales volume for the engineered wood products are expected to be seasonally higher in the second quarter, and we expect continued improvement in this business. Operating rates remain strong across all the Wood Products business lines.
We expect overall second quarter EBITDA and earnings for the Wood Products segment will be significantly higher than the first quarter. In fact, EBITDA for this segment has not been this strong since the second quarter of 2013. This is primarily a result of our improved operational performance and competitive cost structure.
Moving to Cellulose Fibers. EBITDA and earnings in Cellulose Fibers business are expected to increase during the second quarter with higher average sales realizations across our product lines. Volumes are expected to be similar to first quarter levels. We anticipate maintenance spending to be similar to first quarter. Other cost of sales are expected to decrease slightly due to lower fiber and energy costs. 
For our key financial items, cash from operations during the first quarter was $47 million. The first quarter is usually our lowest operating cash flow quarter due to seasonally lower earnings, inventory buildup and semiannual interest payments. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $415 million. Going forward, we anticipate that our normalized cash balance will be in the range of $200 million to $400 million, which we feel is an appropriate level for the capital structure at this time. 
We completed our planned post-transaction financing in February and March by entering into 2 18-month term loans at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 105 basis points or approximately 1.5%. The loans have a total capacity of $2.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had drawn down $1.1 billion. Long-term debt, not including the term loan balance of $1.1 billion, was $6.7 billion at the end of the quarter. We have no debt maturities in 2016, and we intend to pay down the new term loans primarily with proceeds from asset sales. This will allow us to move toward our target debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.5x. Interest expense for the first quarter reflects a partial quarter of interest for both the Plum Creek legacy debt and the new term loans. Looking forward, our 2016 interest expense will be approximately $450 million for the year.
Moving on to capital expenditures. First quarter capital expenditures totaled $73 million. Our capital spending is seasonal and tends to be lowest in the first quarter before ramping up through the rest of the year. We continue to expect 2016 CapEx will be approximately $450 million, excluding Cellulose Fibers. This includes minimal spending for Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources, where the focus is on entitlement and royalty contracts and not capital-intensive development. 
Our 2016 total company tax rate will be dependent upon the mix of REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary income. We are currently estimating our full year total company tax rate to be approximately 18% to 20%. Due to prior year overpayment, we do not anticipate making a cash payment in 2016.
These first quarter estimates do not take into account the impact of the divestiture of the pulp business, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Let me direct your attention to Chart 12, which details the major components of our unallocated items. Income before special items improved to $19 million in the first quarter compared with $1 million of expense in fourth quarter of 2015. Improvement was driven primarily by foreign exchange as the Canadian dollar strengthened 7% against the U.S. dollar during the quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions."

Our merged corporate area team is operating together out of our building in Federal Way, and we have begun the consolidation of regional offices. 
Each of our senior management team members has spent several weeks on the road meeting with employees and reinforcing our vision and the core values, relentless focus and key behaviors that will define our success as a merged company. 
I look forward to building on that strong foundation as we work together to be the world's premier timber, land and forest products company. We are relentlessly focused on improving performance through operational excellence and capturing costs and operational synergies to leverage the full benefit of an improving U.S. housing market and drive long-term value for our shareholders.

This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter net earnings of $70 million or $0.11 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $150 million or $0.24 per diluted share. Our first quarter earnings included results from Plum Creek for the period February 19 through March 31.
Special items for the first quarter included integration and restructuring charges related to the Plum Creek merger and the strategic review of our Cellulose Fibers business, partially offset by gain on the sale of our corporate campus. 
I'm extremely proud of the work of our employees in the quarter as we closed the Plum Creek merger, delivered solid operating performance across each of our businesses and took significant steps toward achieving the commitments that will drive long-term value for shareholders of our merged company, including -- we have specific plans in place to capture $100 million of hard dollar cost synergies, and I am highly confident that we will meet or exceed this run rate target by the end of year 1. 
As part of that, we made and announced nearly all our personnel decisions in the 41 days between merger close and the end of the first quarter. We raised $2.5 billion of attractively priced term loan financing and began to aggressively execute against our $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization. At the end of the first quarter, we had repurchased approximately $860 million or 35% of our authorization at an average price of $27.49 per share. And we closed the sale of our corporate campus for $70 million in cash, with our move to Seattle on track and scheduled for September. 
We have continued to execute against our goals as the second quarter has progressed. On April 1, we closed the Twin Creeks transaction announced by Plum Creek in September 2015, receiving $440 million in cash in a transaction that value 260,000 acres of Plum Creek Southern Timberlands at $2,150 per acre. 
As of the end of April, our share repurchase program was 50% complete, with cumulative repurchases of $1.25 billion or nearly 44 million shares at an average price of $28.62. 
And finally, earlier this week, we announced the conclusion of a portion of our Cellulose Fibers business strategic review with the sale of our pulp mills to International Paper for $2.2 billion.
I will turn now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin with some brief comments about the housing market. The U.S. housing market continues to grow at a moderate pace, supported by continuing job growth and historically low interest rates. As of March, total housing starts have improved 14% year-to-date compared with 2015. 
Single-family starts have grown even more and are up 23% year-to-date. Although multifamily activity, which is typically more volatile, has driven some choppiness in monthly indicators, first quarter housing activity has been consistent with our expectations and those of our customers. Despite some headwinds in labor constraints, builder sentiment remains extremely strong. We continue to plan for just over 1.2 million housing starts in 2016.
Let me now turn to our business segments. Following the merger, we realigned our management structure and our business segments to incorporate the increased scale of our Timberlands operations as well as the addition of Plum Creek's real estate, energy and natural resources expertise. For the first quarter, Weyerhaeuser is reporting 4 business segments: Timberlands; Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources; Wood Products; and Cellulose Fibers. To make it easier to compare current and historical results, business segment results for prior periods have been adjusted to reflect our new segment definitions. 
We have also revised our definition of adjusted EBITDA to add back the noncash basis of real estate sold. With this change, EBITDA for the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resource segment will better reflect the cash generated by those activities. Going forward, we will focus on adjusted EBITDA for all our businesses.
I will now begin the discussion on Timberlands, Charts 3 to 5. In Timberlands, we are reporting EBITDA by 3 primary geographies: Western Timberlands includes Washington and Oregon; Southern Timberlands includes all southern states; and Northern Timberlands includes operations in Montana, the Lake States, New England and West Virginia. Results from Canada and Uruguay are reported in Other Timberlands. Recreational lease activities continues to be reported within the Timberlands segment, and volumes and realizations for our Timberlands business are now reported in tons.
Timberlands contributed $129 million to first quarter earnings, an improvement of $22 million compared with the fourth quarter. These results included higher noncash depletion and amortization costs due to the step-up in timberland bases associated with acquisition accounting and the alignment of our accounting policies. Adjusted EBITDA for Timberlands increased by $39 million to $199 million. Approximately 12% of Timberlands' first quarter EBITDA is attributable to the addition of Plum Creek operations.
Western Timberlands contributed $118 million to first quarter EBITDA, an improvement of $15 million compared with the fourth quarter. Western fee harvest volumes increased due to slightly higher harvest for legacy Weyerhaeuser land and a partial quarter of Plum Creek harvest. Average realizations for Western logs declined slightly due to a shift in mix from export to domestic markets. 
Average realizations for export logs improved, and export sales volumes were comparable to the fourth quarter. Sales volume to Japan increased, and pricing improved modestly due to continued strong demand. Japanese wooden housing starts have improved slightly compared with 2015 as mortgage rates remain low, and we see some pull forward in advance of a scheduled increase in the consumption tax next year. 
Volumes to China declined seasonally compared with the fourth quarter as construction activity paused during the Lunar New Year period. Average realizations improved slightly. Log inventory to Chinese ports rose during the first quarter but remained within a normal range for the season and well below the elevated levels experienced during the first quarter of 2015. With inventories in line and slightly improved construction activity, our customers are optimistic regarding current market conditions. In Western domestic markets, log supply and demand remained balanced and realizations improved slightly.
Southern Timberlands contributed $77 million to first quarter EBITDA, $21 million more than the fourth quarter. This improvement was attributable to a partial quarter of Plum Creek operations. A partial quarter of harvest from Plum Creek's 3.4 million Southern acres increased Southern harvest by 40% and more than offset a small seasonal decline in harvest from legacy Weyerhaeuser land. 
Realizations for Southern logs declined slightly primarily due to mix. Silviculture cost and forestry cost declined as activity was delayed due to wet weather. A partial quarter results from Plum Creek's Northern Timberlands contributed $3 million to first quarter EBITDA.
Operational excellence initiatives continue to contribute to Timberlands' results. On our fourth quarter earnings call, we set a target of $20 million to $30 million of OpEx improvements from legacy Weyerhaeuser holdings. Following the merger, we have now increased the Timberlands 2016 OpEx target to $30 million to $50 million to incorporate $10 million to $20 million of operational synergies we expect to achieve from the merger this year. 
The multiyear OpEx target for Timberlands has also increased to $200 million, including the $64 million achieved in 2014 and '15 to incorporate operational synergy opportunity from the merger. Timberlands has begun an internal benchmarking exercise to identify best practices in silviculture, logging and transportation and leverage those learnings across the entire Timberlands portfolio. Although this work is still in the early stages, I'm pleased by the level of energy and teamwork in identifying opportunities across the business.
Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, Charts 6 and 7. The Real Estate and ENR segment includes sales of HBU and non-core timberland property as well as lease and royalty income from minerals, aggregates and oil and gas. These activities were formerly reported within Weyerhaeuser's Timberlands segment. 
Real Estate and ENR contributed $15 million to first quarter earnings, $12 million lower than the fourth quarter. However, EBITDA increased by $1 million to $34 million as lower EBITDA from legacy Weyerhaeuser operations was more than offset by a partial quarter of Plum Creek results. 
Total acreage sold increased in the first quarter compared with the fourth due to a conservation sale of over 8,000 acres of main timberland. Although a partial quarter of Plum Creek's operations contributed significantly to the segment's EBITDA, the Plum Creek contribution to earnings was minimal because Plum Creek land was marked up to fair value as part of the merger purchase price allocation. 
Operational excellence for the Real Estate and ENR business will be based on the premium to timberland values captured from the sale of HBU properties. The first step in defining the size of this opportunity is applying Plum Creek asset value optimization or AVO process across Weyerhaeuser's 6.9 million acres of legacy Timberlands. This process is underway, and we anticipate it will be substantially complete in about 1 year.
Wood Products, Charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $87 million to first quarter earnings compared with earnings before special items of $48 million in the fourth quarter. Results for Plum Creek lumber mills are recorded as part of the lumber business, and results for Plum Creek's plywood and medium-density fiber board or MBF facilities are reported with engineered wood products. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the Wood Products segment increased to $117 million primarily due to improved unit manufacturing costs and seasonally higher sales volume. Approximately 4% of Wood Products' first quarter EBITDA is attributable to the addition of Plum Creek operations. 
In lumber, EBITDA improved $18 million compared with fourth quarter. Average realizations improved 1%, and sales volumes increased 3%. Unit manufacturing costs declined due to higher operating rates and strong operating performance. Fourth quarter included downtime for installation of capital projects. 
In OSB, EBITDA increased to $31 million, $6 million higher than the fourth quarter and $27 million higher than the first quarter of last year. Unit manufacturing costs improved due to strong operating performance and reduced downtime for planned maintenance. This more than offset a 3% decrease in average sales realizations. Sales volumes increased 5%. 
Engineered wood products EBITDA more than doubled to $31 million compared with $14 million in the fourth quarter. Operating rates and unit manufacturing costs improved due to higher demand, strong operating performance and reduced downtime for maintenance and capital projects. Sales volumes increased seasonally, and average realizations declined slightly due to mix.
EBITDA for the Distribution business improved to $4 million, $2 million more than the fourth quarter and $7 million more than the first quarter of 2015. This business benefited from improved margins and lower operating cost. 
Operational excellence continues to contribute to Wood Products results as all 4 businesses gain leverage from ongoing improvements in controllable cost. The businesses are collectively targeting $55 million to $75 million of operational excellence improvements in 2016. Each business remains relentlessly focused on its initiatives and is on track to achieve its target.
Cellulose Fibers, Charts 10 and 11. Cellulose Fibers contributed $28 million to first quarter earnings compared with earnings before special items of $64 million in the fourth quarter. Average sales realizations for pulp and liquid packaging declined as prices remained under pressure. Sales volumes declined only slightly as demand for our pulp remained strong despite the seasonally weak Lunar New Year period. Maintenance expense increased due to additional scheduled maintenance outage days. First quarter included 16 days of scheduled maintenance outages compared with 8 days in the fourth quarter.
As I noted earlier, we have announced the sale of our pulp mills to International Paper in a $2.2 billion cash transaction. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory review, and we expect it to close in the fourth quarter. This transaction delivers compelling value for our shareholders, and we expect to use a substantial portion of the $1.6 billion after-tax proceeds for repayment of the 18-month term loan raised during the first quarter.
I want to thank the employees of our Cellulose Fiber business for their dedication and professionalism as they have continued to operate safely and deliver an exceptional customer experience through the strategic review process. As noted in Monday's press release, the strategic review of our liquid packaging business and newsprint and publication venture is ongoing, and we look forward to sharing more information with you when that review is complete.
I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook."
107633,330160927,975815,"Weyerhaeuser Co., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 06, 2016",2016-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The overall outlook for the second quarter is summarized on Chart 16 of the earnings slides. Please note that the second quarter will include a full quarter of Plum Creek operations.Starting with Timberlands. We expec",1250,"Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The overall outlook for the second quarter is summarized on Chart 16 of the earnings slides. Please note that the second quarter will include a full quarter of Plum Creek operations.
Starting with Timberlands. We expect second quarter EBITDA to come in approximately 10% higher than first quarter, with second quarter earnings comparable to the first quarter. It is important to note that as part of the purchase price allocation, the Plum Creek timberland basis was stepped up to reflect fair value. As a result, new depletion rates were established for the combined Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek Timberlands. 
In addition to changes in the depletion rate, the accounting policies for amortization of road and other related expenses have been aligned. These changes will result in total amortization and depletion expense of approximately $90 million for the second quarter.
In our Western Timberland operations, log export volume is expected to improve in the second quarter as volumes to China increase following the seasonally low Lunar New Year period. Japanese export volumes were elevated in the first quarter and are expected to return to more normal seasonal levels in the second quarter. We anticipate stable pricing for our Japanese and Chinese export logs, with a slight decline in overall export price realizations due to the higher proportion of Chinese volume. 
Domestic log volumes will increase with the addition of the Plum Creek activity, but prices remain stable quarter-over-quarter. Costs will be higher due to shifting harvest activity to higher elevation, which is typical during the spring season. 
In the South, harvest volumes will increase approximately 40% as we benefit from a full quarter of Plum Creek operations. We expect average log prices will decrease modestly as the harvest mix will include a higher proportion of pulpwood logs. In addition, forestry expenses will be higher due to increased seasonal spending.
In the North, harvest volumes will be above first quarter levels with the inclusion of a full quarter of Plum Creek operations. The second quarter typically has the lowest harvest levels of the year because of spring weather conditions or the mud season, which limits access to harvest sites in the northern operating region. Average sales realizations will be comparable to first quarter levels. Note that prior to the merger, Plum Creek included their Oregon and Washington activity in their Northern segment. 
Moving on to our full year timber harvest outlook. We expect our combined 2016 fee harvest will be 40 million to 42 million tons. The 2016 fee harvest is comparable to the combined Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek 2015 harvest levels after adding Plum Creek's harvest for the January 1 through February 19 premerger period. 
Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources second quarter EBITDA and earnings are expected to be similar to the first quarter. Higher and better use markets remain active in the southern states, and we expect similar transaction activity in second quarter as compared to the first quarter. 
In the second half of the year, we expect transaction counts to increase as more higher and better use properties are identified through our AVO process and brought to market. For the remainder of the year, we estimate the sales mix will be evenly split between Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek lands, with an average basis of 50%. 
For Wood Products, inventories throughout the supply chain remain relatively low as buyers continue to meet their purchasing needs on a just-in-time basis. Prices for lumber have improved in the second half of the first quarter, and that trend continued into the second quarter. Average April sales realizations were $30 higher than the first quarter average. 
OSB prices have also rallied, with average April sales realizations approximately $15 higher than the first quarter averages. We anticipate prices will continue to strengthen during the second quarter as building activity increases. 
Sales volume for the engineered wood products are expected to be seasonally higher in the second quarter, and we expect continued improvement in this business. Operating rates remain strong across all the Wood Products business lines.
We expect overall second quarter EBITDA and earnings for the Wood Products segment will be significantly higher than the first quarter. In fact, EBITDA for this segment has not been this strong since the second quarter of 2013. This is primarily a result of our improved operational performance and competitive cost structure.
Moving to Cellulose Fibers. EBITDA and earnings in Cellulose Fibers business are expected to increase during the second quarter with higher average sales realizations across our product lines. Volumes are expected to be similar to first quarter levels. We anticipate maintenance spending to be similar to first quarter. Other cost of sales are expected to decrease slightly due to lower fiber and energy costs. 
For our key financial items, cash from operations during the first quarter was $47 million. The first quarter is usually our lowest operating cash flow quarter due to seasonally lower earnings, inventory buildup and semiannual interest payments. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $415 million. Going forward, we anticipate that our normalized cash balance will be in the range of $200 million to $400 million, which we feel is an appropriate level for the capital structure at this time. 
We completed our planned post-transaction financing in February and March by entering into 2 18-month term loans at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 105 basis points or approximately 1.5%. The loans have a total capacity of $2.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had drawn down $1.1 billion. Long-term debt, not including the term loan balance of $1.1 billion, was $6.7 billion at the end of the quarter. We have no debt maturities in 2016, and we intend to pay down the new term loans primarily with proceeds from asset sales. This will allow us to move toward our target debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.5x. Interest expense for the first quarter reflects a partial quarter of interest for both the Plum Creek legacy debt and the new term loans. Looking forward, our 2016 interest expense will be approximately $450 million for the year.
Moving on to capital expenditures. First quarter capital expenditures totaled $73 million. Our capital spending is seasonal and tends to be lowest in the first quarter before ramping up through the rest of the year. We continue to expect 2016 CapEx will be approximately $450 million, excluding Cellulose Fibers. This includes minimal spending for Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources, where the focus is on entitlement and royalty contracts and not capital-intensive development. 
Our 2016 total company tax rate will be dependent upon the mix of REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary income. We are currently estimating our full year total company tax rate to be approximately 18% to 20%. Due to prior year overpayment, we do not anticipate making a cash payment in 2016.
These first quarter estimates do not take into account the impact of the divestiture of the pulp business, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Let me direct your attention to Chart 12, which details the major components of our unallocated items. Income before special items improved to $19 million in the first quarter compared with $1 million of expense in fourth quarter of 2015. The improvement was driven primarily by foreign exchange as the Canadian dollar strengthened 7% against the U.S. dollar during the quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions."

So that's an incremental $130 million above what we accomplished in 2014 and 2015, so an additional $130 million that we think we will be able to accomplish over the next 2 or 3 years as we put these 2 companies together and deliver bottom line operational synergies.

We think -- and a little bit of that was pulled forward for people being ready for an anticipated run-up before the consumption tax increase. In the second quarter, we think demand, because it was elevated in the first quarter, will be down a little bit in the second quarter, and price will be down -- flat to down slightly. China, encouraged by what's happening there. As you know, the inventory didn't build like they have over the last couple of years in the first quarter, so we anticipate both demand and pricing will be up in the second quarter. And then domestic, as we said, good demand, probably a little bit slightly lower prices in the second quarter.

This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter net earnings of $70 million or $0.11 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $150 million or $0.24 per diluted share. Our first quarter earnings included results from Plum Creek for the period February 19 through March 31.
Special items for the first quarter included integration and restructuring charges related to the Plum Creek merger and the strategic review of our Cellulose Fiber business, partially offset by a gain on the sale of our corporate campus. 
I'm extremely proud of the work of our employees in the quarter as we closed the Plum Creek merger, delivered solid operating performance across each of our businesses and took significant steps toward achieving the commitments that will drive long-term value for shareholders of our merged company, including -- we have specific plans in place to capture $100 million of hard dollar cost synergies, and I am highly confident that we will meet or exceed this run rate target by the end of year 1. 
As part of that, we made and announced nearly all our personnel decisions in the 41 days between merger close and the end of the first quarter. We raised $2.5 billion of attractively priced term loan financing and began to aggressively execute against our $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization. At the end of the first quarter, we had repurchased approximately $860 million or 35% of our authorization at an average price of $27.49 per share. And we closed the sale of our corporate campus for $70 million in cash, with our move to Seattle on track and scheduled for September. 
We have continued to execute against our goals as the second quarter has progressed. On April 1, we closed the Twin Creeks transaction announced by Plum Creek in September 2015, receiving $440 million in cash in a transaction that valued 260,000 acres of Plum Creek Southern Timberlands at $2,150 per acre. 
As of the end of April, our share repurchase program was 50% complete, with cumulative repurchases of $1.25 billion or nearly 44 million shares at an average price of $28.62. 
And finally, earlier this week, we announced the conclusion of a portion of our Cellulose Fibers business strategic review with the sale of our pulp mills to International Paper for $2.2 billion.
I will turn now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin with some brief comments about the housing market. The U.S. housing market continues to grow at a moderate pace, supported by continuing job growth and historically low interest rates. As of March, total housing starts had improved 14% year-to-date compared with 2015. 
Single-family starts have grown even more and are up 23% year-to-date. Although multifamily activity, which is typically more volatile, has driven some choppiness in monthly indicators, first quarter housing activity has been consistent with our expectations and those of our customers. Despite some headwinds from labor constraints, builder sentiment remains extremely strong. We continue to plan for just over 1.2 million housing starts in 2016.
Let me now turn to our business segments. Following the merger, we realigned our management structure and our business segments to incorporate the increased scale of our Timberlands operations as well as the addition of Plum Creek's real estate, energy and natural resources expertise. For the first quarter, Weyerhaeuser is reporting 4 business segments: Timberlands; Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources; Wood Products; and Cellulose Fibers. To make it easier to compare current and historical results, business segment results for prior periods have been adjusted to reflect our new segment definitions. 
We have also revised our definition of adjusted EBITDA to add back the noncash basis of real estate sold. With this change, EBITDA for the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resource segment will better reflect the cash generated by those activities. Going forward, we will focus on adjusted EBITDA for all our businesses.
I will now begin the discussion on Timberlands, Charts 3 to 5. In Timberlands, we are reporting EBITDA by 3 primary geographies: Western Timberlands includes Washington and Oregon; Southern Timberlands includes all southern states; and Northern Timberlands includes operations in Montana, the Lake States, New England and West Virginia. Results from Canada and Uruguay are reported in Other Timberlands. Recreational lease activities continues to be reported within the Timberlands segment, and volumes and realizations for our Timberlands business are now reported in tons.
Timberlands contributed $129 million to first quarter earnings, an improvement of $22 million compared with the fourth quarter. These results include higher noncash depletion and amortization costs due to the step-up in timberland bases associated with acquisition accounting and the alignment of our accounting policies. Adjusted EBITDA for Timberlands increased by $39 million to $199 million. Approximately 12% of Timberlands' first quarter EBITDA is attributable to the addition of Plum Creek operations.
Western Timberlands contributed $118 million to first quarter EBITDA, an improvement of $15 million compared with the fourth quarter. Western fee harvest volumes increased due to slightly higher harvests from legacy Weyerhaeuser land and a partial quarter of Plum Creek harvest. Average realizations for Western logs declined slightly due to a shift in mix from export to domestic markets. 
Average realizations for export logs improved, and export sales volumes were comparable to the fourth quarter. Sales volume to Japan increased, and pricing improved modestly due to continued strong demand. Japanese wooden housing starts have improved slightly compared with 2015 as mortgage rates remain low, and we see some pull forward in advance of a scheduled increase in the consumption tax next year. 
Volumes to China declined seasonally compared with the fourth quarter as construction activity paused during the Lunar New Year period. Average realizations improved slightly. Log inventory to Chinese ports rose during the first quarter but remained within a normal range for the season and well below the elevated levels experienced during the first quarter of 2015. With inventories in line and slightly improved construction activity, our customers are optimistic regarding current market conditions. In Western domestic markets, log supply and demand remained balanced and realizations improved slightly.
Southern Timberlands contributed $77 million to first quarter EBITDA, $21 million more than the fourth quarter. This improvement was attributable to a partial quarter of Plum Creek operations. A partial quarter of harvest from Plum Creek's 3.4 million Southern acres increased Southern harvest by 40% and more than offset a small seasonal decline in harvest from legacy Weyerhaeuser land. 
Realizations for Southern logs declined slightly primarily due to mix. Silviculture cost and forestry costs declined as activity was delayed due to wet weather. A partial quarter results from Plum Creek's Northern Timberlands contributed $3 million to first quarter EBITDA.
Operational excellence initiatives continue to contribute to Timberlands' results. On our fourth quarter earnings call, we set a target of $20 million to $30 million of OpEx improvements from legacy Weyerhaeuser holdings. Following the merger, we have now increased the Timberlands 2016 OpEx target to $30 million to $50 million to incorporate $10 million to $20 million of operational synergies we expect to achieve from the merger this year. 
The multiyear OpEx target for Timberlands has also increased to $200 million, including the $64 million achieved in 2014 and '15 to incorporate operational synergy opportunity from the merger. Timberlands has begun an internal benchmarking exercise to identify best practices in silviculture, logging and transportation and leverage those learnings across the entire Timberlands portfolio. Although this work is still in the early stages, I'm pleased by the level of energy and teamwork in identifying opportunities across the business.
Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, Charts 6 and 7. The Real Estate and ENR segment includes sales of HBU and non-core timberland property as well as lease and royalty income from minerals, aggregates and oil and gas. These activities were formerly reported within Weyerhaeuser's Timberlands segment. 
Real Estate and ENR contributed $15 million to first quarter earnings, $12 million lower than the fourth quarter. However, EBITDA increased by $1 million to $34 million as lower EBITDA from legacy Weyerhaeuser operations was more than offset by a partial quarter of Plum Creek results. 
Total acreage sold increased in the first quarter compared with the fourth due to a conservation sale of over 8,000 acres of main timberland. Although a partial quarter of Plum Creek's operations contributed significantly to the segment's EBITDA, the Plum Creek contribution to earnings was minimal because Plum Creek land was marked up to fair value as part of the merger purchase price allocation. 
Operational excellence for the Real Estate and ENR business will be based on the premium to timberland values captured from the sale of HBU properties. The first step in defining the size of this opportunity is applying Plum Creek asset value optimization or AVO process across Weyerhaeuser's 6.9 million acres of legacy timberlands. This process is underway, and we anticipate it will be substantially complete in about 1 year.
Wood Products, Charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $87 million to first quarter earnings compared with earnings before special items of $48 million in the fourth quarter. Results for Plum Creek lumber mills are reported as part of the lumber business, and results for Plum Creek's plywood and medium-density fiber board or MBF facilities are reported with engineered wood products. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the Wood Products segment increased to $117 million primarily due to improved unit manufacturing costs and seasonally higher sales volume. Approximately 4% of Wood Products' first quarter EBITDA is attributable to the addition of Plum Creek operations. 
In lumber, EBITDA improved $18 million compared with fourth quarter. Average realizations improved 1%, and sales volumes increased 3%. Unit manufacturing costs declined due to higher operating rates and strong operating performance. Fourth quarter included downtime for installation of capital projects. 
In OSB, EBITDA increased to $31 million, $6 million higher than the fourth quarter and $27 million higher than the first quarter of last year. Unit manufacturing costs improved due to strong operating performance and reduced downtime for planned maintenance. This more than offset a 3% decrease in average sales realizations. Sales volumes increased 5%. 
Engineered wood products EBITDA more than doubled to $31 million compared with $14 million in the fourth quarter. Operating rates and unit manufacturing costs improved due to higher demand, strong operating performance and reduced downtime for maintenance and capital projects. Sales volumes increased seasonally, and average realizations declined slightly due to mix.
EBITDA for the Distribution business improved to $4 million, $2 million more than the fourth quarter and $7 million more than the first quarter of 2015. This business benefited from improved margins and lower operating cost. 
Operational excellence continues to contribute to Wood Products results as all 4 businesses gain leverage from ongoing improvements in controllable cost. The businesses are collectively targeting $55 million to $75 million of operational excellence improvements in 2016. Each business remains relentlessly focused on its initiatives and is on track to achieve its target.
Cellulose Fibers, Charts 10 and 11. Cellulose Fibers contributed $28 million to first quarter earnings compared with earnings before special items of $64 million in the fourth quarter. Average sales realizations for pulp and liquid packaging declined as prices remained under pressure. Sales volumes declined only slightly as demand for our pulp remained strong despite the seasonally weak Lunar New Year period. Maintenance expense increased due to additional scheduled maintenance outage days. First quarter included 16 days of scheduled maintenance outages compared with 8 days in the fourth quarter.
As I noted earlier, we have announced the sale of our pulp mills to International Paper in a $2.2 billion cash transaction. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory review, and we expect it to close in the fourth quarter. This transaction delivers compelling value for our shareholders, and we expect to use a substantial portion of the $1.6 billion after-tax proceeds for repayment of the 18-month term loans raised during the first quarter.
I want to thank the employees of our Cellulose Fiber business for their dedication and professionalism as they have continued to operate safely and deliver an exceptional customer experience through the strategic review process. As noted in Monday's press release, the strategic review of our liquid packaging business and newsprint and publication venture is ongoing, and we look forward to sharing more information with you when that review is complete.
I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook."
107633,330160927,976375,"Weyerhaeuser Co., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 06, 2016",2016-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The overall outlook for the second quarter is summarized on Chart 16 of the earnings slides. Please note that the second quarter will include a full quarter of Plum Creek operations.Starting with Timberlands. We expec",1250,"Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The overall outlook for the second quarter is summarized on Chart 16 of the earnings slides. Please note that the second quarter will include a full quarter of Plum Creek operations.
Starting with Timberlands. We expect second quarter EBITDA to come in approximately 10% higher than first quarter, with second quarter earnings comparable to the first quarter. It is important to note that as part of the purchase price allocation, the Plum Creek timberland basis was stepped up to reflect fair value. As a result, new depletion rates were established for the combined Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek Timberlands. 
In addition to changes in the depletion rate, the accounting policies for amortization of road and other related expenses have been aligned. These changes will result in total amortization and depletion expense of approximately $90 million for the second quarter.
In our Western Timberland operations, log export volume is expected to improve in the second quarter as volumes to China increase following the seasonally low Lunar New Year period. Japanese export volumes were elevated in the first quarter and are expected to return to more normal seasonal levels in the second quarter. We anticipate stable pricing for our Japanese and Chinese export logs, with a slight decline in overall export price realizations due to the higher proportion of Chinese volume. 
Domestic log volumes will increase with the addition of the Plum Creek activity with prices remaining stable quarter-over-quarter. Costs will be higher due to shifting harvest activity to higher elevation, which is typical during the spring season. 
In the South, harvest volumes will increase approximately 40% as we benefit from a full quarter of Plum Creek operations. We expect average log prices will decrease modestly as the harvest mix will include a higher proportion of pulpwood logs. In addition, forestry expenses will be higher due to increased seasonal spending.
In the North, harvest volumes will be above first quarter levels with the inclusion of a full quarter of Plum Creek operations. The second quarter typically has the lowest harvest levels of the year because of spring weather conditions, with the mud season, which limits access to harvest sites in the northern operating region. Average sales realizations will be comparable to first quarter levels. Note that prior to the merger, Plum Creek included their Oregon and Washington activity in their Northern segment. 
Moving on to our full year timber harvest outlook. We expect our combined 2016 fee harvest will be 40 million to 42 million tons. The 2016 fee harvest is comparable to the combined Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek 2015 harvest levels after adding Plum Creek's harvest for the January 1 through February 19 premerger period. 
Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources second quarter EBITDA and earnings are expected to be similar to the first quarter. Higher and better use markets remain active in the southern states, and we expect similar transaction activity in second quarter as compared to the first quarter. 
In the second half of the year, we expect transaction counts to increase as more higher and better use properties are identified through our AVO process and brought to market. For the remainder of the year, we estimate the sales mix will be evenly split between Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek lands, with an average basis of 50%. 
For Wood Products, inventories throughout the supply chain remain relatively low as buyers continue to meet their purchasing needs on a just-in-time basis. Prices for lumber have improved in the second half of the first quarter, and that trend continued into the second quarter. Average April sales realizations were $30 higher than the first quarter average. 
OSB prices have also rallied, with average April sales realizations approximately $15 higher than the first quarter averages. We anticipate prices will continue to strengthen during the second quarter as building activity increases. 
Sales volume for the engineered wood products are expected to be seasonally higher in the second quarter, and we expect continued improvement in this business. Operating rates remain strong across all the Wood Products business lines.
We expect overall second quarter EBITDA and earnings for the Wood Products segment will be significantly higher than the first quarter. In fact, EBITDA for this segment has not been this strong since the second quarter of 2013. This is primarily a result of our improved operational performance and competitive cost structure.
Moving to Cellulose Fibers. EBITDA and earnings in Cellulose Fibers business are expected to increase during the second quarter with higher average sales realizations across our product lines. Volumes are expected to be similar to first quarter levels. We anticipate maintenance spending to be similar to first quarter. Other costs of sales are expected to decrease slightly due to lower fiber and energy costs. 
For our key financial items, cash from operations during the first quarter was $47 million. The first quarter is usually our lowest operating cash flow quarter due to seasonally lower earnings, inventory buildup and semiannual interest payments. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $415 million. Going forward, we anticipate that our normalized cash balance will be in the range of $200 million to $400 million, which we feel is an appropriate level for the capital structure at this time. 
We completed our planned post-transaction financing in February and March by entering into 2 18-month term loans at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 105 basis points or approximately 1.5%. The loans have a total capacity of $2.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had drawn down $1.1 billion. Long-term debt, not including the term loan balance of $1.1 billion, was $6.7 billion at the end of the quarter. We have no debt maturities in 2016, and we intend to pay down the new term loans primarily with proceeds from asset sales. This will allow us to move toward our target debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.5x. Interest expense for the first quarter reflects a partial quarter of interest for both the Plum Creek legacy debt and the new term loans. Looking forward, our 2016 interest expense will be approximately $450 million for the year.
Moving on to capital expenditures. First quarter capital expenditures totaled $73 million. Our capital spending is seasonal and tends to be lowest in the first quarter before ramping up through the rest of the year. We continue to expect 2016 CapEx will be approximately $450 million, excluding Cellulose Fibers. This includes minimal spending for Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources, where the focus is on entitlement and royalty contracts and not capital-intensive development. 
Our 2016 total company tax rate will be dependent upon the mix of REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary income. We are currently estimating our full year total company tax rate to be approximately 18% to 20%. Due to prior year overpayment, we do not anticipate making a cash payment in 2016.
These first quarter estimates do not take into account the impact of the divestiture of the pulp business, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Let me direct your attention to Chart 12, which details the major components of our unallocated items. Income before special items improved to $19 million in the first quarter compared with $1 million of expense in fourth quarter of 2015. The improvement was driven primarily by foreign exchange as the Canadian dollar strengthened 7% against the U.S. dollar during the quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions."

Each of our senior management team members has spent several weeks on the road meeting with employees and reinforcing our vision and the core values, relentless focus and key behaviors that will define our success as a merged company. I look forward to building on that strong foundation as we work together to be the world's premier timber, land and forest products company. We are relentlessly focused on improving performance through operational excellence and capturing cost and operational synergies to leverage the full benefit of an improving U.S. housing market and drive long-term value for our shareholders.

China, encouraged by what's happening there. As you know, the inventory didn't build like they have over the last couple of years in the first quarter, so we anticipate both demand and pricing will be up in the second quarter.

This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter net earnings of $70 million or $0.11 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $150 million or $0.24 per diluted share. Our",2084,"Thank you, Beth, and welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter net earnings of $70 million or $0.11 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $150 million or $0.24 per diluted share. Our first quarter earnings included results from Plum Creek for the period February 19 through March 31.
Special items for the first quarter included integration and restructuring charges related to the Plum Creek merger and the strategic review of our Cellulose Fiber business, partially offset by a gain on the sale of our corporate campus. 
I'm extremely proud of the work of our employees in the quarter as we closed the Plum Creek merger, delivered solid operating performance across each of our businesses and took significant steps toward achieving the commitments that will drive long-term value for shareholders of our merged company, including -- we have specific plans in place to capture $100 million of hard dollar cost synergies, and I am highly confident that we will meet or exceed this run rate target by the end of year 1. 
As part of that, we made and announced nearly all our personnel decisions in the 41 days between merger close and the end of the first quarter. We raised $2.5 billion of attractively priced term loan financing and began to aggressively execute against our $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization. At the end of the first quarter, we had repurchased approximately $860 million or 35% of our authorization at an average price of $27.49 per share. And we closed the sale of our corporate campus for $70 million in cash, with our move to Seattle on track and scheduled for September. 
We have continued to execute against our goals as the second quarter has progressed. On April 1, we closed the Twin Creeks transaction announced by Plum Creek in September 2015, receiving $440 million in cash in a transaction that valued 260,000 acres of Plum Creek Southern Timberlands at $2,150 per acre. 
As of the end of April, our share repurchase program was 50% complete, with cumulative repurchases of $1.25 billion or nearly 44 million shares at an average price of $28.62. 
And finally, earlier this week, we announced the conclusion of a portion of our Cellulose Fibers business strategic review with the sale of our pulp mills to International Paper for $2.2 billion.
I will turn now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin with some brief comments about the housing market. The U.S. housing market continues to grow at a moderate pace, supported by continuing job growth and historically low interest rates. As of March, total housing starts had improved 14% year-to-date compared with 2015. 
Single-family starts have grown even more and are up 23% year-to-date. Although multifamily activity, which is typically more volatile, has driven some choppiness in monthly indicators, first quarter housing activity has been consistent with our expectations and those of our customers. Despite some headwinds from labor constraints, builder sentiment remains extremely strong. We continue to plan for just over 1.2 million housing starts in 2016.
Let me now turn to our business segments. Following the merger, we realigned our management structure and our business segments to incorporate the increased scale of our Timberlands operations as well as the addition of Plum Creek's real estate, energy and natural resources expertise. For the first quarter, Weyerhaeuser is reporting 4 business segments: Timberlands; Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources; Wood Products; and Cellulose Fibers. To make it easier to compare current and historical results, business segment results for prior periods have been adjusted to reflect our new segment definitions. 
We have also revised our definition of adjusted EBITDA to add back the noncash basis of real estate sold. With this change, EBITDA for the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resource segment will better reflect the cash generated by those activities. Going forward, we will focus on adjusted EBITDA for all our businesses.
I will now begin the discussion on Timberlands, Charts 3 to 5. In Timberlands, we are reporting EBITDA by 3 primary geographies: Western Timberlands includes Washington and Oregon; Southern Timberlands includes all southern states; and Northern Timberlands includes operations in Montana, the Lake States, New England and West Virginia. Results from Canada and Uruguay are reported in Other Timberlands. Recreational lease activities continues to be reported within the Timberlands segment, and volumes and realizations for our Timberlands business are now reported in tons.
Timberlands contributed $129 million to first quarter earnings, an improvement of $22 million compared with the fourth quarter. These results include higher noncash depletion and amortization costs due to the step-up in timberland bases associated with acquisition accounting and the alignment of our accounting policies. Adjusted EBITDA for Timberlands increased by $39 million to $199 million. Approximately 12% of Timberlands' first quarter EBITDA is attributable to the addition of Plum Creek operations.
Western Timberlands contributed $118 million to first quarter EBITDA, an improvement of $15 million compared with the fourth quarter. Western fee harvest volumes increased due to slightly higher harvests from legacy Weyerhaeuser land and a partial quarter of Plum Creek harvest. Average realizations for Western logs declined slightly due to a shift in mix from export to domestic markets. 
Average realizations for export logs improved, and export sales volumes were comparable to the fourth quarter. Sales volume to Japan increased, and pricing improved modestly due to continued strong demand. Japanese wooden housing starts have improved slightly compared with 2015 as mortgage rates remain low, and we see some pull forward in advance of a scheduled increase in the consumption tax next year. 
Volumes to China declined seasonally compared with the fourth quarter as construction activity paused during the Lunar New Year period. Average realizations improved slightly. Log inventory to Chinese ports rose during the first quarter but remained within a normal range for the season and well below the elevated levels experienced during the first quarter of 2015. With inventories in line and slightly improved construction activity, our customers are optimistic regarding current market conditions. In Western domestic markets, log supply and demand remained balanced and realizations improved slightly.
Southern Timberlands contributed $77 million to first quarter EBITDA, $21 million more than the fourth quarter. This improvement was attributable to a partial quarter of Plum Creek operations. A partial quarter of harvest from Plum Creek's 3.4 million Southern acres increased Southern harvest by 40% and more than offset a small seasonal decline in harvest from legacy Weyerhaeuser land. 
Realizations for Southern logs declined slightly primarily due to mix. Silviculture cost and forestry costs declined as activity was delayed due to wet weather. A partial quarter results from Plum Creek's Northern Timberlands contributed $3 million to first quarter EBITDA.
Operational excellence initiatives continue to contribute to Timberlands' results. On our fourth quarter earnings call, we set a target of $20 million to $30 million of OpEx improvements from legacy Weyerhaeuser holdings. Following the merger, we have now increased the Timberlands 2016 OpEx target to $30 million to $50 million to incorporate $10 million to $20 million of operational synergies we expect to achieve from the merger this year. 
The multiyear OpEx target for Timberlands has also increased to $200 million, including the $64 million achieved in 2014 and '15 to incorporate operational synergy opportunity from the merger. Timberlands has begun an internal benchmarking exercise to identify best practices in silviculture, logging and transportation and leverage those learnings across the entire Timberlands portfolio. Although this work is still in the early stages, I'm pleased by the level of energy and teamwork in identifying opportunities across the business.
Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, Charts 6 and 7. The Real Estate and ENR segment includes sales of HBU and non-core timberland property as well as lease and royalty income from minerals, aggregates and oil and gas. These activities were formerly reported within Weyerhaeuser's Timberlands segment. 
Real Estate and ENR contributed $15 million to first quarter earnings, $12 million lower than the fourth quarter. However, EBITDA increased by $1 million to $34 million as lower EBITDA from legacy Weyerhaeuser operations was more than offset by a partial quarter of Plum Creek results. 
Total acreage sold increased in the first quarter compared with the fourth due to a conservation sale of over 8,000 acres of main timberland. Although a partial quarter of Plum Creek's operations contributed significantly to the segment's EBITDA, the Plum Creek contribution to earnings was minimal because Plum Creek land was marked up to fair value as part of the merger purchase price allocation. 
Operational excellence for the Real Estate and ENR business will be based on the premium to timberland values captured from the sale of HBU properties. The first step in defining the size of this opportunity is applying Plum Creek asset value optimization or AVO process across Weyerhaeuser's 6.9 million acres of legacy timberlands. This process is underway, and we anticipate it will be substantially complete in about 1 year.
Wood Products, Charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $87 million to first quarter earnings compared with earnings before special items of $48 million in the fourth quarter. Results for Plum Creek lumber mills are reported as part of the lumber business, and results for Plum Creek's plywood and medium-density fiber board or MBF facilities are reported with engineered wood products. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the Wood Products segment increased to $117 million primarily due to improved unit manufacturing costs and seasonally higher sales volume. Approximately 4% of Wood Products' first quarter EBITDA is attributable to the addition of Plum Creek operations. 
In lumber, EBITDA improved $18 million compared with fourth quarter. Average realizations improved 1%, and sales volumes increased 3%. Unit manufacturing costs declined due to higher operating rates and strong operating performance. Fourth quarter included downtime for installation of capital projects. 
In OSB, EBITDA increased to $31 million, $6 million higher than the fourth quarter and $27 million higher than the first quarter of last year. Unit manufacturing costs improved due to strong operating performance and reduced downtime for planned maintenance. This more than offset a 3% decrease in average sales realizations. Sales volumes increased 5%. 
Engineered wood products EBITDA more than doubled to $31 million compared with $14 million in the fourth quarter. Operating rates and unit manufacturing costs improved due to higher demand, strong operating performance and reduced downtime for maintenance and capital projects. Sales volumes increased seasonally, and average realizations declined slightly due to mix.
EBITDA for the Distribution business improved to $4 million, $2 million more than the fourth quarter and $7 million more than the first quarter of 2015. This business benefited from improved margins and lower operating cost. 
Operational excellence continues to contribute to Wood Products results as all 4 businesses gain leverage from ongoing improvements in controllable cost. The businesses are collectively targeting $55 million to $75 million of operational excellence improvements in 2016. Each business remains relentlessly focused on its initiatives and is on track to achieve its target.
Cellulose Fibers, Charts 10 and 11. Cellulose Fibers contributed $28 million to first quarter earnings compared with earnings before special items of $64 million in the fourth quarter. Average sales realizations for pulp and liquid packaging declined as prices remained under pressure. Sales volumes declined only slightly as demand for our pulp remained strong despite the seasonally weak Lunar New Year period. Maintenance expense increased due to additional scheduled maintenance outage days. First quarter included 16 days of scheduled maintenance outages compared with 8 days in the fourth quarter.
As I noted earlier, we have announced the sale of our pulp mills to International Paper in a $2.2 billion cash transaction. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory review, and we expect it to close in the fourth quarter. This transaction delivers compelling value for our shareholders, and we expect to use a substantial portion of the $1.6 billion after-tax proceeds for repayment of the 18-month term loans raised during the first quarter.
I want to thank the employees of our Cellulose Fiber business for their dedication and professionalism as they have continued to operate safely and deliver an exceptional customer experience through the strategic review process. As noted in Monday's press release, the strategic review of our liquid packaging business and newsprint and publication venture is ongoing, and we look forward to sharing more information with you when that review is complete.
I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook."
107633,330160927,977585,"Weyerhaeuser Co., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 06, 2016",2016-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The overall outlook for the second quarter is summarized on Chart 16 of the earnings slides. Please note that the second quarter will include a full quarter of Plum Creek operations.Starting with Timberlands. We expec",1250,"Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The overall outlook for the second quarter is summarized on Chart 16 of the earnings slides. Please note that the second quarter will include a full quarter of Plum Creek operations.
Starting with Timberlands. We expect second quarter EBITDA to come in approximately 10% higher than first quarter, with second quarter earnings comparable to the first quarter. It is important to note that as part of the purchase price allocation, the Plum Creek timberland basis was stepped up to reflect fair value. As a result, new depletion rates were established for the combined Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek Timberlands. 
In addition to changes in the depletion rate, the accounting policies for amortization of road and other related expenses have been aligned. These changes will result in total amortization and depletion expense of approximately $90 million for the second quarter.
In our Western Timberland operations, log export volume is expected to improve in the second quarter as volumes to China increase following the seasonally low Lunar New Year period. Japanese export volumes were elevated in the first quarter and are expected to return to more normal seasonal levels in the second quarter. We anticipate stable pricing for our Japanese and Chinese export logs, with a slight decline in overall export price realizations due to the higher proportion of Chinese volume. 
Domestic log volumes will increase with the addition of the Plum Creek activity with prices remaining stable quarter-over-quarter. Costs will be higher due to shifting harvest activity to higher elevation, which is typical during the spring season. 
In the South, harvest volumes will increase approximately 40% as we benefit from a full quarter of Plum Creek operations. We expect average log prices will decrease modestly as the harvest mix will include a higher proportion of pulpwood logs. In addition, forestry expenses will be higher due to increased seasonal spending.
In the North, harvest volumes will be above first quarter levels with the inclusion of a full quarter of Plum Creek operations. The second quarter typically has the lowest harvest levels of the year because of spring weather conditions, with the mud season, which limits access to harvest sites in the northern operating region. Average sales realizations will be comparable to first quarter levels. Note that prior to the merger, Plum Creek included their Oregon and Washington activity in their Northern segment. 
Moving on to our full year timber harvest outlook. We expect our combined 2016 fee harvest will be 40 million to 42 million tons. The 2016 fee harvest is comparable to the combined Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek 2015 harvest levels after adding Plum Creek's harvest for the January 1 through February 19 premerger period. 
Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources second quarter EBITDA and earnings are expected to be similar to the first quarter. Higher and better use markets remain active in the southern states, and we expect similar transaction activity in second quarter as compared to the first quarter. 
In the second half of the year, we expect transaction counts to increase as more higher and better use properties are identified through our AVO process and brought to market. For the remainder of the year, we estimate the sales mix will be evenly split between Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek lands, with an average basis of 50%. 
For Wood Products, inventories throughout the supply chain remain relatively low as buyers continue to meet their purchasing needs on a just-in-time basis. Prices for lumber have improved in the second half of the first quarter, and that trend continued into the second quarter. Average April sales realizations were $30 higher than the first quarter average. 
OSB prices have also rallied, with average April sales realizations approximately $15 higher than the first quarter averages. We anticipate prices will continue to strengthen during the second quarter as building activity increases. 
Sales volume for the engineered wood products are expected to be seasonally higher in the second quarter, and we expect continued improvement in this business. Operating rates remain strong across all the Wood Products business lines.
We expect overall second quarter EBITDA and earnings for the Wood Products segment will be significantly higher than the first quarter. In fact, EBITDA for this segment has not been this strong since the second quarter of 2013. This is primarily a result of our improved operational performance and competitive cost structure.
Moving to Cellulose Fibers. EBITDA and earnings in Cellulose Fibers business are expected to increase during the second quarter with higher average sales realizations across our product lines. Volumes are expected to be similar to first quarter levels. We anticipate maintenance spending to be similar to first quarter. Other costs of sales are expected to decrease slightly due to lower fiber and energy costs. 
For our key financial items, cash from operations during the first quarter was $47 million. The first quarter is usually our lowest operating cash flow quarter due to seasonally lower earnings, inventory buildup and semiannual interest payments. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $415 million. Going forward, we anticipate that our normalized cash balance will be in the range of $200 million to $400 million, which we feel is an appropriate level for the capital structure at this time. 
We completed our planned post-transaction financing in February and March by entering into 2 18-month term loans at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 105 basis points or approximately 1.5%. The loans have a total capacity of $2.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had drawn down $1.1 billion. Long-term debt, not including the term loan balance of $1.1 billion, was $6.7 billion at the end of the quarter. We have no debt maturities in 2016, and we intend to pay down the new term loans primarily with proceeds from asset sales. This will allow us to move toward our target debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.5x. Interest expense for the first quarter reflects a partial quarter of interest for both the Plum Creek legacy debt and the new term loans. Looking forward, our 2016 interest expense will be approximately $450 million for the year.
Moving on to capital expenditures. First quarter capital expenditures totaled $73 million. Our capital spending is seasonal and tends to be lowest in the first quarter before ramping up through the rest of the year. We continue to expect 2016 CapEx will be approximately $450 million, excluding Cellulose Fibers. This includes minimal spending for Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources, where the focus is on entitlement and royalty contracts and not capital-intensive development. 
Our 2016 total company tax rate will be dependent upon the mix of REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary income. We are currently estimating our full year total company tax rate to be approximately 18% to 20%. Due to prior year overpayment, we do not anticipate making a cash payment in 2016.
These first quarter estimates do not take into account the impact of the divestiture of the pulp business, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Let me direct your attention to Chart 12, which details the major components of our unallocated items. Income before special items improved to $19 million in the first quarter compared with $1 million of expense in fourth quarter of 2015. The improvement was driven primarily by foreign exchange as the Canadian dollar strengthened 7% against the U.S. dollar during the quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions."

So that's an incremental $130 million above what we accomplished in 2014 and 2015, so an additional $130 million that we think we will be able to accomplish over the next 2 or 3 years as we put these 2 companies together and deliver bottom line operational synergies.

We think -- and a little bit of that was pulled forward for people being ready for an anticipated run-up before the consumption tax increase. In the second quarter, we think demand, because it was elevated in the first quarter, will be down a little bit in the second quarter, and price will be down -- flat to down slightly. China, encouraged by what's happening there. As you know, the inventory didn't build like they have over the last couple of years in the first quarter, so we anticipate both demand and pricing will be up in the second quarter. And then domestic, as we said, good demand, probably a little bit slightly lower prices in the second quarter.

This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter net earnings of $157 million or $0.21 per diluted share on a net sales from continuing operations of $1.7 billion. Second quarter results include after-tax earnings",1627,"Thank you, Beth and Welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter net earnings of $157 million or $0.21 per diluted share on a net sales from continuing operations of $1.7 billion. Second quarter results include after-tax earnings of $38 million from discontinued operations and $11 million of after-tax charges for merger and legal expenses. Results for our entire Cellulose Fibers segment are reported as discontinued operations. Excluding discontinued operations and special ops, were in the $130 million or $0.17 per diluted share. 
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA from our continuing operations was $413 million, and this represents an improvement of $77 million or 23% compared with first quarter results. I'm proud of our second quarter operating performance. Our teams continue to execute well and delivered solid operating results, including Wood Products strong in second quarter in over a decade. In the quarter, we also announced the sale of our pulp mill and liquid packaging board facility for collective proceeds of $2.5 billion or approximately $1.8 billion after-tax, closed the Twin Creeks transactions, receiving $440 million in cash and a transaction valuing 260,000 acres of Southern Timberlands at $2,150 per-acre. 
We purchased over $830 million worth of our common shares and made strong progress on merger integration activities as we worked together to successfully integrate Plum Creek and fully capture the cost and operational synergies that will drive superior value for our shareholders. Before I turn to our second quarter business results, let me make some brief comments about the housing market. Single-family housing starts continue to grow at double-digit rates and year-to-date activity remains in line with our expectations. Through June, single-family starts had approved 15% compared with 2015 on a seasonally adjusted basis and total U.S. starts were up 8%. 
Although the supply side constraints such as fuel labor, permitting delays and fees, and rising lending restriction costs dampen the markets acceleration during the second quarter, solid economic fundamentals, including job growth and historically low mortgage rates continue to drive improving housing demand. We continue to anticipate approximately 1.2 million housing starts for 2016, in line with consensus estimates. Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands, Charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed to $12 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA for Timberlands increased by $21 million to $220 million. Noncash depreciation and amortization costs increased by $25 million following a full quarter of higher depreciation rates resulting from acquisition accounting. 
Western Timberlands contributed $114 million to second quarter EBITDA compared with $118 million in the first quarter. Western Sea harbors volume increased by average realizations for Western logs to decline modestly, primarily due to a greater proportion of sales to domestic and Chinese markets. As anticipated, sales volumes to Japan declined in the second quarter as first quarter pulled forward demand in advance of its scheduled consumption tax increase, which was later delayed. Pricing for our Japanese logs moderated slightly in the quarter. Volumes to China rose due to seasonally higher construction activity and were average law realizations were essentially flat. Log inventory at Chinese ports were a little changed in the quarter and remain at normalized levels. 
In Western domestic markets, law of supply and demand remained balanced during the quarter. Average realizations declined slightly due to mix and per unit logging costs increased seasonally as second quarter harvest includes a greater proportion of higher elevation white wood. Southern Timberlands contributed to $99 million to second quarter EBITDA, $22 million more than the first quarter. Southern VR slight decreased by 40% due to a full quarter of Plum Creek operations, realizations for southern logs declined slightly due to mix as second quarter sales included a hyper percentage of pulp wood, increased to catch up on first quarter activity that has been delayed due to wet weather. 
Northern Timberlands EBITDA improved slightly compared to the first quarter. The Timberlands business remains relentlessly focused on capturing operational excellence and is on track to achieve its $30 million to $50 million operational excellence targets for 2016. During the quarter, internal benchmarking teams completed an initial survey of operational synergy opportunities to power test areas with the greatest potential value, a deep dive comparison of each company's practices and the highest value areas is underway. We are pleased with the progress to date and look forward to capturing these opportunities later this year and into 2017. 
Real Estate energy and natural resources, Charts 6 and 7. Real Estate and ENR contributed $12 million to second quarter earnings compared with $15 million in the first quarter. EBITDA for the second quarter totaled $28 million. For Real Estate the number of acres sold declined slightly due to the timing of transaction closings. Average price per-acre increased in the second quarter, including the sale of a high-value parcel in Canada and Beach Oregon. EBITDA from energy and natural resources operations improved slightly. Our Real Estate team is running full out as they apply Plum Creek's asset value optimization or ABO process to the legacy Weyerhaeuser Timberlands. This work is proceeding well and we continue to anticipate the process will be substantially complete in early 2017. We expect Real Estate activity will ramp up significantly in the fourth quarter of this year and into 2017, as this process moves toward conclusion. 
Wood Products, Charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $156 million to second quarter earnings, an improvement of 80% compared with first quarter. By effectively capitalizing on improving markets and ongoing operational excellence initiatives, the business delivered its strongest second quarter since 2005. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $189 million, $72 million more than the first quarter. EBITDA from lumbar rose to $96 million. This is an improvement of $45 million or nearly 90% compared with first quarter. Average realizations improved nearly 10% and the sales volume increased by 8%. The business also had another strong quarter operationally. Western log costs decline and recovery improved and manufacturing cost net of logs decreased due to the continued benefit of operational excellence initiatives. 
OSB contributed $43 million to EBITDA, $12 million more than the first quarter. Average sales realizations increased 12% and our mills continued to run well. Engineered Wood Products EBITDA increased to $45 million, $14 million more than the first quarter. Sales volume rose due to seasonally higher demand and a full quarter of Plum Creek, MDS and plywood operations. Average realizations for solid section declined slightly due to mix. In distribution. EBITDA rose $5 million compared with first quarter due to improved sales volume, higher margins and ongoing cost control. The business had increased EBITDA by $14 million year-to-date against the 2016 full year target of $15 million to $20 million. 
Later in the quarter, we announced changes to improve the profitability of our Montana Wood Products operations. In the third quarter, we will permanently close the lumber and plywood mill in Colombia halts. These moves will allow us to align the available log supply with our manufacturing capacity, including adding shift at our Glasgow facilities and best position our Montana operations for long-term success. Wood Products remains relentlessly focused on OpEx initiatives and is on track to achieve its 2016 target. During our first quarter earnings call, we indicated we thought second quarter Wood Products results can be comparable to second quarter 2013, a time when we were just beginning our OpEx journey and lumber and OSB pricing was significantly higher than it is today. In fact, we exceeded second quarter 2013 EBITDA by $23 million despite the fact that average lumber realizations in the second quarter were 35% [ph], lower than 3 years ago and average realizations for OSB were more than $9 lower than they were in 2013. 
This overall improvement highlights a the contribution, operational excellence to the making to our business results. I will now turn to our -- to discontinued operations, Chart 11. As I previously [indiscernible] our entire Cellulose Fibers is being reported as discontinued operations. This includes results from our pulp mill, [indiscernible] discontinued operations contributed $52 million to pretax earnings compared with $29 million in the first quarter. Average sales realizations for pulp and liquid packaging rose comparably to the first quarter and sales volumes from liquid packaging increased. Maintenance and energy costs declined slightly. 
Second quarter results also reflect accounting changes resulting from the reclassification as discontinued operations. Noncash depreciation expense increased by $23 million compared with first quarter, due to a requirement to see depreciation on assets held for sale and corporate overhead expense previously allocated to cellulose fiber that is now reported an in unallocated items. This change affects both current and prior periods. These expenses totaled approximately 5 $29 million per quarter or approximately $35 million on an annual basis. 
The effects of these accounting changes was largely offset by charges associated with the strategic review process and other transaction expenses. Yesterday, we received Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance in the U.S. with the announced sale of our pulp mills to International Paper. We continue to make progress through remaining regulatory approval, primarily competition clearance and several foreign jurisdictions. We intend to pay closing the transaction in the fourth quarter. Similarly, we have received Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance for the sale of our liquid packaging business and continue to progress with remaining approvals. We expect to close the liquid packaging transaction in the third quarter. 
The process for our joint venture is proceeding well. We are actively working with prospective buyers and we will update you when that review is complete. I want to thank our Cellulose Fibers employees for maintaining their focus on operating safely and delivering strong results throughout the strategic review and sale processes. 
I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook"
107633,372217749,1026851,"Weyerhaeuser Co., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the third quarter is presented in slide -- Chart 14 of the earnings slides. For Timberlands, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will decline slightly for roughly 5% compared to the second quarter du",1105,"Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the third quarter is presented in slide -- Chart 14 of the earnings slides. For Timberlands, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will decline slightly for roughly 5% compared to the second quarter due to seasonality and lower export prices. In our Western Timberland operations overall, we expect harvest volumes to be similar to second quarter levels. Although Japanese housing activity remains strong, we anticipate prices will soften us markets adjust to its delayed increase in the consumption tax. In China, seasonally slower construction activity and continued currency headwinds will result in lower sales volumes and moderately lower pricing. 
Domestic log volumes and prices are expected to remain stable. Operating conditions throughout the Western region have been favorable as the risk of fire has been low. Western logging costs will be seasonally higher in the third quarter as summer weather allows us to ship harvest activities to higher elevations, which have a higher percentage of cable logging and longer haul distances. In the South, fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly higher than the second quarter. But on a lower grade mix as third quarter activity typically includes a higher percentage of sifting volume. Silviculture and growth spending will also be seasonally higher. 
In the North, the third quarter you harvest volumes will be significantly higher than the prior quarter. Note that second quarter harvests are the lowest of the year because of logging and hauling limitations due to spring breakup whereas they like to say the northern woods, the mud season. We expect average sales realizations will be similar to second quarter levels. In Real Estate in energy and national resources segment, we expect significantly higher earnings and adjusted EBITDA from Real Estate sales during the second half of the year, nearly all this improvement will occur in the fourth quarter. 
Third quarter real estate activity will be primarily focused on continuing work on the ABO process and building our inventory of higher and better use properties. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will increase slightly compared to the second quarter with a mix of Real Estate sales slightly heavier to higher basis lands. In the fourth quarter, we expect EBITDA will be more than double the third quarter level as the first results of AVO assessments of the portions of the U.S. other taken to markets have taken to move through the closing. The Wood Products, inventories throughout the supply chain remain tight as buyers continue to only purchase product to meet their immediate needs, which has been pushing lumber and OSB pricing higher as we enter the third quarter. We're anticipating comparable sales volumes and continued strength in lumber and OSB pricing in the third quarter as housing starts, especially single-family, continue to improve and builders move into the late summer building season. 
We expect to see continued solid performance in engineered Wood Products. Overall, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA and earnings for the Wood Products segment will be considerably higher than second quarter. Lumber and OSB prices improved throughout July. If prices stabilized at current levels for the balance of the quarter, the segment is on track to improve EBITDA and earnings by roughly 10% compared with second quarter. However, we believe this continued upside for both lumber and OSB prices and anticipate earnings could exceed this level. Now let me direct your attention to Chart 10, which details the major components of our unallocated items. 
The contribution to earnings before special items, was $1 million, $9 million lower than the first quarter results, which included the $13 million gain on foreign exchange. Note that unallocated corporate function expenses now include approximately $9 million of cost that were recorded in Cellulose Fibers segment prior to the discontinued operations reclassification. Chart 12 summarizes our key financial items. We entered the quarter with a cash balance of $485 million, up $74 million from the first quarter. Cash flow from operations, including Cellulose Fibers, was $492 million for the second quarter. This is, an increase of $444 million over the first quarter, which is typically in the lowest cash flow quarter in the year. In addition to increased cash flows from Wood Products and Timberland segments, we saw a positive variance in our working capital due to the seasonal decrease in inventory levels quarter-over-quarter. Cash from investing activities was a positive $350 million for the quarter as we received $440 million in cash proceeds from the Twin Creeks transaction, which closed on April 1. 
Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $101 million, including $12 million of our discontinued operations. We expect 2016 CapEx from our continuing operations will be approximately $425 million with Timberlands capital spending for expected to total about $125 million for the year and wood products spending up approximately $300 million. Financing cash flows included $831 million 4 share repurchases and $228 million for common dividends. As of June 30, we've drawn $1.4 billion of a $2.5 billion available under the term loan facilities. Long-term debt, not including the term loan balance of $1.4 billion, the $6.6 billion at the end of the second quarter. We intend to pay down the term loans for the proceeds from our recently announced asset sales. 
Interest expense of $114 million for the second quarter reflects a full quarter of interest for both the Plum Creek legacy debt and the new term loans. We expect interest expense will be comparable in the third quarter. For our continuing operations, the company anticipates the full year tax rate will be between 18% and 20% based on the expected mix of REIT and REIT subsidiary income. I'll wrap up with Chart 13, which provide some additional detail on our share count and share repurchase activities. Through the end of the second quarter, we have repurchased 58 million shares of common stock under our February 2016 share repurchase program at an average price of $29.18 per share. 
We have continued our repurchase activity during the third quarter. And as of August 1, our cumulative repurchases totaled $1.98 billion or nearly 67 million shares at an average price of $29.45. The company did not repurchase shares during the period June 1 through June 28 because of the measurement period for our mandatory convertible preference shares. The mandatory convertible preference shares converted to common shares on July 1 at a rate of approximately 1.69 common shares for preference share.

We continue to make strong progress on the merger integration. I'm encouraged by the teamwork I see among employees in all levels as we work together to serve our customers, identify best practices and implement improved processes for our merged company. We have fully identify the sources of the $800 million of hard dollar cost synergies. As of the end of the second quarter, we are capturing about 1/3 of these reductions on the run-rate basis. I'm highly confident we will reach our $100 million run rate cost synergy target by the end of year 1. 
In addition to capturing market synergies, we must address the $35 million of corporate costs formally allocated to the Cellulose Fibers segment. To ensure our businesses remains competitive, we will eliminate these costs just as we did following the divestiture of our homebuilding business. We've been planning for the reduction is part of the strategic review process and anticipate eliminating these costs within 12 months after closing the International Paper transaction. 
In closing, I will mention that the move to our new Seattle headquarters remains on track for mid-September. I'm also pleased to announce that we will be holding an Investor Day in New York on Tuesday, December 13. We will send out the details and a press release later this morning. At that meeting, we will provide specific updates on progress against the key targets for our merged company and you will have the -- an opportunity to hear first-hand from each of our business leaders about the key initiatives as we work together to drive superior value for our shareholders.

This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter net earnings of $157 million or $0.21 per diluted share on a net sales from continuing operations of $1.7 billion. Second quarter results include after-tax earnings",1641,"Thank you, Beth and Welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter net earnings of $157 million or $0.21 per diluted share on a net sales from continuing operations of $1.7 billion. Second quarter results include after-tax earnings of $38 million from discontinued operations and $11 million of after-tax charges for merger and legal expenses. Results for our entire Cellulose Fibers segment are reported as discontinued operations. Excluding discontinued operations and special items, we were in the $130 million or $0.17 per diluted share. 
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA from our continuing operations was $413 million, and this represents an improvement of $77 million or 23% compared with first quarter results. I'm proud of our second quarter operating performance. Our teams continued to execute well and delivered solid operating results, including Wood Products strongest second quarter in over a decade. In the quarter, we also announced the sale of our pulp mill and liquid packaging board facility for collective proceeds of $2.5 billion or approximately $1.8 billion after-tax, closed the Twin Creeks transactions, receiving $440 million in cash and a transaction valuing 260,000 acres of Southern Timberlands at $2,150 per-acre. 
We purchased over $830 million worth of our common shares and made strong progress on merger integration activities as we worked together to successfully integrate Plum Creek and fully capture the cost and operational synergies that will drive superior value for our shareholders.
Before I turn to our second quarter business results, let me make some brief comments about the housing market. Single-family housing starts continued to grow at double-digit rates and year-to-date activity remains in line with our expectations. Through June, single-family starts had improved 15% compared with 2015 on a seasonally adjusted basis and total U.S. starts were up 8%. 
Although supply side constraints such as fuel labor, permitting delays and fees, and rising lending construction costs dampen the market's acceleration during the second quarter, solid economic fundamentals, including job growth and historically low mortgage rates continue to drive improving housing demand. We continue to anticipate approximately 1.2 million housing starts for 2016, in line with consensus estimates. Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands, Charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $125 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA for Timberlands increased by $21 million to $220 million. Noncash depreciation and amortization costs increased by $25 million following a full quarter of higher depreciation rates resulting from acquisition accounting. 
Western Timberlands contributed $114 million to second quarter EBITDA compared with $118 million in the first quarter. Western Sea harbors volumes increased by an average realizations for Western logs to decline modestly, primarily due to a greater proportion of sales to domestic and Chinese markets. As anticipated, sales volumes to Japan declined in the second quarter as first quarter pulled forward demand in advance of its scheduled consumption tax increase, which was later delayed. Pricing for our Japanese logs moderated slightly in the quarter. Volumes to China rose due to seasonally higher construction activity and average log realizations were essentially flat. Log inventory at Chinese ports were a little changed in the quarter and remain at normalized levels. 
In Western domestic markets, law of supply and demand remained balanced during the quarter. Average realizations declined slightly due to mix and per unit logging costs increased seasonally as second quarter harvest includes a greater proportion of higher elevation white wood. Southern Timberlands contributed $99 million to second quarter EBITDA, $22 million more than the first quarter. Southern fee harvest volumes increased by 40% due to a full quarter of Plum Creek operations. Realizations for southern logs declined slightly due to mix as second quarter sales included a higher percentage of pulp wood. Silviculture and forestry cost increased due to catch up on first quarter activity that has been delayed due to wet weather. 
Northern Timberlands EBITDA improved slightly compared to the first quarter. The Timberlands business remains relentlessly focused on capturing operational excellence and is on track to achieve its $30 million to $50 million operational excellence targets for 2016. During the quarter, internal benchmarking teams completed an initial survey of operational synergy opportunities and prioritize areas with the greatest potential value. A deep dive comparison of each company's practices and the highest value areas is underway. We are pleased with the progress to date and look forward to capturing these opportunities later this year and into 2017. 
Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, Charts 6 and 7. Real Estate and ENR contributed $12 million to second quarter earnings compared with $15 million in the first quarter. EBITDA for the second quarter totaled $28 million. For Real Estate the number of acres sold declined slightly due to the timing of transaction closings. Average price per-acre increased as second quarter, included the sale of a high-value parcel in Cannon Beach, Oregon. 
EBITDA from energy and natural resources operations improved slightly. Our Real Estate team is running full out as they apply Plum Creek's asset value optimization or ABO process to the legacy Weyerhaeuser Timberlands. This work is proceeding well and we continue to anticipate the process will be substantially complete in early 2017. We expect Real Estate activity will ramp up significantly in the fourth quarter of this year and into 2017, as this process moves toward conclusion. 
Wood Products, Charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $156 million to second quarter earnings, an improvement of 80% compared with first quarter. By effectively capitalizing on improving markets and ongoing operational excellence initiatives, the business delivered its strongest second quarter since 2005. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $189 million, $72 million more than the first quarter. EBITDA from lumber rose to $96 million. This is an improvement of $45 million or nearly 90% compared with first quarter. Average realizations improved nearly 10%, and sales volume increased by 8%. The business also had another strong quarter operationally. Western log costs decline and recovery improved and manufacturing cost net of logs decreased due to the continued benefit of operational excellence initiatives. 
OSB contributed $43 million to EBITDA, $12 million more than the first quarter. Average sales realizations increased 12% and our mills continued to run well. Engineered Wood Products EBITDA increased to $45 million, $14 million more than the first quarter. Sales volume rose due to seasonally higher demand and a full quarter of Plum Creek, MDS and plywood operations. Average realizations for solid section and I-Joist declined slightly due to mix. 
In distribution. EBITDA rose $5 million compared with first quarter due to improved sales volume, higher margins and ongoing cost control. The business has increased EBITDA by $14 million year-to-date against the 2016 full year target of $15 million to $20 million. 
Later in the quarter, we announced changes to improve the profitability of our Montana Wood Product operations. In the third quarter, we will permanently close the lumber and plywood mill in Colombia Falls. These moves will allow us to align the available log supply with our manufacturing capacity, including adding shift at our [indiscernible] facilities and best position our Montana operations for long-term success. 
Wood Products remains relentlessly focused on OpEx initiatives and is on track to achieve its 2016 target. During our first quarter earnings call, we indicated we thought second quarter Wood Products results could be comparable to second quarter 2013, a time when we were just beginning our OpEx journey and lumber and OSB pricing was significantly higher than it is today. In fact, we exceeded second quarter 2013 EBITDA by $23 million despite the fact that average lumber realizations in the second quarter were $35 per thousand, lower than 3 years ago and average realizations for OSB were more than $90 per thousand lower than they were in second quarter 2013. This overall improvement highlights the significant contribution operational excellence is making to our business results. 
I will now turn to our -- to discontinued operations, Chart 11. As I previously mentioned [indiscernible] our entire Cellulose Fiber segment is being reported as discontinued operations. This includes results from our pulp mill, liquid packaging board facility, and a printing papers joint venture. Discontinued operations contributed $52 million to pretax earnings compared with $29 million in the first quarter. Average sales realizations for pulp and liquid packaging rose compared with first quarter and sales volumes for liquid packaging increased. Maintenance and energy costs declined slightly. 
Second quarter results also reflect accounting changes resulting from the reclassification as discontinued operations. Noncash depreciation expense decreased by $23 million compared with first quarter, due to a requirement to seek depreciation on assets held for sale and corporate overhead expense previously allocated to cellulose fiber is now reported in unallocated items. This change affects both current and prior periods. These expenses total approximately $9 million per quarter or approximately $35 million on an annual basis. The effect of these accounting changes was largely offset by charges associated with the strategic review process and other transaction expenses. 
Yesterday, we received Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance in the U.S. for the announced sale of our pulp mills to International Paper. We continue to make progress through remaining regulatory approvals, primarily competition clearance and several foreign jurisdictions. We intend to pay closing the transaction in the fourth quarter. Similarly, we have received Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance for the sale of our liquid packaging business and continue to progress with remaining approvals. We expect to close the liquid packaging transaction in the third quarter.
The process for our printing papers joint venture is proceeding well. We are actively working with prospective buyers and we will update you when that review is complete. I want to thank our Cellulose Fibers employees for maintaining their focus on operating safely and delivering strong results throughout the strategic review and sale processes. 
I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook."
107633,372217749,1027239,"Weyerhaeuser Co., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the third quarter is presented in slide -- Chart 14 of the earnings slides. For Timberlands, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will decline slightly for roughly 5% compared to the second quarter du",1105,"Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the third quarter is presented in slide -- Chart 14 of the earnings slides. For Timberlands, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will decline slightly for roughly 5% compared to the second quarter due to seasonality and lower export prices. In our Western Timberland operations, overall, we expect harvest volumes to be similar to second quarter levels. Although Japanese housing activity remains strong, we anticipate prices will soften us markets adjust to the delayed increase in the consumption tax. In China, seasonally slower construction activity and continued currency headwinds will result in lower sales volumes and moderately lower pricing. 
Domestic log volumes and prices are expected to remain stable. Operating conditions throughout the Western region have been favorable as the risk of fire has been low. Western logging costs will be seasonally higher in the third quarter as summer weather allows us to ship harvest activities to higher elevations, which have a higher percentage of cable logging and longer haul distances. In the South, fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly higher than the second quarter. But on a lower grade mix as third quarter activity typically includes a higher percentage of sitting volume. Silviculture and growth spending will also be seasonally higher. 
In the North, third quarter harvest volumes will be significantly higher than the prior quarter. Note that second quarter harvests are the lowest of the year because of logging and hauling limitations due to spring breakup or as they like to say in the northern woods, the mud season. We expect average sales realizations will be similar to second quarter levels. In Real Estate in energy and natural resources segment, we expect significantly higher earnings and adjusted EBITDA from Real Estate sales during the second half of the year, nearly all this improvement will occur in the fourth quarter.
Third quarter real estate activity will be primarily focused on continuing work on the ABO process and building our inventory of higher and better use properties. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will increase slightly compared to the second quarter with a mix of Real Estate sales slightly heavier to higher basis lands. In the fourth quarter, we expect EBITDA will be more than double the third quarter level as the first results of AVO assessments in the portions of the U.S. South are taken to market and begin to move through to closing. 
For Wood Products, inventories throughout the supply chain remain tight as buyers continue to only purchase product to meet their immediate needs, which has been pushing lumber and OSB pricing higher as we enter the third quarter. We're anticipating comparable sales volumes and continued strength in lumber and OSB pricing in the third quarter as housing starts, especially single-family, continue to improve and builders move into the late summer building season. 
We expect to see continued solid performance in engineered Wood Products. Overall, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA and earnings for the Wood Products segment will be considerably higher than second quarter. Lumber and OSB prices improved throughout July. If prices stabilized at current levels for the balance of the quarter, the segment is on track to improve EBITDA and earnings by roughly 10% compared with second quarter. However, we believe there's continued upside for both lumber and OSB prices and anticipate earnings could exceed this level. 
Now let me direct your attention to Chart 10, which details the major components of our unallocated items. The contribution to earnings before special items was $1 million, $9 million lower than the first quarter results, which included the $13 million gain on foreign exchange. Note that unallocated corporate function expenses now include approximately $9 million of cost that were recorded in Cellulose Fibers segment prior to the discontinued operations reclassification. 
Chart 12 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $485 million, up $74 million from the first quarter. Cash flow from operations, including Cellulose Fibers, was $492 million for the second quarter. This is an increase of $445 million over the first quarter, which is typically the lowest cash flow quarter of the year. In addition to increased cash flows from Wood Products and Timberland segments, we saw a positive variance in our working capital due to the seasonal decrease in inventory levels quarter-over-quarter. Cash from investing activities was a positive $350 million for the quarter as we received $440 million in cash proceeds from the Twin Creeks transaction, which closed on April 1. 
Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $101 million, including $12 million of our discontinued operations. We expect 2016 CapEx from our continuing operations will be approximately $425 million, with Timberlands capital spending expected to total about $125 million for the year and wood products spending of approximately $300 million. 
Financing cash flows included $831 million 4 share repurchases and $228 million for common dividends. As of June 30, we've drawn $1.4 billion of a $2.5 billion available under the term loan facilities. Long-term debt, not including the term loan balance of $1.4 billion, was $6.6 billion at the end of the second quarter. We intend to pay down the term loans for the proceeds from our recently announced asset sales. 
Interest expense of $114 million for the second quarter reflects a full quarter of interest for both the Plum Creek legacy debt and the new term loans. We expect interest expense will be comparable in the third quarter. For our continuing operations, the company anticipates the full year tax rate will be between 18% and 20% based on the expected mix of REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary income. 
I'll wrap up with Chart 13, which provides some additional detail on our share count and share repurchase activities. Through the end of the second quarter, we have repurchased 58 million shares of common stock under our February 2016 share repurchase program at an average price of $29.18 per share. 
We have continued our repurchase activity during the third quarter. And as of August 1, our cumulative repurchases totaled $1.98 billion or nearly 67 million shares at an average price of $29.45. The company did not repurchase shares during the period June 1 through June 28 because of the measurement period for our mandatory convertible preference shares. The mandatory convertible preference shares converted to common shares on July 1 at a rate of approximately 1.69 common shares per preference share. As a result, common shares outstanding increased by approximately 23.2 million shares subsequent to quarter end. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions."

I'm encouraged by the teamwork I see among employees at all levels as we work together to service our customers, identify best practices and implement improved processes for our merged company. 
We have fully identified the sources of the $100 million of hard dollar cost synergies. As of the end of the second quarter, we are capturing about 1/3 of these reductions on a run-rate basis. I'm highly confident we will reach our $100 million run rate cost synergy target by the end of Year 1. 
In addition to capturing merger synergies, we must address the $35 million of corporate costs formerly allocated to the Cellulose Fibers segment. To ensure our businesses remained competitive, we will eliminate these costs just as we did following the divestiture of our homebuilding business. We've been planning for the reduction as part of the strategic review process and anticipate eliminating these costs within 12 months after closing the International Paper transaction. 
In closing, I will mention that the move to our new Seattle headquarters remains on track for mid-September. I'm also pleased to announce that we will be holding an Investor Day in New York on Tuesday, December 13. We will send out the details and a press release later this morning. At that meeting, we will provide specific updates on progress against the key targets for our merged company and you will have the -- an opportunity to hear first-hand from each of our business leaders about the key initiatives as we work together to drive superior value for our shareholders.

This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter net earnings of $157 million or $0.21 per diluted share on net sales from continuing operations of $1.7 billion. Second quarter results include after-tax earnings of",1636,"Thank you, Beth and Welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter net earnings of $157 million or $0.21 per diluted share on net sales from continuing operations of $1.7 billion. Second quarter results include after-tax earnings of $38 million from discontinued operations and $11 million of after-tax charges for merger and legal expenses. Results for our entire Cellulose Fibers segment are reported as discontinued operations. Excluding discontinued operations and special items, we earned $130 million or $0.17 per diluted share. 
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA from our continuing operations was $413 million, and this represents an improvement of $77 million or 23% compared with first quarter results. I'm proud of our second quarter operating performance. Our teams continued to execute well and delivered solid operating results, including Wood Products' strongest second quarter in over a decade. In the quarter, we also announced the sale of our pulp mill and liquid packaging board facility for collective proceeds of $2.5 billion or approximately $1.8 billion after-tax; closed the Twin Creeks transactions, receiving $440 million in cash and a transaction valuing 260,000 acres of Southern Timberlands at $2,150 per-acre. 
We purchased over $830 million worth of our common shares and made strong progress on merger integration activities as we work together to successfully integrate Plum Creek and fully capture the cost and operational synergies that will drive superior value for our shareholders.
Before I turn to our second quarter business results, let me make some brief comments about the housing market. Single-family housing starts continued to grow at double-digit rate and year-to-date activity remains in line with our expectations. Through June, single-family starts had improved 15% compared with 2015 on a seasonally adjusted basis and total U.S. starts were up 8%. 
Although supply side constraints such as skilled labor, permitting delays and fees, and rising manning [ph] construction costs dampened the market's acceleration during the second quarter, solid economic fundamentals, including job growth and historically low mortgage rates continue to drive improving housing demand. We continue to anticipate approximately 1.2 million housing starts for 2016, in line with consensus estimates. 
Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands, Charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $125 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA for Timberlands increased by $21 million to $220 million. Noncash depletion and amortization costs increased by $25 million following a full quarter of higher depletion rates resulting from acquisition accounting. 
Western Timberlands contributed $114 million to second quarter EBITDA compared with $118 million in the first quarter. Western Sea harbor's volumes increased, but average realizations for Western logs declined modestly, primarily due to a greater proportion of sales to domestic and Chinese markets. As anticipated, sales volumes to Japan declined in the second quarter as first quarter pulled forward demand in advance of its scheduled consumption tax increase, which was later delayed. Pricing for our Japanese logs moderated slightly in the quarter. Volumes to China rose due to seasonally higher construction activity and average log realizations were essentially flat. Log inventories at Chinese ports were little changed in the quarter and remain at normalized levels. 
In Western domestic markets, log supply and demand remained balanced during the quarter. Average realizations declined slightly due to mix and per unit logging costs increased seasonally as second quarter harvest includes a greater proportion of higher elevation white wood. 
Southern Timberlands contributed $99 million to second quarter EBITDA, $22 million more than the first quarter. Southern fee harvest volumes increased by 40% due to a full quarter of Plum Creek operations. Realizations for southern logs declined slightly due to mix as second quarter sales included a higher percentage of pulp wood. Silviculture and forestry cost increased due to catch up on first quarter activity that has been delayed due to wet weather. 
Northern Timberlands EBITDA improved slightly compared to the first quarter. 
The Timberlands business remains relentlessly focused on capturing operational excellence and is on track to achieve its $30 million to $50 million operational excellence targets for 2016. During the quarter, internal benchmarking teams completed an initial survey of operational synergy opportunities and prioritized areas with the greatest potential value. A deep-dive comparison of each company's practices and their highest value areas is underway. We are pleased with the progress to date and look forward to capturing these opportunities later this year and into 2017. 
Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, Charts 6 and 7. Real Estate and ENR contributed $12 million to second quarter earnings compared with $15 million in the first quarter. EBITDA for the second quarter totaled $28 million. For Real Estate, the number of acres sold declined slightly due to the timing of transaction closings. Average price per acre increased as second quarter included the sale of a high-value parcel in Cannon Beach, Oregon. 
EBITDA from Energy and Natural Resources operations improved slightly. 
Our Real Estate team is running full all out as they apply Plum Creek's asset value optimization or ABO process to the legacy Weyerhaeuser Timberlands. This work is proceeding well and we continue to anticipate the process will be substantially complete in early 2017. We expect Real Estate activity will ramp up significantly in the fourth quarter of this year and into 2017, as this process moves toward conclusion. 
Wood Products, Charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $156 million to second quarter earnings, an improvement of 80% compared with first quarter. By effectively capitalizing on improving markets and ongoing operational excellence initiatives, the business delivered its strongest second quarter since 2005. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased to $189 million, $72 million more than the first quarter. EBITDA from lumber rose to $96 million. This is an improvement of $45 million or nearly 90% compared with the first quarter. Average realizations improved nearly 10% and sales volume increased by 8%. 
The business also had another strong quarter operationally. Western log costs declined and recovery improved and manufacturing cost net of logs decreased due to the continued benefit of operational excellence initiatives. 
OSB contributed $43 million to EBITDA, $12 million more than the first quarter. Average sales realizations increased 12% and our mills continued to run well. 
Engineered Wood Products' EBITDA increased to $45 million, $14 million more than the first quarter. Sales volume rose due to seasonally higher demand and a full quarter of Plum Creek, MDS and plywood operations. Average realizations for solid section and I-Joist declined slightly due to mix. 
In distribution, EBITDA rose $5 million compared with first quarter due to improved sales volume, higher margins and ongoing cost control. The business has increased EBITDA by $14 million year-to-date against their 2016 full year target of $15 million to $20 million. 
Later in the quarter, we announced changes to improve the profitability of our Montana Wood Product operations. In the third quarter, we will permanently close the lumber and plywood mill in Columbia Falls. These moves will allow us to align the available log supply with our manufacturing capacity, including adding shifts at our Kalispell facilities and best position our Montana operations for long-term success. 
Wood Products remains relentlessly focused on OpEx initiatives and is on track to achieve its 2016 target. During our first quarter earnings call, we indicated we thought second quarter Wood Products' results could be comparable to second quarter 2013, a time when we were just beginning our OpEx journey and lumber and OSB pricing was significantly higher than it is today. In fact, we exceeded second quarter 2013 EBITDA by $23 million despite the fact that average lumber realizations in the second quarter were $35 per thousand lower than 3 years ago and average realizations for OSB were more than $90 per thousand lower than they were in second quarter 2013. This overall improvement highlights the significant contribution operational excellence is making to our business results. 
I will now turn to our -- to discontinued operations, Chart 11. As I previously mentioned [indiscernible] our entire Cellulose Fiber segment is being reported as discontinued operations. This includes results from our pulp mill, a liquid packaging board facility and a printing papers joint venture. Discontinued operations contributed $52 million to pretax earnings compared with $29 million in the first quarter. Average sales realizations for pulp and liquid packaging rose compared with first quarter and sales volumes for liquid packaging increased. Maintenance and energy costs declined slightly. 
Second quarter results also reflect accounting changes resulting from the reclassification as discontinued operations. Noncash depreciation expense decreased by $23 million compared with first quarter, due to a requirement to seek depreciation on assets held for sale. And corporate overhead expense previously allocated to cellulose fiber is now reported in unallocated items. This change affects both current and prior periods. These expenses total approximately $9 million per quarter or approximately $35 million on an annual basis. The effect of these accounting changes was largely offset by charges associated with the strategic review process and other transaction expenses. 
Yesterday, we received Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance in the U.S. for the announced sale of our pulp mills to International Paper. We continue to make progress through remaining regulatory approvals, primarily competition clearance and several foreign jurisdictions. We anticipate closing the transaction in the fourth quarter. 
Similarly, we have received Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance for the sale of our liquid packaging business and continue to progress with remaining approvals. We expect to close the liquid packaging transaction in the third quarter.
The process for our printing papers joint venture is proceeding well. We are actively working with prospective buyers and we will update you when that review is complete. 
I want to thank our Cellulose Fibers employees for maintaining their focus on operating safely and delivering strong results throughout the strategic review and sale processes. 
I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook."
107633,372217749,1027497,"Weyerhaeuser Co., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the third quarter is presented in slide -- Chart 14 of the earnings slides. For Timberlands, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will decline slightly or roughly 5% compared to the second quarter due",1105,"Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the third quarter is presented in slide -- Chart 14 of the earnings slides. For Timberlands, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will decline slightly or roughly 5% compared to the second quarter due to seasonality and lower export prices. In our Western Timberland operations, overall, we expect harvest volumes to be similar to second quarter levels. Although Japanese housing activity remains strong, we anticipate prices will soften as markets adjust to the delayed increase in the consumption tax. In China, seasonally slower construction activity and continued currency headwinds will result in lower sales volumes and moderately lower pricing. 
Domestic log volumes and prices are expected to remain stable. Operating conditions throughout the Western region have been favorable as the risk of fire has been low. Western logging costs will be seasonally higher in the third quarter as summer weather allows us to ship harvest activities to higher elevations, which have a higher percentage of cable logging and longer haul distances. In the South, fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly higher than the second quarter, but on a lower grade mix as third quarter activity typically includes a higher percentage of sitting volume. Silviculture and growth spending will also be seasonally higher. 
In the North, third quarter harvest volumes will be significantly higher than the prior quarter. Note that second quarter harvests are the lowest of the year because of logging and hauling limitations due to spring breakup or as they like to say in the northern woods, the mud season. We expect average sales realizations will be similar to second quarter levels. 
In Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources segment, we expect significantly higher earnings and adjusted EBITDA from Real Estate sales during the second half of the year; nearly all this improvement will occur in the fourth quarter.
Third quarter Real Estate activity will be primarily focused on continuing work on the AVO process and building our inventory of higher and better use properties. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will increase slightly compared to the second quarter, with the mix of Real Estate sales slightly heavier to higher basis lands. In the fourth quarter, we expect EBITDA will be more than double the third quarter level as the first results of AVO assessments in the portions of the U.S. South are taken to market and begin to move through to closing. 
For Wood Products, inventories throughout the supply chain remain tight as buyers continue to only purchase product to meet their immediate needs, which has been pushing lumber and OSB pricing higher as we enter the third quarter. We're anticipating comparable sales volumes and continued strength in lumber and OSB pricing in the third quarter as housing starts, especially single-family, continue to improve and builders move into the late summer building season. 
We expect to see continued solid performance in engineered Wood Products. Overall, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA and earnings for the Wood Products segment will be considerably higher than second quarter. Lumber and OSB prices improved throughout July. If prices stabilize at current levels for the balance of the quarter, the segment is on track to improve EBITDA and earnings by roughly 10% compared with second quarter. However, we believe there's continued upside for both lumber and OSB prices and anticipate earnings could exceed this level. 
Now let me direct your attention to Chart 10, which details the major components of our unallocated items. The contribution to earnings before special items was $1 million, $9 million lower than the first quarter results, which included a $13 million gain on foreign exchange. Note that unallocated corporate function expenses now include approximately $9 million of cost that were recorded in Cellulose Fibers segment prior to the discontinued operations reclassification. 
Chart 12 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $485 million, up $74 million from the first quarter. Cash flow from operations, including Cellulose Fibers, was $492 million for the second quarter. This is an increase of $445 million over the first quarter, which is typically the lowest cash flow quarter of the year. In addition to increased cash flows from Wood Products and Timberland segments, we saw a positive variance in our working capital due to the seasonal decrease in inventory levels quarter-over-quarter. Cash from investing activities was a positive $350 million for the quarter as we received $440 million in cash proceeds from the Twin Creeks transaction, which closed on April 1. 
Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $101 million, including $12 million of our discontinued operations. We expect 2016 CapEx for our continuing operations will be approximately $425 million, with Timberlands' capital spending expected to total about $125 million for the year and Wood Products' spending of approximately $300 million. 
Financing cash flows included $831 million for share repurchases and $228 million for common dividends. As of June 30, we've drawn $1.4 billion of a $2.5 billion available under the term loan facilities. Long-term debt, not including the term loan balance of $1.4 billion, was $6.6 billion at the end of the second quarter. We intend to pay down the term loans with the proceeds from our recently announced asset sales. 
Interest expense of $114 million for the second quarter reflects a full quarter of interest for both the Plum Creek legacy debt and the new term loans. We expect interest expense will be comparable in the third quarter. 
For our continuing operations, the company anticipates the full year tax rate will be between 18% and 20% based on the expected mix of REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary income. 
I'll wrap up with Chart 13, which provides some additional detail on our share count and share repurchase activities. Through the end of the second quarter, we have repurchased 58 million shares of common stock under our February 2016 share repurchase program at an average price of $29.18 per share. 
We have continued our repurchase activity during the third quarter. And as of August 1, our cumulative repurchases totaled $1.98 billion or nearly 67 million shares at an average price of $29.45. The company did not repurchase shares during the period June 1 through June 28 because of the measurement period for our mandatory convertible preference shares. The mandatory convertible preference shares converted to common shares on July 1 at a rate of approximately 1.69 common shares per preference share. As a result, common shares outstanding increased by approximately 23.2 million shares subsequent to quarter end. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions."

I'm encouraged by the teamwork I see among employees at all levels as we work together to service our customers, identify best practices and implement improved processes for our merged company. 
We have fully identified the sources of the $100 million of hard dollar cost synergies. As of the end of the second quarter, we are capturing about 1/3 of these reductions on a run-rate basis. I'm highly confident we will reach our $100 million run rate cost synergy target by the end of year one.
In addition to capturing merger synergies, we must address the $35 million of corporate costs formerly allocated to the Cellulose Fibers segment. To ensure our businesses remain competitive, we will eliminate these costs just as we did following the divestiture of our homebuilding business. We've been planning for the reduction as part of the strategic review process and anticipate eliminating these costs within 12 months after closing the International Paper transaction. 
In closing, I will mention that the move to our new Seattle headquarters remains on track for mid-September. 
I'm also pleased to announce that we will be holding an Investor Day in New York on Tuesday, December 13. We will send out the details and a press release later this morning. At that meeting, we will provide specific updates on progress against the key targets for our merged company and you will have the -- an opportunity to hear first-hand from each of our business leaders about their key initiatives as we work together to drive superior value for our shareholders.

This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter net earnings of $157 million or $0.21 per diluted share on net sales from continuing operations of $1.7 billion. Second quarter results include after-tax earnings of",1636,"Thank you, Beth and Welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter net earnings of $157 million or $0.21 per diluted share on net sales from continuing operations of $1.7 billion. Second quarter results include after-tax earnings of $38 million from discontinued operations and $11 million of after-tax charges for merger and legal expenses. Results for our entire Cellulose Fibers segment are reported as discontinued operations. Excluding discontinued operations and special items, we earned $130 million or $0.17 per diluted share. 
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA from our continuing operations was $413 million, and this represents an improvement of $77 million or 23% compared with first quarter results. I'm proud of our second quarter operating performance. Our teams continued to execute well and delivered solid operating results, including Wood Products' strongest second quarter in over a decade. In the quarter, we also announced the sale of our pulp mill and liquid packaging board facility for collective proceeds of $2.5 billion or approximately $1.8 billion after-tax; closed the Twin Creeks transactions, receiving $440 million in cash and a transaction valuing 260,000 acres of Southern Timberlands at $2,150 per-acre. 
We purchased over $830 million worth of our common shares and made strong progress on merger integration activities as we work together to successfully integrate Plum Creek and fully capture the cost and operational synergies that will drive superior value for our shareholders.
Before I turn to our second quarter business results, let me make some brief comments about the housing market. Single-family housing starts continued to grow at double-digit rate and year-to-date activity remains in line with our expectations. Through June, single-family starts had improved 15% compared with 2015 on a seasonally adjusted basis and total U.S. starts were up 8%. 
Although supply side constraints such as skilled labor, permitting delays and fees, and rising manning [ph] construction costs dampened the market's acceleration during the second quarter, solid economic fundamentals, including job growth and historically low mortgage rates continue to drive improving housing demand. We continue to anticipate approximately 1.2 million housing starts for 2016, in line with consensus estimates. 
Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands, Charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $125 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA for Timberlands increased by $21 million to $220 million. Noncash depletion and amortization costs increased by $25 million following a full quarter of higher depletion rates resulting from acquisition accounting. 
Western Timberlands contributed $114 million to second quarter EBITDA compared with $118 million in the first quarter. Western Sea harbor's volumes increased, but average realizations for Western logs declined modestly, primarily due to a greater proportion of sales to domestic and Chinese markets. As anticipated, sales volumes to Japan declined in the second quarter as first quarter pulled forward demand in advance of its scheduled consumption tax increase, which was later delayed. Pricing for our Japanese logs moderated slightly in the quarter. Volumes to China rose due to seasonally higher construction activity and average log realizations were essentially flat. Log inventories at Chinese ports were little changed in the quarter and remain at normalized levels. 
In Western domestic markets, log supply and demand remained balanced during the quarter. Average realizations declined slightly due to mix and per unit logging costs increased seasonally as second quarter harvest includes a greater proportion of higher elevation white wood. 
Southern Timberlands contributed $99 million to second quarter EBITDA, $22 million more than the first quarter. Southern fee harvest volumes increased by 40% due to a full quarter of Plum Creek operations. Realizations for southern logs declined slightly due to mix as second quarter sales included a higher percentage of pulp wood. Silviculture and forestry cost increased due to catch up on first quarter activity that has been delayed due to wet weather. 
Northern Timberlands EBITDA improved slightly compared to the first quarter. 
The Timberlands business remains relentlessly focused on capturing operational excellence and is on track to achieve its $30 million to $50 million operational excellence targets for 2016. During the quarter, internal benchmarking teams completed an initial survey of operational synergy opportunities and prioritized areas with the greatest potential value. A deep-dive comparison of each company's practices and their highest value areas is underway. We are pleased with the progress to date and look forward to capturing these opportunities later this year and into 2017. 
Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, Charts 6 and 7. Real Estate and ENR contributed $12 million to second quarter earnings compared with $15 million in the first quarter. EBITDA for the second quarter totaled $28 million. For Real Estate, the number of acres sold declined slightly due to the timing of transaction closings. Average price per acre increased as second quarter included the sale of a high-value parcel in Cannon Beach, Oregon. 
EBITDA from Energy and Natural Resources operations improved slightly. 
Our Real Estate team is running full all out as they apply Plum Creek's asset value optimization or ABO process to the legacy Weyerhaeuser Timberlands. This work is proceeding well and we continue to anticipate the process will be substantially complete in early 2017. We expect Real Estate activity will ramp up significantly in the fourth quarter of this year and into 2017, as this process moves toward conclusion. 
Wood Products, Charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $156 million to second quarter earnings, an improvement of 80% compared with first quarter. By effectively capitalizing on improving markets and ongoing operational excellence initiatives, the business delivered its strongest second quarter since 2005. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased to $189 million, $72 million more than the first quarter. EBITDA from lumber rose to $96 million. This is an improvement of $45 million or nearly 90% compared with the first quarter. Average realizations improved nearly 10% and sales volume increased by 8%. 
The business also had another strong quarter operationally. Western log costs declined and recovery improved and manufacturing cost net of logs decreased due to the continued benefit of operational excellence initiatives. 
OSB contributed $43 million to EBITDA, $12 million more than the first quarter. Average sales realizations increased 12% and our mills continued to run well. 
Engineered Wood Products' EBITDA increased to $45 million, $14 million more than the first quarter. Sales volume rose due to seasonally higher demand and a full quarter of Plum Creek, MDS and plywood operations. Average realizations for solid section and I-Joist declined slightly due to mix. 
In distribution, EBITDA rose $5 million compared with first quarter due to improved sales volume, higher margins and ongoing cost control. The business has increased EBITDA by $14 million year-to-date against their 2016 full year target of $15 million to $20 million. 
Later in the quarter, we announced changes to improve the profitability of our Montana Wood Product operations. In the third quarter, we will permanently close the lumber and plywood mill in Columbia Falls. These moves will allow us to align the available log supply with our manufacturing capacity, including adding shifts at our Kalispell facilities and best position our Montana operations for long-term success. 
Wood Products remains relentlessly focused on OpEx initiatives and is on track to achieve its 2016 target. During our first quarter earnings call, we indicated we thought second quarter Wood Products' results could be comparable to second quarter 2013, a time when we were just beginning our OpEx journey and lumber and OSB pricing was significantly higher than it is today. In fact, we exceeded second quarter 2013 EBITDA by $23 million despite the fact that average lumber realizations in the second quarter were $35 per thousand lower than 3 years ago and average realizations for OSB were more than $90 per thousand lower than they were in second quarter 2013. This overall improvement highlights the significant contribution operational excellence is making to our business results. 
I will now turn to our -- to discontinued operations, Chart 11. As I previously mentioned [indiscernible] our entire Cellulose Fiber segment is being reported as discontinued operations. This includes results from our pulp mill, a liquid packaging board facility and a printing papers joint venture. Discontinued operations contributed $52 million to pretax earnings compared with $29 million in the first quarter. Average sales realizations for pulp and liquid packaging rose compared with first quarter and sales volumes for liquid packaging increased. Maintenance and energy costs declined slightly. 
Second quarter results also reflect accounting changes resulting from the reclassification as discontinued operations. Noncash depreciation expense decreased by $23 million compared with first quarter, due to a requirement to seek depreciation on assets held for sale. And corporate overhead expense previously allocated to cellulose fiber is now reported in unallocated items. This change affects both current and prior periods. These expenses total approximately $9 million per quarter or approximately $35 million on an annual basis. The effect of these accounting changes was largely offset by charges associated with the strategic review process and other transaction expenses. 
Yesterday, we received Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance in the U.S. for the announced sale of our pulp mills to International Paper. We continue to make progress through remaining regulatory approvals, primarily competition clearance and several foreign jurisdictions. We anticipate closing the transaction in the fourth quarter. 
Similarly, we have received Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance for the sale of our liquid packaging business and continue to progress with remaining approvals. We expect to close the liquid packaging transaction in the third quarter.
The process for our printing papers joint venture is proceeding well. We are actively working with prospective buyers and we will update you when that review is complete. 
I want to thank our Cellulose Fibers employees for maintaining their focus on operating safely and delivering strong results throughout the strategic review and sale processes. 
I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook."
107633,372217749,1028938,"Weyerhaeuser Co., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Weyerhaeuser Company","Executives","Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the third quarter is presented in slide -- Chart 14 of the earnings slides. For Timberlands, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will decline slightly or roughly 5% compared to the second quarter due",1105,"Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the third quarter is presented in slide -- Chart 14 of the earnings slides. For Timberlands, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will decline slightly or roughly 5% compared to the second quarter due to seasonality and lower export prices. In our Western Timberland operations, overall, we expect harvest volumes to be similar to second quarter levels. Although Japanese housing activity remains strong, we anticipate prices will soften as markets adjust to the delayed increase in the consumption tax. In China, seasonally slower construction activity and continued currency headwinds will result in lower sales volumes and moderately lower pricing. 
Domestic log volumes and prices are expected to remain stable. Operating conditions throughout the Western region have been favorable as the risk of fire has been low. Western logging costs will be seasonally higher in the third quarter as summer weather allows us to ship harvest activities to higher elevations, which have a higher percentage of cable logging and longer haul distances. In the South, fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly higher than the second quarter, but on a lower grade mix as third quarter activity typically includes a higher percentage of sitting volume. Silviculture and growth spending will also be seasonally higher. 
In the North, third quarter harvest volumes will be significantly higher than the prior quarter. Note that second quarter harvests are the lowest of the year because of logging and hauling limitations due to spring breakup or as they like to say in the northern woods, the mud season. We expect average sales realizations will be similar to second quarter levels. 
In Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources segment, we expect significantly higher earnings and adjusted EBITDA from Real Estate sales during the second half of the year; nearly all this improvement will occur in the fourth quarter.
Third quarter Real Estate activity will be primarily focused on continuing work on the AVO process and building our inventory of higher and better use properties. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will increase slightly compared to the second quarter, with the mix of Real Estate sales slightly heavier to higher basis lands. In the fourth quarter, we expect EBITDA will be more than double the third quarter level as the first results of AVO assessments in the portions of the U.S. South are taken to market and begin to move through to closing. 
For Wood Products, inventories throughout the supply chain remain tight as buyers continue to only purchase product to meet their immediate needs, which has been pushing lumber and OSB pricing higher as we enter the third quarter. We're anticipating comparable sales volumes and continued strength in lumber and OSB pricing in the third quarter as housing starts, especially single-family, continue to improve and builders move into the late summer building season. 
We expect to see continued solid performance in engineered Wood Products. Overall, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA and earnings for the Wood Products segment will be considerably higher than second quarter. Lumber and OSB prices improved throughout July. If prices stabilize at current levels for the balance of the quarter, the segment is on track to improve EBITDA and earnings by roughly 10% compared with second quarter. However, we believe there's continued upside for both lumber and OSB prices and anticipate earnings could exceed this level. 
Now let me direct your attention to Chart 10, which details the major components of our unallocated items. The contribution to earnings before special items was $1 million, $9 million lower than the first quarter results, which included a $13 million gain on foreign exchange. Note that unallocated corporate function expenses now include approximately $9 million of cost that were recorded in Cellulose Fibers segment prior to the discontinued operations reclassification. 
Chart 12 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $485 million, up $74 million from the first quarter. Cash flow from operations, including Cellulose Fibers, was $492 million for the second quarter. This is an increase of $445 million over the first quarter, which is typically the lowest cash flow quarter of the year. In addition to increased cash flows from Wood Products and Timberland segments, we saw a positive variance in our working capital due to the seasonal decrease in inventory levels quarter-over-quarter. Cash from investing activities was a positive $350 million for the quarter as we received $440 million in cash proceeds from the Twin Creeks transaction, which closed on April 1. 
Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $101 million, including $12 million of our discontinued operations. We expect 2016 CapEx for our continuing operations will be approximately $425 million, with Timberlands' capital spending expected to total about $125 million for the year and Wood Products' spending of approximately $300 million. 
Financing cash flows included $831 million for share repurchases and $228 million for common dividends. As of June 30, we've drawn $1.4 billion of a $2.5 billion available under the term loan facilities. Long-term debt, not including the term loan balance of $1.4 billion, was $6.6 billion at the end of the second quarter. We intend to pay down the term loans with the proceeds from our recently announced asset sales. 
Interest expense of $114 million for the second quarter reflects a full quarter of interest for both the Plum Creek legacy debt and the new term loans. We expect interest expense will be comparable in the third quarter. 
For our continuing operations, the company anticipates the full year tax rate will be between 18% and 20% based on the expected mix of REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary income. 
I'll wrap up with Chart 13, which provides some additional detail on our share count and share repurchase activities. Through the end of the second quarter, we have repurchased 58 million shares of common stock under our February 2016 share repurchase program at an average price of $29.18 per share. 
We have continued our repurchase activity during the third quarter. And as of August 1, our cumulative repurchases totaled $1.98 billion or nearly 67 million shares at an average price of $29.45. The company did not repurchase shares during the period June 1 through June 28 because of the measurement period for our mandatory convertible preference shares. The mandatory convertible preference shares converted to common shares on July 1 at a rate of approximately 1.69 common shares per preference share. As a result, common shares outstanding increased by approximately 23.2 million shares subsequent to quarter end. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions."

I will wrap up this morning with some brief comments on integration, synergies and SG&A. We continue to make strong progress on merger integration. I'm encouraged by the teamwork I see among employees at all levels as we work together to service our customers, identify best practices and implement improved processes for our merged company. 
We have fully identified the sources of the $100 million of hard dollar cost synergies. As of the end of the second quarter, we are capturing about 1/3 of these reductions on a run-rate basis. I'm highly confident we will reach our $100 million run rate cost synergy target by the end of year one.
In addition to capturing merger synergies, we must address the $35 million of corporate costs formerly allocated to the Cellulose Fibers segment. To ensure our businesses remain competitive, we will eliminate these costs just as we did following the divestiture of our homebuilding business. We've been planning for the reduction as part of the strategic review process and anticipate eliminating these costs within 12 months after closing the International Paper transaction. 
In closing, I will mention that the move to our new Seattle headquarters remains on track for mid-September. 
I'm also pleased to announce that we will be holding an Investor Day in New York on Tuesday, December 13. We will send out the details and a press release later this morning. At that meeting, we will provide specific updates on progress against the key targets for our merged company and you will have the -- an opportunity to hear first-hand from each of our business leaders about their key initiatives as we work together to drive superior value for our shareholders.

So that's allocated and tax affected accordingly, and then there's debt associated with the REIT asset so you'll get a blended rate."

This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter net earnings of $227 million or $0.30 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Our third quarter results include after-tax earnings of $65 million from discontinued operations and $10 million of after-tax charges for merger-related expenses. Excluding these items, we earned $172 million or $0.23 per diluted share. This is an improvement of over 30% compared with second quarter and over 40% compared with the year ago. 
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $434 million, an improvement of $21 million compared with the second quarter. Our employees delivered strong performance in the quarter as operating results improved across each of our businesses with Timberlands driving increased EBITDA through merger synergies and Wood Products achieving its highest third quarter earnings in 12 years. 
However, these results reflect only some of our quarterly achievements as we also closed the sale of our liquid packaging board business, completed the move to our new corporate headquarters in Seattle and completed our commitment to a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase. I'm proud of what our team's accomplished and the pace at which they continue to operate as we work together to be the world's premier timber, land and forest products company.
Before turning to our business results, let me make a few brief comments regarding the housing market. Third quarter housing activity was roughly in line with our expectations, and we are anticipating nearly 1.2 million housing starts for 2016, in line with consensus estimates. Although total housing starts for September were weaker than expected, the headline number was driven by the volatile multifamily sector. Single-family starts have continued to grow at a favorable pace. Through September, single-family starts were up approximately 10% compared with 2015 on a seasonally adjusted basis, and low inventories of homes for sale reflect continued steady demand.
As we enter the seasonally weaker fourth quarter, we're encouraged by the strength of September permitting activity, new home sales and continued solid builder confidence. Although constraints such as skilled labor, permit delays and fees and rising costs for land and construction may be functioning as a governor on supply side growth, rising employment and wages and favorable mortgage rates continue to drive improving housing demand.
Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands, Charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $122 million to third quarter earnings and $223 million to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $3 million compared with the second quarter. Western Timberlands contributed $109 million to third quarter EBITDA compared with $114 million in the second quarter. Western fee harvest volumes decreased and average log realizations were largely flat. 
Sales volumes to Japan improved moderately during the quarter as low mortgage rates continued to drive strong housing activity and the effect of the delay in the consumption tax increase continued to fade. Average realizations for Japanese logs declined slightly early in the quarter but stabilized as the quarter progressed. Sales volumes to China decreased due to timing of shipments and a slight seasonal decline in demand, and average realization has decreased modestly. Log inventories to Chinese ports declined during the quarter and remain within a normalized range.
Western domestic markets remained solid during the quarter, and pricing for domestic logs improved marginally as some markets were tensioned by fire-related harvest restrictions and increased mill demand. Western logging costs benefited from operational excellence initiatives during the quarter. Although we anticipated a seasonal increase in per unit logging costs due to the harvest at higher-elevation stands, [indiscernible] were able to mitigate this cost increase through new harvesting technology that improves productivity on steep slopes and reduces the need for the highest cost cable logging operations.
Southern Timberlands contributed $108 million to third quarter EBITDA, $9 million more than the second quarter. Seasonally higher log sales volumes were partially offset by seasonally higher silviculture and forestry costs and a 1% decrease in average log price realizations. This decline was partially attributable to mix as third quarter harvest included a slightly higher proportion of pulpwood. Southern logging costs benefited from operational synergies with merger integration progress enabling further optimization of logging and hauling activities across the combined ownership.
Northern Timberlands EBITDA improved $3 million compared with the second quarter. Seasonally higher volumes were partially offset by weaker realizations and seasonally higher road and forestry expense. 
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced a strategic review of our Uruguay operations. This review will enable us to ensure that we are best positioning the business for long-term success and maximizing value for our shareholders. We look forward to providing further information after the review is complete.
The Timberlands business remains relentlessly focused on capturing operational excellence and synergies and is on track to achieve its $30 million to $50 million target for 2016. Internal benchmarking teams are rolling out the initial best practices that resulted from comparing a subset of high-value activities at each company. We are pleased with the progress to date and look forward to continuing to capture the benefits later this year and into 2017.
Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, Charts 6 and 7. Real Estate and ENR contributed $15 million to third quarter earnings compared with $12 million in the second quarter. EBITDA increased by $9 million to $37 million. Real Estate EBITDA increased by $7 million. Average price per acre declined slightly as we sold a greater percentage of lower-value northern acres compared with the second quarter. Contribution to earnings increased minimally due to a proportionally higher land basis as the northern properties, our legacy Plum Creek holdings, that were marked up to fair value and acquisition accounting. Our Real Estate team is making strong progress as they apply [ph] Plum Creek's asset value optimization process to the legacy Weyerhaeuser Timberlands. Work began first in the U.S. south, and that process is entering the latter stages. As we wrap up portions of the Southern analysis, the focus will turn to the West. Work remains on track, and we continue to anticipate the process will be substantially complete in the first half of 2017.
Wood Products, Charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $170 million to third quarter earnings, an increase of $14 million compared with the second quarter. These earnings are the strongest since third quarter 2004 when we operated roughly 2x [ph] the number of manufacturing facilities we do today. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter totaled $203 million.  EBITDA from lumber totaled $85 million. Average realizations increased less than 1% compared with the second quarter. Operating rates and sales volumes decreased slightly due to downtime for capital projects and weather. Log costs for Canadian mills increased, primarily due to weather, and Western log costs were also higher.
EBITDA for OSB increased to $63 million, an improvement of over 45% compared with the second quarter. Average sales realizations increased 7%. Operating performance was very strong, and the business benefited from operational excellence initiatives to reduce spending on controllable manufacturing cost, wax and resin.
Engineered wood products contributed $43 million to EBITDA compared with $45 million in the second quarter. Sales volumes for solid section and I-Joist increased modestly, and average realizations were flat as improved pricing in the West was offset by slower -- slightly lower Eastern realizations and a weaker product mix. EBITDA for distribution declined slightly to $7 million, primarily due to a seasonal shift in products mix. The business remains focused on improving margins and lowering cost. Year-to-date, Wood Products earnings have nearly doubled compared with 2015, and operational excellence has made a meaningful contribution to that improvement. The Wood Products segment has made good progress on this year's OpEx initiatives and remains generally on track to achieve its 2016 targets.
I will now turn to discontinued operations, Chart 11. Discontinued operations, which was formerly our Cellulose Fibers segment, contributed $65 million to after-tax earnings in the third quarter. This includes an after-tax gain of $41 million on the sale of our liquid packaging board business, which closed on August 31 for gross proceeds of $285 million. Excluding this gain, net earnings from operations declined $14 million compared with the second quarter. Maintenance expense increased significantly, and pulp production declined due to additional scheduled maintenance outage days. This was partially offset by higher average sales realizations for pulp, primarily due to mix. 
On October 4, we announced an agreement to sell our printing papers business to One Rock Capital Partners. This completes the strategic review of our Cellulose Fiber business announced in November 2015. Both this transaction and the sale of our pulp mills to International Paper are on track to close in the fourth quarter. 
I'm proud of the contributions our Cellulose Fibers employees have made to Weyerhaeuser, and I want to thank them for maintaining their focus on operating safely and delivering a superior customer experience throughout the strategic review process.
I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook."

The outlook for the fourth quarter is presented in Chart 14 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA will increase slightly over the third quarter. In our Western Tim",977,"Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the fourth quarter is presented in Chart 14 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA will increase slightly over the third quarter. In our Western Timberland operations, we anticipate harvest volumes will be lower than third quarter levels. However, we expect sales realizations will increase modestly in each of our export markets as housing activity remains strong in Japan and Chinese demand remains solid. 
Domestic log sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the third quarter. We anticipate domestic sales realizations will increase slightly in the fourth quarter as a result of steady domestic demand and seasonally lower available log supply. Western logging costs will continue to benefit from the results of our operational excellence initiatives. 
Southern harvest volumes are expected to be slightly higher than third quarter. Mills have adequate log inventories entering the fourth quarter, and average sales realizations are expected to be flat quarter-over-quarter. Silviculture and road spending will be seasonally lower in the South during the fourth quarter. In the North, fourth quarter harvest volumes will decrease seasonally from third quarter levels as third quarter is typically the best operating quarter of the year. 
Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to be slightly higher than the third quarter, while adjusted EBITDA will be about double the third quarter results. It is important to note that the Real Estate sales include a mix of legacy Weyerhaeuser properties and Plum Creek properties, and that the Plum Creek properties have proportionally higher basis because they were marked to fair value in the purchase price allocation. This results in lower earnings when these properties are sold. 
For Wood Products, we expect lower demand through the seasonal decline in building activity. Channel inventories remain lean as buyers purchase for immediate needs. We expect lumber sales realizations in the fourth quarter will be flat to slightly down compared to third quarter levels. We expect OSB prices will decrease, giving back much of the third quarter gains. 
Engineered Wood Products prices are expected to be similar to the third quarter. We anticipate seasonally lower sales volumes across all product lines in the fourth quarter and a slight increase in manufacturing costs as a result of the holiday season and scheduled downtime to complete maintenance and capital projects. Overall, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA and earnings for the Wood Products segment will be seasonally lower than the third quarter. We do, however, expect adjusted EBITDA will be nearly double the fourth quarter of 2015.
Moving on. Chart 10 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. The contribution to earnings before special items was $5 million, $4 million higher than the second quarter. As a reminder, unallocated corporate function expense now includes about $9 million of expenses previously allocated to Cellulose Fibers. 
On October 31, our partner in the Southern diversified Timberland venture redeemed their interest. Following the redemption, Weyerhaeuser now holds all of the equity interest and consolidates the Timberland venture as a wholly owned subsidiary. As a result in consolidation, the investment was eliminated and the note payable to the Timberland venture has been classified as intercompany debt. At the end of the second quarter, the investment in the Timberland venture was $825 million, and the note payable was $830 million. These items no longer appear on our balance sheet as of September 30 for financial reporting purposes.
Chart 12 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $769 million, an increase of $284 million from the second quarter. This is higher than our targeted cash level, and we expect the balance will decrease as we pay down the term loans with proceeds from previously announced Cellulose Fiber asset sales. We expect these sales will close by year-end. 
Cash from investing activities during the quarter included $285 million from the sale of the liquid packaging board business. Capital expenditures for the third quarter totaled $129 million, including $29 million for our discontinued operations. CapEx for our continuing operations will be approximately $200 million in the fourth quarter. $150 million will be for Wood Products, which typically has the highest capital spend during the fourth quarter. 
Financing cash flows for the quarter included $231 million for common dividends and $11 million of preferred dividends, which represent the last dividend payment on the mandatory convertible preference shares. 
During the quarter, we drew an additional $300 million on our term loan. And as of September 30, we had drawn $1.7 billion of the $2.5 billion available under the term loan facilities. Long-term debt, not including the term loan balance of $1.7 billion, was $6.6 billion at the end of the third quarter.
Interest expense was $114 million in the third quarter. We expect interest expense will be similar in the fourth quarter. For our continuing operations, the company now anticipates the full year tax rate will be between 15% and 17% based on the expected mix of 2016 earnings between the REIT and the taxable REIT subsidiary.
I'll wrap up with Chart 13, which provides some additional detail on our share count and repurchase activities. During the third quarter, we repurchased 10 million shares of common stock for $306 million, completing our post-merger goal of repurchasing $2 billion of our shares on an accelerated basis. Overall, under the $2 billion accelerated program, we've purchased a total of 68 million shares of common stock at an average price of $29.49 per share. On July 1, the mandatory convertible preference shares converted to common shares. As a result of the conversion, the company issued approximately 23 million shares. We ended the quarter with about 748 million shares outstanding. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions."

I'm highly confident we will meet or exceed our $100 million run rate cost synergy target by the end of year 1. 
We've also fully identified the sources of reductions for the $35 million of cost formerly allocated to Cellulose Fibers and our own fact [ph] to eliminate these costs within 1 year of closing the International Paper transaction. 
The integration with Plum Creek continues to progress well. Working together will be the foundation of our success, and I am encouraged by the teamwork I see within and between the businesses and functions of our merged company.

As you know, Anthony, there's been a lot of dealer consolidation in the Eastern markets and a lot of jocking around has occurred in those markets.

That was weather-related. As you may know, Canada has been very wet this year, and as a result, having to spend additional dollars to get wood to the mills. So that had an impact. And then also, we had higher log costs in the West. That's consistent with what we reported in our Timberlands operation. So those -- both higher log costs in Canada and the West impacted our margins and results in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Going forward, we would anticipate, as we've said, lumber prices in the fourth quarter to be essentially flat to maybe down just a little bit in fourth quarter versus third quarter."

And as we've said before, what we measure that against is what happened back during the recession in the 2007, 2008, 2009 time frame. Saw a lot of progress made there, more work to do.

This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter net earnings of $227 million or $0.30 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Our third quarter results include after-tax earnings of $65 million from discon",1505,"Thank you, Beth, and welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter net earnings of $227 million or $0.30 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Our third quarter results include after-tax earnings of $65 million from discontinued operations and $10 million of after-tax charges for merger-related expenses. Excluding these items, we earned $172 million or $0.23 per diluted share. This is an improvement of over 30% compared with second quarter and over 40% compared with the year ago. 
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $434 million, an improvement of $21 million compared with the second quarter. Our employees delivered strong performance in the quarter as operating results improved across each of our businesses with Timberlands driving increased EBITDA through merger synergies and Wood Products achieving its highest third quarter earnings in 12 years. 
However, these results reflect only some of our quarterly achievements as we also closed the sale of our liquid packaging board business, completed the move to our new corporate headquarters in Seattle and completed our commitment to a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase. I'm proud of what our team's accomplished and the pace at which they continue to operate as we work together to be the world's premier timber, land and forest products company.
Before turning to our business results, let me make a few brief comments regarding the housing market. Third quarter housing activity was roughly in line with our expectations, and we are anticipating nearly 1.2 million housing starts for 2016, in line with consensus estimates. Although total housing starts for September were weaker than expected, the headline number was driven by the volatile multifamily sector. Single-family starts have continued to grow at a favorable pace. Through September, single-family starts were up approximately 10% compared with 2015 on a seasonally adjusted basis, and low inventories of homes for sale reflect continued steady demand.
As we enter the seasonally weaker fourth quarter, we're encouraged by the strength of September permitting activity, new home sales and continued solid builder confidence. Although constraints such as skilled labor, permit delays and fees and rising costs for land and construction may be functioning as a governor on supply side growth, rising employment and wages and favorable mortgage rates continue to drive improving housing demand.
Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands, Charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $122 million to third quarter earnings and $223 million to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $3 million compared with the second quarter. Western Timberlands contributed $109 million to third quarter EBITDA compared with $114 million in the second quarter. Western fee harvest volumes decreased and average log realizations were largely flat. 
Sales volumes to Japan improved moderately during the quarter as low mortgage rates continued to drive strong housing activity and the effect of the delay in the consumption tax increase continued to fade. Average realizations for Japanese logs declined slightly early in the quarter but stabilized as the quarter progressed. Sales volumes to China decreased due to timing of shipments and a slight seasonal decline in demand, and average realization has decreased modestly. Log inventories to Chinese ports declined during the quarter and remain within a normalized range.
Western domestic markets remained solid during the quarter, and pricing for domestic logs improved marginally as some markets were tensioned by fire-related harvest restrictions and increased mill demand. Western logging costs benefited from operational excellence initiatives during the quarter. Although we anticipated a seasonal increase in per-unit logging costs due to the harvest of higher-elevation stands. Of course, we're able to mitigate this cost increase through new harvesting technology that improves productivity on steep slopes and reduces the need for the highest cost cable logging operations.
Southern Timberlands contributed $108 million to third quarter EBITDA, $9 million more than the second quarter. Seasonally higher log sales volumes were partially offset by seasonally higher silviculture and forestry costs and a 1% decrease in average log price realizations. This decline was partially attributable to mix as third quarter harvest included a slightly higher proportion of pulpwood. Southern logging costs benefited from operational synergies with merger integration progress enabling further optimization of logging and hauling activities across the combined ownership.
Northern Timberlands EBITDA improved $3 million compared with the second quarter. Seasonally higher volumes were partially offset by weaker realizations and seasonally higher road and forestry expense. 
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced a strategic review of our Uruguay operations. This review will enable us to ensure that we are best positioning the business for long-term success and maximizing value for our shareholders. We look forward to providing further information after the review is complete.
The Timberlands business remains relentlessly focused on capturing operational excellence and synergies and is on track to achieve its $30 million to $50 million target for 2016. Internal benchmarking teams are rolling out the initial best practices that resulted from comparing a subset of high-value activities at each company. We are pleased with the progress to date and look forward to continuing to capture the benefits later this year and into 2017.
Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, Charts 6 and 7. Real Estate and ENR contributed $15 million to third quarter earnings compared with $12 million in the second quarter. EBITDA increased by $9 million to $37 million. Real Estate EBITDA increased by $7 million. Average price per acre declined slightly as we sold a greater percentage of lower-value northern acres compared with the second quarter. Contribution to earnings increased minimally due to a proportionally higher land basis as the northern properties, our legacy Plum Creek holdings, that were marked up to fair value and acquisition accounting. Our Real Estate team is making strong progress as they apply Plum Creek's asset value optimization process to the legacy Weyerhaeuser Timberlands. Work began first in the U.S. south, and that process is entering the latter stages. As we wrap up portions of the Southern analysis, the focus will turn to the West. Work remains on track, and we continue to anticipate the process will be substantially complete in the first half of 2017.
Wood Products, Charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $170 million to third quarter earnings, an increase of $14 million compared with the second quarter. These earnings are the strongest since third quarter 2004 when we operated roughly 2x the number of manufacturing facilities we do today. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter totaled $203 million.  EBITDA from lumber totaled $85 million. Average realizations increased less than 1% compared with the second quarter. Operating rates and sales volumes decreased slightly due to downtime for capital projects and weather. Log costs for Canadian mills increased, primarily due to weather, and Western log costs were also higher.
EBITDA for OSB increased to $63 million, an improvement of over 45% compared with the second quarter. Average sales realizations increased 7%. Operating performance was very strong, and the business benefited from operational excellence initiatives to reduce spending on controllable manufacturing cost, wax and resin.
Engineered wood products contributed $43 million to EBITDA compared with $45 million in the second quarter. Sales volumes for solid section and I-Joist increased modestly, and average realizations were flat as improved pricing in the West was offset by slower -- slightly lower Eastern realizations and a weaker product mix. EBITDA for distribution declined slightly to $7 million, primarily due to a seasonal shift in products mix. The business remains focused on improving margins and lowering cost. Year-to-date, Wood Products earnings have nearly doubled compared with 2015, and operational excellence has made a meaningful contribution to that improvement. The Wood Products segment has made good progress on this year's OpEx initiatives and remains generally on track to achieve its 2016 targets.
I will now turn to discontinued operations, Chart 11. Discontinued operations, which was formerly our Cellulose Fibers segment, contributed $65 million to after-tax earnings in the third quarter. This includes an after-tax gain of $41 million on the sale of our liquid packaging board business, which closed on August 31 for gross proceeds of $285 million. Excluding this gain, net earnings from operations declined $14 million compared with the second quarter. Maintenance expense increased significantly, and pulp production declined due to additional scheduled maintenance outage days. This was partially offset by higher average sales realizations for pulp, primarily due to mix. 
On October 4, we announced an agreement to sell our printing papers business to One Rock Capital Partners. This completes the strategic review of our Cellulose Fiber business announced in November 2015. Both this transaction and the sale of our pulp mills to International Paper are on track to close in the fourth quarter. 
I'm proud of the contributions our Cellulose Fibers employees have made to Weyerhaeuser, and I want to thank them for maintaining their focus on operating safely and delivering a superior customer experience throughout the strategic review process.
I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook."

The outlook for the fourth quarter is presented in Chart 14 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA will increase slightly over the third quarter. In our Western Tim",977,"Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the fourth quarter is presented in Chart 14 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA will increase slightly over the third quarter. In our Western Timberland operations, we anticipate harvest volumes will be lower than third quarter levels. However, we expect sales realizations will increase modestly in each of our export markets as housing activity remains strong in Japan and Chinese demand remains solid. 
Domestic log sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the third quarter. We anticipate domestic sales realizations will increase slightly in the fourth quarter as a result of steady domestic demand and seasonally lower available log supply. Western logging costs will continue to benefit from the results of our operational excellence initiatives. 
Southern harvest volumes are expected to be slightly higher than third quarter. Mills have adequate log inventories entering the fourth quarter, and average sales realizations are expected to be flat quarter-over-quarter. Silviculture and road spending will be seasonally lower in the South during the fourth quarter. In the North, fourth quarter harvest volumes will decrease seasonally from third quarter levels as third quarter is typically the best operating quarter of the year. 
Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to be slightly higher than the third quarter, while adjusted EBITDA will be about double the third quarter results. It is important to note that the Real Estate sales include a mix of legacy Weyerhaeuser properties and Plum Creek properties, and that the Plum Creek properties have proportionally higher basis because they were marked to fair value in the purchase price allocation. This results in lower earnings when these properties are sold. 
For Wood Products, we expect lower demand through the seasonal decline in building activity. Channel inventories remain lean as buyers purchase for immediate needs. We expect lumber sales realizations in the fourth quarter will be flat to slightly down compared to third quarter levels. We expect OSB prices will decrease, giving back much of the third quarter gains. 
Engineered Wood Products prices are expected to be similar to the third quarter. We anticipate seasonally lower sales volumes across all product lines in the fourth quarter and a slight increase in manufacturing costs as a result of the holiday season and scheduled downtime to complete maintenance and capital projects. Overall, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA and earnings for the Wood Products segment will be seasonally lower than the third quarter. We do, however, expect adjusted EBITDA will be nearly double the fourth quarter of 2015.
Moving on. Chart 10 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. The contribution to earnings before special items was $5 million, $4 million higher than the second quarter. As a reminder, unallocated corporate function expense now includes about $9 million of expenses previously allocated to Cellulose Fibers. 
On October 31, our partner in the Southern diversified Timberland venture redeemed their interest. Following the redemption, Weyerhaeuser now holds all of the equity interest and consolidates the Timberland venture as a wholly owned subsidiary. As a result in consolidation, the investment was eliminated and the note payable to the Timberland venture has been classified as intercompany debt. At the end of the second quarter, the investment in the Timberland venture was $825 million, and the note payable was $830 million. These items no longer appear on our balance sheet as of September 30 for financial reporting purposes.
Chart 12 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $769 million, an increase of $284 million from the second quarter. This is higher than our targeted cash level, and we expect the balance will decrease as we pay down the term loans with proceeds from previously announced Cellulose Fiber asset sales. We expect these sales will close by year-end. 
Cash from investing activities during the quarter included $285 million from the sale of the liquid packaging board business. Capital expenditures for the third quarter totaled $129 million, including $29 million for our discontinued operations. CapEx for our continuing operations will be approximately $200 million in the fourth quarter. $150 million will be for Wood Products, which typically has the highest capital spend during the fourth quarter. 
Financing cash flows for the quarter included $231 million for common dividends and $11 million of preferred dividends, which represent the last dividend payment on the mandatory convertible preference shares. 
During the quarter, we drew an additional $300 million on our term loan. And as of September 30, we had drawn $1.7 billion of the $2.5 billion available under the term loan facilities. Long-term debt, not including the term loan balance of $1.7 billion, was $6.6 billion at the end of the third quarter.
Interest expense was $114 million in the third quarter. We expect interest expense will be similar in the fourth quarter. For our continuing operations, the company now anticipates the full year tax rate will be between 15% and 17% based on the expected mix of 2016 earnings between the REIT and the taxable REIT subsidiary.
I'll wrap up with Chart 13, which provides some additional detail on our share count and repurchase activities. During the third quarter, we repurchased 10 million shares of common stock for $306 million, completing our post-merger goal of repurchasing $2 billion of our shares on an accelerated basis. Overall, under the $2 billion accelerated program, we've purchased a total of 68 million shares of common stock at an average price of $29.49 per share. On July 1, the mandatory convertible preference shares converted to common shares. As a result of the conversion, the company issued approximately 23 million shares. We ended the quarter with about 748 million shares outstanding. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions."

We've also fully identified the sources of reductions for the $35 million of cost formerly allocated to Cellulose Fibers and our on track to eliminate these costs within 1 year of closing the International Paper transaction. 
The integration with Plum Creek continues to progress well. Working together will be the foundation of our success, and I am encouraged by the teamwork I see within and between the businesses and functions of our merged company.

To get to your second part of your question, we anticipate EWP prices will be essentially flat in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Regarding the price increase, the price increase that went into place within the West in the quarter -- in the second quarter and third quarter, that was successful but was offset by some pricing pressure in the East. As you know, Anthony, there's been a lot of dealer consolidation in the Eastern markets and a lot of jocking around has occurred in those markets. So up in the West, down in the East, which has resulted in a net pricing that we saw in the third quarter, we think that's stabilized and anticipate essentially flat prices in the fourth quarter versus the third."

That was weather-related. As you may know, Canada has been very wet this year, and as a result, having to spend additional dollars to get wood to the mills. So that had an impact. And then also, we had higher log costs in the West. That's consistent with what we reported in our Timberlands operation. So those -- both higher log costs in Canada and the West impacted our margins and results in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Going forward, we would anticipate, as we've said, lumber prices in the fourth quarter to be essentially flat to maybe down just a little bit in fourth quarter versus third quarter."

This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter net earnings of $227 million or $0.30 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Our third quarter results include after-tax earnings of $65 million from discontinued operations and $10 million of after-tax charges for merger-related expenses. Excluding these items, we earned $172 million or $0.23 per diluted share. This is an improvement of over 30% compared with second quarter and over 40% compared with a year ago. 
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $434 million, an improvement of $21 million compared with the second quarter. Our employees delivered strong performance in the quarter as operating results improved across each of our businesses with Timberlands driving increased EBITDA through merger synergies and Wood Products achieving its highest third quarter earnings in 12 years. 
However, these results reflect only some of our quarterly achievements as we also closed the sale of our liquid packaging board business, completed the move to our new corporate headquarters in Seattle and completed our commitment to a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase. I'm proud of what our team's accomplished and the pace at which they continue to operate as we work together to be the world's premier timber, land and forest products company.
Before turning to our business results, let me make a few brief comments regarding the housing market. Third quarter housing activity was roughly in line with our expectations, and we are anticipating nearly 1.2 million housing starts for 2016, in line with consensus estimates. Although total housing starts for September were weaker than expected, the headline number was driven by the volatile multifamily sector. Single-family starts have continued to grow at a favorable pace. Through September, single-family starts were up approximately 10% compared with 2015 on a seasonally adjusted basis, and low inventories of homes for sale reflect continued steady demand.
As we enter the seasonally weaker fourth quarter, we're encouraged by the strength of September permitting activity, new home sales and continued solid builder confidence. Although constraints such as skilled labor, permit delays and fees, and rising costs for land and construction may be functioning as a governor on supply side growth, rising employment and wages and favorable mortgage rates continue to drive improving housing demand.
Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands, Charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $122 million to third quarter earnings and $223 million to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $3 million compared with the second quarter. Western Timberlands contributed $109 million to third quarter EBITDA compared with $114 million in the second quarter. Western fee harvest volumes decreased and average log realizations were largely flat. 
Sales volumes to Japan improved moderately during the quarter as low mortgage rates continued to drive strong housing activity and the effect of a delay in the consumption tax increase continued to fade. Average realizations for Japanese logs declined slightly early in the quarter, but stabilized as the quarter progressed. Sales volumes to China decreased due to timing of shipments and a slight seasonal decline in demand, and average realization has decreased modestly. Log inventories to Chinese ports declined during the quarter and remain within a normalized range.
Western domestic markets remained solid during the quarter, and pricing for domestic logs improved marginally as some markets were tensioned by fire-related harvest restrictions and increased mill demand. Western logging costs benefited from operational excellence initiatives during the quarter. Although we anticipated a seasonal increase in per-unit logging costs due to the harvest at higher elevation stands proves we're able to mitigate this cost increase through new harvesting technology that improves productivity on steep slopes and reduces the need for the highest cost cable logging operations.
Southern Timberlands contributed $108 million to third quarter EBITDA, $9 million more than the second quarter. Seasonally higher log sales volumes were partially offset by seasonally higher silviculture and forestry costs and a 1% decrease in average log price realizations. This decline was partially attributable to mix as third quarter harvest included a slightly higher proportion of pulpwood. Southern logging costs benefited from operational synergies with merger integration progress enabling further optimization of logging and hauling activities across the combined ownership.
Northern Timberlands EBITDA improved $3 million compared with the second quarter. Seasonally higher volumes were partially offset by weaker realizations and seasonally higher road and forestry expense. 
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced a strategic review of our Uruguay operations. This review will enable us to ensure that we are best positioning the business for long-term success and maximizing value for our shareholders. We look forward to providing further information after the review is complete.
The Timberlands business remains relentlessly focused on capturing operational excellence and synergies and is on track to achieve its $30 million to $50 million target for 2016. Internal benchmarking teams are rolling out the initial best practices that resulted from comparing a subset of high-value activities at each company. We are pleased with the progress to date and look forward to continuing to capture the benefits later this year and into 2017.
Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, Charts 6 and 7. Real Estate and ENR contributed $15 million to third quarter earnings compared with $12 million in the second quarter. EBITDA increased by $9 million to $37 million. Real Estate EBITDA increased by $7 million. Average price per acre declined slightly as we sold a greater percentage of lower-value northern acres compared with the second quarter. Contribution to earnings increased minimally due to a proportionally higher land basis as the northern properties, our legacy Plum Creek holdings, that were marked up to fair value and acquisition accounting. Our Real Estate team is making strong progress as they apply Plum Creek's asset value optimization process to the legacy Weyerhaeuser Timberlands. Work began first in the U.S. south, and that process is entering the latter stages. As we wrap up portions of the Southern analysis, the focus will turn to the West. Work remains on track, and we continue to anticipate the process will be substantially complete in the first half of 2017.
Wood Products, Charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $170 million to third quarter earnings, an increase of $14 million compared with the second quarter. These earnings are the strongest since third quarter 2004 when we operated roughly 2x the number of manufacturing facilities we do today. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter totaled $203 million.  EBITDA from lumber totaled $85 million. Average realizations increased less than 1% compared with the second quarter. Operating rates and sales volumes decreased slightly due to downtime for capital projects and weather. Log costs for Canadian mills increased, primarily due to weather, and Western log costs were also higher.
EBITDA for OSB increased to $63 million, an improvement of over 45% compared with the second quarter. Average sales realizations increased 7%. Operating performance was very strong, and the business benefited from operational excellence initiatives to reduce spending on controllable manufacturing cost, wax and resin.
Engineered wood products contributed $43 million to EBITDA compared with $45 million in the second quarter. Sales volumes for solid section and I-Joist increased modestly, and average realizations were flat as improved pricing in the West was offset by slower -- slightly lower Eastern realizations and a weaker product mix. EBITDA for distribution declined slightly to $7 million, primarily due to a seasonal shift in products mix. The business remains focused on improving margins and lowering cost. Year-to-date, Wood Products earnings have nearly doubled compared with 2015, and operational excellence has made a meaningful contribution to that improvement. The Wood Products segment has made good progress on this year's OpEx initiatives and remains generally on track to achieve its 2016 targets.
I will now turn to discontinued operations, Chart 11. Discontinued operations, which was formerly our Cellulose Fibers segment, contributed $65 million to after-tax earnings in the third quarter. This includes an after-tax gain of $41 million on the sale of our liquid packaging board business, which closed on August 31 for gross proceeds of $285 million. Excluding this gain, net earnings from operations declined $14 million compared with the second quarter. Maintenance expense increased significantly, and pulp production declined due to additional scheduled maintenance outage days. This was partially offset by higher average sales realizations for pulp, primarily due to mix. 
On October 4, we announced an agreement to sell our printing papers business to One Rock Capital Partners. This completes the strategic review of our Cellulose Fiber business announced in November 2015. Both this transaction and the sale of our pulp mills to International Paper are on track to close in the fourth quarter. 
I'm proud of the contributions our Cellulose Fibers employees have made to Weyerhaeuser, and I want to thank them for maintaining their focus on operating safely and delivering a superior customer experience throughout the strategic review process.
I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook."

The outlook for the fourth quarter is presented in Chart 14 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA will increase slightly over the third quarter. In our Western Timberland operations, we anticipate harvest volumes will be lower than third quarter levels. However, we expect sales realizations will increase modestly in each of our export markets as housing activity remains strong in Japan and Chinese demand remains solid. 
Domestic log sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the third quarter. We anticipate domestic sales realizations will increase slightly in the fourth quarter as a result of steady domestic demand and seasonally lower available log supply. Western logging costs will continue to benefit from the results of our operational excellence initiatives. 
Southern harvest volumes are expected to be slightly higher than third quarter. Mills have adequate log inventories entering the fourth quarter, and average sales realizations are expected to be flat quarter-over-quarter. Silviculture and road spending will be seasonally lower in the South during the fourth quarter. In the North, fourth quarter harvest volumes will decrease seasonally from third quarter levels as third quarter is typically the best operating quarter of the year. 
Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to be slightly higher than the third quarter, while adjusted EBITDA will be about double the third quarter results. It is important to note that the Real Estate sales include a mix of legacy Weyerhaeuser properties and Plum Creek properties, and that the Plum Creek properties have a proportionally higher basis because they were marked to fair value in the purchase price allocation. This results in lower earnings when these properties are sold. 
For Wood Products, we expect lower demand through the seasonal decline in building activity. Channel inventories remain lean as buyers purchase for immediate needs. We expect lumber sales realizations in the fourth quarter will be flat to slightly down compared to third quarter levels. We expect OSB prices will decrease, giving back much of the third quarter gains. 
Engineered Wood Products prices are expected to be similar to the third quarter. We anticipate seasonally lower sales volumes across all product lines in the fourth quarter and a slight increase in manufacturing costs as a result of the holiday season and scheduled downtime to complete maintenance and capital projects. Overall, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA and earnings for the Wood Products segment will be seasonally lower than the third quarter. We do, however, expect adjusted EBITDA will be nearly double the fourth quarter of 2015.
Moving on. Chart 10 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. The contribution to earnings before special items was $5 million, $4 million higher than the second quarter. As a reminder, unallocated corporate function expense now includes about $9 million of expenses previously allocated to Cellulose Fibers. 
On October 31, our partner in the Southern diversified Timberland venture redeemed their interest. Following the redemption, Weyerhaeuser now holds all of the equity interest and consolidates the Timberland venture as a wholly owned subsidiary. As a result in consolidation, the investment was eliminated and the note payable to the Timberland venture has been classified as intercompany debt. At the end of the second quarter, the investment in the Timberland venture was $825 million, and the note payable was $830 million. These items no longer appear on our balance sheet as of September 30 for financial reporting purposes.
Chart 12 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $769 million, an increase of $284 million from the second quarter. This is higher than our targeted cash level, and we expect the balance will decrease as we pay down the term loans with proceeds from previously announced Cellulose Fiber asset sales. We expect these sales will close by year-end. 
Cash from investing activities during the quarter included $285 million from the sale of the liquid packaging board business. Capital expenditures for the third quarter totaled $129 million, including $29 million for our discontinued operations. CapEx for our continuing operations will be approximately $200 million in the fourth quarter. $150 million will be for Wood Products, which typically has the highest capital spend during the fourth quarter. 
Financing cash flows for the quarter included $231 million for common dividends and $11 million of preferred dividends, which represent the last dividend payment on the mandatory convertible preference shares. 
During the quarter, we drew an additional $300 million on our term loan, and as of September 30, we had drawn $1.7 billion of the $2.5 billion available under the term loan facilities. Long-term debt, not including the term loan balance of $1.7 billion, was $6.6 billion at the end of the third quarter.
Interest expense was $114 million in the third quarter. We expect interest expense will be similar in the fourth quarter. For our continuing operations, the company now anticipates the full year tax rate will be between 15% and 17% based on the expected mix of 2016 earnings between the REIT and the taxable REIT subsidiary.
I'll wrap up with Chart 13, which provides some additional detail on our share count and repurchase activities. During the third quarter, we repurchased 10 million shares of common stock for $306 million, completing our post-merger goal of repurchasing $2 billion of our shares on an accelerated basis. Overall, under the $2 billion accelerated program, we've purchased a total of 68 million shares of common stock at an average price of $29.49 per share. On July 1, the mandatory convertible preference shares converted to common shares. As a result of the conversion, the company issued approximately 23 million shares. We ended the quarter with about 748 million shares outstanding. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions."

We continue to implement the changes necessary to achieve our $100 million hard dollar cost synergy target. As of the end of the third quarter, we have achieved about 2/3 of these reductions on a run rate basis. I'm highly confident we will meet or exceed our $100 million run rate cost synergy target by the end of year one. 
We've also fully identified the sources of reductions for the $35 million of cost formerly allocated to Cellulose Fibers and are on track to eliminate these costs within one year of closing the International Paper transaction. 
The integration with Plum Creek continues to progress well. Working together will be the foundation of our success, and I am encouraged by the teamwork I see within and between the businesses and functions of our merged company. 
I'm excited by what we have achieved and where we are going, and I look forward to continuing to share our successes with you as we work together to drive value for shareholders through a focused portfolio, industry-leading performance and disciplined capital allocation.  
And now with that, I'd like to open the floor for questions."

Regarding the price increase, the price increase that went into place within the West in the quarter -- in the second quarter and third quarter, that was successful, but was offset by some pricing pressure in the East. As you know, Anthony, there's been a lot of dealer consolidation in the Eastern markets and a lot of jocking around has occurred in those markets.

That was weather-related. As you may know, Canada has been very wet this year, and as a result, having to spend additional dollars to get wood to the mills. So that had an impact. And then also, we had higher log costs in the West. That's consistent with what we reported in our Timberlands operation. So those -- both higher log costs in Canada and the West impacted our margins and results in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Going forward, we would anticipate, as we've said, lumber prices in the fourth quarter to be essentially flat to maybe down just a little bit in fourth quarter versus third quarter."

And bottom line is we're encouraged by what we see in the export markets currently. From a Weyerhaeuser perspective, we anticipate that in Japan, which as you know, is our most important market, that pricing will be up in the fourth quarter versus the third due to steady demand and lower log supply that always happens in the fourth quarter. We think volume may be down a little bit, but that's just going to be due to timing and the way the shipping works. In China, we continue to see a solid demand, anticipate higher prices in China in the fourth quarter. And encouragingly, inventories actually came down a little bit in the third quarter versus the second. They're currently at 3.38 million cubic meters, which is down from where they ended at the second quarter. In terms of just overall views on it, we've seen a slight increase in imports into China from Russia but nothing significant, and New Zealand seems to have kind of stabilized. So that's what we're seeing overall in export markets."

This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter net earnings of $227 million or $0.30 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Our third quarter results include after-tax earnings of $65 million from discontinued operations and $10 million of after-tax charges for merger-related expenses. Excluding these items, we earned $172 million or $0.23 per diluted share. This is an improvement of over 30% compared with second quarter and over 40% compared with a year ago. 
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $434 million, an improvement of $21 million compared with the second quarter. Our employees delivered strong performance in the quarter as operating results improved across each of our businesses with Timberlands driving increased EBITDA through merger synergies and Wood Products achieving its highest third quarter earnings in 12 years. 
However, these results reflect only some of our quarterly achievements as we also closed the sale of our liquid packaging board business, completed the move to our new corporate headquarters in Seattle and completed our commitment to a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase. I'm proud of what our team's accomplished and the pace at which they continue to operate as we work together to be the world's premier timber, land and forest products company.
Before turning to our business results, let me make a few brief comments regarding the housing market. Third quarter housing activity was roughly in line with our expectations, and we are anticipating nearly 1.2 million housing starts for 2016, in line with consensus estimates. Although total housing starts for September were weaker than expected, the headline number was driven by the volatile multifamily sector. Single-family starts have continued to grow at a favorable pace. Through September, single-family starts were up approximately 10% compared with 2015 on a seasonally adjusted basis, and low inventories of homes for sale reflect continued steady demand.
As we enter the seasonally weaker fourth quarter, we're encouraged by the strength of September permitting activity, new home sales and continued solid builder confidence. Although constraints such as skilled labor, permit delays and fees, and rising costs for land and construction may be functioning as a governor on supply side growth, rising employment and wages and favorable mortgage rates continue to drive improving housing demand.
Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands, Charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $122 million to third quarter earnings and $223 million to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $3 million compared with the second quarter. Western Timberlands contributed $109 million to third quarter EBITDA compared with $114 million in the second quarter. Western fee harvest volumes decreased and average log realizations were largely flat. 
Sales volumes to Japan improved moderately during the quarter as low mortgage rates continued to drive strong housing activity and the effect of a delay in the consumption tax increase continued to fade. Average realizations for Japanese logs declined slightly early in the quarter, but stabilized as the quarter progressed. Sales volumes to China decreased due to timing of shipments and a slight seasonal decline in demand, and average realization has decreased modestly. Log inventories to Chinese ports declined during the quarter and remain within a normalized range.
Western domestic markets remained solid during the quarter, and pricing for domestic logs improved marginally as some markets were tensioned by fire-related harvest restrictions and increased mill demand. Western logging costs benefited from operational excellence initiatives during the quarter. Although we anticipated a seasonal increase in per-unit logging costs due to the harvest at higher elevation stands proves we're able to mitigate this cost increase through new harvesting technology that improves productivity on steep slopes and reduces the need for the highest cost cable logging operations.
Southern Timberlands contributed $108 million to third quarter EBITDA, $9 million more than the second quarter. Seasonally higher log sales volumes were partially offset by seasonally higher silviculture and forestry costs and a 1% decrease in average log price realizations. This decline was partially attributable to mix as third quarter harvest included a slightly higher proportion of pulpwood. Southern logging costs benefited from operational synergies with merger integration progress enabling further optimization of logging and hauling activities across the combined ownership.
Northern Timberlands EBITDA improved $3 million compared with the second quarter. Seasonally higher volumes were partially offset by weaker realizations and seasonally higher road and forestry expense. 
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced a strategic review of our Uruguay operations. This review will enable us to ensure that we are best positioning the business for long-term success and maximizing value for our shareholders. We look forward to providing further information after the review is complete.
The Timberlands business remains relentlessly focused on capturing operational excellence and synergies and is on track to achieve its $30 million to $50 million target for 2016. Internal benchmarking teams are rolling out the initial best practices that resulted from comparing a subset of high-value activities at each company. We are pleased with the progress to date and look forward to continuing to capture the benefits later this year and into 2017.
Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, Charts 6 and 7. Real Estate and ENR contributed $15 million to third quarter earnings compared with $12 million in the second quarter. EBITDA increased by $9 million to $37 million. Real Estate EBITDA increased by $7 million. Average price per acre declined slightly as we sold a greater percentage of lower-value northern acres compared with the second quarter. Contribution to earnings increased minimally due to a proportionally higher land basis as the northern properties, our legacy Plum Creek holdings, that were marked up to fair value and acquisition accounting. Our Real Estate team is making strong progress as they apply Plum Creek's asset value optimization process to the legacy Weyerhaeuser Timberlands. Work began first in the U.S. south, and that process is entering the latter stages. As we wrap up portions of the Southern analysis, the focus will turn to the West. Work remains on track, and we continue to anticipate the process will be substantially complete in the first half of 2017.
Wood Products, Charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $170 million to third quarter earnings, an increase of $14 million compared with the second quarter. These earnings are the strongest since third quarter 2004 when we operated roughly 2x the number of manufacturing facilities we do today. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter totaled $203 million.  EBITDA from lumber totaled $85 million. Average realizations increased less than 1% compared with the second quarter. Operating rates and sales volumes decreased slightly due to downtime for capital projects and weather. Log costs for Canadian mills increased, primarily due to weather, and Western log costs were also higher.
EBITDA for OSB increased to $63 million, an improvement of over 45% compared with the second quarter. Average sales realizations increased 7%. Operating performance was very strong, and the business benefited from operational excellence initiatives to reduce spending on controllable manufacturing cost, wax and resin.
Engineered wood products contributed $43 million to EBITDA compared with $45 million in the second quarter. Sales volumes for solid section and I-Joist increased modestly, and average realizations were flat as improved pricing in the West was offset by slower -- slightly lower Eastern realizations and a weaker product mix. EBITDA for distribution declined slightly to $7 million, primarily due to a seasonal shift in products mix. The business remains focused on improving margins and lowering cost. Year-to-date, Wood Products earnings have nearly doubled compared with 2015, and operational excellence has made a meaningful contribution to that improvement. The Wood Products segment has made good progress on this year's OpEx initiatives and remains generally on track to achieve its 2016 targets.
I will now turn to discontinued operations, Chart 11. Discontinued operations, which was formerly our Cellulose Fibers segment, contributed $65 million to after-tax earnings in the third quarter. This includes an after-tax gain of $41 million on the sale of our liquid packaging board business, which closed on August 31 for gross proceeds of $285 million. Excluding this gain, net earnings from operations declined $14 million compared with the second quarter. Maintenance expense increased significantly, and pulp production declined due to additional scheduled maintenance outage days. This was partially offset by higher average sales realizations for pulp, primarily due to mix. 
On October 4, we announced an agreement to sell our printing papers business to One Rock Capital Partners. This completes the strategic review of our Cellulose Fiber business announced in November 2015. Both this transaction and the sale of our pulp mills to International Paper are on track to close in the fourth quarter. 
I'm proud of the contributions our Cellulose Fibers employees have made to Weyerhaeuser, and I want to thank them for maintaining their focus on operating safely and delivering a superior customer experience throughout the strategic review process.
I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook."

The outlook for the fourth quarter is presented in Chart 14 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA will increase slightly over the third quarter. In our Western Timberland operations, we anticipate harvest volumes will be lower than third quarter levels. However, we expect sales realizations will increase modestly in each of our export markets as housing activity remains strong in Japan and Chinese demand remains solid. 
Domestic log sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the third quarter. We anticipate domestic sales realizations will increase slightly in the fourth quarter as a result of steady domestic demand and seasonally lower available log supply. Western logging costs will continue to benefit from the results of our operational excellence initiatives. 
Southern harvest volumes are expected to be slightly higher than third quarter. Mills have adequate log inventories entering the fourth quarter, and average sales realizations are expected to be flat quarter-over-quarter. Silviculture and road spending will be seasonally lower in the South during the fourth quarter. In the North, fourth quarter harvest volumes will decrease seasonally from third quarter levels as third quarter is typically the best operating quarter of the year. 
Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to be slightly higher than the third quarter, while adjusted EBITDA will be about double the third quarter results. It is important to note that the Real Estate sales include a mix of legacy Weyerhaeuser properties and Plum Creek properties, and that the Plum Creek properties have a proportionally higher basis because they were marked to fair value in the purchase price allocation. This results in lower earnings when these properties are sold. 
For Wood Products, we expect lower demand through the seasonal decline in building activity. Channel inventories remain lean as buyers purchase for immediate needs. We expect lumber sales realizations in the fourth quarter will be flat to slightly down compared to third quarter levels. We expect OSB prices will decrease, giving back much of the third quarter gains. 
Engineered Wood Products prices are expected to be similar to the third quarter. We anticipate seasonally lower sales volumes across all product lines in the fourth quarter and a slight increase in manufacturing costs as a result of the holiday season and scheduled downtime to complete maintenance and capital projects. Overall, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA and earnings for the Wood Products segment will be seasonally lower than the third quarter. We do, however, expect adjusted EBITDA will be nearly double the fourth quarter of 2015.
Moving on. Chart 10 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. The contribution to earnings before special items was $5 million, $4 million higher than the second quarter. As a reminder, unallocated corporate function expense now includes about $9 million of expenses previously allocated to Cellulose Fibers. 
On October 31, our partner in the Southern diversified Timberland venture redeemed their interest. Following the redemption, Weyerhaeuser now holds all of the equity interest and consolidates the Timberland venture as a wholly owned subsidiary. As a result in consolidation, the investment was eliminated and the note payable to the Timberland venture has been classified as intercompany debt. At the end of the second quarter, the investment in the Timberland venture was $825 million, and the note payable was $830 million. These items no longer appear on our balance sheet as of September 30 for financial reporting purposes.
Chart 12 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $769 million, an increase of $284 million from the second quarter. This is higher than our targeted cash level, and we expect the balance will decrease as we pay down the term loans with proceeds from previously announced Cellulose Fiber asset sales. We expect these sales will close by year-end. 
Cash from investing activities during the quarter included $285 million from the sale of the liquid packaging board business. Capital expenditures for the third quarter totaled $129 million, including $29 million for our discontinued operations. CapEx for our continuing operations will be approximately $200 million in the fourth quarter. $150 million will be for Wood Products, which typically has the highest capital spend during the fourth quarter. 
Financing cash flows for the quarter included $231 million for common dividends and $11 million of preferred dividends, which represent the last dividend payment on the mandatory convertible preference shares. 
During the quarter, we drew an additional $300 million on our term loan, and as of September 30, we had drawn $1.7 billion of the $2.5 billion available under the term loan facilities. Long-term debt, not including the term loan balance of $1.7 billion, was $6.6 billion at the end of the third quarter.
Interest expense was $114 million in the third quarter. We expect interest expense will be similar in the fourth quarter. For our continuing operations, the company now anticipates the full year tax rate will be between 15% and 17% based on the expected mix of 2016 earnings between the REIT and the taxable REIT subsidiary.
I'll wrap up with Chart 13, which provides some additional detail on our share count and repurchase activities. During the third quarter, we repurchased 10 million shares of common stock for $306 million, completing our post-merger goal of repurchasing $2 billion of our shares on an accelerated basis. Overall, under the $2 billion accelerated program, we've purchased a total of 68 million shares of common stock at an average price of $29.49 per share. On July 1, the mandatory convertible preference shares converted to common shares. As a result of the conversion, the company issued approximately 23 million shares. We ended the quarter with about 748 million shares outstanding. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions."

We've also fully identified the sources of reductions for the $35 million of cost formerly allocated to Cellulose Fibers and are on track to eliminate these costs within 1 year of closing the International Paper transaction.

So there are a lot of moving pieces in the pricing for EWP currently. To get to your second part of your question, we anticipate EWP prices will be essentially flat in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Regarding the price increase, the price increase that went into place within the West in the quarter -- in the second quarter and third quarter, that was successful, but was offset by some pricing pressure in the East. As you know, Anthony, there's been a lot of dealer consolidation in the Eastern markets and a lot of jocking around has occurred in those markets. So up in the West, down in the East, which has resulted in a net pricing that we saw in the third quarter, we think that's stabilized and anticipate essentially flat prices in the fourth quarter versus the third."

So I think there were 3 things that impacted our lumber results in the third quarter versus the second, and as you mentioned, we had a strong second quarter in lumber. But 3 things in the third quarter: one was we had a slightly lower sales volume; two, as you mentioned, lower operating rates that were due to weather and some downtime for installation of some capital projects as we continued to invest capital in that business to drive down our overall cost structure; and then third and the most surprising one for us was that log costs increased in Canada. That was weather-related. As you may know, Canada has been very wet this year, and as a result, having to spend additional dollars to get wood to the mills. So that had an impact. And then also, we had higher log costs in the West. That's consistent with what we reported in our Timberlands operation. So those -- both higher log costs in Canada and the West impacted our margins and results in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Going forward, we would anticipate, as we've said, lumber prices in the fourth quarter to be essentially flat to maybe down just a little bit in fourth quarter versus third quarter."

In terms of what we'll do with the cash, as you would anticipate, Mark, we'll run that through our capital allocation priorities as we do everything and figure out the best use of that cash to drive value for our shareholders long term."
