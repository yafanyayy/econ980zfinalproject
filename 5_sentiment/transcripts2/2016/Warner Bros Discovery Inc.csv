While it was a year that saw secular and economic challenges around the world, including strong currency headwinds, Discovery continued to b",1562,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2015 was a year of solid growth at Discovery Communications. While it was a year that saw secular and economic challenges around the world, including strong currency headwinds, Discovery continued to benefit from our investments in content, brands and IP and our ability to execute in all types of macroeconomic environment. 
We experienced strong growth last year as we continue to execute on our key strategic objectives of growing global market share, launching new products and platforms and investing in more high-quality content and brands with universal appeal across our worldwide platform, including over the past couple of years, expanding and strengthening our content mix to focus in more on must-have categories that are more appealing to consumers, such as sports in Europe and kids in Latin America. 
In terms of volume share, our U.S. network delivery, again, outperformed the marketplace, led by Discovery Channel, Investigation Discovery, Science, Velocity and OWN. 
We continue to capture more viewers with our 11% portfolio share across cable. Most notably, Discovery Channel was the #1 nonsports cable network for men for the year. Had its most-watched year ever across all demos and grew total audience in the U.S. by 12% with women up high single digits year-over-year. 
Investigation Discovery continues to grow and prosper in ways the marketplace still hasn't given full value.  ID was the #1 network for women in total day in the full fourth quarter and #3 for the full year in the United States. 
For 4 years, 16 consecutive quarters in a row, ID has been the #1 network for length of tune in all of television in total day delivery.  Just an incredible performance. 
This performance also means that ID has significant opportunities to grow CPMs in recognition of this delivery strength. 
Last year, ID improved pricing, increased revenue and grew many new advertisers. The mystery and crime genre continues to pay and play remarkably well around the world and ID had its largest international audience ever in 2015, growing 20%. 
Going forward, we will continue to rollout ID to additional new markets, and we're just getting started. 
Our success was not limited to Discovery Channel and ID. OWN had its most-watched year in networks history of, its fourth consecutive year of double-digit prime growth in total viewers. 
Oprah is fully engaged and the channel together with a lot of original content and Tyler Perry and Oprah's Magic continues to grow in a meaningful way. 
And Velocity added nearly 5 million subscribers in the U.S. and have prime viewership among men up 24%. It is totally dominating the popular auto category. We're nearly 30% of the advertisers on Velocity are endemic and exclusive to this channel. 
Across Discovery's international portfolio, overall viewership was up more than 10% in 2015, driven most notably by the appeal of our female lifestyle brands such as TLC and Home & Health, and increasingly, our new Eurosport platform, which is growing aggressively. 
We also expanded the reach with several new channel launches, including multiple localized versions of Eurosport, a new free-to-air channels in Italy, Turkey, Finland and the Middle East. 
And recently, we launched Turbo Velocity in New Zealand. An increased distribution of Turbo Velocity 30% across Latin America in 2015. 
Our success across the diverse set of market illustrates our ability to grow in both emerging and established economies. Our increases in network delivery in the U.S. and abroad yielded strong add sale results. 
In the U.S., our sales team drove add revenues up an impressive 5% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. 
Internationally, organic sales were up 12% for the fourth quarter and 11% for the year, driven by strength in Latin America and Southern Europe. 
This strength was due to our continued investment in diversifying our portfolio of brands and must-have content. 
Perhaps the best indicator of this was our groundbreaking agreement for the Olympic Games across Europe for the next decade. We have already started to monetize our Olympics investment with our first sublicensing deal with BBC announced earlier this month. The value of this deal meaningfully exceeded our business plan and ensures that in the U.K, Eurosport will be the only place where people will have access to all of the Olympic events for the next decade. 
During the year, Eurosport expanded its reach to now more than 150 million homes, up double digits since we took control and added more than 100 long-term sports rights deals, including key renewals like the Australian Open  and the U.S. Open. 
Many of our rights are exclusive and include reasonable and monitizeable price increases, which ensures that Eurosport will be profitable and will remain profitable.  These steps help drive double-digit increases in viewership on Eurosport across all of Europe. 
Discovery's portfolio of brand continues to also drive strong affiliate growth. Internationally, we redefined the value of our networks with strong affiliate renewals with carriers and markets, including Sweden, Singapore, France and Poland, driven by our growing audience share, investment in local sports rights and the Olympics. The strength of our portfolio was particularly evident in 2 recent negotiations with Telia in Sweden and Telenor in the Nordics, where we ended up pulling our signal and our drive to obtain strong sub-key increases. We are taking a much more aggressive stand to fight for the value of our content and to drive meaningfully higher sub fees. 
In both instances after we went dark, we ended up with strong renewals and a very favorable economic results. 
While being dark on Telenor for 11 days this month means we will yield a small negative impact on our first quarter results from the loss of advertising revenues for those 11 days. Our medium and long-term results will be much, much better and we will recognize significantly more value across our portfolio in that Northern European region. 
We are also starting to see additional financial upside as international distributors are increasingly looking for ways to differentiate their offerings to consumers with exclusive content and IT. This dynamic is a change in the marketplace and create a significant opportunity for us that really is all incremental growth since we own all of our own content. 
The diversity of our content portfolio enables us to be best positioned to create exclusive content and exclusive channel packages for many current and new distribution partners, and we are in conversations with many of distributors about this around the world. 
Some examples providing our partners with exclusive content are: A terrific deal we did with nc+ in Poland, which is part of the Canal Plus group; and 2 deals we did in the Middle East, one with OSN and another with BN, where we're able to give each distributor exclusive access to different packages of Discovery Networks. And in all 3 cases, we were able to yield significant incremental revenue. 
In 2015, Discovery made several senior A+ hires to focus on growing our revenues across all platforms. We hired a new Chief Commercial officer, Paul Guyardo, and his team is focused on a 3-prong multiplatform strategy to reach viewers across any and all devices and monetize this additional viewing. 
First in the U.S.,we're focused on reaching new viewers and strengthening the offerings of the MVPD ecosystem through TV Everywhere. 
In December, we launched Discovery GO, an authenticated TV Everywhere product in partnership with several U.S. distributors. 
While it is very early days, initial results are extremely encouraging as the number of users ad streams and ad dollars are all ahead of plan. 
Discovery GO also is helping us reach the younger audiences with almost half of its users in the 18 to 34 demo. 
Internationally, we are rolling out a kids TV Everywhere called product called Discovery Kids Play in Latin America, which launched with Sky in Brazil and last week with DISH in Mexico. 
Second, as we look to reach millennial audiences by bringing our linear brands to new platforms, we're also creating exciting new content for digital natives, including daily news and short form docs, audiences and advertisers are engaged in what Discovery Digital Networks are doing, and we see it because we have 350 million streams a month. 
Finally, we will continue to develop our direct-to-consumer products to complement our linear content and fuel the passion of our superfans. 
In Europe, we have been aggressively expanding our deep play in Eurosport player products, which both recorded double-digit subscriber growth for 2015. 
I am proud of all that Discovery achieved in 2015. While the world is changing, we are changing with it. And we ended 2016 with strong long-term deals locked in, our content compelling, our brands never stronger, all yielding real business momentum. 
Near term, ad trends are very healthy domestically, and we expect double-digit growth internationally and our global affiliate growth is locked in over the next several years is due to contracted price escalators. Our ownership of world-class content in IP at a lower cost per hour and in popular genres that play well all over the world gives us valuable optionality to monetize our content as media consumption continues to grow across all screen. This is what sets discovery apart, and we see more growth in the years to come. 
I will now turn the call over to Andy for details on our financial results."

Despite continued secular challenges in the U.S. and currency headwinds internationally, we are pleased with the 2015 performance and optimistic about our continued ability to execute on our",2103,"Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. 
Despite continued secular challenges in the U.S. and currency headwinds internationally, we are pleased with the 2015 performance and optimistic about our continued ability to execute on our stated strategic and financial objectives and the 3-year Investor Day guidance metrics going forward. 
For the full year 2015, all of our income statement metrics were in line with or exceeded our original guidance metrics. Excluding FX, Discovery's revenues increased 10%, adjusted OIBDA increased 4% and adjusted EPS was up 13%. 
On a reported basis, Discovery's total company revenues for the year increased 2%, adjusted OIBDA decreased 4% and adjusted EPS also decreased 4%. 
As expected, given that approximately half of our revenues are outside the U.S., the strengthening dollar was, again, a major headwind in 2015 as changes in currency rates, especially Latin American currencies and the euro, had a year-over-year negative impact of over $460 million or 8% on revenues and over $185 million or 8% negative impact in adjusted OIBDA and $0.30 or 17% negative above and below the line impact on adjusted EPS. 
On an organic basis for, or excluding the impact of foreign currency, Eurosport the SBS Radio sale and consolidation of Discovery Family, full year total company revenues were 6% and adjusted OIBDA grew 3% as we, again, demonstrated our ability to deliver consistently strong financial results even as we continue to invest in strengthening our global IP, platforms and brands. 
Full year net income available to Discovery Communications of $1 billion was down versus last year, driven by negative currency impacts on or above and below-the-line results, partially offset by the benefit of our lower effective tax rate. 
Our full year effective tax rate came down another 200 basis points to 33% as we remain laser-focused on lowering both our effective and cash tax rates by fully utilizing the increasingly international mix of our business. 
For the full year, free cash flow decreased 2% to $1.17 billion, primarily driven by timing of working capital, higher content spend and the negative impacts from currency, partially offset by lower cash taxes, long-term incentive payments and capital expenditures. 
Free cash flow came in just below our guidance, above low single digits due to foreign exchange as the ultimate year-over-year FX impact on adjusted OIBDA was higher-than-anticipated and there were additional negative currency impacts on working capital, especially in the last quarter of the year. 
Excluding the impact of currency, full year free cash flow was up approximately 8% versus 2014. 
Closing now on our fourth quarter results only. Reported total company revenues were down 2% and reported adjusted OIBDA was down 10%. Organic revenues, however, were up 8% and organic adjusted OIBDA was up 1% as expenses in the quarter grew faster than revenue, primarily due to higher content and marketing costs. 
Net income available to Discovery Communications decreased to $290 million, primarily due to foreign exchange and losses associated with the sale of businesses in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring costs and higher equity earnings. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.38 compared to $0.43 a year ago, while fourth quarter currency constant adjusted EPS was actually up 12%. 
Free cash flow increased an impressive 53% in the quarter to $598 million, primarily due to lower cash taxes and timing of working capital, partially offset by negative impact of foreign exchange. 
Moving now to the individual operating units. Despite continued concerns about domestic secular trends, our U.S. Networks' fourth quarter revenues grew a solid 6%, driven by 7% distribution and 5% advertising growth. 
U.S. distribution revenues were up 7%, consistent with 2015's previously reported organic quarterly growth rates. While total portfolio subs did decline by just over 1% year-over-year, we, again, benefited from the higher rates we garnered from our deals with NTTC, Cablevision, Sony and others at the end of 2014 and early 2015 as well as some contributions from our Hulu deal. 
On the advertising side, we are extremely pleased to report another quarter of mid-single digit growth with ad sales up 5%. 
As David mentioned, our ratings, again, outperformed the industry and this outperformance allowed us to benefit from robust scatter pricing and volume as well as stronger overall market demand. 
Looking ahead to 2016, given current ad market trends of stronger scatter pricing and our improving total impressions, we expect U.S. year-over-year ad sales growth in the first quarter to, again, be up mid-single digits. 
While we continue to see strong ad demand in pricing, we're still taking a more conservative view on our full year ad sales and expect growth trends to moderate in the future quarters, largely driven by the impact of the Olympics in the third quarter. 
Fourth quarter domestic adjusted OIBDA was at 1% as operating expenses were up 11%. Cost to revenues were 12% due to writing off certain Discovery and Animal Planet programming as our new creative management team focused on pivoting the networks towards more on brand content and SG&A was up 8% due to the increased marketing spend. 
For the full year 2015, total U.S. revenues and adjusted OIBDA were both up 6%, excluding the impact of consolidating Discovery Family, full year U.S. revenues were up 4%, for advertising up 2% and distribution revenues up 7%, while total cost were up 4%, leading to adjusted OIBDA growing 3%. 
Turning to the International segment. Our International Networks delivered another quarter of strong organic ad and distribution growth as we executed very well on our stated objectives of high single digit organic affiliate growth and low double-digit organic advertising growth for the fourth quarter and full year. 
As already mentioned, the flip side of having a large, growing international business is that currency remained a major headwind on reported results versus 2014. 
Foreign exchange reduced fourth quarter international revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth rates by 13% and 17%, respectively, and reduced full year revenue and adjusted OIBDA by 14% and 16%, respectively. 
Reported results also included Eurosport and the recently divested SBS Radio business. 
For comparability purposes, the following international commentary will refer to all organic results only, say exclude the impact of Eurosport, SBS Radio and foreign exchange. 
Fourth quarter international revenue was up 11%, led by 12% advertising growth and 8% distribution growth. Advertising, again, grew double digits in the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher pricing and ratings in Southern Europe, higher pricing in volume in Latin America as well as higher pricing in volume in Asia. Affiliate revenues had another robust quarter of solid growth, increasing 8%. 
For the full year, organic advertising revenues were up 11% and organic distribution revenues were up 7%. By the ad sales ban and rules change in Russia, we were able to deliver a very impressive growth rates to reflect the vitality of our international brands and business. 
Looking ahead, at our Investor Day, we stated that international advertising and affiliate revenues excluding currency would each growth in the high single digit range over the next 3 years. Given the current advertising strength in many of our markets, especially in Latin America and Southern Europe, we were still benefiting from share gains as well as pricing increases. We expect 2016 organic advertising to exclude the impact of SBS Radio as well as foreign exchange to continue to grow low double digits. Clearly, our international revenue momentum remains strong and intact. 
Turning to the cost side. Organic operating cost internationally were up 18% in the fourth quarter, driven by increased content and marketing expenses as well as higher personnel costs. Content expenses were higher, primarily due to writing off certain programming with changes in creative and regional leadership in the Nordics. 
Full year organic costs were up 11%. Adjusted OIBDA grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year. 
Eurosport standalone margin for the full year came in as expected at 7% as we invested in linear and digital sports rights to drive sustained, long-term value. 
As previously stated, we will no longer break out the results of Eurosport going forward as it will not significantly impact the comparability of DNS results in future periods. 
Now moving on to Education and Other segment. As expected, this division reported 0 adjusted OIBDA in the fourth quarter and a small operating loss for the year. Given our continuing strategic focus on producing and utilizing more content from our in-house OWN production studios, which has no margin associated with it and our continued investment in educations' digital textbooks to drive the long term value of the industry disrupting business, this segment will continue to operate around breakeven even though it's expected to grow revenues in 2016. 
Now taking a look at our overall company financial position. In the fourth quarter, we resumed our share buyback program, and we purchased $375 million of the common stock. 
During 2015, we brought back a total of $950 million worth of common and preferred shares and since inception of our buyback program in 2010, we have now repurchased over $6.6 billion of our stock, reducing our outstanding share count by over 33%. 
As we look ahead to 2016, our capital allocation priorities remain the same as we best position ourselves for the future. First, to invest in driving organic growth; second, to invest in strategic M&A, platforms and IP to have a strong return on investments; and third, to repurchase our stock. 
As we stated on previous calls, we are firmly committed to remaining an investment-grade rated company and are comfortable with our gross leverage ratio being in the 3.25 to 3.4 leverage range. And we will, therefore, likely raise additional debt in 2016. 
We still intend to be a very active buyer of our stock in 2016 as the IRR under purchasing our stock remains very compelling given our long-range plan free cash flow per share growth expectations. 
Given this, we expect to continue to allocate a substantial and growing amount of available capital shall repurchases in 2016 and future years. 
Now let's focus on our financial expectations going forward. As we first announced in our September Investor Day, we still expect our constant currency-adjusted EPS CAGR for 2015 to 2018 to grow at least in the low double-digit range. 
I also want to clarify that our expected free cash flow CAGR over the same 3-year period will be on a constant currency basis as we are firmly committing to real operating execution and performance versus uncontrollable foreign exchange movements, which could ultimately have a positive or negative impact on our cash flow results. We still expect this constant currency free cash flow CAGR to also at least in the low double-digit range. 
Looking specifically at 2016, constant currency-adjusted EPS and constant currency free cash flow are both expected to grow robustly in the low double-digit to low teens range. We also expect our full year effective tax rate to come down another 300 basis points to approximately 30%, one year ahead of our previous 30% effective tax rate commitment by 2017. 
Finally, we're, again, quantifying the expected foreign exchange impact on our 2016 results. 
At current spot rates, FX is expected to negatively impact revenues by approximately $185 million to $195 million and adjusted OIBDA by approximately $115 million to $125 million versus our 2015 reported results. 
While the strong dollar will likely to continue negatively impact our reported results in the near term, currency rates obviously fluctuate up and down, so FX rates do reverse direction as they always, overtime, revert back to the mean, this will have a very positive impact on our reported results. 
In closing, I want to emphasize that while we are cognizant of the current challenges in the media space, given our continued global audience share growth, global ad sales momentum, strong base cost productivity, declining effective tax rate and accelerating share repurchase expectations, I'm even more confident today than I was back at our Investor Day that we will certainly achieve or over deliver on our 3-year financial growth commitments. 
As an example, at our Investor Day, we forecasted at U.S. ad sales will be down low single digits in 2015 to 2018. Yet our current ad sales trend is at mid-single digits. Several other important trends, including U.S. ratings, U.S. sub-universe declines and our effective tax rate are also better today than we forecasted back at September. I really do feel great about our portfolio and financial momentum going into 2016. 
Thanks, again, for your time this morning. And David and I will now be happy to answer any questions you may have."

Okay, first, we're off to a very good start where we're attacking digital and I think in a very sensible way. We hired a new team, which is headed up by Paul Guyardo, and we have an attack team going hard at TV Everywhere, and we're starting to reap some real results. We're working very closely with Neil Smith in X1, which is a great platform, and we're finding our viewership there as increasing and it's really paying off for us and what we've said TV Everywhere is a great platform where we can monetize, and we are. I think we are the only company in the U.S. that has created our own aggregated app with D GO, which has all of our channels on it. And we've now been authenticated with commercials through a number of distributors. It's early days. Time Warner is just launching it as well. But the results early have been quite good. The demo is very young, the engagement is substantial, and we have a team that's really working on that and people are getting closer to our brands, and we're talking to our customers. So I think a really very positive turn in terms of TV Everywhere and our own authenticated app. Outside the U.S., it's really two things. Our Eurosport app is growing quite effectively. I don't -- we wont reach a million subs in 2016, but we do have a march to a million, and we're hoping to reach 1 million by '17. And 1 million at $8 a month will be an incremental $100 million. We have a lot more IP for Eurosport that we've been able to aggregated very reasonable price increases. Eurosport will stay profitable, and this could be meaningfully incremental. When you think about Europe being 700 million people, the ability to drive the direct-to-consumer business here could be quite substantial. And if we can get the 1 million, I think culturally, it can be a tipping point for us. We can get to 1 million, why can't get to 3 million, and we have the IP. And finally there's deep play, which we have in Northern Europe, and we're rolling out throughout Europe. And we've been doing that in our own. And we've been doing quite well. But we're learning more and more this is my own believe that there will be some our consolidation in a positive way. There's nothing stopping major distributors in Northern Europe, where we have 30% or 45% of market share to work with other major programmers. I think that will probably happen around the world over the next 4, 5 years. It's rather having a number of individual apps to come together, and we're having some of those discussions and I think to the extent that we do come together with others, that will even be more powerful. But when you look at the full portfolio of what we're doing direct-to-consumer and TV Everywhere, I think we're doing more, and we're doing it at lower cost than anyone because we own all of our content. And finally, we're not leaving the youngest demo out with our streaming business. We're not making money on that business today, but we're not losing money. But we have 350 million streams. And so when you think about that 350 million streams, and you think about Vice, and you think about Buzz Feed, that 350 million a month is growing, it's a millennial audience, they're spending time with us. And candidly, we haven't done a great job monetizing those streams. And the CPM's on them are quite good and now we have a whole team that is attacking the ability to engage with millennials and make money on those streams. So I think we're in a very good spot and over '16 and '17 I think you'll see some and a full results, and we'll keep you posted."

David, as we kind of settle into 2016 here and look back on last year a little bit, with Apple, we saw this issue of when ADQ and Apple sit down with the content providers and your peers, and they, the programmers, are dead set on keeping all of the networks in the bundle, whether it be a streaming bundle, the likes of which people thought Apple might launch, those networks would include sports. It just got to the point where the cost of the consumer would have been too high for expanded online streaming offering. Where do you think we are in that conversation? And from here, is there anything that could change? What kind of has to happen for the industry to get closer to seeing more over-the-top services with fewer core networks included in those services such that they're actually appealing to the customer? And then Andy, I just wondered, if you look at your deals with Go90, Hulu and Sony, can you quantify how much of those adding on a quarterly basis? Like how much do they contribute to affiliate fee growth in the fourth quarter and then in your 2016 guidance, maybe can help us with, I think, you said high single digit for overall U.S. affiliate fees, that's your long term and and then sounds like that's intact for '16. And then just clarify what's included in that for those 3 deals, that would be really helpful."

Well, look, I think in '15, there was all this noise around skinny bundles. And I said before that the majority of programmers have contracts at least for the next several years that maybe there could be a little bit of that, but that the ability to really start changing the way you offer services, it's going to be another cycle, which will be several years. Having said that, we're very well-positioned for that skinny bundles in 2 ways. One, we have 14 channels that represent 11% or 12% of the viewership, but we're only reaping about 6% of the cost. we're relatively inexpensive. So when Eddie was looking for channels, and we have the #1 channel for men with Discovery, the #1 channel for women with ID, and we have all these affinity networks, the top network with TLC and Science, you can pick up 14 channels for less than the cost of 1 regional sports network. So one, it's very efficient piece. Two is, if we needed to go to our top 8, we make 86% of our revenue and more than 90% of our EBITDA from our top 8 networks. And so if ever did happen here in the U.S, we would be well positioned. I don't believe it's -- and sitting down with the distributors themselves with all the talk of the skinny bundles, and as appealing as it seems, most consumers seem to want the big bundle. And I think probably the most encouraging thing is that cable seems to be -- the numbers have really turned around. As Andy said, we haven't really -- we've seen it, but we haven't seen the full effect of it because there's a few months gap between when they announced and when we actually get paid. But it's very encouraging that there seems to be a change in the universe dynamics. It's also, as you look at the U.S., I think our U.S. business now looks like a meaningful growth business. We have advertising market, much stronger than we expected. Our viewership is growing and the universe decline and the skinny bundles noise seems to dissipated to kind of a reality, which is not too much on skinny bundles and universe maybe charging around. And so, I think quite encouraging for the next couple of years. I'd like over-the-top to happen in a meaningful way because I think ultimately, we have really good services, our channels are on brand and they're reasonable. And we'll be one of the big recipients of that, but I think it's going to be a while."

Can we assume that the Comcast agreement will be represented in the first quarter results because I think that deal is signed last summer. I just want to see if you could comment there. And then David, I heard your comments on the Telenor situation was really interesting. You know better than anybody that there are big differences between Pan-European distribution and U.S. distribution dynamics, but how do you look at the increasing tension between programmers and distributors in Europe as you move forward? Do you view this as an opportunity maybe accelerate your business and maybe you're underpaid historically? Or do you think that's going a create more volatility in the results? What could you tell us since you're much closer to that than we are?"

And so with Telenor and with Telia, we were able to get meaningful step ups in increases. Remember that Europe and Latin America are a little bit than the U.S. in that historically Latin America has been mostly no price increases. Your increases came from sub growth. And Europe was working like that until 2 years ago. And so we started to drive that idea in the last 2 years, and we've been getting increases. But in the last 12 months, we've taken the position that we need much more substantial increases. And putting kids together with our channels in Latin America and sports together with our suite and free-to-air and IP and all of our content together in Europe has helped us get bigger increases. But in order to get it, we really need to stand up for the value of our content. So we had to pull our signals twice. So I think there's 2 buckets. One is, you're going to see us fighting for significant incremental affiliate revenue and between the Olympics and Eurosport and the strength of Discovery and the strength of our female portfolio around the world, we think that we can get that, and you'll start to see our affiliate line growing in a meaningful way over the next -- it's a long cycle over the next year, 2 years, 3 years just like we did here in the U.S. And we have some optimism that maybe we could even do meaningfully better than that because our IP, we think, is quite good. But we're going to have to fight for it. I think the reverberation of pulling those signals in Northern Europe has been valuable in the deals that we've done recently have been very, very favorable, that's one. Two, you bring up a point that is a new phenomenon, but it's all incremental to us. The idea that distributors in Europe are starting to compete more aggressively is a real helper to us. And what they're starting to do, which we didn't anticipate is, that whether you're a satellite, cable or phone player, for the first time over the last 12 months, they have felt that owning the pipe directly to the handset or to the home is not enough. The need to be commoditized that pipe by owning unique exclusive content. And so this is really a new idea here. So we sell our 10 channels and then we get a distributors coming to us saying, do you have other great IP, you could sell just to us that we could promote, that we have just as content in the market. So we have been able to do. We've done 4 of those deals in the last 6 months. None of those were in our plan 4 months ago, 5 months ago. It's all incremental to us, our channel is in language and I think if it continues, if you have the BT is fighting with the Sky, if you have in each market if you have this competitive dynamics, and we can raise our hand and say, we have kids IP, we have sports IP, we have excess drama and nonfiction IP, that, that could be a whole incremental vein of revenue process. And we're starting to see it. If it continues, we'll be able to break it up for you in the years to come, but it's a very positive. And so what we see internationally is double-digit growth even though it's basically been flatlining for the last couple of years, and that will continue. Advertising remains strong. We have this new vein of opportunity with these distributors wanting exclusive content and the Olympics is going to help us with that. And so, I think quite favorable. The big negative is currency. Our international business is really -- it's doing extremely well. The big issue is currency."

I appreciate there's a lot of moving parts here were some write offs and onetime items in the fourth quarter. Let me just provide some clarity and perspective. For 2015 kind of apples-to-apples constant currency, SG&A total for the company was up low single digits with content costs up low double as we invested in rich loss In discovery and sports, et cetera. As I look into 2016, we see constant currency OpEx, SG&A up, again, only low single digits with cost to revenue being up high singles. So total cost, I'll call it mid-single for 2016. Just again to clarify, the foreign exchange impact in '16, we're saying that for OIBDA will be about $115 million to $125 million. As David said, look, clearly, foreign exchange has been a very challenging element for us given our desirable and national portfolio. The good news I'll say in FX you look at some the movements of currency last year. Some of these markets really can't get any worse. You look at example Venezuela, we went from a 5 to 1 exchange rate at the beginning of '15 to a 200 to 1 at the end of '15. And so in some of these markets, we've kind of taken the full bun of the hit, we'll see what happens from here. But I think in terms of OIBDA being about $115 million to $125 million and then lastly, on Comcast, yes, the Comcast deal is effective January and that new deal will be in our first quarter reported results."

So we have happy audience that we're nourishing, that they're spending a lot of time with us. And Oprah is very engaged. We grew our audience double-digit. We have a very strong leadership team there with Eric and Sherry working very closely with Oprah. She works with them for many years of Harpo. So I think we're in a very strong trajectory. In terms of affiliate fees, more than 80% of the affiliate fees are locked with meaningful increases and the channel is almost 90 million homes. And so we took a channel that was in 75 million homes and had no sub fees. Four years ago, it's in almost 90 million homes. It's making a lot of money, it's a top network and Oprah has created a great success. The channel is owned 50-50. As we disclosed when we did the deal, Oprah has some stage puts that she can elect to take or not. The first election opportunity is this year and they're staged throughout the next 6 or 7 years. And we love the channel. If over time, the channel ends up -- we have an opportunity to own more of the channel, and it's only good thing for us. We're very confident in it. We think it is a great niche and some very strong IP. And over time, as our grows gross, we have an opportunity to consolidate it, that would be very favorable for us.

Look, for international, we've acquired all this content with assumption that we were going to use it on our lean your channels that we were going to use it on TV Everywhere, on VOD, direct-to-consumer. We have this huge library of content in kids and sports, in nonfiction and drama that we own. And so do deals that we've done is almost all incremental because we haven't bought any content to provide these exclusive packages. And so whether they come in the form of launching an additional 2 or 3 channels in the market in language or whether it comes in providing exclusive content, it's content that we already own, and so it's all incremental. I think it's less likely to happen here, and we will see how things develop. Right now, TV Everywhere is our #1 priority giving our content to the distributors. Here we are in the U.S., we're having high single digit affiliate growth, Universe is starting to hold its own and our viewership is growing. We have a very healthy U.S. business, and so I think a part of that is going back to our distributors and working with them on TV Everywhere, working with them on VOD, working with them on authenticated apps, which benefits both of us. And so, I think that we've started to tilt. We've got a long way to go, but we started to tilt in a very positive direction with TV Everywhere, which is a very attractive instrument versus kind of the blunt force instruments of some of the SVOD platforms that have no advertising, no branding and our kind of operating outside the existing infrastructure."

But we'll be the only place to get all of the Olympics in the U.K. for the next decade. We were able to get pricing that was significantly more favorable than is in our plan, and it also allows us now to do a Pan-European feed of the Olympics from an advertising perspective also because we could reach almost all 700 million people. So I would say that from something that we felt in terms of modeling that would be profitable given the conversations that we're having across Europe, owning the Olympic IP, we feel confident that it will be meaningfully profitable over the decade, but also that it will be a big helper to us as we build our mobile strategy, as we build our direct-to-consumer strategy and as we look to drive affiliate revenue.

I mean to look at raising extension, for example, we reached 31 million viewers, that kind of reach is unvaluable and very hard to achieve in digital. So those kind of shows and assets for us clearly drive a lot of ad sales volume and pricing.

While it was a year that saw secular and economic challenges around the world, including strong currency headwinds, Discovery continued to benefit from our investments in content, brands and IP and our ability to execute in all types of macroeconomic environment. 
We experienced strong growth last year as we continue to execute on our key strategic objectives of growing global market share, launching new products and platforms and investing in more high-quality content and brands with universal appeal across our worldwide platform, including over the past couple of years, expanding and strengthening our content mix to focusing more on must-have categories that are more appealing to consumers, such as sports in Europe and kids in Latin America. 
In terms of audience share, our U.S. network delivery again outperformed the marketplace, led by Discovery Channel, Investigation Discovery, Science, Velocity and OWN. 
We continue to capture more viewers with our 11% portfolio share across cable. Most notably, Discovery Channel was the #1 non-sports cable network for men for the year, had its most-watched year ever across all demos and grew total audience in the U.S. by 12% with women up high single digits year-over-year. 
Investigation Discovery continues to grow and prosper in ways the marketplace still hasn't given full value.  ID was the #1 network for women in total day in the full fourth quarter and #3 for the full year in the United States. 
For 4 years, 16 consecutive quarters in a row, ID has been the #1 network for length of tune in all of television in total day delivery. Just an incredible performance. 
This performance also means that ID has significant opportunities to grow CPMs in recognition of this delivery strength. 
Last year, ID improved pricing, increased revenue and drew many new advertisers. The mystery and crime genre continues to pay and play remarkably well around the world and ID had its largest international audience ever in 2015, growing 20%. 
Going forward, we will continue to rollout ID to additional new markets, and we're just getting started. 
Our success was not limited to Discovery Channel and ID. OWN had its most-watched year in network history, achieving its fourth consecutive year of double-digit prime growth in total viewers. 
Oprah is fully engaged and the channel together with a lot of original content and Tyler Perry and Oprah's Magic continues to grow in a meaningful way. 
And Velocity added nearly 5 million subscribers in the U.S. and had prime viewership among men up 24%. It is totally dominating the popular auto category, where nearly 30% of the advertisers on Velocity are endemic and exclusive to this channel. 
Across Discovery's international portfolio, overall viewership was up more than 10% in 2015, driven most notably by the appeal of our female lifestyle brands such as TLC and Home & Health, and increasingly our new Eurosport platform, which is growing aggressively. 
We also expanded the reach with several new channel launches, including multiple localized versions of Eurosport, a new free-to-air channels in Italy, Turkey, Finland and the Middle East. 
And recently, we launched Turbo Velocity in New Zealand. An increased distribution of Turbo Velocity 30% across Latin America in 2015. 
Our success across a diverse set of markets illustrates our ability to grow in both emerging and established economies. Our increases in network delivery in the U.S. and abroad yielded strong ad sale results. 
In the U.S., our sales team drove ad revenues up an impressive 5% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. 
Internationally, organic sales were up 12% for the fourth quarter and 11% for the year, driven by strength in Latin America and Southern Europe. 
This strength was due to our continued investment in diversifying our portfolio of brands and must-have content. 
Perhaps the best indicator of this was our groundbreaking agreement for the Olympic Games across Europe for the next decade. We have already started to monetize our Olympics investment with our first sublicensing deal with the BBC announced earlier this month. The value of this deal meaningfully exceeded our business plan and ensures that in the U.K, Eurosport will be the only place where people will have access to all of the Olympic events for the next decade. 
During the year, Eurosport expanded its reach to now more than 150 million homes, up double digits since we took control and added more than 100 long-term sports rights deals, including key renewals like the Australian Open  and the U.S. Open. 
Many of our rights are exclusive and include reasonable and monitizeable price increases, which ensures that Eurosport will be profitable and will remain profitable. These steps help drive double-digit increases in viewership on Eurosport across all of Europe. 
Discovery's portfolio of brand continues to also drive strong affiliate growth. Internationally, we redefined the value of our networks with strong affiliate renewals with carriers and markets including Sweden, Singapore, France and Poland, driven by our growing audience share, investment in local sports rights and the Olympics. The strength of our portfolio was particularly evident in 2 recent negotiations with Telia in Sweden and with Telenor in the Nordics, where we ended up pulling our signal and our drive to obtain strong sub fee  increases. We are taking a much more aggressive stand to fight for the value of our content and to drive meaningfully higher sub fees. 
In both instances after we went dark, we ended up with strong renewals and a very favorable economic result. 
While being dark on Telenor for 11 days this month means we will yield a small negative impact on our first quarter results from the loss of advertising revenues for those 11 days, our medium and long-term results will be much, much better and we will recognize significantly more value across our portfolio in that Northern European region. 
We are also starting to see additional financial upside as international distributors are increasingly looking for ways to differentiate their offerings to consumers with exclusive content and IP. This dynamic is a change in the marketplace and creates a significant opportunity for us that really is all incremental growth since we own all of our own content. 
The diversity of our content portfolio enables us to be best-positioned to create exclusive content and exclusive channel packages for many current and new distribution partners, and we are in conversations with many of distributors about this around the world. 
Some examples of providing our partners with exclusive content are: a terrific deal we did with NC+ in Poland, which is part of the Canal Plus Group; and 2 deals we did in the Middle East, one with OSN and another with BN, where we're able to give each distributor exclusive access to different packages of Discovery Networks. And in all 3 cases, we were able to yield significant incremental revenue. 
In 2015, Discovery made several senior A+ hires to focus on growing our revenues across all platforms. We hired a new Chief Commercial officer, Paul Guyardo, and his team is focused on a 3-prong multi-platform strategy to reach viewers across any and all devices and monetize this additional viewing. 
First in the U.S.,we're focused on reaching new viewers and strengthening the offerings of the MVPD ecosystem through TV Everywhere.  In December, we launched Discovery GO, an authenticated TV Everywhere product in partnership with several U.S. distributors.  While it is very early days, initial results are extremely encouraging as the number of users, ad streams and ad dollars are all ahead of plan.  Discovery GO also is helping us reach younger audiences with almost half of its users in the 18 to 34 demo. 
Internationally, we are rolling out a kids TV Everywhere product called Discovery Kids Play in Latin America, which launched with Sky in Brazil in December and last week with DISH in Mexico. 
Second, as we look to reach millennial audiences by bringing our linear brands to new platforms, we're also creating exciting new content for digital natives, including daily news and short form docs. Audiences and advertisers are engaged in what Discovery Digital Networks are doing, and we see it because we have 350 million streams a month. 
Finally, we will continue to develop our direct-to-consumer products to complement our linear content and fuel the passion of our superfans. 
In Europe, we've been aggressively expanding our Dplay in Eurosport player products, which both recorded double-digit subscriber growth in 2015. 
I am proud of all that Discovery achieved in 2015. While the world is changing, we are changing with it. And we entered 2016 with strong long-term deals locked in, our content compelling, our brands' never stronger all yielding real business momentum. 
Near term, ad trends are very healthy domestically, and we expect double-digit growth internationally and our global affiliate growth is locked in over the next several years due to contracted price escalators. Our ownership of world-class content and IP at a lower cost per hour and in popular genres that play well all over the world gives us valuable optionality to monetize our content as media consumption continues to grow across all screens. This is what sets Discovery apart, and we see more growth in the years to come. 
I will now turn the call over to Andy for details on our financial results."

Despite continued secular challenges in the U.S. and currency headwinds internationally, we are pleased with our 2015 performance, and optimistic about our continued ability to execute on our",2108,"Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. 
Despite continued secular challenges in the U.S. and currency headwinds internationally, we are pleased with our 2015 performance, and optimistic about our continued ability to execute on our stated strategic and financial objectives and the 3-year Investor Day guidance metrics going forward. 
For the full year 2015, all of our income statement metrics were in line with or exceeded our original guidance metrics. Excluding FX, Discovery's revenues increased 10%, adjusted OIBDA increased 4% and adjusted EPS was up 13%. 
On a reported basis, Discovery's total company revenues for the year increased 2%, adjusted OIBDA decreased 4% and adjusted EPS also decreased 4%. 
As expected, given that approximately half of our revenues are now outside the U.S., the strengthening dollar was again a major headwind in 2015 as changes in currency rates, especially Latin American currencies and the euro, had a year-over-year negative impact of over $460 million or 8% on revenues and over $185 million or 8% negative impact in adjusted OIBDA and $0.30 or 17% negative above and below the line impact on adjusted EPS. 
On an organic basis or excluding the impact of foreign currency, Eurosport, the SBS Radio sale and the consolidation of Discovery Family, full year total company revenues grew 6% and adjusted OIBDA grew 3% as we, again, demonstrated our ability to deliver consistently strong financial results even as we continue to invest in strengthening our global IP, platforms and brands. 
Full year net income available to Discovery Communications of $1 billion was down versus last year, driven by the negative currency impacts on our above and below-the-line results, partially offset by the benefit of our lower effective tax rate. 
Our full year effective tax rate came down another 200 basis points to 33% as we remain laser-focused on lowering both our effective and cash tax rates by fully utilizing the increasingly international mix of our business. 
For the full year, free cash flow decreased 2% to $1.17 billion, primarily driven by timing of working capital, higher content spend and the negative impacts from currency partially offset by lower cash taxes, long-term incentive payments and capital expenditures. 
Free cash flow came in just below our guidance, above low single digits due to foreign exchange as the ultimate year-over-year FX impact on adjusted OIBDA was higher-than-anticipated and there were additional negative currency impacts on working capital, especially in the last quarter of the year. 
Excluding the impact of currency, full year free cash flow was up approximately 8% versus 2014. 
Closing now on our fourth quarter results only. Reported total company revenues were down 2% and reported adjusted OIBDA was down 10%. Organic revenues, however, were up 8% and organic adjusted OIBDA was up 1% as expenses in the quarter grew faster than revenue, primarily due to higher content and marketing costs. 
Net income available to Discovery Communications decreased to $290 million, primarily due to foreign exchange and losses associated with the sale of businesses in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring costs and higher equity earnings. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.38 compared to $0.43 a year ago, while fourth quarter currency constant adjusted EPS was actually up 12%. 
Free cash flow increased an impressive 53% in the quarter to $598 million, primarily due to lower cash taxes and timing of working capital, partially offset by negative impact of foreign exchange. 
Moving now to the individual operating units. Despite continued concerns about domestic secular trends, our U.S. Networks' fourth quarter revenues grew a solid 6%, driven by 7% distribution and 5% advertising growth. 
U.S. distribution revenues were up 7%, consistent with 2015's previously reported organic quarterly growth rates. While total portfolio subs did decline by just over 1% year-over-year, we, again, benefited from the higher rates we garnered from our deals with NTTC, Cablevision, Sony and others at the end of 2014 and early 2015 as well as some contributions from our Hulu deal. 
On the advertising side, we are extremely pleased to report another quarter of mid-single digit growth with ad sales up 5%. 
As David mentioned, our ratings, again, outperformed the industry and this outperformance allowed us to benefit from robust scatter pricing and volume as well as stronger overall market demand. 
Looking ahead to 2016, given current ad market trends of stronger scatter pricing and our improving total impressions, we expect U.S. year-over-year ad sales growth in the first quarter to again be up mid-single digits. 
While we continue to see strong ad demand in pricing, we're still taking a more conservative view on our full year ad sales and expect growth trends to moderate in the future quarters, largely driven by the impact of the Olympics in the third quarter. 
Fourth quarter domestic adjusted OIBDA was at 1% as operating expenses were up 11%. Cost to revenues were 12% due to writing off certain Discovery and Animal Planet programming as our new creative management team focused on pivoting the networks towards more on brand content and SG&A was up 8% due to the increased marketing spend. 
For the full year 2015, total U.S. revenues and adjusted OIBDA were both up 6%, excluding the impact of consolidating Discovery Family, full year U.S. revenues were up 4%, for the advertising up 2% and distribution revenues up 7%, while total cost were up 4%, leading to adjusted OIBDA growing 3%. 
Turning to the International segment. Our International Networks delivered another quarter of strong organic ad and distribution growth as we executed very well on our stated objectives of high single digit organic affiliate growth and low double-digit organic advertising growth for the fourth quarter and full year. 
As already mentioned, the flip side of having a large, growing international business is that currency remained a major headwind on reported results versus 2014. 
Foreign exchange reduced fourth quarter international revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth rates by 13% and 17%, respectively, and reduced full year revenue and adjusted OIBDA by 14% and 16%, respectively. 
Reported results also include Eurosport and the recently divested SBS Radio business. 
For comparability purposes, the following international commentary will refer to our organic results only, say exclude the impacts of Eurosport, SBS Radio and foreign exchange. 
Fourth quarter international revenue was up 11%, led by 12% advertising growth and 8% distribution growth. Advertising again grew double digits in the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher pricing and ratings in Southern Europe, higher pricing in volume in Latin America as well as higher pricing in volume in Asia. Affiliate revenues had another robust quarter of solid growth, increasing 8%. 
For the full year, organic advertising revenues were up 11% and organic distribution revenues were up 7%. Despite the ad sales ban and rules change in Russia, we were able to deliver very impressive growth rates to reflect the vitality of our international brands and business. 
Looking ahead, at our Investor Day, we stated that international advertising and affiliate revenues excluding currency would each grow in the high single digit range over the next 3 years. Given the current advertising strength in many of our markets, especially in Latin America and Southern Europe, we were still benefiting from share gains as well as pricing increases. We expect 2016 organic advertising, excluding the impact of SBS Radio as well as foreign exchange, to continue to grow low double digits. Clearly, our international revenue momentum remains strong and intact. 
Turning to the cost side. Organic operating cost internationally were up 18% in the fourth quarter, driven by increased content and marketing expenses as well as higher personnel costs. Content expenses were higher, primarily due to writing off certain programming, with changes in creative and regional leadership in the Nordics. 
Full year organic costs were up 11%. Adjusted OIBDA grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year. 
Eurosport standalone margins for the full year came in, as expected, at 7% as we invested in linear and digital sports rights to drive sustained, long-term value. 
As previously stated, we will no longer break out the results of Eurosport going forward as it will not significantly impact the comparability of DNS results in future periods. 
Now moving on to our Education and Other segment. As expected, this division reported 0 adjusted OIBDA in the fourth quarter and a small operating loss for the year. Given our continuing strategic focus on producing and utilizing more content from our in-house OWN production studios, which has no margin associated with it, and our continued investment in educations' digital textbooks to drive the long term value of the industry disrupting business, this segment will continue to operate around breakeven even though it's expected to grow revenues in 2016. 
Now taking a look at our overall company financial position. In the fourth quarter, we resumed our share buyback program and we purchased $375 million with the common stock. 
During 2015, we bought back a total of $950 million worth of common and preferred shares and since inception of our buyback program in 2010, we have now repurchased over $6.6 billion of our stock, reducing our outstanding share count by over 33%. 
As we look ahead to 2016, our capital allocation priorities remain the same as we best position ourselves for the future. First, to invest in driving organic growth; second, to invest in strategic M&A, platforms and IP to have a strong return on investments; and third, to repurchase our stock. 
As we stated on previous calls, we are firmly committed to remaining an investment-grade rated company and are comfortable with our gross leverage ratio being in the 3.25 to 3.4 leverage range. And we will, therefore, likely raise additional debt in 2016. 
We still intend to be a very active buyer of our stock in 2016 as the IRR on we purchasing our stock remains very compelling given our long-range plan free cash flow per share growth expectations. 
Given this, we expect to continue to allocate a substantial and growing amount of available capital share repurchases in 2016 and future years. 
Now let's focus on our financial expectations going forward. As we first announced in our September Investor Day, we still expect our constant currency-adjusted EPS CAGR for 2015 to 2018 to grow at least in the low double-digit range. 
I also want to clarify that our expected free cash flow CAGR over the same 3-year period will be on a constant currency basis as we are firmly committing to real operating execution and performance versus uncontrollable foreign exchange movements, which could ultimately have a positive or negative impact on our cash flow results. We still expect this constant currency free cash flow CAGR to also, at least, be in the low double-digit range. 
Looking specifically 2016, constant currency-adjusted EPS and constant currency free cash flow are both expected to grow robustly in the low double-digit to low teens range. We also expect our full year effective tax rate to come down another 300 basis points to approximately 30%, one year ahead of our previous 30% effective tax rate commitment by 2017. 
Finally, we're again quantifying the expected foreign exchange impact on our 2016 results. 
At current spot rates, FX is expected to negatively impact revenues by approximately $185 million to $195 million and adjusted OIBDA by approximately $115 million to $125 million versus our 2015 reported results. 
While the strong dollar will likely to continue negligibly impact our reported results in the near term, currency rates obviously fluctuate up and down, so when FX rates do reverse direction, as they always over time revert back to the mean, this will have a very positive impact on our reported results. 
In closing, I want to emphasize that while we are cognizant of the current challenges in the media space, given our continued global audience share growth, global ad sales momentum, strong base cost productivity, declining effective tax rate and accelerating share repurchase expectations, I'm even more confident today than I was back at our Investor Day that we will certainly achieve or over deliver on our 3-year financial growth commitments. 
As an example, at our Investor Day, we forecasted that U.S. ad sales will be down low single digits from 2015 to 2018. Yet our current ad sales trend is at mid-single digits. Several other important trends, including U.S. ratings, U.S. sub-universe declines and our effective tax rate are also better today than we forecasted back at September. I really do feel great about our portfolio and financial momentum going into 2016. 
Thanks, again, for your time this morning. And now, David and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have."

And for Andy, you talked about global affiliate growth locked in over the next several years due to contracts. Certainly, there's increased investor concerns in media in the U.S. around core cutting and skinny bundle impacts on distribution consolidation. I think -- I was just hoping for clarification on the one comment you just made around the sub-trends are better than you thought they would be when you gave guidance back in October. Is that an improvement in the marketplace or just you were conservative in your guidance, the trends are unchanged?

Okay, first, we're off to a very good start where we're attacking digital and I think a very sensible way. We've hired a new team, which is headed up by Paul Guyardo, and we have an attack team going hard at TV Everywhere, and we're starting to reap some real results. We're working very closely with Neil Smith in X1, which is a great platform, and we're finding our viewership there as increasing and it's really paying off for us, and what we've said, TV Everywhere is a great platform where we can monetize, and we are. I think we are the only company in the U.S. that has created our own aggregated app with the GO, which has all of our channels on it. And we've now been authenticated with commercials through a number of distributors. It's early days. Time Warner is just launching it as well. But the results early have been quite good. The demo is very young, the engagement is substantial, and we have a team that's really working on that and people are getting closer to our brands and we're talking to our customers. So I think a really -- a very positive turn in terms of TV Everywhere and our own authenticated app. Outside the U.S., it's really two things. Our Eurosport app is growing quite effectively. I don't -- we wont reach a million subs in 2016, but we do have a march to a million, and we're hoping to reach 1 million by '17. And 1 million at $8 a month will be an incremental $100 million. We have a lot more IP for Eurosport that we've been able to aggregate at very reasonable price increases. Eurosport will stay profitable, and this could be meaningfully incremental. When you think about Europe being 700 million people, the ability to drive a direct-to-consumer business here could be quite substantial. And if we can get to 1 million, I think culturally, it could be a tipping point for us. We can get to 1 million, why can't we get to 3 million, and we have the IP. And finally there's Dplay, which we have in Northern Europe, and we're rolling out throughout Europe. And we've been doing that on our own, and we've been doing quite well. But we're learning more and more, and this is my own belief, that there will be some more consolidation in a positive way. That there's nothing stopping major distributors in Northern Europe, where we have 30% or 45% of market share to work with other major programmers. I think that'll probably happen around the world over the next 4, 5 years, then rather having a number of individual apps to come together, and we're having some of those discussions and I think to the extent that we do come together with others, that will even be more powerful. But when you look at the full portfolio of what we're doing, direct-to-consumer and TV Everywhere, I think we're doing more, and we're doing it at a lower cost than anyone, because we own all of our content. And finally, we're not leaving the youngest demo out with our streaming business. We're not making money on that business today, but we're not losing money. But we have 350 million streams. And so when you think about that 350 million streams, and you think about Vice, and you think about BuzzFeed, that 350 million a month is growing, it's a millennial audience, they're spending time with us. And candidly, we haven't done a great job monetizing those streams. And the CPM's on them are quite good, and now we have a whole team that is attacking the ability to engage with millennials and make money on those streams. So I think we're in a very good spot, and over '16 and '17, I think you'll see some meaningful results, and we'll keep you posted."

And David, as we kind of settle into 2016 here and look back on last year a little bit, with Apple, we saw this issue of when ADQ and Apple sit down with the content providers and your peers, and they all, the programmers, are dead set on keeping all of the networks in the bundle, whether it'd be a streaming bundle, the likes of which people thought Apple might launch, those networks would include sports. And it just got to the point where the cost to the consumer would would've been too high for expanded online streaming offering. Where do you think we are in that conversation? And from here, is there anything that could change? What kind of has to happen for the industry to get closer to seeing more over-the-top services with fewer core networks included in those services, such that they're actually appealing to the customer? 
And then Andy, I just wondered, if you look at your deals with Go90, Hulu and Sony, can you quantify how much of those are adding on a quarterly basis? Like how much do they contribute to affiliate fee growth in the fourth quarter? And then in your 2016 guidance, maybe can help us with -- I think, you said high single digit for overall U.S. affiliate fees, that's your long term and then sounds like that's intact for '16? And then just clarify what's included in that for those 3 deals? That would be really helpful."

Well, look, I think in '15, there was all this noise around skinny bundles. And I've said before, that the majority of programmers have contracts, at least for the next several years, that maybe there could be a little bit of that, but that the ability to really start changing the way you offer services, it's going to be another cycle, which will be several years. Having said that, we're very well-positioned for that skinny bundle in 2 ways. One, we have 14 channels that represent 11% or 12% of the viewership, but we're only reaping about 6% of the cost. So we're relatively inexpensive. So when Eddie was looking for channels, and we have the #1 channel for men with Discovery, the #1 channel for women with ID, and we have all these affinity networks, the top network with TLC and Science and -- you can pick up 14 channels for less than the cost of 1 regional sports network. So one, it's a very efficient piece. Two is, if we needed to go to our top 8, we make 86% of our revenue and more than 90% of our EBITDA from our top 8 networks. And so if it ever did happen here in the U.S, we would be well-positioned. I don't believe it's going to -- and sitting down with the distributors themselves, with all the talk of the skinny bundle, and as appealing as it seems, most consumers seem to want the big bundle. And I think probably the most encouraging thing is that cable seems to be -- the numbers have really turned around. As Andy said, we haven't really -- we've seen it, but we haven't seen the full effect of it because there's a few months gap between when they announce and when we actually get paid. But it's very encouraging that there seems to be a change in the universe dynamics. It's also, as you look at the U.S., I think our U.S. business now looks like a meaningful growth business. We have advertising market, much stronger than we expected; our viewership is growing; and the universe decline -- and the skinny bundle noise seems to have dissipated to kind of a reality, which is not too much on skinny bundle and universe maybe turning around. And so, I think quite encouraging for the next couple of years. I'd like over-the-top to happen in a meaningful way because I think ultimately, we have really good services, our channels are on brand and they're reasonable. And we'll be one of the big recipients of that, but I think it's going to be a while."

And then David, I heard your comments on the Telenor situation was really interesting. You know better than anybody that there are big differences between kind of European distribution and U.S. distribution dynamics. But how do you look at the increasing tension between programmers and distributors in Europe as you move forward? Do you view it as an opportunity to, maybe, accelerate your business and maybe you're underpaid historically? Or do you think that's going a create more volatility in the results? What could you tell us since you're much closer to that than we are?"

So with Telenor and with Telia, we were able to get meaningful step ups in increases.

So with Telenor and with Telia, we were able to get meaningful step ups in increases. Remember that Europe and Latin America are a little bit different than the U.S., in that historically Latin America has been mostly no price increases. Your increases came from sub growth. And Europe was working like that until 2 years ago. And so we started to drive that idea in the last 2 years, and we've been getting increases. But this -- but in the last 12 months, we've taken the position that we need much more substantial increases. And putting kids together with our channels in Latin America and sports together with our suite and free-to-air IP and all of our content together in Europe has helped us get bigger increases. But in order to get it, we really need to stand up for the value of our content. So we had to pull our signals twice. So I think there's 2 buckets. One is, you're going to see us fighting for significant incremental affiliate revenue and between the Olympics and Eurosport and the strength of Discovery and the strength of our female portfolio around the world, we think that we can get that, and you'll start to see our affiliate line growing in a meaningful way over the next -- it's a long cycle, over the next year, 2 years, 3 years just like we did here in the U.S. And we have some optimism that maybe we could even do meaningfully better than that, because our IP, we think is quite good. But we're going to have to fight for it. I think the reverberation of pulling those signals in Northern Europe has been valuable in the deals that we've done recently have been very, very favorable, that's one. Two, you bring up a point that is a new phenomenon, but it's all incremental to us. The idea that distributors in Europe are starting to compete more aggressively is a real helper to us. And what they're starting to do, which we didn't anticipate is, that whether you're a satellite, cable or phone player, for the first time over the last 12 months, they have felt that owning the pipe directly to the handset or to the home is not enough. They need to be decommoditize that pipe by owning unique, exclusive content. And so this is really a new idea here. So we sell our 10 channels and then we get a distributor coming to us saying, ""Do you have other great IP, you could sell just to us that we could promote, that we have just as content in the market."" So we have been able to do -- we've done 4 of those deals in the last 6 months. None of those were in our plan 4 months ago, 5 months ago. It's all incremental to us, our channel is in language and I think that if it continues, if you have the BT is fighting with the Sky, if you have -- in each market if you have this competitive dynamic, and we can raise our hand and say, we have kids IP, we have sports IP, we have excess drama and nonfiction IP, that, that could be a whole incremental vein of revenue for us, and we're starting to see it. If it continues, we'll be able to break it out for you in the years to come, but it's a very positive. And so what we see internationally is, double-digit growth, even though it's basically been flatlining for the last couple of years, and that will continue. Advertising remains strong. We have this new vein of opportunity with these distributors wanting exclusive content, and the Olympics is going to help us with that. And so, I think quite favorable. The big negative is currency. Our international business is really -- it's doing extremely well. The big issue is currency."

I appreciate there's a lot of moving parts here, with some write offs and onetime items in the fourth quarter. So let me just provide some clarity and perspective. For 2015, kind of apples-to-apples constant currency, SG&A total of the company was up low single digits with content costs up low double as we invested in Rich Ross in Discovery and Sports, et cetera. As I look into 2016, we see constant currency OpEx, SG&A up, again, only low single digits with cost to revenue being up high single. So total cost, I'll call it mid-single for 2016. Just again to clarify, the foreign exchange impact in '16, we're saying that for OIBDA will be about $115 million to $125 million. And as David said, look, clearly, foreign exchange has been a very challenging element for us given our -- the size of our international portfolio. The good news I'll say in FX is, you look at some of the movements in currency last year, some of these markets really can't get any worse. You look at Venezuela for example -- Venezuela we went from a 5 to 1 exchange rate at the beginning of '15 to a 200 to 1 at the end of '15. And so in some of these markets, we've kind of taken the full brunt of the hit, we'll see what happens from here. But I think in terms of OIBDA being about $115 million to $125 million. And then lastly, on Comcast, yes, the Comcast deal is effective January, and for that new deal will be in our first quarter reported results."

So we have happy audience that we're nourishing, that're spending a lot of time with us. And Oprah is very engaged. We grew our audience double-digit. We have a very strong leadership team there, with Erik and Sheri Salata working very closely with Oprah. She worked with them for many years at Harpo. So I feel like we're on a very strong trajectory. In terms of affiliate fees, more than 80% of the affiliate fees are locked with meaningful increases and the channel's in almost 90 million homes. And so we took a channel that was in 75 million homes and had no sub fees four years ago. It's in almost 90 million homes. It's making a lot of money, it's a top network and Oprah has created a great success. The channel is owned 50-50. As we disclosed when we did the deal, Oprah has some stage puts that she can elect to take or not. The first election opportunity is this year and they're staged throughout the next 6 or 7 years and we love the channel. If over time, the channel ends up -- we have an opportunity to own more of the channel, that's only a good thing for us. We're very confident in it. We think it has a great niche and some very strong IP. And over time, as our interest grows, if we have an opportunity to consolidate it, that would be very favorable for us. But in the meantime, it's a 50-50 venture with Oprah having rights to put interest to us overtime beginning this year, and she's very happy with the venture, we're very happy with the venture, and it's quite a success story."

We have this huge library of content in kids and sports, in nonfiction and drama that we own. And so the deals that we've done is almost all incremental because we haven't bought any content to provide these exclusive packages. And so whether they come in the form of launching an additional 2 or 3 channels in a market in language or whether it comes in providing exclusive content, it's content that we already own, and so it's all incremental. I think it's less likely to happen here, and we will see how things develop. Right now, TV Everywhere is our #1 priority giving our content to the distributors. Here we are in the U.S., we're having high single digit affiliate growth, Universe is starting to hold its own and our viewership is growing, we have a very healthy U.S. business, and so, I think a part of that is going back to our distributors and working with them on TV Everywhere, working with them on VOD, working with them on authenticated apps, which benefits both of us. And so, I think that we've started to tilt. We've got a long way to go, but we've started to tilt in a very positive direction with TV Everywhere, which is a very attractive instrument versus kind of the blunt force instruments of a -- of some of the SVOD platforms that have no advertising, no branding and our kind of operating outside the existing infrastructure."

But we'll be the only place to get all of the Olympics in the U.K. for the next decade. We were able to get pricing that was significantly more favorable than is in our plan, and it also allows us now to do a Pan-European feed of the Olympics from an advertising perspective also, because we can reach almost all 700 million people. So I would say that from something that we felt, in terms of modeling, that it would be profitable, given the conversations that we're having across Europe, owning the Olympic IP, we feel confident that it will be meaningfully profitable over the decade, but also that it will be a big helper to us as we build our mobile strategy, as we build our direct-to-consumer strategy and as we look to drive affiliate revenue.

With regard to the U.S. Olympics, which maybe a part of your question, yes, we do expect it to have an impact, certainly on our total ad sales in the third quarter, as obviously that's a large amount of ad sales to fill. And with regard to kind of the move to digital, look, clearly, what we're still seeing is the trend out of print, out of radio, out of outdoor into TV and into digital. And so when we think about the TV ad sales clearly doing better than people thought, 6, 12 months ago, I think it does come down still to reach. I mean to look at Racing Extinction, for example, reached 31 million viewers. That kind of reach is invaluable and very hard to achieve on digital. So those kind of shows and assets for us clearly drive a lot of ad sales volume and pricing. So I think that we're still seeing some of the more secular trends into TV and digital, with Olympic impacting really isolated for us only in the third quarter."

While it was a year that saw secular and economic challenges around the world, including strong currency headwinds, Discovery continued to",1565,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2015 was a year of solid growth for Discovery Communications. While it was a year that saw secular and economic challenges around the world, including strong currency headwinds, Discovery continued to benefit from our investments in content, brands and IP and our ability to execute in all types of macroeconomic environments. 
We experienced strong growth last year as we continued to execute on our key strategic objectives of growing global market share, launching new products and platforms and investing in more high-quality content and brands with universal appeal across our worldwide platform, including over the past couple of years, expanding and strengthening our content mix to focus in more on must-have categories that are more appealing to consumers, such as Sports in Europe and Kids in Latin America. 
In terms of audience share, our U.S. network delivery again outperformed the marketplace, led by Discovery Channel, Investigation Discovery, Science, Velocity and OWN. 
We continued to capture more viewers with our 11% portfolio share across cable. Most notably, Discovery Channel was the #1 non-sports cable network for men for the year, had its most-watched year ever across all demos and grew total audience in the U.S. by 12%, with women up high single digits year-over-year. 
Investigation Discovery continues to grow and prosper in ways the marketplace still hasn't given full value.  ID was the #1 network for women in total day in the full fourth quarter and #3 for the full year in the United States. 
For 4 years, 16 consecutive quarters in a row, ID has been the #1 network for length of tune in all of television in total day delivery. Just an incredible performance. 
This performance also means that ID has significant opportunity to grow CPMs in recognition of this delivery strength. 
Last year, ID improved pricing, increased revenue and drew many new advertisers. The mystery and crime genre continues to pay and play remarkably well around the world, and ID had its largest international audience ever in 2015, growing 20%. 
Going forward, we will continue to roll out ID to additional new markets, and we're just getting started. 
Our success was not limited to Discovery Channel and ID. OWN had its most-watched year in network history, achieving its fourth consecutive year of double-digit prime growth in total viewers. 
Oprah is fully engaged and the channel, together with a lot of original content and Tyler Perry and Oprah's Magic, continues to grow in a meaningful way. 
And Velocity added nearly 5 million subscribers in the U.S. and had prime viewership among men, up 24%. It is totally dominating the popular auto category, where nearly 30% of the advertisers on Velocity are endemic and exclusive to this channel. 
Across Discovery's International portfolio, overall viewership was up more than 10% in 2015, driven most notably by the appeal of our female lifestyle brands such as TLC and Home & Health and increasingly our new Eurosport platform, which is growing aggressively. 
We also expanded the reach with several new channel launches, including multiple localized versions of Eurosport and new free-to-air channels in Italy, Turkey, Finland and the Middle East. 
And recently, we launched Turbo Velocity in New Zealand and increased distribution of Turbo Velocity 30% across Latin America in 2015. 
Our success across a diverse set of markets illustrates our ability to grow in both emerging and established economies. Our increases in network delivery in the U.S. and abroad yielded strong ad sale results. 
In the U.S., our sales team drove ad revenues up an impressive 5% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. 
Internationally, organic sales were up 12% for the fourth quarter and 11% for the year, driven by strength in Latin America and Southern Europe. 
This strength was due to our continued investment in diversifying our portfolio of brands and must-have content. 
Perhaps the best indicator of this was our groundbreaking agreement for the Olympic Games across Europe for the next decade. We have already started to monetize our Olympics investment, with our first sublicensing deal with the BBC announced earlier this month. The value of this deal meaningfully exceeded our business plan and ensures that in the U.K., Eurosport will be the only place where people will have access to all of the Olympic events for the next decade. 
During the year, Eurosport expanded its reach to now more than 150 million homes, up double digits since we took control and added more than 100 long-term sports rights deals, including key renewals like the Australian Open  and the U.S. Open. 
Many of our rights are exclusive and include reasonable and monitizeable price increases, which ensures that Eurosport will be profitable and will remain profitable. These steps help drive double-digit increases in viewership on Eurosport across all of Europe. 
Discovery's portfolio of brands continues to also drive strong affiliate growth. Internationally, we redefined the value of our networks, with strong affiliate renewals with carriers in markets including Sweden, Singapore, France and Poland, driven by our growing audience share, investment in local sports rights and the Olympics. The strength of our portfolio was particularly evident in 2 recent negotiations: with Telia in Sweden and with Telenor in the Nordics, where we ended up pulling our signal in our drive to obtain strong sub fee  increases. We are taking a much more aggressive stand to fight for the value of our content and to drive meaningfully higher sub fees. 
In both instances, after we went dark, we ended up with strong renewals and a very favorable economic result. 
While being dark on Telenor for 11 days this month means we will yield a small negative impact on our first quarter results from the loss of advertising revenues for those 11 days, our medium and long-term results will be much, much better and we will recognize significantly more value across our portfolio in that Northern European region. 
We are also starting to see additional financial upside as international distributors are increasingly looking for ways to differentiate their offerings to consumers with exclusive content and IP. This dynamic is a change in the marketplace and creates a significant opportunity for us that really is all incremental growth since we own all of our own content. 
The diversity of our content portfolio enables us to be best positioned to create exclusive content and exclusive channel packages for many current and new distribution partners, and we are in conversations with many distributors about this around the world. 
Some examples of providing our partners with exclusive content are: a terrific deal we did with NC+ in Poland, which is part of the Canal Plus Group; and 2 deals we did in the Middle East, one with OSN and another with BN, where we were able to give each distributor exclusive access to different packages of Discovery Networks. And in all 3 cases, we were able to yield significant incremental revenue. 
In 2015, Discovery made several senior A+ hires to focus on growing our revenues across all platforms. We hired a new Chief Commercial Officer, Paul Guyardo, and his team is focused on a 3-prong multiplatform strategy to reach viewers across any and all devices and monetize this additional viewing. 
First, in the U.S.,we're focused on reaching new viewers and strengthening the offerings of the MVPD ecosystem through TV Everywhere.  In December, we launched Discovery GO, an authenticated TV Everywhere product in partnership with several U.S. distributors.  While it is very early days, initial results are extremely encouraging as the number of users, ad streams and ad dollars are all ahead of plan.  Discovery GO also is helping us reach younger audiences, with almost half of its users in the 18 to 34 demo. 
Internationally, we are rolling out a kids TV Everywhere product called Discovery Kids Play in Latin America, which launched with Sky in Brazil in December and last week with DISH in Mexico. 
Second, as we look to reach millennial audiences by bringing our linear brands to new platforms, we're also creating exciting new content for digital natives, including daily news and short form docs. Audiences and advertisers are engaged in what Discovery Digital Networks are doing, and we see it because we have 350 million streams a month. 
Finally, we will continue to develop our direct-to-consumer products to complement our linear content and fuel the passion of our superfans. 
In Europe, we have been aggressively expanding our Dplay and Eurosport Player products, which both recorded double-digit subscriber growth in 2015. 
I am proud of all that Discovery achieved in 2015. While the world is changing, we are changing with it. And we enter 2016 with strong long-term deals locked in, our content compelling, our brands never stronger, all yielding real business momentum. 
Near term, ad trends are very healthy domestically, and we expect double-digit growth internationally, and our global affiliate growth is locked in over the next several years due to contracted price escalators. Our ownership of world-class content and IP at a lower cost per hour and in popular genres that play well all over the world gives us valuable optionality to monetize our content as media consumption continues to grow across all screens. This is what sets Discovery apart, and we see more growth in the years to come. 
I will now turn the call over to Andy for details on our financial results."
22666093,318735658,936001,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Despite continued secular challenges in the U.S. and currency headwinds internationally, we are pleased with our 2015 performance, and optimistic about our continued ability to execute on our",2111,"Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. 
Despite continued secular challenges in the U.S. and currency headwinds internationally, we are pleased with our 2015 performance, and optimistic about our continued ability to execute on our stated strategic and financial objectives and 3-year Investor Day guidance metrics going forward. 
For the full year 2015, all of our income statement metrics were in line with or exceeded our original guidance metrics. Excluding FX, Discovery's revenues increased 10%, adjusted OIBDA increased 4% and adjusted EPS was up 13%. 
On a reported basis, Discovery's total company revenues for the year increased 2%, adjusted OIBDA decreased 4% and adjusted EPS also decreased 4%. 
As expected, given that approximately half of our revenues are now outside the U.S., the strengthening dollar was again a major headwind in 2015 as changes in currency rates, especially Latin American currencies and the euro, had a year-over-year negative impact of over $460 million or 8% on revenues and over $185 million or 8% negative impact in adjusted OIBDA and $0.30 or 17% negative above and below-the-line impact on adjusted EPS. 
On an organic basis, or excluding the impact of foreign currency, Eurosport, the SBS Radio sale and the consolidation of Discovery Family, full year total company revenues grew 6% and adjusted OIBDA grew 3% as we again demonstrated our ability to deliver consistently strong financial results even as we continue to invest in strengthening our global IP, platforms and brands. 
Full year net income available to Discovery Communications of $1 billion was down versus last year, driven by the negative currency impacts on our above and below-the-line results, partially offset by the benefit of our lower effective tax rate. 
Our full year effective tax rate came down another 200 basis points to 33% as we remain laser-focused on lowering both our effective and cash tax rates by fully utilizing the increasingly international mix of our business. 
For the full year, free cash flow decreased 2% to $1.17 billion, primarily driven by timing of working capital, higher content spend and the negative impacts from currency partially offset by lower cash taxes, long-term incentive payments and capital expenditures. 
Free cash flow came in just below our guidance of up low single digits due to foreign exchange, as the ultimate year-over-year FX impact on adjusted OIBDA was higher than anticipated and there were additional negative currency impacts on working capital, especially in the last quarter of the year. 
Excluding the impact of currency, full year free cash flow was up approximately 8% versus 2014. 
Focusing now on our fourth quarter results only. Reported total company revenues were down 2% and reported adjusted OIBDA was down 10%. Organic revenues, however, were up 8%, and organic adjusted OIBDA was up 1% as expenses in the quarter grew faster than revenue, primarily due to higher content and marketing costs. 
Net income available to Discovery Communications decreased to $219 million, primarily due to foreign exchange and losses associated with the sale of businesses in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring costs and higher equity earnings. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.38 compared to $0.43 a year ago, while fourth quarter currency constant adjusted EPS was actually up 12%. 
Free cash flow increased an impressive 53% in the quarter to $598 million, primarily due to lower cash taxes and timing of working capital, partially offset by negative impact of foreign exchange. 
Moving now to the individual operating units. Despite continued concerns about domestic secular trends, our U.S. Networks' fourth quarter revenues grew a solid 6%, driven by 7% distribution and 5% advertising growth. 
U.S. distribution revenues were up 7%, consistent with 2015's previously reported organic quarterly growth rates. While total portfolio subs did decline by just over 1% year-over-year, we again benefited from the higher rates we garnered from our deals with NTTC, Cablevision, Sony and others at the end of 2014 and early 2015 as well as some contributions from our Hulu deal. 
On the advertising side, we are extremely pleased to report another quarter of mid-single-digit growth, with ad sales up 5%. 
As David mentioned, our ratings again outperformed the industry and this outperformance allowed us to benefit from robust scatter pricing and volume as well as stronger overall market demand. 
Looking ahead to 2016, given current ad market trends of stronger scatter pricing and our improving total impressions, we expect U.S. year-over-year ad sales growth in the first quarter to again be up mid-single digits. 
While we continue to see strong ad demand in pricing, we're still taking a more conservative view on our full year ad sales and expect growth trends to moderate in the future quarters, largely driven by the impact of the Olympics in the third quarter. 
Fourth quarter domestic adjusted OIBDA was at 1% as operating expenses were up 11%. Cost to revenues were up 12% due to writing off certain Discovery and Animal Planet programming as our new creative management team focused on pivoting the networks towards more on-brand content, and SG&A was up 8% due to increased marketing spend. 
For the full year 2015, total U.S. revenues and adjusted OIBDA were both up 6%. Excluding the impact of consolidating Discovery Family, full year U.S. revenues were up 4%, with advertising up 2% and distribution revenues up 7%, while total costs were up 4%, leading to adjusted OIBDA growing 3%. 
Turning to the International segment. Our International Networks delivered another quarter of strong organic ad and distribution growth as we executed very well on our stated objectives of high single digit organic affiliate growth and low double digit organic advertising growth for the fourth quarter and full year. 
As already mentioned, the flip side of having a large, growing international business is that currency remained a major headwind on reported results versus 2014. 
Foreign exchange reduced fourth quarter International revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth rates by 13% and 17%, respectively, and reduced full year revenue and adjusted OIBDA by 14% and 16%, respectively. 
Reported results also include Eurosport and the recently divested SBS Radio business. 
For comparability purposes, the following International commentary will refer to our organic results only, they exclude the impacts of Eurosport, SBS Radio and foreign exchange. 
Fourth quarter International revenue was up 11%, led by 12% advertising growth and 8% distribution growth. Advertising again grew double digits in the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher pricing and ratings in Southern Europe, higher pricing and volume in Latin America as well as higher pricing and volume in Asia. Affiliate revenues had another robust quarter of solid growth, increasing 8%. 
For the full year, organic advertising revenues were up 11% and organic distribution revenues were up 7%. Despite the ad sales ban and rules change in Russia, we were able to deliver very impressive growth rates that reflect the vitality of our international brands and business. 
Looking ahead, at our Investor Day, we stated that International advertising and affiliate revenues excluding currency would each grow in the high single-digit range over the next 3 years. Given the current advertising strength in many of our markets, especially in Latin America and Southern Europe, where we're still benefiting from share gains as well as pricing increases, we expect 2016 organic advertising, so excluding the impact of SBS Radio as well as foreign exchange, to continue to grow low double digits. Clearly, our International revenue momentum remains strong and intact. 
Turning to the cost side. Organic operating costs internationally were up 18% in the fourth quarter, driven by increased content and marketing expenses as well as higher personnel costs. Content expenses were higher, primarily due to writing off certain programming, with changes in creative and regional leadership in the Nordics. 
Full year organic costs were up 11%. Adjusted OIBDA grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year. 
Eurosport standalone margins for the full year came in as expected at 7% as we invested in linear and digital sports rights to drive sustained, long-term value. 
As previously stated, we will no longer break out the results of Eurosport going forward as it will not significantly impact the comparability of DNI's results in future periods. 
Now moving on to our Education and Other segment. As expected, this division reported 0 adjusted OIBDA in the fourth quarter and a small operating loss for the year. Given our continuing strategic focus on producing and utilizing more content from our in-house OWN production studios, which has no margin associated with it, and our continued investment in Education's digital textbooks to drive the long term value of the industry disrupting business, this segment will continue to operate around breakeven even though it was expected to grow revenues in 2016. 
Now taking a look at our overall company financial position. In the fourth quarter, we resumed our share buyback program and repurchased $375 million worth of common stock. 
During 2015, we bought back a total of $950 million worth of common and preferred shares, and since the inception of our buyback program in 2010, we have now repurchased over $6.6 billion of our stock, reducing our outstanding share count by over 33%. 
As we look ahead at 2016, our capital allocation priorities remain the same as we best position ourselves for the future. First, to invest in driving organic growth; second, to invest in strategic M&A, platforms and IP that have a strong return on investment; and third, to repurchase our stock. 
As we stated on previous calls, we are firmly committed to remaining an investment-grade rated company and are comfortable with our gross leverage ratio being in the 3.25 to 3.4 leverage range. And we will, therefore, likely raise additional debt in 2016. 
We still intend to be a very active buyer of our stock in 2016 as the IRR on repurchasing our stock remains very compelling given our long-range plan free cash flow per share growth expectations. 
Given this, we expect to continue to allocate a substantial and growing amount of our available capital to share repurchases in 2016 and future years. 
Now let's focus on our financial expectations going forward. As we first announced at our September Investor Day, we still expect our constant currency adjusted EPS CAGR for 2015 to 2018 to grow at least in the low double-digit range. 
I also want to clarify that our expected free cash flow CAGR over the same 3-year period will be on a constant currency basis as we are firmly committing to real operating execution and performance versus uncontrollable foreign exchange movements, which could ultimately have a positive or negative impact on our cash flow results. We still expect this constant currency free cash flow CAGR to also at least be in the low double-digit range. 
Looking specifically at 2016, constant currency adjusted EPS and constant currency free cash flow are both expected to grow robustly in the low double-digit to low teens range. We also expect our full year effective tax rate to come down another 300 basis points to approximately 30%, one year ahead of our previous 30% effective tax rate commitment by 2017. 
Finally, we're again quantifying the expected foreign exchange impact on our 2016 results. 
At current spot rates, FX is expected to negatively impact revenues by approximately $185 million to $195 million and adjusted OIBDA by approximately $115 million to $125 million versus our 2015 reported results. 
While the strong dollar will likely continue to negatively impact our reported results in the near term, currency rates obviously fluctuate up and down, so when FX rates do reverse direction, as they always over time revert back to the mean, this will have a very positive impact on our reported results. 
In closing, I want to emphasize that while we are cognizant of the current challenges in the media space, given our continued global audience share growth, global ad sales momentum, strong base cost productivity, declining effective tax rate and accelerating share repurchase expectations, I'm even more confident today than I was back at our Investor Day that we will certainly achieve or overdeliver on our 3-year financial growth commitments. 
As an example, at our Investor Day, we forecasted that U.S. ad sales would be down low single digits from 2015 through 2018. Yet our current ad sales trend is up mid-single digits. Several other important trends, including U.S. ratings, U.S. sub universe declines and our effective tax rate are also better today than we forecasted back in September. I really do feel great about our portfolio and financial momentum going into 2016. 
Thanks again for your time this morning. And now David and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have."

And for Andy, you talked about global affiliate growth locked in over the next several years due to contracts. Certainly, there's increased investor concerns in media in the U.S. around core cutting and skinny bundle impacts and distributor consolidation, I think. I was just hoping for clarification on the one comment you just made around the sub trends are better than you thought they would be when you gave guidance back in October. Is that an improvement in the marketplace or just you were conservative in your guidance and the trends are unchanged?

Okay, first, we're off to a very good start, where we're attacking digital in, I think, a very sensible way. We've hired a new team, which is headed up by Paul Guyardo, and we have an attack team going hard at TV Everywhere, and we're starting to reap some real results. We're working very closely with Neil Smith and X1, which is a great platform, and we're finding our viewership there is increasing and it's really paying off for us. And we've always said TV Everywhere is a great platform where we can monetize, and we are. I think we are the only company in the U.S. that has created our own aggregated app with D-GO, which has all of our channels on it. And we've now been authenticated with commercials through a number of distributors. It's early days. Time Warner is just launching it as well. But the results early have been quite good. The demo is very young, the engagement is substantial and we have a team that's really working on that and people are getting closer to our brands and we're talking to our customers. So I think a really -- a very positive turn in terms of TV Everywhere and our own authenticated app. Outside the U.S., it's really two things. Our Eurosport app is growing quite effectively. I don't -- we wont reach a million subs in 2016, but we do have a March to a Million, and we're hoping to reach 1 million by '17. And 1 million at $8 a month would be an incremental $100 million. We have a lot more IP for Eurosport that we've been able to aggregate at very reasonable price increases. Eurosport will stay profitable, and this could be meaningfully incremental. When you think about Europe being 700 million people, the ability to drive a direct-to-consumer business here could be quite substantial. And if we can get to 1 million, I think culturally, it could be a tipping point for us. If we can get to 1 million, why can't we get to 3 million, and we have the IP. And finally there's Dplay, which we have in Northern Europe and we're rolling out throughout Europe. And we've been doing that on our own, and we've been doing quite well. But we're learning more and more, and this is my own belief, that there will be some more consolidation in a positive way. There's nothing stopping major distributors in Northern Europe, where we have 30% or 45% of market share, to work with other major programmers. I think that'll probably happen around the world over the next 4 or 5 years, but rather having a number of individual apps to come together. And we're having some of those discussions, and I think to the extent that we do come together with others, that we'll even be more powerful. But when you look at the full portfolio of what we're doing, direct-to-consumer and TV Everywhere, I think we're doing more and we're doing it at lower costs than anyone because we own all of our content. And finally, we're not leaving the youngest demo out with our streaming business. We're not making money on that business today, but we're not losing money. But we have 350 million streams. And so when you think about that 350 million streams, and you think about Vice, and you think about BuzzFeed, that 350 million a month is growing, it's a millennial audience, they're spending time with us. And candidly, we haven't done a great job monetizing those streams. And the CPMs on them are quite good, and now we have a whole team that is attacking the ability to engage with millennials and make money on those streams. So I think we're in a very good spot, and over '16 and '17, I think you'll see some meaningful results, and we'll keep you posted."

And then regarding your question on consolidation, look, as far as the deals with Charter and Time Warner and Cablevision, the impacts there should be de minimus given the rate structures. And regarding DIRECTV and AT&T, they're both paying at their rates that they always have in the past. And when that deal comes up, we'll have a sense of kind of what -- how that will play out. But right now, the rate structure seem to be very much in line with what we've had in the past."

David, as we kind of settle into 2016 here and look back on last year a little bit, with Apple, we saw this issue of when ADQ and Apple sit down with the content providers and your peers, and they all, the programmers, are dead set on keeping all of the networks in the bundle, whether it be a streaming bundle the likes of which people thought Apple might launch, those networks would include sports. And it just got to the point where the cost to the consumer would would've been too high for kind of expanded online streaming offering. Where do you think we are in that conversation? And from here, is there anything that could change? What kind of has to happen for the industry to get closer to seeing more over-the-top services with fewer core networks included in those services, such that they're actually appealing to the customer? 
And then Andy, I just wondered, if you look at your deals with Go90, Hulu and Sony, can you quantify how much those are adding on a quarterly basis? Like how much do they contribute to affiliate fee growth in the fourth quarter? And then in your 2016 guidance, maybe you can help us with -- I think you said high single digit for overall U.S. affiliate fees, that's your long term, and then it sounds like that's intact for '16. And then just clarify what's included in that for those 3 deals, that would be really helpful."

Well, look, I think in '15, there was all this noise around skinny bundles. And I've said before that the majority of programmers have contracts at least for the next several years, that maybe there could be a little bit of that, but that the ability to really start changing the way you offer services, it's going to be another cycle, which will be several years. Having said that, we're very well positioned for that skinny bundle in 2 ways. One, we have 14 channels that represent 11% or 12% of the viewership, but we're only reaping about 6% of the cost. So we're relatively inexpensive. So when Eddie was looking for channels, and we have the #1 channel for men with Discovery, the #1 channel for women with ID, and we have all these affinity networks, the top network with TLC and Science and -- you can pick up 14 channels for less than the cost of one regional sports network. So one, it's a very efficient piece. Two is, if we needed to go to our top 8, we make 86% of our revenue and more than 90% of our EBITDA from our top 8 networks. And so if it ever did happen here in the U.S, we would be well positioned. I don't believe it's going to -- and sitting down with the distributors themselves, with all the talk of the skinny bundle, and as appealing as it seems, most consumers seem to want the big bundle. And I think probably the most encouraging thing is that cable seems to be -- their numbers have really turned around. As Andy said, we haven't really -- we've seen it, but we haven't seen the full effect of it because there's a few month gap between when they announce and when we actually get paid. But it's very encouraging that there seems to be a change in the universe dynamics. It's also, as you look at the U.S., I think our U.S. business now looks like a meaningful growth business. We have advertising market much stronger than we expected, our viewership is growing and the universe decline and the skinny bundle noise seems to have dissipated to kind of a reality, which is not too much on skinny bundle and universe maybe turning around. And so, I think quite encouraging for the next couple of years. I'd like over-the-top to happen in a meaningful way because I think ultimately, we have really good services, our channels are on brand and they're reasonable. And we'll be one of the big recipients of that, but I think it's going to be a while."

Because I think that deal was signed last summer. I just wanted to see if you would comment there. 
And then David, I thought your comments on the Telenor situation was really interesting. You know better than anybody that there are big differences between kind of European distribution and U.S. distribution dynamics. But how do you look at the increasing tension between programmers and distributors in Europe as you move forward? Do you view it as an opportunity to maybe accelerate your business and maybe you were underpaid historically? Or do you think that's going to create more volatility in the results? What could you tell us since you're much closer to that than we are?"

So with Telenor and with Telia, we were able to get meaningful step ups in increases. Remember that Europe and Latin America are a little bit different than the U.S. in that historically, Latin America has been mostly no price increases. Your increases came from sub growth. And Europe was working like that until 2 years ago. And so we started to drive that idea in the last 2 years, and we've been getting increases. But this -- but in the last 12 months, we've taken the position that we need much more substantial increases. And putting Kids together with our channels in Latin America and Sports together with our suite and free-to-air and IP and all of our content together in Europe has helped us get bigger increases. But in order to get it, we really need to stand up for the value of our content. So we had to pull our signals twice. So I think there's 2 buckets. One is, you're going to see us fighting for significant incremental affiliate revenue, and between the Olympics and Eurosport and the strength of Discovery and the strength of our female portfolio around the world, we think that we can get that, and you'll start to see our affiliate line growing in a meaningful way over the next -- it's long cycle, over the next year, 2 years, 3 years, just like we did here in the U.S. And we have some optimism that maybe we could even do meaningfully better than that, because our IP, we think, is quite good. But we're going to have to fight for it. And I think the reverberation of pulling those signals in Northern Europe has been valuable and the deals that we've done recently have been very, very favorable, that's one. Two, you bring up a point that is a new phenomenon, but it's all incremental to us. The idea that distributors in Europe are starting to compete more aggressively is a real helper to us. And what they're starting to do, which we didn't anticipate, is that whether you're a satellite, cable or phone player, for the first time over the last 12 months, they have felt that owning the pipe directly to the handset or to the home is not enough. They need to be decommoditize that pipe by owning unique, exclusive content. And so this is really a new idea here. So we sell our 10 channels and then we get a distributor coming to us saying, ""Do you have other great IP you could sell just to us that we could promote that we have just this content in the market."" So we have been able to do -- we've done 4 of those deals in the last 6 months. None of those were in our plan 4 months ago, 5 months ago. It's all incremental to us, our channel is in language and I think that if it continues, if you have the BTs fighting with the Skys, if you have -- in each market, if you have this competitive dynamic, and we can raise our hand and say we have kids IP, we have sports IP, we have excess drama and nonfiction IP, that, that could be a whole incremental vein of revenue for us, and we're starting to see it. If it continues, we'll be able to break it out for you in the years to come, but it's very positive. And so what we see internationally is double-digit growth, even though it's basically been flatlining for the last couple of years, and that will continue, advertising remains strong. We have this new vein of opportunity with these distributors wanting exclusive content, and the Olympics is going to help us with that. And so, I think quite favorable. The big negative is currency. Our International business is really -- it's doing extremely well. The big issue is currency."

I appreciate there's a lot of moving parts here, with some write offs and onetime items in the fourth quarter. So let me just provide some clarity and perspective. For 2015, kind of apples-to-apples constant currency, SG&A total company was up low single digits with content costs up low double as we invested in Rich Ross [ph], in Discovery and in Sports, et cetera. As I look into 2016, we see constant currency OpEx, SG&A up, again, only low single digits, with cost to revenue being up high single. So total cost, I'll call it mid-single for 2016. Just again to clarify the foreign exchange impact in '16, we're saying that for OIBDA it will be about $115 million to $125 million. And as David said, look, clearly, foreign exchange has been a very challenging element for us given our -- the size of our international portfolio. The good news I'll say on FX is, you look at some of the movements in currency last year, some of these markets really can't get any worse. You look at Venezuela for example -- Venezuela we went from a 5 to 1 exchange rate at the beginning of '15 to a 200 to 1 at the end of '15. And so in some of these markets, we've kind of taken the full brunt of the hit. We'll see what happens from here. But think in terms of OIBDA being about $115 million to $125 million. And then lastly, on Comcast, yes, the Comcast deal is effective January, and so that new deal will be in our first quarter reported results."

So we have a happy audience that we're nourishing, that they're spending a lot of time with us. And Oprah is very engaged. We grew our audience double-digit. We have a very strong leadership team there, with Erik and Sheri Salata working very closely with Oprah. She worked with them for many years at Harpo. And so I feel like we're on a very strong trajectory. In terms of affiliate fees, more than 80% of the affiliate fees are locked with meaningful increases and the channel's in almost 90 million homes. And so we took a channel that was in 75 million homes and had no sub fees four years ago. It's in almost 90 million homes. It's making a lot of money, it's a top network and Oprah has created a great success. The channel is owned 50-50. As we disclosed when we did the deal, Oprah has some staged puts that she can elect to take or not. The first election opportunity is this year, and they're staged throughout the next 6 or 7 years. And we love the channel. If over time, the channel ends up -- we have an opportunity to own more of the channel, that's only a good thing for us. We're very confident in it. We think it has a great niche and some very strong IP. And over time, as our interest grows, if we have an opportunity to consolidate it, that would be very favorable for us. But in the meantime, it's a 50-50 venture, with Oprah having rights to put interest to us over time, beginning this year, and she's very happy with the venture, we're very happy with the venture and it's quite a success story."

We have this huge library of content in kids, in sports, in nonfiction and drama that we own. And so the deals that we've done is almost all incremental because we haven't bought any content to provide these exclusive packages. And so whether they come in the form of launching an additional 2 or 3 channels in a market, in language, or whether it comes in providing exclusive content, it's content that we already own and so it's all incremental. I think it's less likely to happen here, and we will see how things develop. Right now, TV Everywhere is our #1 priority, giving our content to the distributors. Here we are in the U.S., we're having high single-digit affiliate growth, Universe is starting to hold its own and our viewership is growing. We have a very healthy U.S. business, and so I think a part of that is going back to our distributors and working with them on TV Everywhere, working with them on VOD, working with them on authenticated apps, which benefits both of us. And so, I think that we've started to tilt. We've got a long way to go, but we've started to tilt in a very positive direction with TV Everywhere, which is a very attractive instrument versus kind of the blunt force instrument of a -- of some of the SVOD platforms that have no advertising, no branding and are kind of operating outside the existing infrastructure."

With regard to the U.S. Olympics, which may be a part of your question, yes, we do expect it to have an impact certainly on our total ad sales in the third quarter, as obviously that's a large amount of ad sales to fill. And with regard to kind of the move to digital, look, clearly, what we're still seeing is the trend out of print, out of radio, out of outdoor into TV and into digital. And so when we think about the TV ad sales clearly doing better than people thought 6, 12 months ago, I think it does come down still to reach. I mean if you look at Racing Extinction, for example, reached 31 million viewers. That kind of reach is invaluable and very hard to achieve on digital. So those kind of shows and assets for us clearly drive a lot of ad sales volume and pricing. So I think we're still seeing some of the more secular trends into TV and digital, with Olympic impacting really isolated for us only in the third quarter."

While it was a year that saw secular and economic challenges around the world, including strong currency headwinds, Discovery continued to",1566,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2015 was a year of solid growth for Discovery Communications. While it was a year that saw secular and economic challenges around the world, including strong currency headwinds, Discovery continued to benefit from our investments in content, brands and IP and our ability to execute in all types of macroeconomic environments. 
We experienced strong growth last year as we continued to execute on our key strategic objectives of growing global market share, launching new products and platforms and investing in more high-quality content and brands with universal appeal across our worldwide platform, including over the past couple of years, expanding and strengthening our content mix to focus in more on must-have categories that are more appealing to consumers, such as Sports in Europe and Kids in Latin America. 
In terms of audience share, our U.S. network delivery again outperformed the marketplace, led by Discovery Channel, Investigation Discovery, Science, Velocity and OWN. 
We continued to capture more viewers with our 11% portfolio share across cable. Most notably, Discovery Channel was the #1 non-sports cable network for men for the year, had its most-watched year ever across all demos and grew total audience in the U.S. by 12%, with women up high single digits year-over-year. 
Investigation Discovery continues to grow and prosper in ways the marketplace still hasn't given full value. ID was the #1 network for women in total day in the full fourth quarter and #3 for the full year in the United States. 
For 4 years, 16 consecutive quarters in a row, ID has been the #1 network for length of tune in all of television in total day delivery. Just an incredible performance. 
This performance also means that ID has significant opportunity to grow CPMs in recognition of this delivery strength. 
Last year, ID improved pricing, increased revenue and drew many new advertisers. The mystery and crime genre continues to pay and play remarkably well around the world, and ID had its largest international audience ever in 2015, growing 20%. 
Going forward, we will continue to roll out ID to additional new markets, and we're just getting started. 
Our success was not limited to Discovery Channel and ID. OWN had its most-watched year in network history, achieving its fourth consecutive year of double-digit prime growth in total viewers. 
Oprah is fully engaged and the channel, together with a lot of original content and Tyler Perry and Oprah's Magic, continues to grow in a meaningful way. 
And Velocity added nearly 5 million subscribers in the U.S. and had prime viewership among men, up 24%. It is totally dominating the popular auto category, where nearly 30% of the advertisers on Velocity are endemic and exclusive to this channel. 
Across Discovery's International portfolio, overall viewership was up more than 10% in 2015, driven most notably by the appeal of our female lifestyle brands such as TLC and Home & Health and increasingly our new Eurosport platform, which is growing aggressively. 
We also expanded the reach with several new channel launches, including multiple localized versions of Eurosport and new free-to-air channels in Italy, Turkey, Finland and the Middle East. 
And recently, we launched Turbo Velocity in New Zealand and increased distribution of Turbo Velocity 30% across Latin America in 2015. 
Our success across a diverse set of markets illustrates our ability to grow in both emerging and established economies. Our increases in network delivery in the U.S. and abroad yielded strong ad sale results. 
In the U.S., our sales team drove ad revenues up an impressive 5% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. 
Internationally, organic sales were up 12% for the fourth quarter and 11% for the year, driven by strength in Latin America and Southern Europe. 
This strength was due to our continued investment in diversifying our portfolio of brands and must-have content. 
Perhaps the best indicator of this was our groundbreaking agreement for the Olympic Games across Europe for the next decade. We have already started to monetize our Olympics investment, with our first sublicensing deal with the BBC announced earlier this month. The value of this deal meaningfully exceeded our business plan and ensures that in the U.K., Eurosport will be the only place where people will have access to all of the Olympic events for the next decade. 
During the year, Eurosport expanded its reach to now more than 150 million homes, up double digits since we took control and added more than 100 long-term sports rights deals, including key renewals like the Australian Open and the U.S. Open. 
Many of our rights are exclusive and include reasonable and monitizeable price increases, which ensures that Eurosport will be profitable and will remain profitable. These steps help drive double-digit increases in viewership on Eurosport across all of Europe. 
Discovery's portfolio of brands continues to also drive strong affiliate growth. Internationally, we redefined the value of our networks, with strong affiliate renewals with carriers in markets including Sweden, Singapore, France and Poland, driven by our growing audience share, investment in local sports rights and the Olympics. The strength of our portfolio was particularly evident in 2 recent negotiations: with Telia in Sweden and with Telenor in the Nordics, where we ended up pulling our signal in our drive to obtain strong sub fee increases. We are taking a much more aggressive stand to fight for the value of our content and to drive meaningfully higher sub fees. 
In both instances, after we went dark, we ended up with strong renewals and a very favorable economic result. 
While being dark on Telenor for 11 days this month means we will yield a small negative impact on our first quarter results from the loss of advertising revenues for those 11 days, our medium and long-term results will be much, much better and we will recognize significantly more value across our portfolio in that Northern European region. 
We are also starting to see additional financial upside as international distributors are increasingly looking for ways to differentiate their offerings to consumers with exclusive content and IP. This dynamic is a change in the marketplace and creates a significant opportunity for us that really is all incremental growth since we own all of our own content. 
The diversity of our content portfolio enables us to be best positioned to create exclusive content and exclusive channel packages for many current and new distribution partners, and we are in conversations with many distributors about this around the world. 
Some examples of providing our partners with exclusive content are: a terrific deal we did with NC+ in Poland, which is part of the Canal Plus Group; and 2 deals we did in the Middle East, one with OSN and another with BN, where we were able to give each distributor exclusive access to different packages of Discovery Networks. And in all 3 cases, we were able to yield significant incremental revenue. 
In 2015, Discovery made several senior A+ hires to focus on growing our revenues across all platforms. We hired a new Chief Commercial Officer, Paul Guyardo, and his team is focused on a 3-prong multiplatform strategy to reach viewers across any and all devices and monetize this additional viewing. 
First, in the U.S., we're focused on reaching new viewers and strengthening the offerings of the MVPD ecosystem through TV Everywhere. In December, we launched Discovery GO, an authenticated TV Everywhere product in partnership with several U.S. distributors. While it is very early days, initial results are extremely encouraging as the number of users, ad streams and ad dollars are all ahead of plan. Discovery GO also is helping us reach younger audiences, with almost half of its users in the 18 to 34 demo. 
Internationally, we are rolling out a kids TV Everywhere product called Discovery Kids Play in Latin America, which launched with Sky in Brazil in December and last week with DISH in Mexico. 
Second, as we look to reach millennial audiences by bringing our linear brands to new platforms, we're also creating exciting new content for digital natives, including daily news and short form docs. Audiences and advertisers are engaged in what Discovery Digital Networks are doing, and we see it because we have 350 million streams a month. 
Finally, we will continue to develop our direct-to-consumer products to complement our linear content and fuel the passion of our superfans. 
In Europe, we have been aggressively expanding our Dplay and Eurosport Player products, which both recorded double-digit subscriber growth in 2015. 
I am proud of all that Discovery achieved in 2015. While the world is changing, we are changing with it. And we enter 2016 with strong long-term deals locked in, our content compelling, our brands never stronger, all yielding real business momentum. 
Near term, ad trends are very healthy domestically, and we expect double-digit growth internationally, and our global affiliate growth is locked in over the next several years due to contracted price escalators. Our ownership of world-class content and IP at a lower cost per hour and in popular genres that play well all over the world gives us valuable optionality to monetize our content as media consumption continues to grow across all screens. This is what sets Discovery apart, and we see more growth in the years to come. 
I will now turn the call over to Andy for details on our financial results."

Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Despite continued secular challenges in the U.S. and currency headwinds internationally, we are pleased with our 2015 performance, and optimistic about our continued ability to execute on our",2111,"Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. 
Despite continued secular challenges in the U.S. and currency headwinds internationally, we are pleased with our 2015 performance, and optimistic about our continued ability to execute on our stated strategic and financial objectives and 3-year Investor Day guidance metrics going forward. 
For the full year 2015, all of our income statement metrics were in line with or exceeded our original guidance metrics. Excluding FX, Discovery's revenues increased 10%, adjusted OIBDA increased 4% and adjusted EPS was up 13%. 
On a reported basis, Discovery's total company revenues for the year increased 2%, adjusted OIBDA decreased 4% and adjusted EPS also decreased 4%. 
As expected, given that approximately half of our revenues are now outside the U.S., the strengthening dollar was again a major headwind in 2015 as changes in currency rates, especially Latin American currencies and the euro, had a year-over-year negative impact of over $460 million or 8% on revenues and over $185 million or 8% negative impact in adjusted OIBDA and $0.30 or 17% negative above and below-the-line impact on adjusted EPS. 
On an organic basis, or excluding the impact of foreign currency, Eurosport, the SBS Radio sale and the consolidation of Discovery Family, full year total company revenues grew 6% and adjusted OIBDA grew 3% as we again demonstrated our ability to deliver consistently strong financial results even as we continue to invest in strengthening our global IP, platforms and brands. 
Full year net income available to Discovery Communications of $1 billion was down versus last year, driven by the negative currency impacts on our above and below-the-line results, partially offset by the benefit of our lower effective tax rate. 
Our full year effective tax rate came down another 200 basis points to 33% as we remain laser-focused on lowering both our effective and cash tax rates by fully utilizing the increasingly international mix of our business. 
For the full year, free cash flow decreased 2% to $1.17 billion, primarily driven by timing of working capital, higher content spend and the negative impacts from currency partially offset by lower cash taxes, long-term incentive payments and capital expenditures. 
Free cash flow came in just below our guidance of up low single digits due to foreign exchange, as the ultimate year-over-year FX impact on adjusted OIBDA was higher than anticipated and there were additional negative currency impacts on working capital, especially in the last quarter of the year. 
Excluding the impact of currency, full year free cash flow was up approximately 8% versus 2014. 
Focusing now on our fourth quarter results only. Reported total company revenues were down 2% and reported adjusted OIBDA was down 10%. Organic revenues, however, were up 8%, and organic adjusted OIBDA was up 1% as expenses in the quarter grew faster than revenue, primarily due to higher content and marketing costs. 
Net income available to Discovery Communications decreased to $219 million, primarily due to foreign exchange and losses associated with the sale of businesses in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring costs and higher equity earnings. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.38 compared to $0.43 a year ago, while fourth quarter currency constant adjusted EPS was actually up 12%. 
Free cash flow increased an impressive 53% in the quarter to $598 million, primarily due to lower cash taxes and timing of working capital, partially offset by negative impact of foreign exchange. 
Moving now to the individual operating units. Despite continued concerns about domestic secular trends, our U.S. Networks' fourth quarter revenues grew a solid 6%, driven by 7% distribution and 5% advertising growth. 
U.S. distribution revenues were up 7%, consistent with 2015's previously reported organic quarterly growth rates. While total portfolio subs did decline by just over 1% year-over-year, we again benefited from the higher rates we garnered from our deals with NTTC, Cablevision, Sony and others at the end of 2014 and early 2015 as well as some contributions from our Hulu deal. 
On the advertising side, we are extremely pleased to report another quarter of mid-single-digit growth, with ad sales up 5%. 
As David mentioned, our ratings again outperformed the industry and this outperformance allowed us to benefit from robust scatter pricing and volume as well as stronger overall market demand. 
Looking ahead to 2016, given current ad market trends of stronger scatter pricing and our improving total impressions, we expect U.S. year-over-year ad sales growth in the first quarter to again be up mid-single digits. 
While we continue to see strong ad demand in pricing, we're still taking a more conservative view on our full year ad sales and expect growth trends to moderate in the future quarters, largely driven by the impact of the Olympics in the third quarter. 
Fourth quarter domestic adjusted OIBDA was at 1% as operating expenses were up 11%. Cost to revenues were up 12% due to writing off certain Discovery and Animal Planet programming as our new creative management team focused on pivoting the networks towards more on-brand content, and SG&A was up 8% due to increased marketing spend. 
For the full year 2015, total U.S. revenues and adjusted OIBDA were both up 6%. Excluding the impact of consolidating Discovery Family, full year U.S. revenues were up 4%, with advertising up 2% and distribution revenues up 7%, while total costs were up 4%, leading to adjusted OIBDA growing 3%. 
Turning to the International segment. Our International Networks delivered another quarter of strong organic ad and distribution growth as we executed very well on our stated objectives of high single digit organic affiliate growth and low double digit organic advertising growth for the fourth quarter and full year. 
As already mentioned, the flip side of having a large, growing international business is that currency remained a major headwind on reported results versus 2014. 
Foreign exchange reduced fourth quarter International revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth rates by 13% and 17%, respectively, and reduced full year revenue and adjusted OIBDA by 14% and 16%, respectively. 
Reported results also include Eurosport and the recently divested SBS Radio business. 
For comparability purposes, the following International commentary will refer to our organic results only, they exclude the impacts of Eurosport, SBS Radio and foreign exchange. 
Fourth quarter International revenue was up 11%, led by 12% advertising growth and 8% distribution growth. Advertising again grew double digits in the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher pricing and ratings in Southern Europe, higher pricing and volume in Latin America as well as higher pricing and volume in Asia. Affiliate revenues had another robust quarter of solid growth, increasing 8%. 
For the full year, organic advertising revenues were up 11% and organic distribution revenues were up 7%. Despite the ad sales ban and rules change in Russia, we were able to deliver very impressive growth rates that reflect the vitality of our international brands and business. 
Looking ahead, at our Investor Day, we stated that International advertising and affiliate revenues excluding currency would each grow in the high single-digit range over the next 3 years. Given the current advertising strength in many of our markets, especially in Latin America and Southern Europe, where we're still benefiting from share gains as well as pricing increases, we expect 2016 organic advertising, so excluding the impact of SBS Radio as well as foreign exchange, to continue to grow low double digits. Clearly, our International revenue momentum remains strong and intact. 
Turning to the cost side. Organic operating costs internationally were up 18% in the fourth quarter, driven by increased content and marketing expenses as well as higher personnel costs. Content expenses were higher, primarily due to writing off certain programming, with changes in creative and regional leadership in the Nordics. 
Full year organic costs were up 11%. Adjusted OIBDA grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year. 
Eurosport standalone margins for the full year came in as expected at 7% as we invested in linear and digital sports rights to drive sustained, long-term value. 
As previously stated, we will no longer break out the results of Eurosport going forward as it will not significantly impact the comparability of DNI's results in future periods. 
Now moving on to our Education and Other segment. As expected, this division reported 0 adjusted OIBDA in the fourth quarter and a small operating loss for the year. Given our continuing strategic focus on producing and utilizing more content from our in-house OWN production studios, which has no margin associated with it, and our continued investment in Education's digital textbooks to drive the long term value of the industry disrupting business, this segment will continue to operate around breakeven even though it was expected to grow revenues in 2016. 
Now taking a look at our overall company financial position. In the fourth quarter, we resumed our share buyback program and repurchased $375 million worth of common stock. 
During 2015, we bought back a total of $950 million worth of common and preferred shares, and since the inception of our buyback program in 2010, we have now repurchased over $6.6 billion of our stock, reducing our outstanding share count by over 33%. 
As we look ahead at 2016, our capital allocation priorities remain the same as we best position ourselves for the future. First, to invest in driving organic growth; second, to invest in strategic M&A, platforms and IP that have a strong return on investment; and third, to repurchase our stock. 
As we stated on previous calls, we are firmly committed to remaining an investment-grade rated company and are comfortable with our gross leverage ratio being in the 3.25 to 3.4 leverage range. And we will, therefore, likely raise additional debt in 2016. 
We still intend to be a very active buyer of our stock in 2016 as the IRR on repurchasing our stock remains very compelling given our long-range plan free cash flow per share growth expectations. 
Given this, we expect to continue to allocate a substantial and growing amount of our available capital to share repurchases in 2016 and future years. 
Now let's focus on our financial expectations going forward. As we first announced at our September Investor Day, we still expect our constant currency adjusted EPS CAGR for 2015 to 2018 to grow at least in the low double-digit range. 
I also want to clarify that our expected free cash flow CAGR over the same 3-year period will be on a constant currency basis as we are firmly committing to real operating execution and performance versus uncontrollable foreign exchange movements, which could ultimately have a positive or negative impact on our cash flow results. We still expect this constant currency free cash flow CAGR to also at least be in the low double-digit range. 
Looking specifically at 2016, constant currency adjusted EPS and constant currency free cash flow are both expected to grow robustly in the low double-digit to low teens range. We also expect our full year effective tax rate to come down another 300 basis points to approximately 30%, one year ahead of our previous 30% effective tax rate commitment by 2017. 
Finally, we're again quantifying the expected foreign exchange impact on our 2016 results. 
At current spot rates, FX is expected to negatively impact revenues by approximately $185 million to $195 million and adjusted OIBDA by approximately $115 million to $125 million versus our 2015 reported results. 
While the strong dollar will likely continue to negatively impact our reported results in the near term, currency rates obviously fluctuate up and down, so when FX rates do reverse direction, as they always over time revert back to the mean, this will have a very positive impact on our reported results. 
In closing, I want to emphasize that while we are cognizant of the current challenges in the media space, given our continued global audience share growth, global ad sales momentum, strong base cost productivity, declining effective tax rate and accelerating share repurchase expectations, I'm even more confident today than I was back at our Investor Day that we will certainly achieve or overdeliver on our 3-year financial growth commitments. 
As an example, at our Investor Day, we forecasted that U.S. ad sales would be down low single digits from 2015 through 2018. Yet our current ad sales trend is up mid-single digits. Several other important trends, including U.S. ratings, U.S. sub universe declines and our effective tax rate are also better today than we forecasted back in September. I really do feel great about our portfolio and financial momentum going into 2016. 
Thanks again for your time this morning. And now David and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have."

Are there any milestones we should be looking for to consider whether or not the digital efforts continue to be successful? 
And for Andy, you talked about global affiliate growth locked in over the next several years due to contracts. Certainly, there's increased investor concerns in media in the U.S. around core cutting and skinny bundle impacts and distributor consolidation, I think. I was just hoping for clarification on the one comment you just made around the sub trends are better than you thought they would be when you gave guidance back in October. Is that an improvement in the marketplace or just you were conservative in your guidance and the trends are unchanged? And just any reaffirmation that distributor consolidation, particularly the AT&T deal, won't have any impact on trends as you look over that guidance period."

Okay, first, we're off to a very good start, where we're attacking digital in, I think, a very sensible way. We've hired a new team, which is headed up by Paul Guyardo, and we have an attack team going hard at TV Everywhere,",657,"Okay, great. Thank you, Doug. Okay, first, we're off to a very good start, where we're attacking digital in, I think, a very sensible way. We've hired a new team, which is headed up by Paul Guyardo, and we have an attack team going hard at TV Everywhere, and we're starting to reap some real results. We're working very closely with Neil Smith and X1, which is a great platform, and we're finding our viewership there is increasing and it's really paying off for us. And we've always said TV Everywhere is a great platform where we can monetize, and we are. I think we are the only company in the U.S. that has created our own aggregated app with D-GO, which has all of our channels on it. And we've now been authenticated with commercials through a number of distributors. It's early days. Time Warner is just launching it as well. But the results early have been quite good. The demo is very young, the engagement is substantial and we have a team that's really working on that and people are getting closer to our brands and we're talking to our customers. So I think a really -- a very positive turn in terms of TV Everywhere and our own authenticated app. Outside the U.S., it's really two things. Our Eurosport app is growing quite effectively. I don't -- we won't reach a million subs in 2016, but we do have a March to a Million, and we're hoping to reach 1 million by '17. And 1 million at $8 a month would be an incremental $100 million. We have a lot more IP for Eurosport that we've been able to aggregate at very reasonable price increases. Eurosport will stay profitable, and this could be meaningfully incremental. When you think about Europe being 700 million people, the ability to drive a direct-to-consumer business here could be quite substantial. And if we can get to 1 million, I think culturally, it could be a tipping point for us. If we can get to 1 million, why can't we get to 3 million, and we have the IP. And finally there's Dplay, which we have in Northern Europe and we're rolling out throughout Europe. And we've been doing that on our own, and we've been doing quite well. But we're learning more and more, and this is my own belief, that there will be some more consolidation in a positive way. There's nothing stopping major distributors in Northern Europe, where we have 30% or 45% of market share, to work with other major programmers. I think that'll probably happen around the world over the next 4 or 5 years, but rather having a number of individual apps to come together. And we're having some of those discussions, and I think to the extent that we do come together with others, that we'll even be more powerful. But when you look at the full portfolio of what we're doing, direct-to-consumer and TV Everywhere, I think we're doing more and we're doing it at lower costs than anyone because we own all of our content. And finally, we're not leaving the youngest demo out with our streaming business. We're not making money on that business today, but we're not losing money. But we have 350 million streams. And so when you think about that 350 million streams, and you think about Vice, and you think about BuzzFeed, that 350 million a month is growing, it's a millennial audience, they're spending time with us. And candidly, we haven't done a great job monetizing those streams. And the CPMs on them are quite good, and now we have a whole team that is attacking the ability to engage with millennials and make money on those streams. So I think we're in a very good spot, and over '16 and '17, I think you'll see some meaningful results, and we'll keep you posted."

Yes, back at Investor Day, for the 3-year period, we kind of assumed that, I think conservatively, that the sub decline would be about 2.5% a year. And if you look at in '15, we were down 1% throughout our portfolio. If you look at what the affiliates have reported in the last reports, clearly, the trends are better. So look, I think we were, arguably, conservative back in September, and the recent trends are better than that. And then regarding your question on consolidation, look, as far as the deals with Charter and Time Warner and Cablevision, the impacts there should be de minimus given the rate structures. And regarding DIRECTV and AT&T, they're both paying at their rates that they always have in the past. And when that deal comes up, we'll have a sense of kind of what -- how that will play out. But right now, the rate structure seem to be very much in line with what we've had in the past."

David, as we kind of settle into 2016 here and look back on last year a little bit, with Apple, we saw this issue of when ADQ and Apple sit down with the content providers and your peers, and they all, the programmers, are dead set on keeping all of the networks in the bundle, whether it be a streaming bundle the likes of which people thought Apple might launch, those networks would include sports. And it just got to the point where the cost to the consumer would would've been too high for kind of expanded online streaming offering. Where do you think we are in that conversation? And from here, is there anything that could change? What kind of has to happen for the industry to get closer to seeing more over-the-top services with fewer core networks included in those services, such that they're actually appealing to the customer? 
And then Andy, I just wondered, if you look at your deals with Go90, Hulu and Sony, can you quantify how much those are adding on a quarterly basis? Like how much do they contribute to affiliate fee growth in the fourth quarter? And then in your 2016 guidance, maybe you can help us with -- I think you said high single digit for overall U.S. affiliate fees, that's your long term, and then it sounds like that's intact for '16. And then just clarify what's included in that for those 3 deals, that would be really helpful."

Well, look, I think in '15, there was all this noise around skinny bundles. And I've said before that the majority of programmers have contracts at least for the next several years, that maybe there could be a little bit of that, but that the ability to really start changing the way you offer services, it's going to be another cycle, which will be several years. Having said that, we're very well positioned for that skinny bundle in 2 ways. One, we have 14 channels that represent 11% or 12% of the viewership, but we're only reaping about 6% of the cost. So we're relatively inexpensive. So when Eddie was looking for channels, and we have the #1 channel for men with Discovery, the #1 channel for women with ID, and we have all these affinity networks, the top network with TLC and Science and -- you can pick up 14 channels for less than the cost of one regional sports network. So one, it's a very efficient piece. Two is, if we needed to go to our top 8, we make 86% of our revenue and more than 90% of our EBITDA from our top 8 networks. And so if it ever did happen here in the U.S, we would be well positioned. I don't believe it's going to -- and sitting down with the distributors themselves, with all the talk of the skinny bundle, and as appealing as it seems, most consumers seem to want the big bundle. And I think probably the most encouraging thing is that cable seems to be -- their numbers have really turned around. As Andy said, we haven't really -- we've seen it, but we haven't seen the full effect of it because there's a few month gap between when they announce and when we actually get paid. But it's very encouraging that there seems to be a change in the universe dynamics. It's also, as you look at the U.S., I think our U.S. business now looks like a meaningful growth business. We have advertising market much stronger than we expected, our viewership is growing and the universe decline and the skinny bundle noise seems to have dissipated to kind of a reality, which is not too much on skinny bundle and universe maybe turning around. And so, I think quite encouraging for the next couple of years. I'd like over-the-top to happen in a meaningful way because I think ultimately, we have really good services, our channels are on brand and they're reasonable. And we'll be one of the big recipients of that, but I think it's going to be a while."

And then David, I thought your comments on the Telenor situation was really interesting. You know better than anybody that there are big differences between kind of European distribution and U.S. distribution dynamics. But how do you look at the increasing tension between programmers and distributors in Europe as you move forward? Do you view it as an opportunity to maybe accelerate your business and maybe you were underpaid historically? Or do you think that's going to create more volatility in the results? What could you tell us since you're much closer to that than we are?"

So with Telenor and with Telia, we were able to get meaningful step ups in increases. Remember that Europe and Latin America are a little bit different than the U.S. in that historically, Latin America has been mostly no price increases. Your increases came from sub growth. And Europe was working like that until 2 years ago. And so we started to drive that idea in the last 2 years, and we've been getting increases. But this -- but in the last 12 months, we've taken the position that we need much more substantial increases. And putting Kids together with our channels in Latin America and Sports together with our suite and free-to-air and IP and all of our content together in Europe has helped us get bigger increases. But in order to get it, we really need to stand up for the value of our content. So we had to pull our signals twice. So I think there's 2 buckets. One is, you're going to see us fighting for significant incremental affiliate revenue, and between the Olympics and Eurosport and the strength of Discovery and the strength of our female portfolio around the world, we think that we can get that, and you'll start to see our affiliate line growing in a meaningful way over the next -- it's long cycle, over the next year, 2 years, 3 years, just like we did here in the U.S. And we have some optimism that maybe we could even do meaningfully better than that, because our IP, we think, is quite good. But we're going to have to fight for it. And I think the reverberation of pulling those signals in Northern Europe has been valuable and the deals that we've done recently have been very, very favorable, that's one. Two, you bring up a point that is a new phenomenon, but it's all incremental to us. The idea that distributors in Europe are starting to compete more aggressively is a real helper to us. And what they're starting to do, which we didn't anticipate, is that whether you're a satellite, cable or phone player, for the first time over the last 12 months, they have felt that owning the pipe directly to the handset or to the home is not enough. They need to be decommoditize that pipe by owning unique, exclusive content. And so this is really a new idea here. So we sell our 10 channels and then we get a distributor coming to us saying, ""Do you have other great IP you could sell just to us that we could promote that we have just this content in the market."" So we have been able to do -- we've done 4 of those deals in the last 6 months. None of those were in our plan 4 months ago, 5 months ago. It's all incremental to us, our channel is in language and I think that if it continues, if you have the BTs fighting with the Skys, if you have -- in each market, if you have this competitive dynamic, and we can raise our hand and say we have kids IP, we have sports IP, we have excess drama and nonfiction IP, that, that could be a whole incremental vein of revenue for us, and we're starting to see it. If it continues, we'll be able to break it out for you in the years to come, but it's very positive. And so what we see internationally is double-digit growth, even though it's basically been flatlining for the last couple of years, and that will continue, advertising remains strong. We have this new vein of opportunity with these distributors wanting exclusive content, and the Olympics is going to help us with that. And so, I think quite favorable. The big negative is currency. Our International business is really -- it's doing extremely well. The big issue is currency."

I appreciate there's a lot of moving parts here, with some write offs and onetime items in the fourth quarter. So let me just provide some clarity and perspective. For 2015, kind of apples-to-apples constant currency, SG&A total company was up low single digits with content costs up low double as we invested in Rich Ross [ph], in Discovery and in Sports, et cetera. As I look into 2016, we see constant currency OpEx, SG&A up, again, only low single digits, with cost to revenue being up high single. So total cost, I'll call it mid-single for 2016. Just again to clarify the foreign exchange impact in '16, we're saying that for OIBDA it will be about $115 million to $125 million. And as David said, look, clearly, foreign exchange has been a very challenging element for us given our -- the size of our international portfolio. The good news I'll say on FX is, you look at some of the movements in currency last year, some of these markets really can't get any worse. You look at Venezuela for example -- Venezuela we went from a 5 to 1 exchange rate at the beginning of '15 to a 200 to 1 at the end of '15. And so in some of these markets, we've kind of taken the full brunt of the hit. We'll see what happens from here. But think in terms of OIBDA being about $115 million to $125 million. And then lastly, on Comcast, yes, the Comcast deal is effective January, and so that new deal will be in our first quarter reported results."

We have a very strong leadership team there, with Erik and Sheri Salata working very closely with Oprah. She worked with them for many years at Harpo. And so I feel like we're on a very strong trajectory. In terms of affiliate fees, more than 80% of the affiliate fees are locked with meaningful increases and the channel's in almost 90 million homes. And so we took a channel that was in 75 million homes and had no sub fees four years ago. It's in almost 90 million homes. It's making a lot of money, it's a top network and Oprah has created a great success. The channel is owned 50-50. As we disclosed when we did the deal, Oprah has some staged puts that she can elect to take or not. The first election opportunity is this year, and they're staged throughout the next 6 or 7 years. And we love the channel. If over time, the channel ends up -- we have an opportunity to own more of the channel, that's only a good thing for us. We're very confident in it. We think it has a great niche and some very strong IP. And over time, as our interest grows, if we have an opportunity to consolidate it, that would be very favorable for us.

We have this huge library of content in kids, in sports, in nonfiction and drama that we own. And so the deals that we've done is almost all incremental because we haven't bought any content to provide these exclusive packages. And so whether they come in the form of launching an additional 2 or 3 channels in a market, in language, or whether it comes in providing exclusive content, it's content that we already own and so it's all incremental. I think it's less likely to happen here, and we will see how things develop. Right now, TV Everywhere is our #1 priority, giving our content to the distributors. Here we are in the U.S., we're having high single-digit affiliate growth, Universe is starting to hold its own and our viewership is growing. We have a very healthy U.S. business, and so I think a part of that is going back to our distributors and working with them on TV Everywhere, working with them on VOD, working with them on authenticated apps, which benefits both of us. And so, I think that we've started to tilt. We've got a long way to go, but we've started to tilt in a very positive direction with TV Everywhere, which is a very attractive instrument versus kind of the blunt force instrument of a -- of some of the SVOD platforms that have no advertising, no branding and are kind of operating outside the existing infrastructure."

And the early activity that the team is delivering on is clearly better than what our expectations were when we did the deal. With regard to the U.S. Olympics, which may be a part of your question, yes, we do expect it to have an impact certainly on our total ad sales in the third quarter, as obviously that's a large amount of ad sales to fill. And with regard to kind of the move to digital, look, clearly, what we're still seeing is the trend out of print, out of radio, out of outdoor into TV and into digital. And so when we think about the TV ad sales clearly doing better than people thought 6, 12 months ago, I think it does come down still to reach. I mean if you look at Racing Extinction, for example, reached 31 million viewers. That kind of reach is invaluable and very hard to achieve on digital. So those kind of shows and assets for us clearly drive a lot of ad sales volume and pricing. So I think we're still seeing some of the more secular trends into TV and digital, with Olympic impacting really isolated for us only in the third quarter."

I'm pleased about Discovery's operating and financial momentum with current trends in the U.S. particularly strong and international investments driving new value across our portfolio. While we continu",1332,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased about Discovery's operating and financial momentum with current trends in the U.S. particularly strong and international investments driving new value across our portfolio. While we continue to face certain secular and economic challenges in various markets around the world, we are in evolving in a consumer video marketplace with 7 billion worldwide screens and are optimistic about our global growth profile in the more than 220 markets. 
As Andy will discuss in more detail, we are focused on spending more on growth, in content and in direct-to-consumer platforms, while relentlessly driving down cost growth in all non-content cost areas. If it is not going to nourish audiences or help us grow long term, we are attacking it. As a result, I'm pleased to announce today that we will have real constant-currency margin expansion for the full 2016 year. 
The ultimate goal is to maximize growth, first and foremost, in our linear TV business, while aggressively pursuing new opportunities to diversify and strengthen our content and bring it to more screens and more people around the world. These cost savings will allow us to continue growing our business by focusing on investment in 4 key areas. More investment in content. More investment in our international growth markets. More investment in digital services and OTT products. And more investment in sports. Our expansion into sports is well underway with Eurosport. We have been on a journey to revitalize the brand with locally relevant sports rights and programming, and we are realizing the potential of this cash flow-positive business, and we're starting to see meaningful results, including double-digit growth all across Europe. 
And we're leveraging the power of sports programming by driving meaningful affiliate value across our whole portfolio, which you will see grow further in the years ahead. 
In addition, the Eurosport Player is generating value by offering a deeper, more immersive experience all across Europe. It's a separate offering with unique content from what we have on our Eurosport channels all across Europe. Tennis fanatics were able to watch up to 16 courts at the Australian Open. And at the beginning of the year, Squash TV launched as a dedicated channel on Eurosport Player with 500 hours of squash action a year. 
Our distinct digital offering allows us to have a direct economic relationship with viewers and gives us an opportunity to go deeper into the sports they love. It's a richer different value proposition from all linear channels. In the first quarter, subscription growth increased double digits versus last year, proving Eurosport's content and brand power is a multiscreen opportunity for us. 
We continue to monetize our Olympics investment by signing sublicensing deals in the Netherlands and Finland, which followed our deal with the BBC in the U.K. These agreements significantly exceeded our plan. We have retained all rights to the Olympics on all platforms so that we could pursue incremental value and deals on mobile, on social media with players like Facebook Live and Twitter or going direct to consumer on our Eurosport app. The Olympics will not only be profitable. But based on the deals that we've done already, we expect the Olympics will make real money for us on each of the games. 
Moving on to our entire international portfolio. Our international average audience was up over 5%, driven by worldwide viewership strength from Discovery Channel, especially in Russia, Brazil and Mexico, and strong performances from our female networks in Latin America. And Germany also enjoyed strong double-digit growth, driven by TLC and DMAX. Across all of our international markets, we are getting good value for our portfolio of global brands and sports, and the momentum remains strong with recent renewals. As I mentioned last quarter, we pulled our channels in the Nordics to tell our subscribers as we stood up for the value of our content. And we were able to win significant increases in our renewal and lock in long-term growth. We believe in the value of our content, and we will continue to stand up and fight for the value. 
Looking at our U.S. portfolio. We had another quarter of very strong results. We're extremely pleased with our current domestic trends, and ad growth remains solid as we head into the second quarter in the upfront. Discovery Channel had its second-highest-rated quarter ever in prime time with 8 of the top 10 unscripted shows on cable, including Gold Rush, Fast N' Loud and Alaskan Bush People ranked #1, #2 and #3. ID was the #2 network for women and had its best quarter ever in prime time. Velocity had its highest-delivering quarter ever and Science its highest-rated quarter ever. And starting next month, we welcome back Patrice Andrews, who is most recently with ITV and ANE, as the new General Manager of Animal Planet. Patrice is a fantastic storyteller and a great creative leader. She'll be a big help to driving the value of Animal Planet. 
Beyond traditional pay-TV distribution, people want access to our brands and content across all screens. As we own most of our IP, we are driving our digital strategy and making progress in diversifying how and where we reach consumers, particularly younger viewers. Across all these efforts, we are building audiences, learning consumption habits and expanding monetization models. Part of our digital strategy is to add value to pay-TV subscribers through our OWN TV Everywhere products, such as Discovery GO in the U.S., Discovery Kids Play in Latin America, and by extending the availability of our content through distributor TV Everywhere products. It's very early days for Discovery GO, but we are pleased with our initial results. The platform is clearly appealing to younger audience as 50% of our visitors are in the 18 to 34 demo. And we are selling CPMs at a significant premium, highlighting the appeal of our longform content in the digital space. 
Second, we continue engaging millennials and younger audiences with Discovery Digital Networks. Today, we average more than 300 million streams each month. And we are now focusing our web-native efforts on the 2 key brands that are resonating with advertisers and with users: Seeker and SourceFed. 
Over the last 2 years, we have drilled down and developed the best-in-class virtual-reality content. The Discovery virtual reality app has over 30 million views in the last few months, and we have developed over 100 pieces of virtual-reality content with a new offering every week. We're very excited about the possibilities to immerse audiences in new story formats and create meaningful opportunities for advertisers. As content gets closer to real, our content brands move to the top of the heap. 
Finally, we're focusing on delivering for super fans with select, direct-to-consumer offerings. In Europe, the Eurosport Player and Dplay exemplify our range to grow audiences across platforms and continue to provide captivating exclusive content across more screens than ever before. And we recently took a minority stake in Rugby Pass, the definitive OTT product for rugby fans in 23 markets in Asia. Across all these efforts, we are learning viewing habits and amassing data on how best to reach consumers across all screens. 
As we begin another year, Discovery is well positioned to broaden our reach and relevance with our audiences. We end the quarter with a lot of optimism. Our U.S. business is a real meaningful growth business, even given small subscriber universe declines. And as a company, worldwide, 50% of our revenues come from long-cycle distribution agreements with strong contractual growth rates. In our international business, we've turned the corner on currency and are now starting to realize some tailwinds that could grow stronger in the months and years ahead. And we're investing in the growth areas for the future. We are confident in the long-term growth profile of the company and our ability to create sustainable shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Andy for details of our financial results."
22666093,327892507,973619,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before I review our first quarter results, I want to highlight a few very important and positive updates regarding our 2016 guidance. As David mentioned, we are now committing to total company",2022,"Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before I review our first quarter results, I want to highlight a few very important and positive updates regarding our 2016 guidance. As David mentioned, we are now committing to total company constant-currency margin expansion for the year. We want to ensure that we position Discovery for growth in both existing and new areas and continue to embrace change to drive innovation across the company. As the industry evolves, we will continue to evolve with it. We have consistently highlighted our flexible cost structures and the fact that we own or control most of our own content across all global platforms as 2 of our most critical competitive advantages. And these advantages are allowing us to maximize our profit growth while taking advantage of new opportunities as the new ecosystem evolves. 
As a company, we have, for several years now, taken a very hard look at our cost structures and continue to see and realize opportunities to become leaner while freeing up dollars to continue investing in new platforms like mobile and OTT. Spending on global content IP will always be our priority. We were focused on managing down growth in all other cost areas to ensure that our constant-currency revenues will grow faster than our constant-currency cost. Our 2016 SG&A cost productivity has been much better than planned. You may have seen yesterday that we filed an 8-K specifying additional personnel-related cost-reduction initiatives that will yield cost benefits in the second half of 2016 as well as full year 2017. We remain highly focused on paring back cost growth in non-content expense areas and reallocating traditional linear business costs to new media platforms and content development around the globe such as mobile, short-form video, sports and direct-to-consumer initiatives. 
As a result of this commitment to margin expansion as well as our better-than-planned U.S. ad sales performance to date, we are also raising our 2016 adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance to being of at least high teens on a constant-currency basis. With our first quarter constant-currency margins up almost 100 basis points, adjusted OIBDA, ex FX, of 7% and adjusted EPS, ex FX, up 18%, we're off to a very strong start to the year. 
In addition, with the U.S. dollar softening year-to-date, currency headwinds have begun to subside and are meaningfully better for 2016 than we quantified on our year-end call. More on this later. 
Now let's talk about our first quarter results in more detail. Reported revenues and adjusted OIBDA were both up 2%. Excluding currency impacts, revenues were up 5% and adjusted OIBDA was up 7%. On an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as prior contributions from SBS Radio, which we sold on June 30, 2015, total company revenues and adjusted OIBDA both grew 7%. Net income available through Discovery Communications of $263 million was up 5% from the first quarter a year ago, primarily driven by improved operating performance, a lower effective tax rate and a gain from the SBS Radio sale, partially offset by higher stock-based compensation and a decline on income from equity investees. We were able to lower our effective tax rate by another 400 basis points from the full year 2015 rate to 29% this quarter. Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter was $0.42, 14% above the first quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per diluted share, a more relevant metric from a comparability perspective as it excludes the impact from acquisition-related noncash amortization of intangible assets, was $0.46, a 10% improvement versus 1Q 2015. Excluding currency impacts, adjusted EPS was up 18% for the quarter and was up 11% for the last 12-month period over the prior 12-month period. First quarter free cash flow increased 62% as improved operating performance and lower cash taxes were partially offset by higher content spend. First quarter free cash flow growth, excluding currency effects, was strong and increased 53% for the last 12-month period compared to the prior 12 months. 
Turning to the operating units. Our U.S. Networks had a spectacular quarter with total revenues up 8%, led by 8% distribution growth and 7% advertising growth. And adjusted OIBDA was up a very impressive 11%. Our 7% advertising growth, which accelerated from 5% in the prior quarter, was due to higher pricing and proactively managing and monetizing the inventory to take advantage of the strong demand in the scatter market offsetting lower delivery. The ad market currently remains quite healthy. And looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect advertising revenues to have another strong quarter with second quarter's year-over-year growth similar to that of our first quarter. 
Our domestic distribution revenues were up 8% while total portfolio subs again declined by about 1% versus the first quarter last year. We continue to benefit from the higher rates we garnered from our recent deals, including our most recent deal with Comcast, which went into effect on January 1. 
Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses in the quarter were up 3%. Cost of revenues were up 7% while SG&A declined 4% due primarily to lower personnel expenses. Our focus on controlling base costs led to impressive domestic adjusted OIBDA growth of 11% with margins expanding by almost 200 basis points to 59%. 
As we look ahead to the rest of the year, U.S. cost growth in the second quarter is expected to rise at a slightly faster rate than first quarter as we increase marketing spend, partially due to an earlier Shark Week, which starts on June 26, and then expense growth will abate again in the second half of this year. 
Turning now to international operations. Excluding currency, revenues increased 3% and adjusted OIBDA decreased 2% as changes in currency mix reduced revenue growth by 6% and adjusted OIBDA growth by 12%. For comparability purposes, by following international comments, we'll refer to our organic results only, so we'll exclude the impacts of foreign exchange and the previously mentioned SBS Radio sale. 
International organic revenues increased 7% and adjusted OIBDA declined 2% for the first quarter of 2016. The 7% first quarter revenue growth was comprised of 12% distribution growth and 4% advertising growth. Our 12% affiliate revenue growth was due to higher affiliate rates in eastern and northern Europe, where we have been successful in leveraging our expanded content portfolio, that now includes sports, to drive higher contracted pricing increases; increased subscribers in Latin America as well as contributions from Eurosport France, which was not consolidated into the second quarter last year. Excluding Eurosport France, affiliate revenues were up high single digits. Going forward, we still expect organic distribution growth to remain in the high single-digit range for the rest of 2016. 
Turning to our first quarter international advertising results. While we benefited from higher pricing and delivery in Southern Europe and higher volumes in Central Europe, growth in these markets was partially offset by declines in Northern Europe, our largest advertising region. Northern Europe was impacted by the February Telenor blackout in the Nordics that we highlighted on our year-end call and overall softness in the U.K. and Nordic markets due to macro factors and lower ratings across the region, especially at our female-skewing networks. While the Telenor blackout did have a negative impact beyond the 10 days we were dark, as advertisers shifted their money elsewhere due to the uncertainty around contract renewal, our standing up for the value of our content paid off, as the long-term economic upside from the new deal is significantly greater than the temporary advertising losses incurred while going dark. Excluding the impact from the Telenor blackout, first quarter international advertising revenue increased 7%. We're delivering on our promise that the investments we're making in content and brands will drive sustained global affiliate growth, and this very positive Telenor deal outcome supports this thesis. 
Another factor that impacted our first quarter ad results and will continue to affect results for the rest of the year is a shift in the Middle East, where we are pivoting from a free-to-air model to a pay-TV model. As part of our exclusive content deal with 2 key affiliate partners, we have locked in long-term affiliate fees, which enhances OIBDA but shifts ad revenue to affiliate revenue. 
Our international ad sales is currently trending at high single to low double digits, but we do expect the ad growth to accelerate to low double digits in the second half of the year. Second half growth will be led by increases in the U.K. as we expect pricing and ad market pressures to ease post the Euro Championships and the June 23 Brexit vote as well as continued strong growth in Latin America, Eastern Europe and Southern Europe. 
Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses internationally grew 11% in the first quarter, primarily due to higher content amortization as well as costs associated with Eurosport France, and adjusted OIBDA declined 2%. Looking ahead, it is very important to note that cost growth and therefore adjusted OIBDA growth will be lumpy on a quarterly basis, mostly driven by the timing of sporting events. We currently expect second quarter organic expense growth to be similar to that of the first quarter. Cost growth will then significantly moderate in the back half of the year to being up mid-single digits as we're able to more fully leverage our pre-existing sports rights and local market people and infrastructure. 
Lastly, regarding our financial expectations for the Olympics. As a result of the very positive and better-than-planned licensing deals that Dave highlighted in the U.K., Netherlands and Finland, we now expect meaningfully positive cumulative Olympic-related cash flows through the 2024 games. We forecast that aggregate revenues from this deal will significantly exceed total cost. 
Now taking a look at our share repurchases. In the first quarter, we repurchased a total of $373 million in shares. We have now spent over $7 billion buying back shares since we began our buyback program at the end of 2010, and we reduced our outstanding share count by 36% as we continue to find the return on repurchasing our own shares very attractive. 
Getting back to our full year guidance. As stated, we are raising our constant-currency adjusted EPS and constant-currency free cash flow growth to being up at least high teens. Our guidance includes potential upcoming personnel-related and other restructuring charges of approximately $40 million to $60 million, [ph] as outlined in our 8-K and also assumes full year stock-based compensation of approximately $55 million and no further P&L impact from the Lionsgate investment we made last year. We also now expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate to now be approximately 29% versus our prior expectation of 30% as we continue to realize significant benefits from our multiyear global tax strategies. 
I have update the expected year-over-year foreign exchange impact on our full year reported results. As a result of the dollar weakening year-to-date versus most of the global currencies, the expected year-over-year FX impact has significantly improved since we last guided on February 18. Assuming current spot rates stay constant for the rest of the year, FX is now expected to reduce our constant-currency revenue by $100 million to $110 million and adjusted OIBDA by $70 million to $80 million. We now also expect a positive FX impact to adjusted EPS of $0.01 to $0.05 due to the net effect of this year's adjusted OIBDA impact and last year's over $100 million of below-the-line FX impact. 
In closing, I'm extremely pleased with Discovery's start to 2016. We are fully committed to constant-currency margin expansion and our higher full year 2016 guidance metrics. As I noted earlier, we will continue to assess operating trends and proactively manage Discovery's overall expense base to best position the company for growth as the media industry evolves. I remain very optimistic about our global portfolio as well as our overall financial and operating momentum. 
Thanks again for your time this morning. And now Dave and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have."

So the advertising market remains robust. We'll talk about it a little bit later. We don't have that much information on the upfront, but the pricing in scatter is very strong. And cancellations and options are down significantly from the last few years. So the environment feels quite good going into the upfront, I think, for us and the whole marketplace. On the point of over-the-top, I think one of the things that makes us very well positioned is we have our 14 channels, which represents about 12% of viewership on cable. And even though we're looking at high single to double-digit affiliate growth domestically, we still only get about 5.5% of the economics. So 12% of viewership, 5.5% of economics. And you have ID as the #1 or #2 channel for women, the most valued channel on cable in Discovery, and Oprah the #1 Channel for African-American women. With OWN and TLC, one of the top 2 or 3 networks in Middle America. And so we're very, very good value with our channels, including Animal Planet being one of the top 3 or 4 channels that people value in terms of brand, but also in terms of economics. If you took just our top 6 channels, that would represent about 83% of our affiliate. If you only took 4, it would be 70%. We are talking to everyone. And one of the things, I think, there's kind of 2 baskets. If it's a nonsports package, and I think we will be an extraordinarily powerful piece of that as we bring so many demos and so much strength to a package like that. But for all packages, we're very economically attractive. And with Discovery, ID, Animal Planet and Oprah, it's very difficult, I think, to have a compelling package without us. We're talking to everyone. The reason that we're not on Sling right now is that our deal, Charlie tense, those deals tend to get done on Sling as those deals come up, and our deal with Charlie's not up. But we look at over-the-top as real opportunity. And we can even see it in our TV Everywhere product, how much content is being consumed by the consumers, which is quite attractive."

And it's very hard to predict, so I'm not going to predict where it's going to be in the quarters ahead. We thought, in the second and third quarter last year, that it was going to really be a challenge. Some of the things that are happening is, one, the measurability is getting better. A number of companies that move more quickly to digital found that their market share -- they had market share challenges. And so I think you have 2 baskets: How effective is television advertising? It's still probably the most effective of all advertising. And two, knowing that you're getting the actual value and it could be proven. And in fact, when you get paid only on L3, for us, we leave about 14% of viewership on the table. And there are a lot of people in the industry that do more than that. So the fact that you're getting -- that the advertiser is getting the full value and they only pay on what you watch for the first 3 days, there's actually an over-delivery. So at least for now, I think the view is that it's quite an effective way to reach a broad audience and to reach across demos. And it's not a -- you don't get embarrassed by finding out 9 months later that there was an issue with it when you don't have to worry that it's not going to deliver in terms of your -- the ability to move product. It does feel good right now. The whole U.S. market feels good. I think this whole narrative of -- when we -- toward the end of last year, this idea that universe numbers were declining precipitously as a result of distributors losing subscribers, their overall viewership on cable was declining, that advertising was going to decline in an accelerating rate. All of those have moved, I think, in our favor. So at least for the near term, we see the U.S. now as a meaningful growth market. And for the near term -- I mean, for the next several years, with having high single digit affiliate growth locked in, with 80% of our deals done, even if the universe declines, which we don't -- which looks like it stabilized, and even if the advertising market declines, we'll still have a U.S. growth market. And if the advertising market stays like it is now, we'll have a very significant U.S. growth market. So it feels good like for now, and let's hope it continues."

We're embedded with creative talent, commercial talent and serving 220 countries and all across this been embedded. When we did do Eurosport, and as we've tucked in channels, we've been able to get meaningful synergy because we have 10 to 12 channels in every country. We're always opportunistic, but I think we're very happy with our existing mix. The way we see it now is we have this great sports IP in Europe and Discovery's OWN brand and growing with real pull-through. And then our most recent deals, the negative is, we've had to pull our signal 3 times. We did it with Telenor, the largest distributor in the Nordics. We did it [indiscernible] in Sweden, and we did with Boxer in Sweden. And so we took the near-term hits by doing that. But in all 3 cases, we're back up, and we've got very significant increases, and the deals are long term, which give us -- which moved us from the potential to go from mid-single. We're now at high single, and we're looking to get to double-digit. And so we think -- we've improved our IP portfolio. The same is true for us in Latin America, where Kids has gotten a lot stronger, and we have a number of female networks that are stronger. So I think we're in a very good position now. We like our -- we've improved our IP. As our deals come up, I think you'll see our affiliate line growing internationally because our content has improved. We're taking some of that content direct to consumer, and we're having some success. And so we would have to see something that would help us grow faster. Because, I think, we had a -- we sort of took a step back with SBS, and we took a step back with Eurosport. We've acquired the sports IP we think we need. And I think we're making the turn. We now -- we're very happy with the Olympics. And margin should start to grow now in Eurosport. I think we like the position we're in. We've worked hard over the last 3 years to get in this position, to get all the infrastructure in place. And so we got the synergy if there's a good asset out there, but it's going to have to help us grow faster."

Look, I think the thing that's going to drive our distribution revenue the hardest is the fact that our share has been growing over the last several years. And as these deals come up, we have more share and as well as sports rights or Kids. And we've been standing up for our value in a way that we haven't in the past. And part of that has to do with -- through this recession and challenge over the last 8 years, most content players have reduced their content investment. So we go into these deals we've increased our investment, we've increased our share, and we've been able to get more significant dollars. The second piece that is important is that there's been a change in the marketplace over the last year, and that's distributors are now looking to decommoditize their platforms. They do want to just be pipes to the home or pipes to a device. So they're looking to get exclusive content. So what you saw us do in the Middle East, where some of our advertising revenue went away, it's because we did exclusive deals with [indiscernible] for each, we did a regular package, and we gave each of them some exclusive content, and we were able to get significant economics. In addition, we did a similar thing with Canal Plus. And we're in a number of discussions with distributors. This is something that could either -- right now you see our affiliate line internationally growing. We want to push that to double-digit. If the opportunity for exclusive content continues, you're going to see that line begin to move up higher in a way that's a lot easier to be moving the advertising length. Our goal in advertising is to get it back up to double-digit, which we think we can do. But the distribution line, we're quite optimistic about. On TV Everywhere, the point that we made in -- a couple of months ago is that TV Everywhere is just much more effective in Europe because TV Everywhere really means TV Everywhere. Everything is on the platform. It's helpful because I think it's an impediment to the SVOD platforms coming into those markets. So you have 2 things helping the kind of, a, a pushback on Netflix and some of the other SVOD platforms. One is that a number of us are going direct to consumer ourselves, like us, with Eurosport app or Dplay. Two, players like Fox of Liberty Global are going direct to consumer with our TV Everywhere platform. And they have everything. So unlike here in the U.S., which is finally getting it together and we're seeing the great benefit of that, and Brian is leading in that with X1, in Europe, it really is TV Everywhere. And that is a big benefit to us, and it will help us on advertising. And Sky is having a real positive with Now TV. And you got to take your hat off to James and to Jeremy there because they've really -- they've invested and we are on Now TV. So being part of a cable operators platform, for us, is a much more favorable environment."

I love the fact that Les is talking about the fact about being double-digit. On a practical level, across our domestic portfolio, we tend to be maybe 1 point behind. So if broadcast gets 9, maybe we get 8. If broadcast gets 11, maybe we get 10. If they get 6, we get 5. That's the way it's been historically. Having said that, our channels are very firmly on brand. And we've been able to get some significant benefit. So some of our channels like ID and Velocity have been up 50% or 60% higher in CPM over the last year. Discovery CPM is up higher. So I think there's a real benefit as you look at OWN, ID, Discovery, Velocity, even Science. So we've worked hard to get back to brand and to really be nourishing a very specific demographic audience. And so we've been rewarded on those channels, I think, a little bit more. ID still has a lot of headroom for us. It's length of view is the highest of any channel on cable. And it's the ability to reach women all day. We were #1 on cable work late night, and we were #1. And so we think there's still some significant upside on that. But when you average all of our channels together, we tend to do about -- a little bit, probably a little bit behind with some of the best broadcast network does. And if we can get a little bit lucky with ID and pushing it, maybe we can -- even though we don't have the same amount of reach in terms of being able to roll out a product, we could maybe reach it.

Look, there's a couple of important points here. One, we're extremely committed to investment-grade. It gives us access to long-term capital, gives us access the multicurrency commercial paper. So it absolutely is the right kind of capital assessment for us, an investment-grade. Also, if you look at our access to capital today, we issued a long-term bond earlier in the year, many times oversubscribed. Rates are actually more in the BBB rating. So even though we intentionally took our rating down to BBB-, the market still view us as being more BBB, especially with our mid-teen free cash flow and debt yield. And look, the other point I'd make, Doug, which I think is so important, if you think about the capital expansion, given our high single OIBDA growth and given what is an improving currency environment, we're seeing a lot of available capital based on just our profit growth and our ability to leverage that profit growth. So there's no shortage of capital that we have to be proactive and to play offense with either buying stock or allocating capital to those acquisitions."

Look, the U.S. market is really quite different from the international market because the U.S. is really just one culture, and it's one satellite. And so it's football, baseball, basketball, hockey. And because there's a very competitive environment of the biggest media companies to get into that space, because that's where most of the affiliate revenue has gone over the years to those that have those sports rights, those rights have accelerated, as you've seen. And the fight for those 4 sports more and more has generated huge increases. In Europe, you see that for soccer, in-market. So you've seen that kind of huge increases on renewals. We've been able to do with Eurosport is we've done over 70 deals on Eurosport and all of our deals are in the low single to mid-single-digit increase. Even on the Olympics itself, we were able to get the Olympics for mid-single-digit increase on what it had gone for 4 years earlier. And so we've been quite disciplined to get about getting our sports right. And Eurosport now remains profitable. We've made the turn. We don't think we need to own a lot more IP. We'll do it opportunistically. And again, when we picked up speed skating, we're picking up a sport that might be the #1 sport in 4 markets all across northern Europe. When we pick up handball, we're picking up a sport, that's #1 sport in Poland. So a lot of this will be picking up tennis and cycling. So for us, sort of the home for everything but soccer. And so we're also picking up a lot of IP for very little. And remember, there is no bidder for sports in Europe that can provide the platform that we provide. Eurosport has 3 channels in every market, but we have 150 million homes on just one of our channels. So ESPN is a little less than 100, and we have 150 million. So when a federation wants to sell a sport, soccer sold locally, but most other sports are sold either across Europe, or you have to do 55 deals. And so I think that's the unique advantage that we have a very complex market both in terms of taste, culture and language that we have set up to deal with. And the fact that we have the only Pan-European sports channels gives us a unique advantage. And I think, over time, our ability to continue to get these rights should be pretty stable. Not a lot of people that are bidding for the kind the sports that we're building our business on. Finally, on the international advertising. Telenor hurt us this quarter. It hurt a significantly. It is the biggest distributor in the Nordics, which is one of our biggest markets. We were off for 11 days, and so not only did we lose on those 11 days, but some money moved. It's all back now, but it had an impact. But it really resonated in the market. We were able to get him a very significant economics and driving that long-cycle top line for us is critical. If you put Telenor back into your economics, we would've been -- our international business would've been positive in the mid-single digits versus negative. But we're fighting for the long term. So this quarter, we expect -- the first 2 quarters, we expect to see in the high single range. And in the second half of the year, we expect acceleration into the double-digit range. And whether on average that ends up being high single or low double, we'll have to see."

I just wondering, just given underperformance in terms of ratings that some of your networks if part of this, as part of this initiative, you would consider rationalizing any of the underperforming, smaller cable networks? And then secondly, for David, just on -- going back to the theme of the subject of new over-the-top platforms and distribution. I feel like we all went through this period of handwringing last year about whether Apple is going to launch something like this. And I think you spoke about it and my thought was that profitability was a real reason that DQ and Apple not decided to move forward. The fact that the [indiscernible] we just got to be too costly as part of this sort of virtual MVPD bundle and so forth. So I'd just -- what you think about the fact that the new Hulu venture is likely to be unprofitable out of the gate? Does it surprise you that others are deciding to move forward with a business like that even if its operating at a loss or as a loss lever?"

But in general, we, as an industry, have to make some compromises. And if we do, I think we'll be healthier. So if in the end, we're going to do an over-the-top bundle that's 30 channels for $30, then each of the media companies can have every one of the channels, everyone the sports channels, every one of the regional sports channels carried. And for those that have the leverage to include all of them, then probably -- not going to be the best of what we have to offer. And so for instance, we have 14 channels, taking -- having 6 or 8 of our channels carried in a package, to me, seems quite effective. We would get 85%, 86%. It's only 6, we get 83% of our dollars. We've done this in a lot of markets where a lot happened in Brazil. The major programs always cited, ""Look, we'll get a less money, but we'll be on this beginning tier. We'll serve a different audience in the case of Brazil, it was the C-class. In the case of the U.S, it would be more of a millennial audience. we all came together and if you saw kind of the best of cable, we will have 6 of those slots, than I think it could be quite attractive. But if we each try and put all of our kids in there, which is how we used to doing business, I think it's going to be overly bloated. Can be a lot of channels that aren't that strong. It's going to be quite expensive. And it's not going to be that attractive. The marketplace is quite rational. So it'll -- I think in the end, the smaller bundles are working around the world are those that have 20 or 30 channels and those are kind of a best of the U.K. and that's probably where we'll end up in the U.S. As I've said, with all the talk about this, the only place that the skinny bundles is going to present is over-the-top. Because in the next 3 to 4 years, almost every programmers contractually committed to have an all their channels carried. And so the exception of maybe being able to go down from lose 5% of distribution or 10% of your distribution, most deals provide that you need to have all the channels carried to at least 90% or 95% of the package. And so having said that, I would -- I'd like the skinny bundles. I was interested in what Apple is doing. I think, again, the fact that we have the #1 Channel on cable, the #1 channel for women, the #1 channel for African-Americans and our channels a reasonable with high-quality contact puts us in a position to be part of those models and will have those discussions and over time, I'm confident that we will. In terms of rationalizing costs for smaller networks, 2 things. We had quite a good quarter, but we also have -- our content channels were hurt, I think, a little bit more than some others by the news networks. Networks were up 38%. But every night, whether that was a Republican or Democratic debate, a lot of that energy came out of some of our nonfiction channels. We feel pretty good about our how we're going to do this quarter. To some of our channels, we need to improve. One is Animal Planet, which is brought in a new GM, we're working hard and turning TLC. But Discovery, science, ID, Velocity, OWN are all running very strong. And so we're looking at everything. But in the end, this cost cutting that we're doing right now isn't related to the channels. The channels are a journey to find -- to make sure brands are right and reaching out an audience. The cost cutting is really that is side of the house where we're having some effect of efficiency."

I'm pleased about Discovery's operating and financial momentum with current trends in the U.S. particularly strong and international investments driving new value across our portfolio. While we continu",1332,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased about Discovery's operating and financial momentum with current trends in the U.S. particularly strong and international investments driving new value across our portfolio. While we continue to face certain secular and economic challenges in various markets around the world, we are in evolving in a consumer video marketplace with 7 billion worldwide screens and are optimistic about our global growth profile in the more than 220 markets. 
As Andy will discuss in more detail, we are focused on spending more on growth, in content and in direct-to-consumer platforms, while relentlessly driving down cost growth in all non-content cost areas. If it is not going to nourish audiences or help us grow long term, we are attacking it. As a result, I'm pleased to announce today that we will have real constant-currency margin expansion for the full 2016 year. 
The ultimate goal is to maximize growth, first and foremost, in our linear TV business, while aggressively pursuing new opportunities to diversify and strengthen our content and bring it to more screens and more people around the world. These cost savings will allow us to continue growing our business by focusing on investment in 4 key areas: more investment in content, more investment in our international growth markets, more investment in digital services and OTT products, and more investment in sports. 
Our expansion into sports is well underway with Eurosport. We have been on a journey to revitalize the brand with locally relevant sports rights and programming. And we are realizing the potential of this cash flow-positive business, and we're starting to see meaningful results, including double-digit growth all across Europe. And we're leveraging the power of sports programming by driving meaningful affiliate value across our whole portfolio, which you will see grow further in the years ahead. 
In addition, the Eurosport Player is generating value by offering a deeper, more immersive experience all across Europe. It's a separate offering with unique content from what we have on our Eurosport channels all across Europe. Tennis fanatics were able to watch up to 16 courts at the Australian Open. And at the beginning of the year, Squash TV launched as a dedicated channel on Eurosport Player with 500 hours of squash action a year. 
Our distinct digital offering allows us to have a direct economic relationship with viewers and gives us an opportunity to go deeper into the sports they love. It's a richer, different value proposition from our linear channels. In the first quarter, subscription growth increased double digits versus last year, proving Eurosport's content and brand power is a multiscreen opportunity for us. 
We continue to monetize our Olympics investment by signing sublicensing deals in the Netherlands and Finland, which followed our deal with the BBC in the U.K. These agreements significantly exceeded our plan. We have retained all rights to the Olympics on all platforms so that we could pursue incremental value and deals on mobile, on social media with players like Facebook Live and Twitter or going direct to consumer on our Eurosport app. The Olympics will not only be profitable, but based on the deals that we've done already, we expect the Olympics will make real money for us on each of the games. 
Moving on to our entire international portfolio. Our international average audience was up over 5%, driven by worldwide viewership strength from Discovery Channel, especially in Russia, Brazil and Mexico; and strong performances from our female networks in Latin America. And Germany also enjoyed strong double-digit growth, driven by TLC and DMAX. Across all of our international markets, we are getting good value for our portfolio of global brands and sports, and the momentum remains strong with recent renewals. As I mentioned last quarter, we pulled our channels in the Nordics to Telenor subscribers as we stood up for the value of our content. And we were able to win significant increases in our renewal and lock in long-term growth. We believe in the value of our content, and we will continue to stand up and fight for the value. 
Looking at our U.S. portfolio. We had another quarter of very strong results. We are extremely pleased with our current domestic trends, and ad growth remains solid as we head into the second quarter and the upfront. Discovery Channel had its second-highest-rated quarter ever in prime time with 8 of the top-10 unscripted shows on cable, including Gold Rush, Fast N' Loud and Alaskan Bush People, ranked 1, 2 and 3. ID was the #2 network for women and had its best quarter ever in prime time. Velocity had its highest-delivering quarter ever and Science its highest-rated quarter ever. And starting next month, we welcome back Patrice Andrews, who is most recently with ITV and A&E, as the new General Manager of Animal Planet. Patrice is a fantastic storyteller and a great creative leader. She'll be a big help to driving the value of Animal Planet. 
Beyond traditional pay-TV distribution, people want access to our brands and content across all screens. As we own most of our IP, we are driving our digital strategy and making progress in diversifying how and where we reach consumers, particularly younger viewers. Across all these efforts, we are building audiences, learning consumption habits and expanding monetization models. Part of our digital strategy is to add value to pay-TV subscribers through our own TV Everywhere products, such as Discovery GO in the U.S., Discovery K!ds Play in Latin America, and by extending the availability of our content through distributor TV Everywhere products. It's very early days for Discovery GO, but we are pleased with our initial results. The platform is clearly appealing to a younger audience as 50% of our visitors are in the 18 to 34 demo. And we are selling CPMs at a significant premium, highlighting the appeal of our long-form content in the digital space. 
Second, we continue engaging millennials and younger audiences with Discovery Digital Networks. Today, we average more than 300 million streams each month. And we are now focusing our web-native efforts onto 2 key brands that are resonating with advertisers and with users: Seeker and SourceFed. 
Over the last 2 years, we have drilled down and developed a best-in-class virtual-reality content. The Discovery virtual reality app has over 30 million views in the last few months, and we have developed over 100 pieces of virtual reality content, with a new offering every week. We're very excited about the possibilities to immerse audiences in new story formats and create meaningful opportunities for advertisers. As content gets closer to real, our content brands move to the top of the heap. 
Finally, we're focusing on delivering for super fans with select, direct-to-consumer offerings. In Europe, the Eurosport Player and Dplay exemplify our aim to grow audiences across platforms and continue to provide captivating exclusive content across more screens than ever before. And we recently took a minority stake in Rugby Pass, the definitive OTT product for rugby fans in 23 markets in Asia. Across all these efforts, we are learning viewing habits and amassing data on how best to reach consumers across all screens. 
As we begin another year, Discovery is well positioned to broaden our reach and relevance with our audiences. We end the quarter with a lot of optimism. Our U.S. business is a real meaningful growth business, even given small subscriber universe declines. And as a company, worldwide, 50% of our revenues come from long-cycle distribution agreements with strong contractual growth rates. In our international business, we've turned the corner on currency and are now starting to realize some tailwinds that could grow stronger in the months and years ahead. And we're investing in the growth areas for the future. We are confident in the long-term growth profile of the company and our ability to create sustainable shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Andy for details of our financial results."
22666093,327892507,974018,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before I review our first quarter results, I want to highlight a few very important and positive updates regarding our 2016 guidance. As David mentioned, we are now committing to total company",2025,"Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before I review our first quarter results, I want to highlight a few very important and positive updates regarding our 2016 guidance. As David mentioned, we are now committing to total company constant-currency margin expansion for the year. We want to ensure that we position Discovery for growth in both existing and new areas and continue to embrace change to drive innovation across the company. As the industry evolves, we will continue to evolve with it. We have consistently highlighted our flexible cost structures and the fact that we own or control most of our own content across all global platforms as 2 of our most critical competitive advantages. And these advantages are allowing us to maximize our profit growth while taking advantage of new opportunities as the new ecosystem evolves. 
As a company, we have, for several years now, taken a very hard look at our cost structures and continue to see and realize opportunities to become leaner while freeing up dollars to continue investing in new platforms like mobile and OTT. Spending on global content IP will always be our priority. We were focused on managing down growth in all other cost areas to ensure that our constant-currency revenues will grow faster than our constant-currency cost. Our 2016 SG&A cost productivity has been much better than planned. You may have seen yesterday that we filed an 8-K specifying additional personnel-related cost-reduction initiatives that will yield cost benefits in the second half of 2016 as well as full year 2017. We remain highly focused on paring back cost growth in non-content expense areas and reallocating traditional linear business costs to new media platforms and content development around the globe, such as mobile, short-form video, sports and direct-to-consumer initiatives. 
As a result of this commitment to margin expansion as well as our better-than-planned U.S. ad sales performance to date, we are also raising our 2016 adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance to being up at least high teens on a constant-currency basis. With our first quarter constant-currency margins up almost 100 basis points; adjusted OIBDA, ex FX, up 7%; and adjusted EPS, ex FX, up 18%, we're off to a very strong start to the year. In addition, with the U.S. dollar softening year-to-date, currency headwinds have begun to subside and are meaningfully better for 2016 than we quantified on our year-end call. More on this later. 
Now let's talk about our first quarter results in more detail. Reported revenues and adjusted OIBDA were both up 2%. Excluding currency impacts, revenues were up 5% and adjusted OIBDA was up 7%. On an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as prior-year contributions from SBS Radio, which we sold on June 30, 2015, total company revenues and adjusted OIBDA both grew 7%. Net income available to Discovery Communications of $263 million was up 5% from the first quarter a year ago, primarily driven by improved operating performance, a lower effective tax rate and a gain from the SBS Radio sale, partially offset by higher stock-based compensation and a decline on income from equity investees. We were able to lower our effective tax rate by another 400 basis points from the full year 2015 rate to 29% this quarter. 
Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter was $0.42, 14% above the first quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per diluted share, a more relevant metric from a comparability perspective as it excludes the impact from acquisition-related noncash amortization of intangible assets, was $0.46, a 10% improvement versus 1Q 2015. Excluding currency impacts, adjusted EPS was up 18% for the quarter and was up 11% for the last 12-month period over the prior 12-month period. First quarter free cash flow increased 62% as improved operating performance and lower cash taxes were partially offset by higher content spend. First quarter free cash flow growth, excluding currency effects, was strong and increased 53% for the last 12-month period compared to the prior 12 months. 
Turning to the operating units. Our U.S. Networks had a spectacular quarter with total revenues up 8%, led by 8% distribution growth and 7% advertising growth. And adjusted OIBDA was up a very impressive 11%. Our 7% advertising growth, which accelerated from 5% in the prior quarter, was due to higher pricing and proactively managing and monetizing the inventory to take advantage of the strong demand in the scatter market, offsetting lower delivery. The ad market currently remains quite healthy. And looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect advertising revenues to have another strong quarter with second quarter's year-over-year growth similar to that of our first quarter. 
Our Domestic Distribution revenues were up 8% while total portfolio subs again declined by about 1% versus the first quarter of last year. We continue to benefit from the higher rates we garnered from our recent deals, including our most recent deal with Comcast, which went into effect on January 1. 
Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses in the quarter were up 3%, cost of revenues were up 7%, while SG&A declined 4% due primarily to lower personnel expenses. Our focus on controlling base costs led to impressive domestic adjusted OIBDA growth of 11% with margins expanding by almost 200 basis points to 59%. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, U.S. cost growth in the second quarter is expected to rise at a slightly faster rate than first quarter as we increase marketing spend, partially due to an earlier Shark Week, which starts on June 26, and then expense growth will abate again in the second half of this year. 
Turning now to international operations. Excluding currency, revenues increased 3% and adjusted OIBDA decreased 2% as changes in currency mix reduced revenue growth by 6% and adjusted OIBDA growth by 12%. For comparability purposes, my following international comments will refer to our organic results only, so we'll exclude the impacts of foreign exchange and the previously mentioned SBS Radio sale. 
International organic revenues increased 7% and adjusted OIBDA declined 2% for the first quarter of 2016. The 7% first quarter revenue growth was comprised of 12% distribution growth and 4% advertising growth. Our 12% affiliate revenue growth was due to higher affiliate rates in Eastern and Northern Europe where we have been successful in leveraging our expanded content portfolio, that now includes sports, to drive higher contracted pricing increases; increased subscribers in Latin America; as well as contributions from Eurosport France, which was not consolidated into the second quarter of last year. Excluding Eurosport France, affiliate revenues were up high single digits. Going forward, we still expect organic distribution growth to remain in the high single-digit range for the rest of 2016. 
Turning to our first quarter international advertising results. While we benefited from higher pricing and delivery in Southern Europe and higher volumes in Central Europe, growth in these markets was partially offset by declines in Northern Europe, our largest advertising region. Northern Europe was impacted by the February Telenor blackout in the Nordics that we highlighted on our year-end call; and overall softness in the U.K. and Nordic markets due to macro factors; and lower ratings across the region, especially at our female-skewing networks. While the Telenor blackout did have a negative impact beyond the 10 days we were dark, as advertisers shifted their money elsewhere due to the uncertainty around our contract renewal, our standing up for the value of our content paid off, as the long-term economic upside from the new deal is significantly greater than the temporary advertising losses incurred while going dark. Excluding the impact from the Telenor blackout, first quarter international advertising revenue increased 7%. We're delivering on our promise that the investments we're making in content and brands will drive sustained global affiliate growth, and this very positive Telenor deal outcome supports this thesis. 
Another factor that impacted our first quarter ad results and will continue to affect results for the rest of the year is a shift in the Middle East, where we are pivoting from a free-to-air model to a pay-TV model. As part of our exclusive content deal with 2 key affiliate partners, we have locked in long-term affiliate fees, which enhances OIBDA but shifts ad revenue to affiliate revenue. 
Our international ad sales is currently trending at high single to low double digits, but we do expect the ad growth to accelerate to low double digits in the second half of the year. Second half growth will be led by increases in the U.K. as we expect pricing and ad market pressures to ease post the Euro championships and the June 23 Brexit vote as well as continued strong growth in Latin America, Eastern Europe and Southern Europe. 
Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses internationally grew 11% in the first quarter, primarily due to higher content amortization as well as costs associated with Eurosport France; and adjusted OIBDA declined 2%. Looking ahead, it is very important to note that cost growth and, therefore, adjusted OIBDA growth will be lumpy on a quarterly basis, mostly driven by the timing of sporting events. We currently expect second quarter organic expense growth to be similar to that of the first quarter. Cost growth will then significantly moderate in the back half of the year to being up mid-single digits as we're able to more fully leverage our pre-existing sports rights and local market people and infrastructure. 
Lastly, regarding our financial expectations for the Olympics. As a result of the very positive and better-than-planned licensing deals that Dave highlighted in the U.K., Netherlands and Finland, we now expect meaningfully positive cumulative Olympic-related cash flows through the 2024 games. We forecast that aggregate revenues from this deal will significantly exceed total costs. 
Now taking a look at our share repurchases. In the first quarter, we repurchased a total of $373 million in shares. We have now spent over $7 billion buying back shares since we began our buyback program at the end of 2010, and we reduced our outstanding share count by 36% as we continue to find the return on repurchasing our own shares very attractive. 
Getting back to our full year guidance. As stated, we are raising our constant-currency adjusted EPS and constant-currency free cash flow growth to being up at least high teens. Our guidance includes potential upcoming personnel-related and other restructuring charges of approximately $40 million to $60 million, as outlined in our 8-K, and also assumes full year stock-based compensation of approximately $55 million and no further P&L impact from the Lionsgate investment we made last year. We also now expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate to now be approximately 29% versus our prior expectation of 30% as we continue to realize significant benefits from our multiyear global tax strategies. 
I also now update the expected year-over-year foreign exchange impact on our full year reported results. As a result of the dollar weakening year-to-date versus most of the global currencies, the expected year-over-year FX impact has significantly improved since we last guided on February 18. Assuming current spot rates stay constant for the rest of the year, FX is now expected to reduce our constant-currency revenue by $100 million to $110 million and adjusted OIBDA by $70 million to $80 million. We now also expect a positive FX impact to adjusted EPS of $0.01 to $0.05 due to the net effect of this year's adjusted OIBDA impact and last year's over $100 million of below-the-line FX impact. 
In closing, I'm extremely pleased with Discovery's start to 2016. We are fully committed to constant-currency margin expansion and our higher full year 2016 guidance metrics. As I noted earlier, we will continue to assess operating trends and proactively manage Discovery's overall expense base to best position the company for growth as the media industry evolves.

The right side is growth, and we're -- we've been investing significantly more in content each year, more money in creating -- in the whole creative side of our business as well as our direct-to-consumer business and our TV Everywhere business. And as we look at the overall infrastructure, we just felt that there was a lot of opportunity to attack all of our other costs. And where the $40 million to $60 million is something that we think will make our company more efficient. We think there's probably more opportunity there as we're looking at additional technology opportunities, working -- we have satellites all over the world. We have technology infrastructure all over the world and a lot of that, over the next year or 2, we think we could also get more efficient. So the -- our overall strategy of continuing to invest in more content, build relationships with consumers on all platforms, just lightening up our existing infrastructure cost helps our margins, gives us more opportunity to invest in all those platforms and makes us stronger."

So the advertising market remains robust. We'll talk about it a little bit later. We don't have that much information on the upfront, but the pricing in scatter is very strong, and cancellations on options are down significantly from the last few years. So the environment feels quite good going into the upfront, I think, for us and the whole marketplace. On the point of over-the-top, I think one of the things that makes us very well positioned is we have our 14 channels, which represents about 12% of viewership on cable. And even though we're looking at high single to double-digit affiliate growth domestically, we still only get about 5.5% of the economics, so 12% of viewership, 5.5% of the economics. And you have ID as the #1 or 2 channel for women, the most valued channel on cable in Discovery; Oprah the #1 channel for African-American women with OWN; and TLC, one of the top 2 or 3 networks in Middle America. And so we're very, very good value for -- with our channels, including Animal Planet being one of the top 3 or 4 channels that people value in terms of brand, but also in terms of economics. If you took just our top 6 channels, that would represent about 83% of our affiliate. If you only took 4, it would be 70%. We are talking to everyone. And one of the things, I think, there's kind of 2 baskets: If it's a non-sports package, then I think we will be an extraordinarily powerful piece of that as we bring so many demos and so much strength to a package like that. But for all packages, we're very economically attractive. And with Discovery, ID, Animal Planet and Oprah, it's very difficult, I think, to have a compelling package without us. We're talking to everyone. The reason that we're not on Sling right now is that our deal, Charlie [ph], those deals tend to get done on Sling as the deals come up, and our deal with Charlie [ph] is not up. But we look at over-the-top as a real opportunity. And we can even see it in our TV Everywhere product, how much our content is being consumed by consumers, which is quite attractive."

And it's very hard to predict, so I'm not going to predict where it's going to be in the quarters ahead. We thought, in the second and third quarter of last year, that it was going to really be a challenge. Some of the things that are happening is, one, the measurability is getting better. A number of companies that moved more quickly to digital found that their market share -- they had market share challenges. And so I think you have 2 baskets: How effective is television advertising? It's still probably the most effective of all advertising. And two, knowing that you're getting the actual value and it could be proven. And in fact, when you get paid only on L3, for us, we leave about 14% of viewership on the table, and there are a lot of people in the industry that do more than that. So the fact that you're getting -- that the advertiser is getting the full value and they only pay on what you watch for the first 3 days, there's actually an over-delivery. So at least for now, I think the view is that it's quite an effective way to reach a broad audience and to reach across demos. And it's not a -- you don't get embarrassed by finding out 9 months later that there was an issue with it when you don't have to worry that it's not going to deliver in terms of your -- the ability to move product. It does feel good right now. The whole U.S. market feels good. I think this whole narrative of -- when -- toward the end of last year, this idea that universe numbers were declining precipitously as a result of distributors losing subscribers, their overall viewership on cable was declining, that advertising was going to decline in an accelerating rate, all of those have moved, I think, in our favor. So at least for the near term, we see the U.S. now as a meaningful growth market. And for the near term -- I mean, for the next several years, with having high single-digit affiliate growth locked in, with 80% of our deals done, even if the universe declines, which we don't -- which it looks now like it's stabilized, and even if the advertising market declines, we'll still have a U.S. growth market. And if the advertising market stays like it is now, we'll have a very significant U.S. growth market. So it feels good like -- for now, and let's hope it continues."

We're embedded with creative talent, commercial talent in serving 220 countries and all the cost has been embedded. When we did do Eurosport, and as we've tucked in channels, we've been able to get meaningful synergy because we have 10 to 12 channels in every country. We're always opportunistic, but I think we're very happy with our existing mix. The way we see it now is we have this great sports IP in Europe and Discovery is on brand and growing with real pull-through. And in our most recent deals, the negative is, we've had to pull our signal 3 times. We did it with Telenor, the largest distributor in the Nordics. We did it Telia in Sweden, and we did it with Boxer in Sweden. And so we took near-term hits by doing that. But in all 3 cases, we were back up, and we got very significant increases. And the deals are long term, which give us -- which move us from the potential to go from mid-single. We're now at high single, and we're looking to get to double digit. And so we think with -- we've improved our IP portfolio. The same is true for us in Latin America, where Kids has gotten a lot stronger, and we have a number of female networks that are stronger. So I think we're in a very good position now. We like our -- we've improved our IP. As our deals come up, I think you'll see our affiliate line growing internationally because our content has improved. We're taking some of that content direct to consumer, and we're having some success. And so we would have to see something that would help us grow faster. Because, I think, we had a -- we sort of took a step back with SBS, and we took a step back with Eurosport. We've acquired the sports IP we think we need, and I think we're making the turn. We now -- we're very happy with the Olympics. And margins should start to grow now in Eurosport. I think we like the position we're in. We've worked hard over the last 3 years to get in this position, to get all the infrastructure in place. And so we got the synergy if there's a good asset out there, but it's going to have to help us grow faster."

Look, I think the thing that's going to drive our distribution revenue the hardest is the fact that our share has been growing over the last several years. And as these deals come up, we have more share and we have -- as well as sports rights or Kids. And we've been standing up for our value in a way that we haven't in the past. And part of that has to do with -- through this recession and challenge over the last 8 years, most content players have reduced their content investment. So we go into these deals where we've increased our investment, we've increased our share, and we've been able to get more significant dollars. The second piece that is important is that there's been a change in the marketplace over the last year, and that's distributors are now looking to decommoditize their platforms. They don't want to just be pipes to the home or pipes to a device. So they're looking to get exclusive content. So what you saw us do in the Middle East, where some of our advertising revenue went away, it's because we did exclusive deals with OSN and with BeIN for each -- we did our regular package, and then we gave each of them some exclusive content, and we were able to get significant economics. In addition, we did a similar thing with Canal Plus, and we're in a number of discussions with distributors. This is something that could either -- right now, you see our affiliate line internationally growing. We want to push that to double digit. If the opportunity for exclusive content continues, you're going to see that line begin to move up higher in a way that's a lot easier to be moving the advertising line. Our goal on advertising is to get it back up to double digit, which we think we can do. But the distribution line, we're quite optimistic about. On TV Everywhere, the point that we made in -- a couple of months ago is that TV Everywhere is just much more effective in Europe because TV Everywhere really means TV Everywhere. Everything is on the platform. It's helpful because I think it's an impediment to the SVOD platforms coming into those markets. So you have 2 things helping the kind of -- a pushback on Netflix and some of the other SVOD platforms. One is, that a number of us are going direct to consumer ourselves, like us, with the Eurosport app or Dplay. Two is, that players like FOX and Liberty Global are going direct to consumer with our TV Everywhere platforms, and they have everything. So unlike here in the U.S., which is finally getting it together and we're seeing the great benefit of that, and Brian is leading in that with X1, in Europe, it really is TV Everywhere. And that is a big benefit to us, and it will help us on advertising. And Sky is having a real positive with NOW TV. And you got to take your hat off to James and to Jeremy Darroch because they've really -- they've invested and we're on Now TV. And so being part of a cable operator's platform, for us, is a much more favorable environment."

I love the fact that Les is talking about being double digit. On a practical level, across all of our domestic portfolio, we tend to be maybe 1 point behind. So if broadcast gets 9, maybe we get 8. If broadcast gets 11, maybe we get 10. If they get 6, we get 5. That's the way it's been historically. Having said that, our channels are very firmly on brand. And we've been able to get some significant benefit. So some of our channels, like ID and Velocity, have been up 50% or 60% higher in CPM over the last year. Discovery CPM is up higher. So I think there's a real benefit as you look at OWN, ID, Discovery, Velocity, even Science. So we've worked hard to get back to brand and to really be nourishing a very specific demographic audience. And so we've been rewarded on those channels, I think, a little bit more. ID still has a lot of headroom for us. It's length of view is the highest of any channel on cable. And it's -- you have an ability to reach women all day where we're #1 on cable, late night, we're #1. And so we think there's still some significant upside on that. But when you average all of our channels together, we'll tend to do about -- a little bit, probably a little bit behind what some of the -- maybe the best broadcast network does. And if we can get a little bit lucky with ID and pushing it, maybe we can -- even though we don't have the same amount of reach in terms of being able to roll out a product, we could maybe reach it. But we'll do well, I think."

And then, Doug, just to go through your capital question. Look, there's a couple of important points here. One, we are extremely committed to investment grade. It gives us access to long-term capital, gives us access to multicurrency commercial paper",198,"Yes. And then, Doug, just to go through your capital question. Look, there's a couple of important points here. One, we are extremely committed to investment grade. It gives us access to long-term capital, gives us access to multicurrency commercial paper. So it absolutely is the right kind of capital assessment for us, an investment grade. Also, if you look at our access to capital today, we issued a long-term bond earlier in the year, many times oversubscribed. Rates are actually more in the BBB rating. So even though we intentionally took our rating down to BBB-, the markets still view us as being more BBB, especially with our mid-teen free cash flow to debt yield. And look, the other point I'd make, Doug, which I think is so important, if you think about our capital expansion, given our high single OIBDA growth and given what is an improving currency environment, we're seeing a lot of available capital based on just our profit growth and our ability to leverage that profit growth. So there's no shortage of capital that we have to be proactive and to play offense with either buying stock or allocating capital to the acquisitions."

Look, the U.S. market is really quite different from the international market because the U.S. is really just one culture, and it's one satellite. And so it's football, baseball, basketball, hockey. And because there's a very competitive environment",610,"Sure. Look, the U.S. market is really quite different from the international market because the U.S. is really just one culture, and it's one satellite. And so it's football, baseball, basketball, hockey. And because there's a very competitive environment by some of the biggest media companies to get into that space, because that's where most of the affiliate revenue has gone over the years, to those that have those sports rights, those rights have accelerated, as you've seen. And the fight for those 4 sports, more and more, has generated huge increases. In Europe, you see that for soccer, in-market. So you've seen that kind of huge increases on renewals. What we've been able to do with Eurosport is we've done over 70 deals on Eurosport, and all of our deals are in the low single to mid-single-digit increase. Even on the Olympics itself, we were able to get the Olympics for mid-single-digit increase on what it had gone for 4 years earlier. And so we've been quite disciplined to get -- about getting our sports right. And Eurosport now remains profitable. We've made the turn. We don't think we need to own a lot more IP. We'll do it opportunistically. So -- and again, when we pick up speed skating, we're picking up a sport that might be the #1 sport in 4 markets all across Northern Europe. When we pick up handball, we're picking up a sport, that's the #1 sport in Poland. So a lot of this -- picking up tennis and cycling, so for us, we're sort of the home for everything but soccer. And we've also picked up a lot of IP for very little. And remember, there is no bidder for sports in Europe that can provide the platform that we provide. Eurosport has 3 channels in every market, but we have 150 million homes on just one of our channels. So ESPN is a little less than 100, and we have 150 million. So when a federation wants to sell a sport -- soccer is sold locally, but most other sports are sold either across Europe, or you have to do 55 deals. And so I think that's the unique advantage that we have as a very complex market, both in terms of taste, culture and language that we set up to deal with. And the fact that we have the only Pan-European sports channels gives us a unique advantage. And I think, over time, our ability to continue to get these rights should be pretty stable. There's not a lot of people that are bidding for the kind the sports that we're building our business on. Finally, on the international advertising. Telenor hurt us this quarter. It hurt us significantly. It is the biggest distributor in the Nordics, which is one of our biggest markets. We were off for 11 days, and so not only did we lose on those 11 days, but some money moved. It's all back now, but it had an impact. But it really resonated in the market. We were able to get very significant economics, and driving that long-cycle top line for us is critical. If you put Telenor back into your economics, we would've been -- our international business would've been positive in the mid-single digits versus negative. But we're fighting for the long term. So this quarter, we expect -- the first 2 quarters, we expect to see in the high single range. And in the second half of the year, we expect acceleration into the double-digit range. And whether on average that ends up being high single or low double, we'll have to see."

And then secondly for David, just on -- going back to the theme and the subject of new over-the-top platforms and distribution. I feel like we all went through this period of handwringing last year about whether Apple is going to launch something like this. And I think you and I spoke about it, and my thought was that profitability was the real reason that Eddy Cue and Apple decided not to move forward, the fact that the RSNs [ph] were just going to be too costly as part of this sort of virtual MVPD bundle and so forth. So I'd just -- what do you guys think about the fact that the new Hulu venture is likely to be unprofitable out of the gate? Does it surprise you that others are deciding to move forward with a business like that even if it's operating at a loss or as a loss lever?"

So I don't want to speak specifically to Hulu. But in general, we, as an industry, have to make some compromises. And if we do, I think we'll be healthier.

But in general, we, as an industry, have to make some compromises. And if we do, I think we'll be healthier. So if in the end, we're going to do an over-the-top bundle that's 30 channels for $30, then each of the media companies can't have every one of their channels, every one of their sports channels, every one of their regional sports channels carried. And for those that have the leverage to include all of them, then there's probably going to -- it's not going to be the best of what we have to offer. And so for instance, we have 14 channels taking -- having 6 or 8 of our channels carried in a package, to me, seems quite effective. We would get 85%, 86%. If it's only 6, we get 83% of our dollars. We've done this in a lot of markets where -- a lot happened in Brazil. The major programs all decided, ""Look, we'll get a little bit less money, but we'll be on this beginning tier. It'll serve a different audience."" In the case of Brazil, it was the C-class. In the case of the U.S, it would be more of a millennial audience. And so if we all came together and if you saw kind of the best of cable, where we would have 6 of those slots, than I think it could be quite attractive. But if we each try and put all of our kids in there, which is how we're used to doing business, I think it's going to be overly bloated. There's going to be a lot of channels that aren't that strong. It's going to be quite expensive, and it's not going to be that attractive. The marketplace is quite rational. So it'll -- I think in the end, the smaller bundles that are working around the world are those that have 20 or 30 channels, and those are kind of a best-of bouquet, and that's probably where it'll end up in the U.S. As I've said, with all the talk about this, the only place that the skinny bundle is going to present is over-the-top. Because in the next 3 to 4 years, almost every programmer's contractually committed to have all their channels carried. And so with the exception of maybe being able to go down from -- lose 5% of you distribution or 10% of your distribution, most deals provide that you need to have all your channels carried to at least 90% or 95% of the package. And so having said that, I would -- I like the skinny bundle. I was very interested in what Apple was doing. And I think, again, the fact that we have the #1 channel on cable, the #1 channel for women, the #1 channel for African-Americans and our channels are reasonable, with high-quality content, puts us in a position to be part of those bundles. And we'll have those discussions, and over time, I'm confident that we will. In terms of rationalizing costs for smaller networks, 2 things: We had quite a good quarter, but we also -- our content channels were hurt, I think, a little bit more than some others by the news networks. The news networks were up 38%. But every night, whether it was a Republican or a Democratic debate, a lot of that energy came out of some of our nonfiction channels. We feel pretty good about how we're going to do this quarter. There's some of our channels, we need to improve. One of those is Animal Planet. We just brought in a new GM. We're working hard on turning TLC. But Discovery, Science, ID, Velocity, OWN are all running very strong. And so we're looking at everything. But in the end, this cost cutting that we're doing right now isn't related to the channels. The channels are a journey to find -- to make sure our brands are right and we're reaching an audience. The cost cutting is really the other side of the house where we're having some effect of efficiency."

You saw it in the first quarter, up 70 basis points, and we're committing to revenues growing faster than cost. And so those are 2 critical elements of our strategic financial plan, and a big piece of that is not only accelerating top line, but managing costs so that it grow slower than revenues."

I'm pleased about Discovery's operating and financial momentum with current trends in the U.S. particularly strong and international investments driving new value across our portfolio. While we continue to face certain secular and economic challenges in various markets around the world, we are evolving in a consumer video marketplace with 7 billion worldwide screens and are optimistic about our global growth profile in the more than 220 markets. 
As Andy will discuss in more detail, we are focused on spending more on growth, in content and in direct-to-consumer platforms, while relentlessly driving down cost growth in all non-content cost areas. If it is not going to nourish audiences or help us grow long term, we are attacking it. As a result, I'm pleased to announce today that we will have real constant-currency margin expansion for the full 2016 year. 
The ultimate goal is to maximize growth, first and foremost, in our linear TV business, while aggressively pursuing new opportunities to diversify and strengthen our content and bring it to more screens and more people around the world. These cost savings will allow us to continue growing our business by focusing our investment in 4 key areas: more investment in content, more investment in our international growth markets, more investment in digital services and OTT products, and more investment in sports. 
Our expansion into sports is well underway with Eurosport. We have been on a journey to revitalize the brand with locally relevant sports rights and programming. And we are realizing the potential of this cash flow-positive business, and we're starting to see meaningful results, including double-digit growth all across Europe. And we're leveraging the power of sports programming by driving meaningful affiliate value across our whole portfolio, which you will see grow further in the years ahead. 
In addition, the Eurosport Player is generating value by offering a deeper, more immersive experience all across Europe. It's a separate offering with unique content from what we have on our Eurosport channels all across Europe. Tennis fanatics were able to watch up to 16 courts at the Australian Open. And at the beginning of the year, Squash TV launched as a dedicated channel on Eurosport Player with 500 hours of squash action a year. 
Our distinct digital offering allows us to have a direct economic relationship with viewers and gives us an opportunity to go deeper into the sports they love. It's a richer, different value proposition from our linear channels. In the first quarter, subscription growth increased double digits versus last year, proving Eurosport's content and brand power is a multiscreen opportunity for us. 
We continue to monetize our Olympics investment by signing sublicensing deals in the Netherlands and Finland, which followed our deal with the BBC in the U.K. These agreements significantly exceeded our plan. We have retained all rights to the Olympics on all platforms so that we could pursue incremental value and deals on mobile, on social media with players like Facebook Live and Twitter or going direct to consumer on our Eurosport app. The Olympics will not only be profitable, but based on the deals that we've done already, we expect the Olympics will make real money for us on each of the games. 
Moving on to our entire international portfolio. Our international average audience was up over 5%, driven by worldwide viewership strength from Discovery Channel, especially in Russia, Brazil and Mexico; and strong performances from our female networks in Latin America. And Germany also enjoyed strong double-digit growth, driven by TLC and DMAX. Across all of our international markets, we are getting good value for our portfolio of global brands and sports, and the momentum remains strong with recent renewals. As I mentioned last quarter, we pulled our channels in the Nordics to Telenor subscribers as we stood up for the value of our content. And we were able to win significant increases in our renewal and lock in long-term growth. We believe in the value of our content, and we will continue to stand up and fight for the value. 
Looking at our U.S. portfolio. We had another quarter of very strong results. We are extremely pleased with our current domestic trends, and ad growth remains solid as we head into the second quarter and the upfront. Discovery Channel had its second-highest-rated quarter ever in prime time with 8 of the top-10 unscripted shows on cable, including Gold Rush, Fast N' Loud and Alaskan Bush People, ranked 1, 2 and 3. ID was the #2 network for women and had its best quarter ever in prime time. Velocity had its highest-delivering quarter ever and Science its highest-rated quarter ever. And starting next month, we welcome back Patrice Andrews, who is most recently with ITV and A&E, as the new General Manager of Animal Planet. Patrice is a fantastic storyteller and a great creative leader. She'll be a big help to driving the value of Animal Planet. 
Beyond traditional pay-TV distribution, people want access to our brands and content across all screens. As we own most of our IP, we are driving our digital strategy and making progress in diversifying how and where we reach consumers, particularly younger viewers. Across all these efforts, we are building audiences, learning consumption habits and expanding monetization models. Part of our digital strategy is to add value to pay-TV subscribers through our own TV Everywhere products, such as Discovery GO in the U.S., Discovery K!ds Play in Latin America, and by extending the availability of our content through distributor TV Everywhere products. It's very early days for Discovery GO, but we are pleased with our initial results. The platform is clearly appealing to a younger audience as 50% of our visitors are in the 18 to 34 demo. And we are selling CPMs at a significant premium, highlighting the appeal of our long-form content in the digital space. 
Second, we continue engaging millennials and younger audiences with Discovery Digital Networks. Today, we average more than 300 million streams each month. And we are now focusing our web-native efforts onto 2 key brands that are resonating with advertisers and with users: Seeker and SourceFed. 
Over the last 2 years, we have drilled down and developed a best-in-class virtual-reality content. The Discovery virtual reality app has over 30 million views in the last few months, and we have developed over 100 pieces of virtual reality content, with a new offering every week. We're very excited about the possibilities to immerse audiences in new story formats and create meaningful opportunities for advertisers. As content gets closer to real, our content brands move to the top of the heap. 
Finally, we're focusing on delivering for super fans with select, direct-to-consumer offerings. In Europe, the Eurosport Player and Dplay exemplify our aim to grow audiences across platforms and continue to provide captivating exclusive content across more screens than ever before. And we recently took a minority stake in Rugby Pass, the definitive OTT product for rugby fans in 23 markets in Asia. Across all these efforts, we are learning viewing habits and amassing data on how best to reach consumers across all screens. 
As we begin another year, Discovery is well positioned to broaden our reach and relevance with our audiences. We end the quarter with a lot of optimism. Our U.S. business is a real meaningful growth business, even given small subscriber universe declines. And as a company, worldwide, 50% of our revenues come from long-cycle distribution agreements with strong contractual growth rates. In our international business, we've turned the corner on currency and are now starting to realize some tailwinds that could grow stronger in the months and years ahead. And we're investing in the growth areas for the future. We are confident in the long-term growth profile of the company and our ability to create sustainable shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Andy for details of our financial results."

Before I review our first quarter results, I want to highlight a few very important and positive updates regarding our 2016 guidance. As David mentioned, we are now committing to total company constant-currency margin expansion for the year. We want to ensure that we position Discovery for growth in both existing and new areas and continue to embrace change to drive innovation across the company. As the industry evolves, we will continue to evolve with it. We have consistently highlighted our flexible cost structures and the fact that we own or control most of our own content across all global platforms as 2 of our most critical competitive advantages. And these advantages are allowing us to maximize our profit growth while taking advantage of new opportunities as the new ecosystem evolves. 
As a company, we have, for several years now, taken a very hard look at our cost structures and continue to see and realize opportunities to become leaner while freeing up dollars to continue investing in new platforms like mobile and OTT. Spending on global content IP will always be our priority. We were focused on managing down growth in all other cost areas to ensure that our constant-currency revenues will grow faster than our constant-currency cost. Our 2016 SG&A cost productivity has been much better than planned. You may have seen yesterday that we filed an 8-K specifying additional personnel-related cost-reduction initiatives that will yield cost benefits in the second half of 2016 as well as full year 2017. We remain highly focused on paring back cost growth in non-content expense areas and reallocating traditional linear business costs to new media platforms and content development around the globe, such as mobile, short-form video, sports and direct-to-consumer initiatives. 
As a result of this commitment to margin expansion as well as our better-than-planned U.S. ad sales performance to date, we are also raising our 2016 adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance to being up at least high teens on a constant-currency basis. With our first quarter constant-currency margins up almost 100 basis points; adjusted OIBDA, ex FX, up 7%; and adjusted EPS, ex FX, up 18%, we're off to a very strong start to the year. In addition, with the U.S. dollar softening year-to-date, currency headwinds have begun to subside and are meaningfully better for 2016 than we quantified on our year-end call. More on this later. 
Now let's talk about our first quarter results in more detail. Reported revenues and adjusted OIBDA were both up 2%. Excluding currency impacts, revenues were up 5% and adjusted OIBDA was up 7%. On an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as prior-year contributions from SBS Radio, which we sold on June 30, 2015, total company revenues and adjusted OIBDA both grew 7%. Net income available to Discovery Communications of $263 million was up 5% from the first quarter a year ago, primarily driven by improved operating performance, a lower effective tax rate and a gain from the SBS Radio sale, partially offset by higher stock-based compensation and a decline on income from equity investees. We were able to lower our effective tax rate by another 400 basis points from the full year 2015 rate to 29% this quarter. 
Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter was $0.42, 14% above the first quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per diluted share, a more relevant metric from a comparability perspective as it excludes the impact from acquisition-related noncash amortization of intangible assets, was $0.46, a 10% improvement versus 1Q 2015. Excluding currency impacts, adjusted EPS was up 18% for the quarter and was up 11% for the last 12-month period over the prior 12-month period. First quarter free cash flow increased 62% as improved operating performance and lower cash taxes were partially offset by higher content spend. First quarter free cash flow growth, excluding currency effects, was strong and increased 53% for the last 12-month period compared to the prior 12 months. 
Turning to the operating units. Our U.S. Networks had a spectacular quarter with total revenues up 8%, led by 8% distribution growth and 7% advertising growth. And adjusted OIBDA was up a very impressive 11%. Our 7% advertising growth, which accelerated from 5% in the prior quarter, was due to higher pricing and proactively managing and monetizing the inventory to take advantage of the strong demand in the scatter market, offsetting lower delivery. The ad market currently remains quite healthy. And looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect advertising revenues to have another strong quarter with second quarter's year-over-year growth similar to that of our first quarter. 
Our Domestic Distribution revenues were up 8% while total portfolio subs again declined by about 1% versus the first quarter of last year. We continue to benefit from the higher rates we garnered from our recent deals, including our most recent deal with Comcast, which went into effect on January 1. 
Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses in the quarter were up 3%, cost of revenues were up 7%, while SG&A declined 4% due primarily to lower personnel expenses. Our focus on controlling base costs led to impressive domestic adjusted OIBDA growth of 11% with margins expanding by almost 200 basis points to 59%. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, U.S. cost growth in the second quarter is expected to rise at a slightly faster rate than first quarter as we increase marketing spend, partially due to an earlier Shark Week, which starts on June 26, and then expense growth will abate again in the second half of this year. 
Turning now to international operations. Excluding currency, revenues increased 3% and adjusted OIBDA decreased 2% as changes in currency mix reduced revenue growth by 6% and adjusted OIBDA growth by 12%. For comparability purposes, my following international comments will refer to our organic results only, so we'll exclude the impacts of foreign exchange and the previously mentioned SBS Radio sale. 
International organic revenues increased 7% and adjusted OIBDA declined 2% for the first quarter of 2016. The 7% first quarter revenue growth was comprised of 12% distribution growth and 4% advertising growth. Our 12% affiliate revenue growth was due to higher affiliate rates in Eastern and Northern Europe where we have been successful in leveraging our expanded content portfolio, that now includes sports, to drive higher contracted pricing increases; increased subscribers in Latin America; as well as contributions from Eurosport France, which was not consolidated into the second quarter of last year. Excluding Eurosport France, affiliate revenues were up high single digits. Going forward, we still expect organic distribution growth to remain in the high single-digit range for the rest of 2016. 
Turning to our first quarter international advertising results. While we benefited from higher pricing and delivery in Southern Europe and higher volumes in Central Europe, growth in these markets was partially offset by declines in Northern Europe, our largest advertising region. Northern Europe was impacted by the February Telenor blackout in the Nordics that we highlighted on our year-end call; and overall softness in the U.K. and Nordic markets due to macro factors; and lower ratings across the region, especially at our female-skewing networks. While the Telenor blackout did have a negative impact beyond the 10 days we were dark, as advertisers shifted their money elsewhere due to the uncertainty around our contract renewal, our standing up for the value of our content paid off, as the long-term economic upside from the new deal is significantly greater than the temporary advertising losses incurred while going dark. Excluding the impact from the Telenor blackout, first quarter international advertising revenue increased 7%. We're delivering on our promise that the investments we're making in content and brands will drive sustained global affiliate growth, and this very positive Telenor deal outcome supports this thesis. 
Another factor that impacted our first quarter ad results and will continue to affect results for the rest of the year is a shift in the Middle East, where we are pivoting from a free-to-air model to a pay-TV model. As part of our exclusive content deal with 2 key affiliate partners, we have locked in long-term affiliate fees, which enhances OIBDA but shifts ad revenue to affiliate revenue. 
Our international ad sales is currently trending at high single to low double digits, but we do expect the ad growth to accelerate to low double digits in the second half of the year. Second half growth will be led by increases in the U.K. as we expect pricing and ad market pressures to ease post the Euro championships and the June 23 Brexit vote as well as continued strong growth in Latin America, Eastern Europe and Southern Europe. 
Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses internationally grew 11% in the first quarter, primarily due to higher content amortization as well as costs associated with Eurosport France; and adjusted OIBDA declined 2%. Looking ahead, it is very important to note that cost growth and, therefore, adjusted OIBDA growth will be lumpy on a quarterly basis, mostly driven by the timing of sporting events. We currently expect second quarter organic expense growth to be similar to that of the first quarter. Cost growth will then significantly moderate in the back half of the year to being up mid-single digits as we're able to more fully leverage our pre-existing sports rights and local market people and infrastructure. 
Lastly, regarding our financial expectations for the Olympics. As a result of the very positive and better-than-planned licensing deals that Dave highlighted in the U.K., Netherlands and Finland, we now expect meaningfully positive cumulative Olympic-related cash flows through the 2024 games. We forecast that aggregate revenues from this deal will significantly exceed total costs. 
Now taking a look at our share repurchases. In the first quarter, we repurchased a total of $373 million in shares. We have now spent over $7 billion buying back shares since we began our buyback program at the end of 2010, and we reduced our outstanding share count by 36% as we continue to find the return on repurchasing our own shares very attractive. 
Getting back to our full year guidance. As stated, we are raising our constant-currency adjusted EPS and constant-currency free cash flow growth to being up at least high teens. Our guidance includes potential upcoming personnel-related and other restructuring charges of approximately $40 million to $60 million, as outlined in our 8-K, and also assumes full year stock-based compensation of approximately $55 million and no further P&L impact from the Lionsgate investment we made last year. We also now expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate to now be approximately 29% versus our prior expectation of 30% as we continue to realize significant benefits from our multiyear global tax strategies. 
I also now update the expected year-over-year foreign exchange impact on our full year reported results. As a result of the dollar weakening year-to-date versus most of the global currencies, the expected year-over-year FX impact has significantly improved since we last guided on February 18. Assuming current spot rates stay constant for the rest of the year, FX is now expected to reduce our constant-currency revenue by $100 million to $110 million and adjusted OIBDA by $70 million to $80 million. We now also expect a positive FX impact to adjusted EPS of $0.01 to $0.05 due to the net effect of this year's adjusted OIBDA impact and last year's over $100 million of below-the-line FX impact. 
In closing, I'm extremely pleased with Discovery's start to 2016. We are fully committed to constant-currency margin expansion and our higher full year 2016 guidance metrics. As I noted earlier, we will continue to assess operating trends and proactively manage Discovery's overall expense base to best position the company for growth as the media industry evolves. I remain very optimistic about our global portfolio as well as our overall financial and operating momentum. 
Thanks again for your time this morning. And now Dave and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have."

And as we look at the overall infrastructure, we just felt that there was a lot of opportunity to attack all of our other costs. And where the $40 million to $60 million is something that we think will make our company more efficient. We think there's probably more opportunity there as we're looking at additional technology opportunities, working -- we have satellites all over the world. We have technology infrastructure all over the world and a lot of that, over the next year or 2, we think we could also get more efficient. So the -- our overall strategy of continuing to invest in more content, build relationships with consumers on all platforms, just lightening up our existing infrastructure cost helps our margins, gives us more opportunity to invest in all those platforms and makes us stronger."

So the advertising market remains robust. We'll talk about it a little bit later. We don't have that much information on the upfront, but the pricing in scatter is very strong, and cancellations on options are down significantly from the last few years. So the environment feels quite good going into the upfront, I think, for us and the whole marketplace. On the point of over-the-top, I think one of the things that makes us very well positioned is we have our 14 channels, which represents about 12% of viewership on cable. And even though we're looking at high single to double-digit affiliate growth domestically, we still only get about 5.5% of the economics, so 12% of viewership, 5.5% of the economics. And you have ID as the #1 or 2 channel for women, the most valued channel on cable in Discovery; Oprah the #1 channel for African-American women with OWN; and TLC, one of the top 2 or 3 networks in Middle America. And so we're very, very good value for -- with our channels, including Animal Planet being one of the top 3 or 4 channels that people value in terms of brand, but also in terms of economics. If you took just our top 6 channels, that would represent about 83% of our affiliate. If you only took 4, it would be 70%. We are talking to everyone. And one of the things, I think, there's kind of 2 baskets: If it's a non-sports package, then I think we will be an extraordinarily powerful piece of that as we bring so many demos and so much strength to a package like that. But for all packages, we're very economically attractive. And with Discovery, ID, Animal Planet and Oprah, it's very difficult, I think, to have a compelling package without us. We're talking to everyone. The reason that we're not on Sling right now is that our deal, Charlie [ph], those deals tend to get done on Sling as the deals come up, and our deal with Charlie [ph] is not up. But we look at over-the-top as a real opportunity. And we can even see it in our TV Everywhere product, how much our content is being consumed by consumers, which is quite attractive."

And it's very hard to predict, so I'm not going to predict where it's going to be in the quarters ahead. We thought, in the second and third quarter of last year, that it was going to really be a challenge. Some of the things that are happening is, one, the measurability is getting better. A number of companies that moved more quickly to digital found that their market share -- they had market share challenges. And so I think you have 2 baskets: How effective is television advertising? It's still probably the most effective of all advertising. And two, knowing that you're getting the actual value and it could be proven. And in fact, when you get paid only on L3, for us, we leave about 14% of viewership on the table, and there are a lot of people in the industry that do more than that. So the fact that you're getting -- that the advertiser is getting the full value and they only pay on what you watch for the first 3 days, there's actually an over-delivery. So at least for now, I think the view is that it's quite an effective way to reach a broad audience and to reach across demos. And it's not a -- you don't get embarrassed by finding out 9 months later that there was an issue with it when you don't have to worry that it's not going to deliver in terms of your -- the ability to move product. It does feel good right now. The whole U.S. market feels good. I think this whole narrative of -- when -- toward the end of last year, this idea that universe numbers were declining precipitously as a result of distributors losing subscribers, their overall viewership on cable was declining, that advertising was going to decline in an accelerating rate, all of those have moved, I think, in our favor. So at least for the near term, we see the U.S. now as a meaningful growth market. And for the near term -- I mean, for the next several years, with having high single-digit affiliate growth locked in, with 80% of our deals done, even if the universe declines, which we don't -- which it looks now like it's stabilized, and even if the advertising market declines, we'll still have a U.S. growth market. And if the advertising market stays like it is now, we'll have a very significant U.S. growth market. So it feels good like -- for now, and let's hope it continues."

When we did do Eurosport, and as we've tucked in channels, we've been able to get meaningful synergy because we have 10 to 12 channels in every country. We're always opportunistic, but I think we're very happy with our existing mix. The way we see it now is we have this great sports IP in Europe and Discovery is on brand and growing with real pull-through. And in our most recent deals, the negative is, we've had to pull our signal 3 times. We did it with Telenor, the largest distributor in the Nordics. We did it Telia in Sweden, and we did it with Boxer in Sweden. And so we took near-term hits by doing that. But in all 3 cases, we were back up, and we got very significant increases. And the deals are long term, which give us -- which move us from the potential to go from mid-single. We're now at high single, and we're looking to get to double digit. And so we think with -- we've improved our IP portfolio. The same is true for us in Latin America, where Kids has gotten a lot stronger, and we have a number of female networks that are stronger. So I think we're in a very good position now. We like our -- we've improved our IP. As our deals come up, I think you'll see our affiliate line growing internationally because our content has improved. We're taking some of that content direct to consumer, and we're having some success. And so we would have to see something that would help us grow faster. Because, I think, we had a -- we sort of took a step back with SBS, and we took a step back with Eurosport. We've acquired the sports IP we think we need, and I think we're making the turn. We now -- we're very happy with the Olympics. And margins should start to grow now in Eurosport. I think we like the position we're in. We've worked hard over the last 3 years to get in this position, to get all the infrastructure in place.

And so when you look at our free cash flow model and our IRR from a free cash flow perspectives, it's such a strong mid to high IRR that it's an important threshold that we look at a lens through on all allocations of capital."

We've seen Sky roll out a number of -- if you want to call OTT platforms or skinny bundles. So the market over there, particularly in Europe, seems to be evolving quite rapidly. Could you just talk about how Discovery sees that landscape? How it fits in? And is that -- are the changes you're seeing going to help drive acceleration in the high single-digit growth you've been putting up internationally?

Look, I think the thing that's going to drive our distribution revenue the hardest is the fact that our share has been growing over the last several years. And as these deals come up, we have more share and we have -- as well as sports",548,"Okay. Thanks, Ben. Look, I think the thing that's going to drive our distribution revenue the hardest is the fact that our share has been growing over the last several years. And as these deals come up, we have more share and we have -- as well as sports rights or Kids. And we've been standing up for our value in a way that we haven't in the past. And part of that has to do with -- through this recession and challenge over the last 8 years, most content players have reduced their content investment. So we go into these deals where we've increased our investment, we've increased our share, and we've been able to get more significant dollars. The second piece that is important is that there's been a change in the marketplace over the last year, and that's distributors are now looking to decommoditize their platforms. They don't want to just be pipes to the home or pipes to a device. So they're looking to get exclusive content. So what you saw us do in the Middle East, where some of our advertising revenue went away, it's because we did exclusive deals with OSN and with BeIN for each -- we did our regular package, and then we gave each of them some exclusive content, and we were able to get significant economics. In addition, we did a similar thing with Canal Plus, and we're in a number of discussions with distributors. This is something that could either -- right now, you see our affiliate line internationally growing. We want to push that to double digit. If the opportunity for exclusive content continues, you're going to see that line begin to move up higher in a way that's a lot easier to be moving the advertising line. Our goal on advertising is to get it back up to double digit, which we think we can do. But the distribution line, we're quite optimistic about. On TV Everywhere, the point that we made in -- a couple of months ago is that TV Everywhere is just much more effective in Europe because TV Everywhere really means TV Everywhere. Everything is on the platform. It's helpful because I think it's an impediment to the SVOD platforms coming into those markets. So you have 2 things helping the kind of -- a pushback on Netflix and some of the other SVOD platforms. One is, that a number of us are going direct to consumer ourselves, like us, with the Eurosport app or Dplay. Two is, that players like FOX and Liberty Global are going direct to consumer with their TV Everywhere platforms, and they have everything. So unlike here in the U.S., which is finally getting it together and we're seeing the great benefit of that, and Brian is leading in that with X1, in Europe, it really is TV Everywhere. And that is a big benefit to us, and it will help us on advertising. And Sky is having a real positive with NOW TV. And you got to take your hat off to James and to Jeremy Darroch because they've really -- they've invested and we're on Now TV. And so being part of a cable operator's platform, for us, is a much more favorable environment."

I love the fact that Les is talking about being double digit. On a practical level, across all of our domestic portfolio, we tend to be maybe 1 point behind. So if broadcast gets 9, maybe we get 8. If broadcast gets 11, maybe we get 10. If they get 6, we get 5. That's the way it's been historically. Having said that, our channels are very firmly on brand. And we've been able to get some significant benefit. So some of our channels, like ID and Velocity, have been up 50% or 60% higher in CPM over the last year. Discovery CPM is up higher. So I think there's a real benefit as you look at OWN, ID, Discovery, Velocity, even Science. So we've worked hard to get back to brand and to really be nourishing a very specific demographic audience. And so we've been rewarded on those channels, I think, a little bit more. ID still has a lot of headroom for us. It's length of view is the highest of any channel on cable. And it's -- you have an ability to reach women all day where we're #1 on cable, late night, we're #1. And so we think there's still some significant upside on that. But when you average all of our channels together, we'll tend to do about -- a little bit, probably a little bit behind what some of the -- maybe the best broadcast network does. And if we can get a little bit lucky with ID and pushing it, maybe we can -- even though we don't have the same amount of reach in terms of being able to roll out a product, we could maybe reach it. But we'll do well, I think."

Look, there's a couple of important points here. One, we are extremely committed to investment grade. It gives us access to long-term capital, gives us access to multicurrency commercial paper. So it absolutely is the right kind of capital assessment for us, an investment grade. Also, if you look at our access to capital today, we issued a long-term bond earlier in the year, many times oversubscribed. Rates are actually more in the BBB rating. So even though we intentionally took our rating down to BBB-, the markets still view us as being more BBB, especially with our mid-teen free cash flow to debt yield. And look, the other point I'd make, Doug, which I think is so important, if you think about our capital expansion, given our high single OIBDA growth and given what is an improving currency environment, we're seeing a lot of available capital based on just our profit growth and our ability to leverage that profit growth. So there's no shortage of capital that we have to be proactive and to play offense with either buying stock or allocating capital to the acquisitions."

Look, the U.S. market is really quite different from the international market because the U.S. is really just one culture, and it's one satellite. And so it's football, baseball, basketball, hockey. And because there's a very competitive environment by some of the biggest media companies to get into that space, because that's where most of the affiliate revenue has gone over the years, to those that have those sports rights, those rights have accelerated, as you've seen. And the fight for those 4 sports, more and more, has generated huge increases. In Europe, you see that for soccer, in-market. So you've seen that kind of huge increases on renewals. What we've been able to do with Eurosport is we've done over 70 deals on Eurosport, and all of our deals are in the low single to mid-single-digit increase. Even on the Olympics itself, we were able to get the Olympics for mid-single-digit increase on what it had gone for 4 years earlier. And so we've been quite disciplined to get -- about getting our sports rights. And Eurosport now remains profitable. We've made the turn. We don't think we need to own a lot more IP. We'll do it opportunistically. So -- and again, when we pick up speed skating, we're picking up a sport that might be the #1 sport in 4 markets all across Northern Europe. When we pick up handball, we're picking up a sport that's the #1 sport in Poland. So a lot of this -- picking up tennis and cycling, so for us, we're sort of the home for everything but soccer. And we've also picked up a lot of IP for very little. And remember, there is no bidder for sports in Europe that can provide the platform that we provide. Eurosport has 3 channels in every market, but we have 150 million homes on just one of our channels. So ESPN is a little less than 100, and we have 150 million. So when a federation wants to sell a sport -- soccer is sold locally, but most other sports are sold either across Europe, or you have to do 55 deals. And so I think that's the unique advantage that we have as a very complex market, both in terms of taste, culture and language that we're set up to deal with. And the fact that we have the only Pan-European sports channels gives us a unique advantage. And I think, over time, our ability to continue to get these rights should be pretty stable. There's not a lot of people that are bidding for the kind of sports that we're building our business on. Finally, on the international advertising. Telenor hurt us this quarter. It hurt us significantly. It is the biggest distributor in the Nordics, which is one of our biggest markets. We were off for 11 days, and so not only did we lose on those 11 days, but some money moved. It's all back now, but it had an impact. But it really resonated in the market. We were able to get very significant economics, and driving that long-cycle top line for us is critical. If you put Telenor back into your economics, we would've been -- our international business would've been positive in the mid-single digits versus negative. But we're fighting for the long term. So this quarter, we expect -- the first 2 quarters, we expect to see in the high single range. And in the second half of the year, we expect acceleration into the double-digit range. And whether on average that ends up being high single or low double, we'll have to see."

I just wonder, just given the underperformance in terms of ratings at some of your networks, if part of this -- as part of this initiative, you would consider rationalizing any of the underperforming, smaller cable net? And then secondly for David, just on -- going back to the theme and the subject of new over-the-top platforms and distribution. I feel like we all went through this period of handwringing last year about whether Apple is going to launch something like this. And I think you and I spoke about it, and my thought was that profitability was the real reason that Eddy Cue and Apple decided not to move forward, the fact that the RSNs [ph] were just going to be too costly as part of this sort of virtual MVPD bundle and so forth. So I'd just -- what do you guys think about the fact that the new Hulu venture is likely to be unprofitable out of the gate? Does it surprise you that others are deciding to move forward with a business like that even if it's operating at a loss or as a loss lever?"
22666093,327892507,974227,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Look, Hulu is a great product. So I don't want to speak specifically to Hulu. But in general, we, as an industry, have to make some compromises. And if we do, I think we'll be healthier. So if in the end, we're going to do an over-the-top bundle that's 30",696,"Look, Hulu is a great product. So I don't want to speak specifically to Hulu. But in general, we, as an industry, have to make some compromises. And if we do, I think we'll be healthier. So if in the end, we're going to do an over-the-top bundle that's 30 channels for $30, then each of the media companies can't have every one of their channels, every one of their sports channels, every one of their regional sports channels carried. And for those that have the leverage to include all of them, then there's probably going to -- it's not going to be the best of what we have to offer. And so for instance, we have 14 channels taking -- having 6 or 8 of our channels carried in a package, to me, seems quite effective. We would get 85%, 86%. If it's only 6, we get 83% of our dollars. We've done this in a lot of markets where -- a lot happened in Brazil. The major programmers all decided, ""Look, we'll get a little bit less money, but we'll be on this beginning tier. It'll serve a different audience."" In the case of Brazil, it was the C-class. In the case of the U.S, it would be more of a millennial audience. And so if we all came together and if you saw kind of the best of cable, where we would have 6 of those slots, than I think it could be quite attractive. But if we each try and put all of our kids in there, which is how we're used to doing business, I think it's going to be overly bloated. There's going to be a lot of channels that aren't that strong. It's going to be quite expensive, and it's not going to be that attractive. The marketplace is quite rational. So it'll -- I think in the end, the smaller bundles that are working around the world are those that have 20 or 30 channels, and those are kind of a best-of bouquet, and that's probably where it'll end up in the U.S. As I've said, with all the talk about this, the only place that the skinny bundle is going to present is over-the-top. Because in the next 3 to 4 years, almost every programmer's contractually committed to have all their channels carried. And so with the exception of maybe being able to go down from -- lose 5% of you distribution or 10% of your distribution, most deals provide that you need to have all your channels carried to at least 90% or 95% of the package. And so having said that, I would -- I like the skinny bundle. I was very interested in what Apple was doing. And I think, again, the fact that we have the #1 channel on cable, the #1 channel for women, the #1 channel for African-Americans and our channels are reasonable, with high-quality content, puts us in a position to be part of those bundles. And we'll have those discussions, and over time, I'm confident that we will. In terms of rationalizing costs for smaller networks, 2 things: We had quite a good quarter, but we also -- our content channels were hurt, I think, a little bit more than some others by the news networks. The news networks were up 38%. But every night, whether it was a Republican or a Democratic debate, a lot of that energy came out of some of our nonfiction channels. We feel pretty good about how we're going to do this quarter. There's some of our channels, we need to improve. One of those is Animal Planet. We just brought in a new GM. We're working hard on turning TLC. But Discovery, Science, ID, Velocity, OWN are all running very strong. And so we're looking at everything. But in the end, this cost cutting that we're doing right now isn't related to the channels. The channels are a journey to find -- to make sure our brands are right and we're reaching an audience. The cost cutting is really the other side of the house where we're having some effect of efficiency."

These cost savings will allow us to continue growing our business by focusing our investment in 4 key areas: more investment in content, more investment in our international growth markets, more investment in digital services and OTT products, and more investment in sports. 
Our expansion into sports is well underway with Eurosport. We have been on a journey to revitalize the brand with locally relevant sports rights and programming. And we are realizing the potential of this cash flow-positive business, and we're starting to see meaningful results, including double-digit growth all across Europe. And we're leveraging the power of sports programming by driving meaningful affiliate value across our whole portfolio, which you will see grow further in the years ahead. 
In addition, the Eurosport Player is generating value by offering a deeper, more immersive experience all across Europe. It's a separate offering with unique content from what we have on our Eurosport channels all across Europe. Tennis fanatics were able to watch up to 16 courts at the Australian Open. And at the beginning of the year, Squash TV launched as a dedicated channel on Eurosport Player with 500 hours of squash action a year. 
Our distinct digital offering allows us to have a direct economic relationship with viewers and gives us an opportunity to go deeper into the sports they love. It's a richer, different value proposition from our linear channels. In the first quarter, subscription growth increased double digits versus last year, proving Eurosport's content and brand power is a multiscreen opportunity for us. 
We continue to monetize our Olympics investment by signing sublicensing deals in the Netherlands and Finland, which followed our deal with the BBC in the U.K. These agreements significantly exceeded our plan. We have retained all rights to the Olympics on all platforms so that we could pursue incremental value and deals on mobile, on social media with players like Facebook Live and Twitter or going direct to consumer on our Eurosport app. The Olympics will not only be profitable, but based on the deals that we've done already, we expect the Olympics will make real money for us on each of the games. 
Moving on to our entire international portfolio. Our international average audience was up over 5%, driven by worldwide viewership strength from Discovery Channel, especially in Russia, Brazil and Mexico; and strong performances from our female networks in Latin America. And Germany also enjoyed strong double-digit growth, driven by TLC and DMAX. Across all of our international markets, we are getting good value for our portfolio of global brands and sports, and the momentum remains strong with recent renewals. As I mentioned last quarter, we pulled our channels in the Nordics to Telenor subscribers as we stood up for the value of our content. And we were able to win significant increases in our renewal and lock in long-term growth. We believe in the value of our content, and we will continue to stand up and fight for the value. 
Looking at our U.S. portfolio. We had another quarter of very strong results. We are extremely pleased with our current domestic trends, and ad growth remains solid as we head into the second quarter and the upfront. Discovery Channel had its second-highest-rated quarter ever in prime time with 8 of the top-10 unscripted shows on cable, including Gold Rush, Fast N' Loud and Alaskan Bush People, ranked 1, 2 and 3. ID was the #2 network for women and had its best quarter ever in prime time. Velocity had its highest-delivering quarter ever and Science its highest-rated quarter ever. And starting next month, we welcome back Patrice Andrews, who is most recently with ITV and A&E, as the new General Manager of Animal Planet. Patrice is a fantastic storyteller and a great creative leader. She'll be a big help to driving the value of Animal Planet. 
Beyond traditional pay-TV distribution, people want access to our brands and content across all screens. As we own most of our IP, we are driving our digital strategy and making progress in diversifying how and where we reach consumers, particularly younger viewers. Across all these efforts, we are building audiences, learning consumption habits and expanding monetization models. Part of our digital strategy is to add value to pay-TV subscribers through our own TV Everywhere products, such as Discovery GO in the U.S., Discovery K!ds Play in Latin America, and by extending the availability of our content through distributor TV Everywhere products. It's very early days for Discovery GO, but we are pleased with our initial results. The platform is clearly appealing to a younger audience as 50% of our visitors are in the 18 to 34 demo. And we are selling CPMs at a significant premium, highlighting the appeal of our long-form content in the digital space. 
Second, we continue engaging millennials and younger audiences with Discovery Digital Networks. Today, we average more than 300 million streams each month. And we are now focusing our web-native efforts onto 2 key brands that are resonating with advertisers and with users: Seeker and SourceFed. 
Over the last 2 years, we have drilled down and developed a best-in-class virtual-reality content. The Discovery virtual reality app has over 30 million views in the last few months, and we have developed over 100 pieces of virtual reality content, with a new offering every week. We're very excited about the possibilities to immerse audiences in new story formats and create meaningful opportunities for advertisers. As content gets closer to real, our content brands move to the top of the heap. 
Finally, we're focusing on delivering for super fans with select, direct-to-consumer offerings. In Europe, the Eurosport Player and Dplay exemplify our aim to grow audiences across platforms and continue to provide captivating exclusive content across more screens than ever before. And we recently took a minority stake in Rugby Pass, the definitive OTT product for rugby fans in 23 markets in Asia. Across all these efforts, we are learning viewing habits and amassing data on how best to reach consumers across all screens. 
As we begin another year, Discovery is well positioned to broaden our reach and relevance with our audiences. We end the quarter with a lot of optimism. Our U.S. business is a real meaningful growth business, even given small subscriber universe declines. And as a company, worldwide, 50% of our revenues come from long-cycle distribution agreements with strong contractual growth rates. In our international business, we've turned the corner on currency and are now starting to realize some tailwinds that could grow stronger in the months and years ahead. And we're investing in the growth areas for the future. We are confident in the long-term growth profile of the company and our ability to create sustainable shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Andy for details of our financial results."
22666093,327892507,974978,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before I review our first quarter results, I want to highlight a few very important and positive updates regarding our 2016 guidance. As David mentioned, we are now committing to total company",2025,"Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before I review our first quarter results, I want to highlight a few very important and positive updates regarding our 2016 guidance. As David mentioned, we are now committing to total company constant-currency margin expansion for the year. We want to ensure that we position Discovery for growth in both existing and new areas and continue to embrace change to drive innovation across the company. As the industry evolves, we will continue to evolve with it. We have consistently highlighted our flexible cost structures and the fact that we own or control most of our own content across all global platforms as 2 of our most critical competitive advantages. And these advantages are allowing us to maximize our profit growth while taking advantage of new opportunities as the new ecosystem evolves. 
As a company, we have, for several years now, taken a very hard look at our cost structures and continue to see and realize opportunities to become leaner while freeing up dollars to continue investing in new platforms like mobile and OTT. Spending on global content IP will always be our priority. We were focused on managing down growth in all other cost areas to ensure that our constant-currency revenues will grow faster than our constant-currency cost. Our 2016 SG&A cost productivity has been much better than planned. You may have seen yesterday that we filed an 8-K specifying additional personnel-related cost-reduction initiatives that will yield cost benefits in the second half of 2016 as well as full year 2017. We remain highly focused on paring back cost growth in non-content expense areas and reallocating traditional linear business costs to new media platforms and content development around the globe, such as mobile, short-form video, sports and direct-to-consumer initiatives. 
As a result of this commitment to margin expansion as well as our better-than-planned U.S. ad sales performance to date, we are also raising our 2016 adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance to being up at least high teens on a constant-currency basis. With our first quarter constant-currency margins up almost 100 basis points; adjusted OIBDA, ex FX, up 7%; and adjusted EPS, ex FX, up 18%, we're off to a very strong start to the year. In addition, with the U.S. dollar softening year-to-date, currency headwinds have begun to subside and are meaningfully better for 2016 than we quantified on our year-end call. More on this later. 
Now let's talk about our first quarter results in more detail. Reported revenues and adjusted OIBDA were both up 2%. Excluding currency impacts, revenues were up 5% and adjusted OIBDA was up 7%. On an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as prior-year contributions from SBS Radio, which we sold on June 30, 2015, total company revenues and adjusted OIBDA both grew 7%. Net income available to Discovery Communications of $263 million was up 5% from the first quarter a year ago, primarily driven by improved operating performance, a lower effective tax rate and a gain from the SBS Radio sale, partially offset by higher stock-based compensation and a decline on income from equity investees. We were able to lower our effective tax rate by another 400 basis points from the full year 2015 rate to 29% this quarter. 
Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter was $0.42, 14% above the first quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per diluted share, a more relevant metric from a comparability perspective as it excludes the impact from acquisition-related noncash amortization of intangible assets, was $0.46, a 10% improvement versus 1Q 2015. Excluding currency impacts, adjusted EPS was up 18% for the quarter and was up 11% for the last 12-month period over the prior 12-month period. First quarter free cash flow increased 62% as improved operating performance and lower cash taxes were partially offset by higher content spend. First quarter free cash flow growth, excluding currency effects, was strong and increased 53% for the last 12-month period compared to the prior 12 months. 
Turning to the operating units. Our U.S. Networks had a spectacular quarter with total revenues up 8%, led by 8% distribution growth and 7% advertising growth. And adjusted OIBDA was up a very impressive 11%. Our 7% advertising growth, which accelerated from 5% in the prior quarter, was due to higher pricing and proactively managing and monetizing the inventory to take advantage of the strong demand in the scatter market, offsetting lower delivery. The ad market currently remains quite healthy. And looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect advertising revenues to have another strong quarter with second quarter's year-over-year growth similar to that of our first quarter. 
Our Domestic Distribution revenues were up 8% while total portfolio subs again declined by about 1% versus the first quarter of last year. We continue to benefit from the higher rates we garnered from our recent deals, including our most recent deal with Comcast, which went into effect on January 1. 
Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses in the quarter were up 3%, cost of revenues were up 7%, while SG&A declined 4% due primarily to lower personnel expenses. Our focus on controlling base costs led to impressive domestic adjusted OIBDA growth of 11% with margins expanding by almost 200 basis points to 59%. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, U.S. cost growth in the second quarter is expected to rise at a slightly faster rate than first quarter as we increase marketing spend, partially due to an earlier Shark Week, which starts on June 26, and then expense growth will abate again in the second half of this year. 
Turning now to international operations. Excluding currency, revenues increased 3% and adjusted OIBDA decreased 2% as changes in currency mix reduced revenue growth by 6% and adjusted OIBDA growth by 12%. For comparability purposes, my following international comments will refer to our organic results only, so we'll exclude the impacts of foreign exchange and the previously mentioned SBS Radio sale. 
International organic revenues increased 7% and adjusted OIBDA declined 2% for the first quarter of 2016. The 7% first quarter revenue growth was comprised of 12% distribution growth and 4% advertising growth. Our 12% affiliate revenue growth was due to higher affiliate rates in Eastern and Northern Europe where we have been successful in leveraging our expanded content portfolio, that now includes sports, to drive higher contracted pricing increases; increased subscribers in Latin America; as well as contributions from Eurosport France, which was not consolidated into the second quarter of last year. Excluding Eurosport France, affiliate revenues were up high single digits. Going forward, we still expect organic distribution growth to remain in the high single-digit range for the rest of 2016. 
Turning to our first quarter international advertising results. While we benefited from higher pricing and delivery in Southern Europe and higher volumes in Central Europe, growth in these markets was partially offset by declines in Northern Europe, our largest advertising region. Northern Europe was impacted by the February Telenor blackout in the Nordics that we highlighted on our year-end call; and overall softness in the U.K. and Nordic markets due to macro factors; and lower ratings across the region, especially at our female-skewing networks. While the Telenor blackout did have a negative impact beyond the 10 days we were dark, as advertisers shifted their money elsewhere due to the uncertainty around our contract renewal, our standing up for the value of our content paid off, as the long-term economic upside from the new deal is significantly greater than the temporary advertising losses incurred while going dark. Excluding the impact from the Telenor blackout, first quarter international advertising revenue increased 7%. We're delivering on our promise that the investments we're making in content and brands will drive sustained global affiliate growth, and this very positive Telenor deal outcome supports this thesis. 
Another factor that impacted our first quarter ad results and will continue to affect results for the rest of the year is a shift in the Middle East, where we are pivoting from a free-to-air model to a pay-TV model. As part of our exclusive content deal with 2 key affiliate partners, we have locked in long-term affiliate fees, which enhances OIBDA but shifts ad revenue to affiliate revenue. 
Our international ad sales is currently trending at high single to low double digits, but we do expect the ad growth to accelerate to low double digits in the second half of the year. Second half growth will be led by increases in the U.K. as we expect pricing and ad market pressures to ease post the Euro championships and the June 23 Brexit vote as well as continued strong growth in Latin America, Eastern Europe and Southern Europe. 
Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses internationally grew 11% in the first quarter, primarily due to higher content amortization as well as costs associated with Eurosport France; and adjusted OIBDA declined 2%. Looking ahead, it is very important to note that cost growth and, therefore, adjusted OIBDA growth will be lumpy on a quarterly basis, mostly driven by the timing of sporting events. We currently expect second quarter organic expense growth to be similar to that of the first quarter. Cost growth will then significantly moderate in the back half of the year to being up mid-single digits as we're able to more fully leverage our pre-existing sports rights and local market people and infrastructure. 
Lastly, regarding our financial expectations for the Olympics. As a result of the very positive and better-than-planned licensing deals that Dave highlighted in the U.K., Netherlands and Finland, we now expect meaningfully positive cumulative Olympic-related cash flows through the 2024 games. We forecast that aggregate revenues from this deal will significantly exceed total costs. 
Now taking a look at our share repurchases. In the first quarter, we repurchased a total of $373 million in shares. We have now spent over $7 billion buying back shares since we began our buyback program at the end of 2010, and we reduced our outstanding share count by 36% as we continue to find the return on repurchasing our own shares very attractive. 
Getting back to our full year guidance. As stated, we are raising our constant-currency adjusted EPS and constant-currency free cash flow growth to being up at least high teens. Our guidance includes potential upcoming personnel-related and other restructuring charges of approximately $40 million to $60 million, as outlined in our 8-K, and also assumes full year stock-based compensation of approximately $55 million and no further P&L impact from the Lionsgate investment we made last year. We also now expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate to now be approximately 29% versus our prior expectation of 30% as we continue to realize significant benefits from our multiyear global tax strategies. 
I also now update the expected year-over-year foreign exchange impact on our full year reported results. As a result of the dollar weakening year-to-date versus most of the global currencies, the expected year-over-year FX impact has significantly improved since we last guided on February 18. Assuming current spot rates stay constant for the rest of the year, FX is now expected to reduce our constant-currency revenue by $100 million to $110 million and adjusted OIBDA by $70 million to $80 million. We now also expect a positive FX impact to adjusted EPS of $0.01 to $0.05 due to the net effect of this year's adjusted OIBDA impact and last year's over $100 million of below-the-line FX impact. 
In closing, I'm extremely pleased with Discovery's start to 2016. We are fully committed to constant-currency margin expansion and our higher full year 2016 guidance metrics. As I noted earlier, we will continue to assess operating trends and proactively manage Discovery's overall expense base to best position the company for growth as the media industry evolves. I remain very optimistic about our global portfolio as well as our overall financial and operating momentum. 
Thanks again for your time this morning. And now Dave and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have."

And as we look at the overall infrastructure, we just felt that there was a lot of opportunity to attack all of our other costs.

So the advertising market remains robust. We'll talk about it a little bit later. We don't have that much information on the upfront, but the pricing in scatter is very strong, and cancellations on options are down significantly from the last few years. So the environment feels quite good going into the upfront, I think, for us and the whole marketplace. On the point of over-the-top, I think one of the things that makes us very well positioned is we have our 14 channels, which represents about 12% of viewership on cable. And even though we're looking at high single to double-digit affiliate growth domestically, we still only get about 5.5% of the economics, so 12% of viewership, 5.5% of the economics. And you have ID as the #1 or 2 channel for women, the most valued channel on cable in Discovery; Oprah the #1 channel for African-American women with OWN; and TLC, one of the top 2 or 3 networks in Middle America. And so we're very, very good value for -- with our channels, including Animal Planet being one of the top 3 or 4 channels that people value in terms of brand, but also in terms of economics. If you took just our top 6 channels, that would represent about 83% of our affiliate. If you only took 4, it would be 70%. We are talking to everyone. And one of the things, I think, there's kind of 2 baskets: If it's a non-sports package, then I think we will be an extraordinarily powerful piece of that as we bring so many demos and so much strength to a package like that. But for all packages, we're very economically attractive. And with Discovery, ID, Animal Planet and Oprah, it's very difficult, I think, to have a compelling package without us. We're talking to everyone. The reason that we're not on Sling right now is that our deal, Charlie [ph], those deals tend to get done on Sling as the deals come up, and our deal with Charlie [ph] is not up. But we look at over-the-top as a real opportunity. And we can even see it in our TV Everywhere product, how much our content is being consumed by consumers, which is quite attractive."

And it's very hard to predict, so I'm not going to predict where it's going to be in the quarters ahead. We thought, in the second and third quarter of last year, that it was going to really be a challenge. Some of the things that are happening is, one, the measurability is getting better. A number of companies that moved more quickly to digital found that their market share -- they had market share challenges. And so I think you have 2 baskets: How effective is television advertising? It's still probably the most effective of all advertising. And two, knowing that you're getting the actual value and it could be proven. And in fact, when you get paid only on L3, for us, we leave about 14% of viewership on the table, and there are a lot of people in the industry that do more than that. So the fact that you're getting -- that the advertiser is getting the full value and they only pay on what you watch for the first 3 days, there's actually an over-delivery. So at least for now, I think the view is that it's quite an effective way to reach a broad audience and to reach across demos. And it's not a -- you don't get embarrassed by finding out 9 months later that there was an issue with it when you don't have to worry that it's not going to deliver in terms of your -- the ability to move product. It does feel good right now. The whole U.S. market feels good. I think this whole narrative of -- when -- toward the end of last year, this idea that universe numbers were declining precipitously as a result of distributors losing subscribers, their overall viewership on cable was declining, that advertising was going to decline in an accelerating rate, all of those have moved, I think, in our favor. So at least for the near term, we see the U.S. now as a meaningful growth market. And for the near term -- I mean, for the next several years, with having high single-digit affiliate growth locked in, with 80% of our deals done, even if the universe declines, which we don't -- which it looks now like it's stabilized, and even if the advertising market declines, we'll still have a U.S. growth market. And if the advertising market stays like it is now, we'll have a very significant U.S. growth market. So it feels good like -- for now, and let's hope it continues."

We're embedded with creative talent, commercial talent in serving 220 countries and all the cost has been embedded. When we did do Eurosport, and as we've tucked in channels, we've been able to get meaningful synergy because we have 10 to 12 channels in every country. We're always opportunistic, but I think we're very happy with our existing mix. The way we see it now is we have this great sports IP in Europe and Discovery is on brand and growing with real pull-through. And in our most recent deals, the negative is, we've had to pull our signal 3 times. We did it with Telenor, the largest distributor in the Nordics. We did it Telia in Sweden, and we did it with Boxer in Sweden. And so we took near-term hits by doing that. But in all 3 cases, we were back up, and we got very significant increases. And the deals are long term, which give us -- which move us from the potential to go from mid-single. We're now at high single, and we're looking to get to double digit. And so we think with -- we've improved our IP portfolio. The same is true for us in Latin America, where Kids has gotten a lot stronger, and we have a number of female networks that are stronger. So I think we're in a very good position now. We like our -- we've improved our IP. As our deals come up, I think you'll see our affiliate line growing internationally because our content has improved. We're taking some of that content direct to consumer, and we're having some success. And so we would have to see something that would help us grow faster. Because, I think, we had a -- we sort of took a step back with SBS, and we took a step back with Eurosport. We've acquired the sports IP we think we need, and I think we're making the turn. We now -- we're very happy with the Olympics. And margins should start to grow now in Eurosport. I think we like the position we're in. We've worked hard over the last 3 years to get in this position, to get all the infrastructure in place. And so we got the synergy if there's a good asset out there, but it's going to have to help us grow faster."

Look, I think the thing that's going to drive our distribution revenue the hardest is the fact that our share has been growing over the last several years. And as these deals come up, we have more share and we have -- as well as sports rights or Kids. And we've been standing up for our value in a way that we haven't in the past. And part of that has to do with -- through this recession and challenge over the last 8 years, most content players have reduced their content investment. So we go into these deals where we've increased our investment, we've increased our share, and we've been able to get more significant dollars. The second piece that is important is that there's been a change in the marketplace over the last year, and that's distributors are now looking to decommoditize their platforms. They don't want to just be pipes to the home or pipes to a device. So they're looking to get exclusive content. So what you saw us do in the Middle East, where some of our advertising revenue went away, it's because we did exclusive deals with OSN and with BeIN for each -- we did our regular package, and then we gave each of them some exclusive content, and we were able to get significant economics. In addition, we did a similar thing with Canal Plus, and we're in a number of discussions with distributors. This is something that could either -- right now, you see our affiliate line internationally growing. We want to push that to double digit. If the opportunity for exclusive content continues, you're going to see that line begin to move up higher in a way that's a lot easier to be moving the advertising line. Our goal on advertising is to get it back up to double digit, which we think we can do. But the distribution line, we're quite optimistic about. On TV Everywhere, the point that we made in -- a couple of months ago is that TV Everywhere is just much more effective in Europe because TV Everywhere really means TV Everywhere. Everything is on the platform. It's helpful because I think it's an impediment to the SVOD platforms coming into those markets. So you have 2 things helping the kind of -- a pushback on Netflix and some of the other SVOD platforms. One is, that a number of us are going direct to consumer ourselves, like us, with the Eurosport app or Dplay. Two is, that players like FOX and Liberty Global are going direct to consumer with their TV Everywhere platforms, and they have everything. So unlike here in the U.S., which is finally getting it together and we're seeing the great benefit of that, and Brian is leading in that with X1, in Europe, it really is TV Everywhere. And that is a big benefit to us, and it will help us on advertising. And Sky is having a real positive with NOW TV. And you got to take your hat off to James and to Jeremy Darroch because they've really -- they've invested and we're on Now TV. And so being part of a cable operator's platform, for us, is a much more favorable environment."

I love the fact that Les is talking about being double digit. On a practical level, across all of our domestic portfolio, we tend to be maybe 1 point behind. So if broadcast gets 9, maybe we get 8. If broadcast gets 11, maybe we get 10. If they get 6, we get 5. That's the way it's been historically. Having said that, our channels are very firmly on brand. And we've been able to get some significant benefit. So some of our channels, like ID and Velocity, have been up 50% or 60% higher in CPM over the last year. Discovery CPM is up higher. So I think there's a real benefit as you look at OWN, ID, Discovery, Velocity, even Science. So we've worked hard to get back to brand and to really be nourishing a very specific demographic audience. And so we've been rewarded on those channels, I think, a little bit more. ID still has a lot of headroom for us. It's length of view is the highest of any channel on cable. And it's -- you have an ability to reach women all day where we're #1 on cable, late night, we're #1. And so we think there's still some significant upside on that. But when you average all of our channels together, we'll tend to do about -- a little bit, probably a little bit behind what some of the -- maybe the best broadcast network does. And if we can get a little bit lucky with ID and pushing it, maybe we can -- even though we don't have the same amount of reach in terms of being able to roll out a product, we could maybe reach it. But we'll do well, I think."

Look, there's a couple of important points here. One, we are extremely committed to investment grade. It gives us access to long-term capital, gives us access to multicurrency commercial paper. So it absolutely is the right kind of capital assessment for us, an investment grade. Also, if you look at our access to capital today, we issued a long-term bond earlier in the year, many times oversubscribed. Rates are actually more in the BBB rating. So even though we intentionally took our rating down to BBB-, the markets still view us as being more BBB, especially with our mid-teen free cash flow to debt yield. And look, the other point I'd make, Doug, which I think is so important, if you think about our capital expansion, given our high single OIBDA growth and given what is an improving currency environment, we're seeing a lot of available capital based on just our profit growth and our ability to leverage that profit growth. So there's no shortage of capital that we have to be proactive and to play offense with either buying stock or allocating capital to the acquisitions."

And because there's a very competitive environment",610,"Sure. Look, the U.S. market is really quite different from the international market because the U.S. is really just one culture, and it's one satellite. And so it's football, baseball, basketball, hockey. And because there's a very competitive environment by some of the biggest media companies to get into that space, because that's where most of the affiliate revenue has gone over the years, to those that have those sports rights, those rights have accelerated, as you've seen. And the fight for those 4 sports, more and more, has generated huge increases. In Europe, you see that for soccer, in-market. So you've seen that kind of huge increases on renewals. What we've been able to do with Eurosport is we've done over 70 deals on Eurosport, and all of our deals are in the low single to mid-single-digit increase. Even on the Olympics itself, we were able to get the Olympics for mid-single-digit increase on what it had gone for 4 years earlier. And so we've been quite disciplined to get -- about getting our sports rights. And Eurosport now remains profitable. We've made the turn. We don't think we need to own a lot more IP. We'll do it opportunistically. So -- and again, when we pick up speed skating, we're picking up a sport that might be the #1 sport in 4 markets all across Northern Europe. When we pick up handball, we're picking up a sport that's the #1 sport in Poland. So a lot of this -- picking up tennis and cycling, so for us, we're sort of the home for everything but soccer. And we've also picked up a lot of IP for very little. And remember, there is no bidder for sports in Europe that can provide the platform that we provide. Eurosport has 3 channels in every market, but we have 150 million homes on just one of our channels. So ESPN is a little less than 100, and we have 150 million. So when a federation wants to sell a sport -- soccer is sold locally, but most other sports are sold either across Europe, or you have to do 55 deals. And so I think that's the unique advantage that we have as a very complex market, both in terms of taste, culture and language that we're set up to deal with. And the fact that we have the only Pan-European sports channels gives us a unique advantage. And I think, over time, our ability to continue to get these rights should be pretty stable. There's not a lot of people that are bidding for the kind of sports that we're building our business on. Finally, on the international advertising. Telenor hurt us this quarter. It hurt us significantly. It is the biggest distributor in the Nordics, which is one of our biggest markets. We were off for 11 days, and so not only did we lose on those 11 days, but some money moved. It's all back now, but it had an impact. But it really resonated in the market. We were able to get very significant economics, and driving that long-cycle top line for us is critical. If you put Telenor back into your economics, we would've been -- our international business would've been positive in the mid-single digits versus negative. But we're fighting for the long term. So this quarter, we expect -- the first 2 quarters, we expect to see in the high single range. And in the second half of the year, we expect acceleration into the double-digit range. And whether on average that ends up being high single or low double, we'll have to see."

I feel like we all went through this period of handwringing last year about whether Apple is going to launch something like this. And I think you and I spoke about it, and my thought was that profitability was the real reason that Eddy Cue and Apple decided not to move forward, the fact that the RSNs [ph] were just going to be too costly as part of this sort of virtual MVPD bundle and so forth. So I'd just -- what do you guys think about the fact that the new Hulu venture is likely to be unprofitable out of the gate?

But in general, we, as an industry, have to make some compromises. And if we do, I think we'll be healthier. So if in the end, we're going to do an over-the-top bundle that's 30 channels for $30, then each of the media companies can't have every one of their channels, every one of their sports channels, every one of their regional sports channels carried. And for those that have the leverage to include all of them, then there's probably going to -- it's not going to be the best of what we have to offer. And so for instance, we have 14 channels taking -- having 6 or 8 of our channels carried in a package, to me, seems quite effective. We would get 85%, 86%. If it's only 6, we get 83% of our dollars. We've done this in a lot of markets where -- a lot happened in Brazil. The major programmers all decided, ""Look, we'll get a little bit less money, but we'll be on this beginning tier. It'll serve a different audience."" In the case of Brazil, it was the C-class. In the case of the U.S, it would be more of a millennial audience. And so if we all came together and if you saw kind of the best of cable, where we would have 6 of those slots, than I think it could be quite attractive. But if we each try and put all of our kids in there, which is how we're used to doing business, I think it's going to be overly bloated. There's going to be a lot of channels that aren't that strong. It's going to be quite expensive, and it's not going to be that attractive. The marketplace is quite rational. So it'll -- I think in the end, the smaller bundles that are working around the world are those that have 20 or 30 channels, and those are kind of a best-of bouquet, and that's probably where it'll end up in the U.S. As I've said, with all the talk about this, the only place that the skinny bundle is going to present is over-the-top. Because in the next 3 to 4 years, almost every programmer's contractually committed to have all their channels carried. And so with the exception of maybe being able to go down from -- lose 5% of you distribution or 10% of your distribution, most deals provide that you need to have all your channels carried to at least 90% or 95% of the package. And so having said that, I would -- I like the skinny bundle. I was very interested in what Apple was doing. And I think, again, the fact that we have the #1 channel on cable, the #1 channel for women, the #1 channel for African-Americans and our channels are reasonable, with high-quality content, puts us in a position to be part of those bundles. And we'll have those discussions, and over time, I'm confident that we will. In terms of rationalizing costs for smaller networks, 2 things: We had quite a good quarter, but we also -- our content channels were hurt, I think, a little bit more than some others by the news networks. The news networks were up 38%. But every night, whether it was a Republican or a Democratic debate, a lot of that energy came out of some of our nonfiction channels. We feel pretty good about how we're going to do this quarter. There's some of our channels, we need to improve. One of those is Animal Planet. We just brought in a new GM. We're working hard on turning TLC. But Discovery, Science, ID, Velocity, OWN are all running very strong. And so we're looking at everything. But in the end, this cost cutting that we're doing right now isn't related to the channels. The channels are a journey to find -- to make sure our brands are right and we're reaching an audience. The cost cutting is really the other side of the house where we're having some effect of efficiency."

Discovery Communications had another quarter of strong operating and financial results as we remain focused on maximizing our global linear TV business, strengthening our position on digital and direct-to-co",1672,"Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Discovery Communications had another quarter of strong operating and financial results as we remain focused on maximizing our global linear TV business, strengthening our position on digital and direct-to-consumer platforms and controlling our cost base. 
A key element of Discovery's growth profile is our continued success in securing long cycle distribution agreements that provide for steady and predictable revenue growth and the optionality for windowing our content on existing and new platforms. 
Today, I am pleased to announce we have reached a new long-term comprehensive affiliate deal with Liberty Global, one of our biggest international distribution partners. The new multiyear deal will deliver our full portfolio of networks to Liberty Global subscribers in 12 European countries and includes new linear distribution for some of our key brands. It also includes brought digital distribution on Liberty Global's Horizon platform that will guarantee our passionate super fans that will have access to our content on the screen of their choice. 
The Liberty Global deal is a continuation of several recent renewals in Europe where we are fighting for the value of our investments in nonfiction, sports and the Olympic Games. These agreements validate our diversification approach and underscore the potential to drive long-term growth through these long-term affiliate deals. 
Our international distribution growth is returning to a double-digit increase for the full year of 2016, and it's poised to stay there for many years to come. This ensures cash flows and provide an investment pool to bolster our content to drive the next generation of growth. 
There is no question that the audition of sports to our nonfiction portfolio in Europe is bolstering our profile with distributors and reinforcing the must have nature of our overall suite of brands. Our U.S. and international affiliate revenues comprise about 50% of our total company revenues. And growth of these revenue streams is now locked in for the next couple of years. 
Given the double-digit revenue growth internationally with our new Liberty deal and with recent agreements with Telenor and Talia across the Nordics and the favorable price increases and step ups we've garnered in all of our recent domestic renewals, together, they will register strong growth even assuming universe declines in some markets. 
The is solid guaranteed revenue growth for half of our company. It's like a favorable bond. Against our solid distribution revenue base, we have more variable ad rates and we also have longer term upside potential as we convert the Intellectual Property, our content that we control to new and emerging platforms. Along with the additional contributions to our international affiliate growth, investments in premium and exclusive sports rights also are opening up new opportunities to build our direct-to-consumer platform and businesses. 
A key example is our recent acquisition of Bundesliga rights in Germany. As you know, we look at every deal that comes available but we are always financially disciplined in our approach. A number of things aligned that made the Bundesliga different and very attractive. 
First, there was a new law in Germany called the no single buyer rule that gave us an opportunity to acquire the rights on favorable terms so that the investment will be cash flow positive for us. 
Second, we acquired a package of 45 games, mostly on Friday nights. It's a unique offering of must-have content for German sports fans, similar to Monday Night Football in the U.S. and it makes our Eurosport pay-TV channel and the Eurosport Player the home of Friday night Bundesliga matches. The deal is also for all platforms allowing digital growth as it will help drive the Eurosport Player subscriptions while also providing a huge marketing platform for our whle portfolio. 
Finally, Germany is the fourth largest economy in the world and the German pay-TV market has never been healthier, with multiple telcos, satellite players and other distributors, all buying for the best and strongest IP. 
These are important potent sports rights that we now own across all platforms. As Andy will discuss in more detail, we will do well with this deal from a financial perspective and it will also bring numerous strategic benefits for the business. 
Another example of our opportunistic and disciplined sports acquisition strategy for exclusive content is the multi market deal for Wimbledon that we are announcing today. This agreement solidifies Eurosport as the home of all 4 grand slam tennis tournaments in 25 countries next year. One year ago, we had just 1 market with all 4 tournaments. Like the Bundesliga deal, these rights bolster our pay-TV offering, fuel our over-the-top sports product and gives us exclusive premium content to attract more advertisers and viewers to our platforms. 
And with Rio a couple of days away, our Olympics team is in place, geared up and have started logistical planning for our first Olympic Games across Europe in 2018. 
With our focus on securing these exclusive rights, we feel that we have that real building blocks and value proposition to begin accelerating our direct-to-consumer sports strategy. And the market potential is huge. As Andy will outline in more detail, given only about half of the homes in Europe have the main Eurosport pay-TV channel, a little less than 150 million homes, there's significant opportunity for our sports IP to reach people on all devices throughout all of Europe, which has a population of over 700 million people. Our investments in premium IP in Europe and around the world are a key part of our strategy, and we're really seeing the benefits take hold. 
In the U.S., our expansion into crime and mystery with ID has been a home run. The Velocity and Oprah Winfrey's own network delivered top performances this quarter and this past year, further validating our differentiated and diverse portfolio. Specifically with its focus on scripted with Tyler Perry and Greenleaf, the new series featuring Oprah and produced by Oprah, OWN's success is only accelerating. Oprah's Greanleaf success, coupled with Tyler is usually successful scripted series already on OWN made OWN the #1 channel for African-American women and the top 10 cable network in America for all women, which is really incredible considering OWN didn't exist 5 years ago. 
This impressive growth trajectory is being recognized in the marketplace during this year's years upfront where we did very, very well. And we have a new scripted series, which is produced by Oprah Winfrey, called Queen Sugar and that will be premiering in a few weeks and it also looks absolutely terrific. 
Our premium content strategy also is driving our digital business as we are leaning more into short form, streaming and virtual reality platforms that appeal to millennial digital natives. For example, Discovery virtual reality, VR, which will launched just a year ago, now has over 1.4 million downloads and over 60 million streams, and we recently launched our first VR scripted 4-part mini-series, The Satchel, in conjunction with Toyota. This innovative storytelling product brings our viewers closer to real, which has long been our aspiration, and we are first-mover market leader with our virtual reality content gaining scale quickly and tapping into a potential next-generation growth business for Discovery that younger generations are deeply engaged in. 
We also are engaging younger viewers and adding value to pay-TV customers through our authenticated TV Everywhere product, Discovery GO. An exciting millennials with our online brands, Seeker and SourceFed, which totaled over 1 billion worldwide streams during the quarter. In Latin America, our TV Everywhere product, Discovery K!ds Play, is off to a strong start with great engagement in 11 countries across 9 carriers. 
Another example of over platform agnostic approach can be seen in Italy, where we completed a deal with Vodafone to provide our entire free-to-air portfolio to its subscribers across all platforms. Beyond our platforms, we are engaged with many players regarding other new and emerging products as we remain platform agnostic in how and where we reach our viewers, like our deals with Verizon Go90, Sony PlayStation's Vue and Hulu, these opportunities represent potential ways to reach new viewers and new revenue streams to drive growth. 
Viewers worldwide have made it clear they value our content. On a recent beta research study in the U.S. that asks which network people would want in an à la carte world, Discovery Channel rank #1 among all noncable viewers, and many of our other channels we're the top 5 of their target demos. Discovery Channel is the #1 pay-TV brand in most of the markets around the world where we're in business. 
As we think about our U.S. business, I'd like to highlight some of our unique competitive advantages that will help ensure we continue to have a stable, profitable domestic business going forward. Unlike many other content providers, we have very flexible cost structures and are not locked into long-term syndication type deals. Thus we have levers we can pull when and if needed. We also own almost all of our content and control it across all platforms. That makes us more platform agnostic and gives us a lot of optionality as the world evolves. 
Additionally, given the demand for our brands and the value they represent, we believe we are extremely well positioned if the U.S. shifts toward more skinny bundles in the many years ahead. 
And with 85% of our economics coming from our top 6 networks, we could even benefit from smaller bundles, especially if they attract new audiences, which has been our experience in markets around the world where we have been on skinnier bundles. 
Our mission has transformed over time. From linear-only nonfiction programming to a multiplatform offering of nonfiction, sports and kids content today. The common thread has always been and continues to be real-world entertainment that engages passionate communities around the globe. 
I am a very optimistic about the future and our continued ability to deliver strong financial results and enhance shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Andy for details on our financial results."
22666093,337690396,1021106,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As david mentioned, we were very pleased with the continued financial and strategic progress we made in the second quarter. Our strong sustained domestic and international long cycle affiliate",2614,"Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As david mentioned, we were very pleased with the continued financial and strategic progress we made in the second quarter. Our strong sustained domestic and international long cycle affiliate revenue growth combined with mid-single-digit global ad growth drove 8% total company organic revenue growth. This solid top line performance combined with our continued focus on controlling our operational costs led to a 10% global organic adjusted OIBDA growth more than triple last year's second quarter growth rate. 
As we've consistently noted, 2 of our critical competitive advantages are our flexible cost structures and the fact that we own or control the vast majority of our content across all platforms. This give us tremendous operational flexibility and optionality and allow us to fully maximize our profit growth. While our international advertising growth has recently been slowed by unusual market factors, such as Brexit, we booked very strong U.S. upfront ad volume, our affiliate growth remains stable domestically and it's accelerating internationally and we remain hyper focused on controlling global cost growth. 
With our first half of the year, constant currency adjusted EPS of 25%, we are pacing well ahead of our earlier guidance of high teens growth. Therefore, we're increasing our full year guidance for constant currency adjusted EPS growth from high teens to at least 20-plus percent. Similarly, our first half constant currency free cash flow growth of 42% is also pacing well ahead of our high teens growth guidance range, which clearly validates our operational attraction and excellence. 
Before providing more details around the second quarter results, I want to answer directly several of the major questions analysts and investors have been asking us lately. First, with today's announcement, our new distribution deal with Liberty Global, we are now able to provide more information on the Bundesliga soccer right license in Germany that we announced mid-quarter. We are very mindful of your concerns about these additional costs and the potential impact on Eurosport's profitability. 
As David mentioned, given the new no-single-buyer rule, we're able to pickup a primetime package of 45 exclusive games per year over the next 4 years at attractive rates. Also, consistent with our imperative that we position Discovery's international business for the future, the deal includes a live streaming rights for games that we will now be able to market directly to all German consumers, including the 80% who do not subscribe to premium pay-TV. But these rights starting in August of 2017 will recognize half of that annual cost next year and given the favorable rights pricing terms, we can't commit to the Bundesliga being cash flow positive. It's very important for investors to know that each and every sports rights deal rigorously to ensure that we can both generate a positive return in these investments and meaningfully enhance our strategic content position in key markets. 
Eurosport does not and will never have negative margins. No sports rights deal that we pursue will lead the Eurosport losing money and Bundesliga is absolutely no exception to this commitment. 
Now I'll take a moment to talk to the future of our digital business in Europe, especially regarding Eurosport. Like you, we don't know exactly how the digital future and, in particular, mobile will progress. But we do know for sure that it's essential that we play and lead on this platform. Here are few statistics and market perspectives that we use to inform our strategic and investment decision-making processes. 
First, data from the organization for economic cooperation and development, or OECD, indicates that there are around 330 million mobile phone data subscribers in Europe. Also, [ph] research indicates smartphone penetration in major European countries to be between 50% and 70%. This, of course, means that these people all have smartphone video capability today. We also know that mobile operators are looking for sports content partners to help bundle their respective services. Second, our owner analysis indicate that today, there are over 30 million OTT households in the top European markets and clearly that number will continue to increase dramatically with higher broadband rates and more SVOD services, especially around sports. 
Third, we know that there are -- have already been over 17 million downloads to-date of our free Eurosport news app. These users are our starting point or funnel for marketing access to all of the digital sports content we've been smartly collecting. 
With these market dynamics, we could begin to build some strategic planning numbers around these facts to give us a sense of the potential scale and long-term value creation, to tell us whether this is a line of business worth pursuing. You'll do your own models but here's one of the ways we've been thinking about quantifying the opportunity. 1% of the OECD's 330 million mobile data subscribers at $8 per month will deliver approximately $330 million in additional annual revenues, and a 5% penetration will deliver $1.6 billion. Recognizing that we've already paid for most of this digital content rights and we will need to continue to invest in the latest platform technologies, a 40% margin would provide between $100 million and $700 million of additional adjusted OIBDA at these [ph] 1% to 5% take rates. 
This is not assuming additional advertising and sponsorship revenues from our Eurosport digital apps as we will certainly sell across platforms. We were also aware that the enterprise value multiples on these digital earnings are hired to know some traditional linear programming. 
To be clear, this is not guidance but an example of one of the ways we are exploring the digital future in Europe as we make our strategic investment in content decisions. And one of the reasons that we need to assure that we have the content fully available for digital platforms as we execute our linear sports deals. 
Not surprisingly, another big question we've been getting is the impact of Brexit. For context, our U.K. business represents about 5% of total company revenues and a slightly higher percentage of total company advertising revenues. We are working through all of the potential implications of Brexit on our business. But from an FX perspective, we expect minimal near-term impact on our cash flows. For 2016, our adjusted OIBDA is fully hedged against the weaker pound Sterling and 80% hedged against movements in the euro. 
For 2017, we have greatly hedged about half of our euro-denominated cash flow exposures as we are rolling 12 to 18 months foreign exchange hedge is already in place. From a business perspective, we have not yet seen the recovery in the U.K. ad market that we expected had the Brexit vote gone the other way but it is still early days. We are continuing to monitor policy developments but do fully expect that U.K. to remain our key market for us. 
Finally, an important question being asked is how the Olympics and Brexit will impact our Q3 results. While we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance for the year, we need to caution that Q3 will be challenged. The Olympics, as they always do, suck advertising dollars out of the market and Brexit will negatively impact our U.K.-derived ad sales. 
Now let's talk about the second quarter results in more detail. As I stated, on an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as prior year contributions from the SBS Radio, which resulted in June 30, 2015, total company revenues were up 8% and adjusted OIBDA grew 10%. Net income available to Discovery Communications are $408 million, it was up 43% from the second quarter a year ago primarily due to improved operating results, currency-related transactional gains, a decrease in taxes and lower stock compensation, partially offset by decline in income from equity investees and higher restructuring charges. 
Our book tax income rate in the quarter was 19% due to a onetime settlement benefit and therefore, we now expect our full year tax rate to be 28%, fully 500 basis points lower than our 2015 tax rate. 
Earnings per diluted share for the second quarter was $0.66, 50% above the second quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per diluted share which excludes the impact from acquisition-related noncash amortization of intangible assets, was $0.71, a 45% improvement versus last year's second quarter. Excluding currency impacts, adjusted EPS is up 31% for the quarter and up 20% to the last 12 months over the prior 12 months. Second quarter free cash flow decreased 4% to $301 million as improved operating performance and lower cash taxes were more than offset by the timing of working capital and higher capital expenditures. 
Second quarter free cash flow ex-FX increased 30% for the last 12-month period compared to the prior 12 months. 
Turning now to the operating units. Our U.S. Networks had another very solid quarter, with total revenues up 7% led by 8% distribution growth and 5% advertising growth and another quarter of double-digit adjusted OIBDA, up an impressive 10%. 
Our 5% advertising growth was again due to higher pricing and proactively managing and monetizing our inventory to take advantage of the strong demand in the scatter market. This was partially offset by weaker delivery and in particular, a weaker-than-expected Shark week due to its earlier positioning ahead of the fourth of July. 
As we look ahead to the third quarter, we expect advertising revenues to be down low single digits versus last year's first quarter due to Olympics and the tougher comp before rebounding back to positive growth in the fourth quarter. 
Our Domestic Distribution revenues again increased 8%. While total portfolio subs declined 2% for the second quarter last year, we continue to benefit from the higher locked-in rate increases earned and all of our recent affiliate deals. 
Domestic operating expenses in the quarter were up 3%. Our focus on controlling base costs led to an impressive domestic adjusted OIBDA growth of 10%, with margins expanding by 100 basis points to 62%. 
As we look ahead the rest of the year, we now expect expense growth to increase slightly in Q3 due to increased marketing spend and then abate in the fourth quarter. 
Turning now to our international operations, for comparability purposes, my following international comments will refer to our organic results only, so excluding the impact of FX and the SBS Radio sale. International organic revenues and adjusted OIBDA both increased 8%. The 8% second quarter revenue growth was comprised of 10% distribution and 5% advertising growth. Our 10% affiliate revenue growth was due to higher affiliate rates in CEEMEA and Northern Europe, where we have been highly successful in leveraging our expanded content portfolio that now includes sports to drive higher contracted pricing step ups as well as increased subscribers in Latin America. 
Going forward, we expect our international affiliate growth rates to accelerate, so we're raising our growth expectations to the high single-digit, low double-digit range for the back half of 2016. 
Turning to our second quarter international advertising results. While we benefited from higher volume and ratings in Southern Europe and higher pricing and volumes in CEEMEA, growth in these markets was partially offset by declines in Northern Europe, our largest advertising region. 
Northern Europe was impacted by the UK's lower ratings and softer demand due to uncertainty ahead of the Brexit vote. Given softer ratings and the fact of this uncertainty has not lifted post the decision to exit the EU and visibility remains limited. We expect an ad sales deceleration in the third quarter, which will also be impacted by the Olympics. 
We now expect total second half 2016 organic international advertising growth to be in the mid- to high single-digit range. 
International operating expenses grew 9% in the second quarter, primarily due to higher sports content and production costs. Looking ahead, we expect organic expense growth to moderate in the back half of the year as we're able to fully leverage our pre-existing sports rights and local market people and infrastructure. 
Now taking a look at our share repurchases. In the second quarter, we repurchased a total of $377 million worth of shares. We have now spent over $7.4 billion buying back shares and should begin our buyback program at the end of 2010. 
On a stock split-adjusted basis, we have reduced our outstanding share count by 33%. We still plan to buy back a total of $1.5 billion worth of shares in 2016 as we continue to find the mid to high teen IRR return on this investment highly attractive. 
Despite increased global uncertainties, we remain very comfortable with our current gross leverage ratio of 3.3x, given both our high degree of confidence and our free cash flow growth forecast as well as our robust 15% and growing free cash flow to debt yield. 
Additionally, OWN's free cash flow were not included in our operating results, continues to accelerate and supports our capital structure. We retain a lot of flexibility around capital allocation and are highly committed to remaining investment-grade rated company. Importantly, we are well within the financial ratios prescribed by all 3 rating agencies for our current investment-grade, BBB- debt rating. 
For the full year 2016, despite the anticipated difficult third quarter, I am very pleased, as previously mentioned, to raise our guidance for adjusted EPS from high teens to at least 20-plus percent. At the same time, we are reiterating our guidance for constant currency free cash flow growth of at least high teens as well as commitment to driving solid, constant currency margin expansion. 
Importantly, today, we are also increasing our 2015 through 2018 3-year constant currency adjusted EPS and free cash flow growth [ph] from the low double-digit guidance we outlined in our Investor Day last September 2 to now growing at least low teens or better. Even taking into account uncertain global ad and media market dynamics, we are able to very confidently today raise this 3-year financial growth commitments given our increased visibility in 3 specific areas. First, our global affiliate growth rates, which make 50% of our revenue base given our continued success in executing strong affiliate deals around the world with sustained pricing escalators. Second, with restructuring efforts already completed, we have made significant progress in controlling our SG&A cost base and therefore, slowing our total growth profile. And finally, our book and cash tax rates continued to trend down and are much more favorable than we had expected last September. 
Lastly, I want to update the expected year-over-year foreign exchange impact on our full year reported results. Thanks to our hedging strategy, the expected FX impact on our cash flows has not changed much since our last call despite recent weaker currencies in the U.K. and Europe. 
Assuming current spot rates stay constant for the rest of the year, FX is now expected to reduce our constant currency revenues by $150 million to $160 million  and our constant currency adjusted OIBDA by $80 million to $90 million. 
We also now expect a positive FX impact to adjusted EPS of $0.02 to $0.06 due to the net effect of this year's adjusted OIBDA impact and the year-over-year change in the below-the-line FX impact. 
In closing, I'm extremely pleased to Discovery's progress in the first half of 2016 and our outlook for the rest of the year. I remain extremely optimistic about our evolving global portfolio of well-loved brands and over 220 countries around  the world, our optionality, given our ownership and content and flexible cost structures and our overall financial and operating momentum. 
Thank you, again for your time this morning. And now Dave and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have."

And secondly, Andy, from your perspective, the comment on Bundesliga breaking even free cash flow perspectives. Does that include any assumption on penetration?"

And Look, I think our company really, if you will, where we were 3 years ago, 3.5 years ago with the beginning of the cycle of all of our deals coming up with distributors here in the U.S. and around the world and mostly our IP being nonfiction, we really -- we made a strategic decision that we were going to invest more in content. We're going to focus our brands to be really around tribes or super fans, get Discovery back on brand, science, we've driven all [ph] #1 to African-American women, but we felt we needed to grow our IP to have a strength to really drive our long-term affiliate fees in an aggressive way. And we had said all along that sports was a real lag mover that a lot of what you saw with ESPN in the '90s is the way we see the sports market. And the way tat you saw the kid's market in the '90s is the way that we saw Brazil. So we've emerged now with much stronger IP, and we are spending more for it in Europe on the sports site but we've been very disciplined around the come all almost all of our deals have been low single or mid-single increases, and we've said we'll be profitable on Eurosport with our sports bets. On top of that, we have the ability to sell that same sports IP to other platforms. As you go to Latin America, we have invested more in IP, but scrips number never went on to Latin America. So we have the #2 or 3 channel for women in Latin America, which is Home & Health, so that's the equivalent of home food and health down there. And we also invested in kids IP. So as we look at ourselves today, we now have made most of our favorite. We don't need more exports content in Europe. We can be opportunistic. We have 3 sports channels in each country, we've been able to get big step sups better than double-digit increases, and you see our affiliate is now growing double-digit in outside the U.S. You can see that accelerate even further in Europe, and we're finding that having kids as well as a great female content together with Discovery being #1 in most markets is giving us a lot more strength in Latin America. And so our cost structure is really stabilized here in the U.S. We have Oprah working, we have Discovery #1 in the U.S. and we have our channels on brand. And I think we help basically stabilized in Latin America and in Europe because we have enough sports IP now. We think to go directly to consumers to service all platforms, whether it be the phone guys or whether it be satellite providers or content or going directly ourselves. So I think we're in much better position with real long cycle sustainability on our affiliate domestically and internationally. And when I look at our bouquet of IP, we like our hand and it's important for us now to get that kids IP, to get Discovery, which was last 2 weeks ago determined to be the #1 channel that people in America would want as a channel over-the-top to take advantage of our brands and IP on other platforms, which would be a cherry on top."

Most of the rights we've got are in the 6 -to 8-year range and we've gotten all of our rights on all platforms. 4 years is shorter than we would like, but having 4 years start in '17 we think is attractive and we don't need the Bundesliga on renewal. Right now, we have -- we're the leader in tennis, we have all the Winter Sports, we have attracted a field, we have cycling and we have Moto GP in all German-speaking countries. And so getting the Bundesliga is we think for us kind of a real jumpstart and allows us to play a lot of the games in terms of mobile and other providers that we think would be quite attractive, and we can learn a lot from it. We don't have any affiliate because right now that are dependent on that. And we will be charging independently for the Bundesliga. So it will be a separate case sort of the week it's been done here in the U.S. So for us, it's really a one-off. It'the s ability to get the equivalent of Monday Night Football to go into a very strong market and to take advantage of all the strong IP we have. And in fact that this is the most competitive market in all of Europe, not just in terms of having a good advertising play. But you have the number of mobile players in that market. You have some very strong cable guys competing and on top of that, you have Sky Deutscheland Fighting. And so there is a significant amount of interest in getting, as I said before, 1, there is no requirements, governmental requirements, that will restrict us from offering certain exclusive, certain sports exclusively. We did that in France with [ph] so we can make this available for everyone. We can make some of our sports exclusive. We can emerge with an exclusive deal for some of the Bundesliga games. So it just gives us a lot of vitality and it takes us through '21 [ph] and then we'll see what happens. We do not need it."

But the way that we are doing those deals what packaging Eurosport together with our 10 or 12 channels in each country and that's where you see the 10% affiliate growth. That's not driven by subscriber growth. There hasn't been increased fees generally paid by distributors in Eastern Europe and Western Europe.

We certainly have a lot to learn. We hired Paul Guyardo [ph] who work for Barry Diller and ran his media and marketing operation and he's now our chief commercial officer and he has deployed Discovery GO here in the U.S. And it isn't -- at this point, it isn't deployed on all the cable systems. It's about deployed to about 30 million cable homes in the U.S., but it's an authenticated app, it's all 14 of our channels and we're learning a ton. One is about 60% of the viewership on Discovery GO is in the 15 to 25 age demographics. So a very young demographic is watching our content. Our female abundant is a big surprise, it's doing exceptionally well. We really thought it was going to be our meal content, which research has always shown they love Discovery, they love philosophy. And so we've hard ball, we're going to roll that out but as they are probably everywhere in the U.S. Senate it will be helpful to us in terms of economics. But we're also getting to see what are people watching when the could watch anything. In Europe, we're learning a fair amount in our Eurosport app. Right now, our Eurosport app is everything, and we're finding we have significant churn. But we're talking to sustomers, we're finding the gaming for the French Open and in the left. And and they came in for the U.S. Open and they left. They came in for Tour de France and they left. So we hired Michelangelo who was head of development and strategy for Rupert and [ph]. He also ran MGM. It was 1 of the architects of creating Hulu. And has moved to London, and you build a direct-to-consumer team, and we are making some announcements. We've hired some very strong people and it's an independent operation that will be driving our Eurosport app and all the great IP that we have. And one of the things that we're learning is that it may be that these niches getting a Seasons Pass for 10 days, you got all the tennis majors, seasons pass for cycling, seasons pass for Winter Sports. there some research showing that, that might be a more interesting product. So we're doing a lot research because the 55 countries in Europe. In the French Open, we offered it 5 or 6 different ways and we are now evaluating where we were stronger, where we were weaker, where we will spend more or less turn. So we're felling quite good about it, especially because our cost of IP for direct-to-consumer business is 0. Because we all know all all of it and the fact we own so much strong IP as it works well for us. And so the final thing I would say is that when we look at Discovery and we look at Science and it will look up the call to category with Velocity was around the world is called Turbo or DMAX, we're looking very hard at whether we create things like a Science club for $2.99. We already have more Science content than anyone in the world and they are due and when are you can't read a Science club for $2.99 or $3.99, and you get that app and you got all the signs and some content and embedded in line around the world. Or we can do that with animals and animal planet or we can do that with some of the sub-niches on Discovery. Maybe one of the most interesting pieces of data we've got this we started pushing the leader with Eurosport.com online. We started to push new app instead of going to Eurosport.com you have your own up in your phone. We already have 17 million people that have downloaded and are regular users of that app. And so that is for free but that becomes a group we now get as we want to find out what they want when we want up convert them to pay. So we've got a whole lot to learn. We've got 2 fantastic leaders in the company that are really in the marketing and direct-to-consumer business. And I think that you'll be hearing a lot over the next years. We can make this work, you're going to see huge, I think, huge growth, and I think you guys will give us a lot of credit for because it's kind the next generation of our IP. And finally, on all 3, it's a great partnership with Mike frees and us. We own it 50-50. We have a fair amount of scripted content in there. The thing that differentiates all 3 from a lot of the production companies that are primarily U.S. is that you could do deals in Europe where you hold on to the digital rights or you get the digital rights back in a year, 2 years or 3 years. So we see that as a profitable business that we can continue to grow and scale up. But ultimately, those digital rights are rights that we could use on Dplay across Europe that Mike could use on Liberty Global together with our content. And we view it as a profitable contents business but an IP form that could really generate more value for us  in the aftermarket of mobile and direct-to-consumer as well as working with Mike and providing a better environment for Liberty Global customers."

So it's a cultural change is not always our IP better but you're going to stand up for the value of our continent as reverberated in Asia as well. The other piece that's helping our affiliate line, which I think has more sustainable opportunity for us is that more and more content players want some exclusive content in order to do decommoditize their platforms, whether it's a mobile player or, whether it's a satellite operator, whether it's cable operator in a particular market, more and more once instance of content so when you buy the service you get something you don't get anywhere else, and we have been able to take advantage of that with BeIN in the Middle East and we offered some extra content to BeIN, some extra content to OSN. That was all incremental and that's exclusive content. We have the biggest library. We did the same thing with [ph] in France and so more and more having discussions where we provide over basic services into the marketplace but then because we have a real opportunity we could just create a kid Science Channel, a male channel very quickly in a market that we can launch another female channels.

Well first, Shark Week, Shark Week was down this year, was still the number maybe fourth most successful Shark Week. But we think it should be most -- much better. We got it to a whole different level in the last 2 years and it dropped off. Part of that is we made a mistake we move the too early we. Did it for 2 reasons. One, would it what it out of the way of the Olympics and 2, we thought it would be helpful for us to align with the July 4th weekend. But I think in retrospect doing a lot of the research I think that was too early a lot of people still working and what we have done it in August, we get a huge boost in day and late-night because people just hanging out and the kids are kind -- it's kind of the base of summer. So I think you will see next year will be going back into late July or early August where we found the most success. The only 1 other thing I would say about the overall ratings in advertising market. Advertising market is strong. Scatter is better than double-digit above last year, the volume is quite good. We have been hurt in the U.S. by the strength of the news networks. They were up almost 100% the a lot of that you said we were going for those networks is coming from some of our channels. Discovery still the #1 channel in America for man, but there's no question that both our male and female channels are getting hurt a little bit by that. So we're looking forward to the Olympics being over and early November for the elections to be over. Because we think we have a good hand with our brands and a good hand with our channels in terms of longer term, we really can't predict I would say we took some our money because the pricing was quite good. We were able to get more dollars into better pricing into some of our more successful channels like ID. It's broken through now and is a top 3 or 4 channel in America for women, it's #1 in daytime and late night. We were able to do a lot better in that, and we are at is working up at a good job of leveraging some money on digital, which should show up incremental value next year. Scatter right now is strong. I think the biggest narrative that's changed and I don't know how long it will change is that TV is a pretty good place to move products for advertisers and the number of advertisers move to digital and they weren't able to move as much product and they weren't able to get the kind of metrics that they were comfortable with. And so the money has move back to TV and the ability to things like X1, the ability through working with a number of the data services to really get better quantification for who is watching and target advertising on television is improving as well as TV Everywhere getting a little bit better. So overall, I think, right now, there's some momentum that TV is a pretty good place, a more favorable place to move money and more sustainable and more dependable. I think overtime the digital is going to make more of a comeback but the vote in focus, which felt a setting 1 up a little bit and those that went into hard to make it up to hurt a little bit. But for now it's good we really can make any long-term predictions but we're certainly way ahead of where we thought it would be."

So we have TV Everywhere, which we now deployed everywhere possible and we have our own authenticated app, which allows us to get incremental advertising but also reach a very strong millennial population. So our CPMs on app are quite good. Our viewing globally is up. One of the things that it's a little bit of a tale of 2 cities. Northern Europe is challenged. It's a -- it's been a challenge for the last year and it continues to be a challenge. Advertising was actually down in Northern Europe. If you took Northern Europe, we were double-digit growth everywhere else in the world. And so we are finding that Northern Europe, through very high penetration of high-speed, expenses, it's very expensive cable, high penetration of HBO and of Netflix and a very strong appeal of U.S. content with a high English-speaking population that loves the U.S. stuff that it is having a significant impact on viewership in Northern Europe. SBS has been good transaction transition for us. It's a free cash flow machine. It's been very efficient in terms of the price we bought it at and the synergy we got. But of all markets around the world, it seems to be the 1 that has most challenge in terms of viewership on traditional platforms. The good news is that it doesn't feel at all like its contagion. In fact, Netflix penetration and SVOD penetration outside of Northern Europe is much lower than everybody thought, local content is working more, working better for those players brought most of Western Europe and Latin America. So our viewership overall is up. It's up in the mid-single-digit range and we're finding very difficult economies around the world. I mean, you have almost every country in Latin America or Europe, either flat or down. And and advertising tends to follow GDP. The reason that we're still growing is that our share is growing, and we have some efficiency and we've been able to get some a little bit of market power as we've gotten bigger. But we don't see the economies improving anytime soon. And we don't see Northern Europe improving anytime soon. But the rest of the market feels rather healthy to us and our ability to get double-digit feels sustainable."

Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Discovery Communications had another quarter of strong operating and financial results as we remain focused on maximizing our global linear TV business, strengthening our position on digital and direct-to-co",1659,"Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Discovery Communications had another quarter of strong operating and financial results as we remain focused on maximizing our global linear TV business, strengthening our position on digital and direct-to-consumer platforms and controlling our cost base. 
A key element of Discovery's growth profile is our continued success in securing long-cycle distribution agreements that provide for steady and predictable revenue growth and the optionality for windowing our content on existing and new platforms. 
Today, I am pleased to announce we have reached a new long-term comprehensive affiliate deal with Liberty Global, one of our biggest international distribution partners. The new multiyear deal will deliver our full portfolio of networks to Liberty Global subscribers in 12 European countries and includes new linear distribution for some of our key brands. It also includes broad digital distribution on Liberty Global's Horizon platform that will guarantee our passionate super fans will have access to our content on the screen of their choice. The Liberty Global deal is a continuation of several recent renewals in Europe where we are fighting for the value of our investments in nonfiction, sports and the Olympic Games. These agreements validate our diversification approach and underscore the potential to drive long-term growth through these long-term affiliate deals. 
Our international distribution growth is returning to a double-digit increase for the full year of 2016, and it's poised to stay there for many years to come. This ensures cash flows and provide an investment pool to bolster our content to drive the next generation of growth. There is no question that the addition of sports to our nonfiction portfolio in Europe is bolstering our profile with distributors and reinforcing the must-have nature of our overall suite of brands. Our U.S. and international affiliate revenues comprise about 50% of our total company revenues, and growth of these revenue streams is now locked in for the next couple of years. 
Given the double-digit revenue growth internationally with our new Liberty deal and with recent agreements with Telenor and Telia across the Nordics and the favorable price increases and step-ups we've garnered in all of our recent domestic renewals, together they will register strong growth even assuming universe declines in some markets. The is solid guaranteed revenue growth for half of our company. It's like a favorable bond. Against our solid distribution revenue base, we have more variable ad rates, and we also have longer-term upside potential as we convert the intellectual property, our content that we control to new and emerging platforms. 
Along with the additional contributions to our international affiliate growth, investments in premium and exclusive sports rights also are opening up new opportunities to build our direct-to-consumer platform and businesses. A key example is our recent acquisition of Bundesliga rights in Germany. As you know, we look at every deal that comes available, but we are always financially disciplined in our approach. A number of things aligned that made the Bundesliga different and very attractive. First, there was a new law in Germany called the no single buyer rule that gave us an opportunity to acquire the rights on favorable terms so that the investment will be cash flow positive for us. 
Second, we acquired a package of 45 games, mostly on Friday nights. It's a unique offering of must-have content for German sports fans, similar to Monday Night Football in the U.S., and it makes our Eurosport pay-TV channel and the Eurosport Player the home of Friday night Bundesliga matches. The deal is also for all platforms allowing digital growth as it will help drive the Eurosport Player subscriptions while also providing a huge marketing platform for our whole portfolio. 
Finally, Germany is the fourth-largest economy in the world, and the German pay-TV market has never been healthier with multiple telcos, satellite players and other distributors all buying for the best and strongest IP. These are important potent sports rights that we now own across all platforms. As Andy will discuss in more detail, we will do well with this deal from a financial perspective, and it will also bring numerous strategic benefits for the business. 
Another example of our opportunistic and disciplined sports acquisition strategy for exclusive content is the multi-market deal for Wimbledon that we are announcing today. This agreement solidifies Eurosport as the home of all 4 Grand Slam tennis tournaments in 25 countries next year. 1 year ago, we had just 1 market with all 4 tournaments. Like the Bundesliga deal, these rights bolster our pay-TV offering, fuel our over-the-top sports product and give us exclusive premium content to attract more advertisers and viewers to our platforms. And with Rio a couple of days away, our Olympics team is in place, geared up and has started logistical planning for our first Olympic Games across Europe in 2018. 
With our focus on securing these exclusive rights, we feel that we have the real building blocks and value proposition to begin accelerating our direct-to-consumer sports strategy, and the market potential is huge. As Andy will outline in more detail, given only about half of the homes in Europe have the main Eurosport pay-TV channel, a little less than 150 million homes, there's significant opportunity for our sports IP to reach people on all devices throughout all of Europe, which has a population of over 700 million people. Our investments in premium IP in Europe and around the world are a key part of our strategy, and we're really seeing the benefits take hold. 
In the U.S., our expansion into crime and mystery with ID has been a home run. The Velocity and Oprah Winfrey's OWN network delivered top performances this quarter and this past year, further validating our differentiated and diverse portfolio. Specifically with its focus on scripted with Tyler Perry and Greenleaf, the new series featuring Oprah and produced by Oprah, OWN's success is only accelerating. Oprah's Greanleaf's success, coupled with Tyler hugely successful scripted series already on OWN, has made OWN the #1 channel for African-American women and the top 10 cable network in America for all women, which is really incredible considering OWN didn't exist 5 years ago. This impressive growth trajectory is being recognized in the marketplace during this year's Upfront where we did very, very well. And we have a new scripted series, which is produced by Oprah Winfrey called Queen Sugar, and that will be premiering in a few weeks, and it also looks absolutely terrific. 
Our premium content strategy also is driving our digital business as we are leaning more into short-form, streaming and virtual reality platforms that appeal to Millennial digital natives. For example, Discovery virtual reality, VR, which we launched just a year ago, now has over 1.4 million downloads and over 60 million streams, and we recently launched our first VR-scripted, 4-part miniseries, The Satchel, in conjunction with Toyota. This innovative storytelling product brings our viewers closer to real, which has long been our aspiration, and we are a first-mover market leader with our virtual reality content gaining scale quickly and tapping into a potential next-generation growth business for Discovery that younger generations are deeply engaged in. 
We also are engaging younger viewers and adding value to pay-TV customers through our authenticated TV Everywhere product, Discovery GO; and exciting Millennials with our online brands, Seeker and SourceFed, which totaled over 1 billion worldwide streams during the quarter. In Latin America, our TV Everywhere product, Discovery K!ds Play, is off to a strong start with great engagement in 11 countries across 9 carriers. 
Another example of our platform-agnostic approach can be seen in Italy, where we completed a deal with Vodafone to provide our entire free-to-air portfolio to its subscribers across all platforms. 
Beyond our platforms, we are engaged with many players regarding other new and emerging products as we remain platform-agnostic in how and where we reach our viewers like our deals with Verizon Go90, Sony's PlayStation Vue and Hulu. These opportunities represent potential ways to reach new viewers and new revenue streams to drive growth. 
Viewers worldwide have made it clear they value our content. In a recent beta research study in the U.S. that asked which network's people would want in a à la carte world, Discovery Channel ranked #1 among all non-cable viewers, and many of our other channels were in the top 5 of their target demos. Discovery Channel is the #1 pay-TV brand in most of the markets around the world where we're in business. 
As we think about our U.S. business, I'd like to highlight some of our unique, competitive advantages that will help ensure we continue to have a stable, profitable domestic business going forward. Unlike many other content providers, we have very flexible cost structures and are not locked into long-term syndication-type deals, thus we have levers we can pull when and if needed. We also own almost all of our content and control it across all platforms. That makes us more platform-agnostic and gives us a lot of optionality as the world evolves. 
Additionally, given the demand for our brands and the value they represent, we believe we are extremely well positioned if the U.S. shifts toward more skinny bundles in the many years ahead. And with 85% of our economics coming from our top 6 networks, we could even benefit from smaller bundles, especially if they attract new audiences, which has been our experience in markets around the world where we have been on skinnier bundles. 
Our mission has transformed over time. From linear-only nonfiction programming to a multi-platform offering of nonfiction, sports and kids content today. The common thread has always been and continues to be real-world entertainment that engages passionate communities around the globe. I am very optimistic about the future and our continued ability to deliver strong financial results and enhance shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Andy for details on our financial results."
22666093,337690396,1021536,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros.

As David mentioned, we are very pleased with the continued financial and strategic progress we made in the second quarter.

As David mentioned, we are very pleased with the continued financial and strategic progress we made in the second quarter. Our strong sustained domestic and international long-cycle affiliate revenue growth combined with mid-single-digit global ad growth drove 8% total company organic revenue growth. This solid top line performance, combined with our continued focus on controlling our operational costs, led to a 10% global organic adjusted OIBDA growth, more than triple last year's second quarter growth rate. 
As we have consistently noted, 2 of our critical competitive advantages are our flexible cost structures and the fact that we own or control the vast majority of our content across all platforms. This give us tremendous operational flexibility and optionality and allow us to fully maximize our profit growth. While our international advertising growth has recently been slowed by unusual market factors, such as Brexit, we booked very strong U.S. Upfront ad volume. Our affiliate growth remains stable domestically, and it's accelerating internationally, and we remain hyper focused on controlling global cost growth. 
With our first half of the year constant-currency adjusted EPS of 25%, we are pacing well ahead of our earlier guidance of high teens growth. Therefore, we're increasing our full year guidance for constant-currency adjusted EPS growth from high teens to at least 20-plus percent. Similarly, our first half constant-currency free cash flow growth of 42% is also pacing well ahead of our high teens growth guidance range, which clearly validates our operational attraction and excellence. 
Before providing more details around the second quarter results, I want to answer directly several of the major questions analysts and investors have been asking us lately. First, with today's announcement, our new distribution deal with Liberty Global, we are now able to provide more information on the Bundesliga soccer right license in Germany that we announced mid-quarter. We are very mindful of your concerns about these additional costs and their potential impact on Eurosport's profitability. 
As David mentioned, given the new no single buyer rule, we are able to pickup a prime time package of 45 exclusive games per year over the next 4 years at attractive rates. Also, consistent with our imperative that we position Discovery's international business for the future, the deal includes a live streaming rights for games that we will now be able to market directly to all German consumers, including the 80% who do not subscribe to premium pay TV. But these rights starting in August of 2017 will recognize half of that annual cost next year, and given the favorable rights pricing terms, we can't commit to the Bundesliga being cash flow positive. It's very important for investors to know that we vet each and every sports rights deal rigorously to ensure that we could both generate a positive return in these investments and meaningfully enhance our strategic content position in key markets. Eurosport does not and will never have negative margins. No sports rights deal that we pursue will lead the Eurosport losing money, and Bundesliga is absolutely no exception to this commitment. 
Now I'll take a moment to talk through the future of our digital business in Europe, especially regarding Eurosport. Like you, we don't know exactly how the digital future and, in particular, mobile will progress. But we do know for sure that it's essential that we play and lead on this platform. Here are a few statistics and market perspectives that we use to inform our strategic and investment decision-making processes. First, data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, indicates that there are around 330 million mobile phone data subscribers in Europe. Also, few research indicate smartphone penetration in major European countries to be between 50% and 70%. This, of course, means that these people all have smartphone video capability today. We also know that mobile operators are looking for sports content partners to help bundle their respective services. 
Second, our own analysis indicates that today, there are over 32 million OTT households in the top European markets, and clearly that number will continue to increase dramatically with higher broadband rates and more SVOD services, especially around sports. 
Third, we know that there are -- have already been over 17 million downloads to date of our free Eurosport news app. These users are our starting point or funnel for marketing access to all the digital sports content we have been smartly collecting. 
With these market dynamics, we could begin to build some strategic planning numbers around these facts to give us a sense of the potential scale and long-term value creation to tell us whether this is a line of business worth pursuing. You'll do your own models, but here is one of the ways we've been thinking about quantifying the opportunity. 1% of the OECD's 330 million mobile data subscribers at $8 per month would deliver approximately $330 million in additional annual revenues, and a 5% penetration would deliver $1.6 billion. Recognizing that we have already paid for most of these digital content rights and will need to continue to invest in the latest platform technologies, a 40% margin would provide between $100 million and $700 million of additional adjusted OIBDA at these 1% to 5% take rates. This is not assuming additional advertising and sponsorship revenues from our Eurosport digital apps as we will certainly sell across platform. We are also aware that the enterprise value multiples on these digital earnings are higher than those from traditional linear programming. 
To be clear, this is not guidance but an example of one of the ways we are exploring the digital future in Europe as we make our strategic investment and content decisions and one of the reasons that we need to assure that we have the content fully available for digital platforms as we execute our linear sports deals. 
Not surprisingly, another big question we've been getting is the impact of Brexit. For context, our U.K. business represents about a 5% of total company revenues and a slightly higher percentage of total company advertising revenues. We are working through all the potential implications of Brexit on our business. But from an FX perspective, we expect minimal near-term impact on our cash flows. For 2016, our adjusted OIBDA is fully hedged against the weaker pound sterling and 80% hedged against movements in the euro. For 2017, we have currently hedged about half of our euro-denominated cash flow exposures as we are rolling 12 to 18 months foreign exchange hedges already in place. 
From a business perspective, we have not yet seen the recovery in the U.K. ad market that we expected had the Brexit vote gone the other way, but it is still early days. We are continuing to monitor policy developments but do fully expect the U.K. to remain a key market for us. 
Finally, an important question being asked is how the Olympics and Brexit will impact our Q3 results. While we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance for the year, we need to caution that Q3 will be challenged. The Olympics, as they always do, suck advertising dollars out of the market, and Brexit will negatively impact our U.K.-derived ad sales. 
Now let's talk about the second quarter results in more detail. As I stated, on an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as prior year contributions from the SBS Radio, which we sold on June 30, 2015, total company revenues were up 8%, and adjusted OIBDA grew 10%. 
Net income available to Discovery Communications are $408 million, was up 43% from the second quarter a year ago, primarily due to improved operating results, currency-related transactional gains, a decrease in taxes and lower stock compensation, partially offset by a decline in income from equity investees and higher restructuring charges. 
Our book tax income rate in the quarter was 19% due to a onetime settlement benefit. And therefore, we now expect our full year tax rate to be 28%, fully 500 basis points lower than our 2015 tax rate. 
Earnings per diluted share for the second quarter was $0.66, 50% above the second quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per diluted share, which excludes the impact from acquisition-related noncash amortization of intangible assets, was $0.71, a 45% improvement versus last year's second quarter. Excluding currency impacts, adjusted EPS was up 31% for the quarter and up 20% for the last 12 months over the prior 12 months. 
Second quarter free cash flow decreased 4% to $301 million as improved operating performance and lower cash taxes were more than offset by the timing of working capital and higher capital expenditures. 
Second quarter free cash flow ex FX increased 30% for the last 12-month period compared to the prior 12 months. 
Turning now to the operating units. Our U.S. Networks had another very solid quarter with total revenues up 7%, led by 8% distribution growth and 5% advertising growth and another quarter of double-digit adjusted OIBDA, up an impressive 10%. Our 5% advertising growth was again due to higher pricing and proactively managing and monetizing our inventory to take advantage of the strong demand in the scatter market. This was partially offset by weaker delivery, and in particular, a weaker-than-expected Shark Week due to its earlier positioning ahead of the Fourth of July. 
As we look ahead to the third quarter, we expect advertising revenues to be down low single digits versus last year's third quarter due to the Olympics and the tougher comp before rebounding back to positive growth in the fourth quarter. 
Our Domestic Distribution revenues again increased 8%, while total portfolio subs declined 2% for the second quarter last year. We continue to benefit from the higher locked-in rate increases earned and all of our recent affiliate deals. 
Domestic operating expenses in the quarter were up 3%. Our focus on controlling base costs led to an impressive domestic adjusted OIBDA growth of 10% with margins expanding by 100 basis points to 62%. 
As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we now expect expense growth to increase slightly in Q3 due to increased marketing spend and then abate in the fourth quarter. 
Turning now to our international operations, for comparability purposes, my following international comments will refer to our organic results only, so excluding the impact of FX and the SBS Radio sale. International organic revenues and adjusted OIBDA both increased 8%. The 8% second quarter revenue growth was comprised of 10% distribution and 5% advertising growth. Our 10% affiliate revenue growth was due to higher affiliate rates in CEEMEA and in Northern Europe, where we have been highly successful in leveraging our expanded content portfolio that now includes sports to drive higher-contracted pricing step-ups as well as increased subscribers in Latin America. Going forward, we expect our international affiliate growth rates to accelerate, so we are raising our growth expectation to the high single-digit, low double-digit range for the back half of 2016. 
Turning to our second quarter international advertising results. While we benefited from higher volume and ratings in Southern Europe and higher pricing and volumes in CEEMEA, growth in these markets was partially offset by declines in Northern Europe, our largest advertising region. Northern Europe was impacted by the U.K.'s lower ratings and softer demand due to uncertainty ahead of the Brexit vote. Given softer ratings and the fact of this uncertainty has not lifted post the decision to exit the EU and visibility remains limited, we expect an ad sales deceleration in the third quarter, which will also be impacted by the Olympics. We now expect total second half 2016 organic international advertising growth to be in the mid- to high single-digit range. 
International operating expenses grew 9% in the second quarter, primarily due to higher sports content and production costs. Looking ahead, we expect organic expense growth to moderate in the back half of the year as we're able to fully leverage our preexisting sports rights and local market people and infrastructure. 
Now taking a look at our share repurchases. In the second quarter, we repurchased a total of $377 million worth of shares. We have now spent over $7.4 billion buying back shares and should begin our buyback program at the end of 2010. On a stock split-adjusted basis, we have reduced our outstanding share count by 33%. We still plan to buy back a total of $1.5 billion worth of shares in 2016 as we continue to find the mid to high teen IRR return on this investment highly attractive. 
Despite increased global uncertainties, we remain very comfortable with our current gross leverage ratio of 3.3x, given both our high degree of confidence and our free cash flow growth forecast as well as our robust 15% and growing free cash flow to debt yield. 
Additionally, OWN's free cash flow, while not included in our operating results, continues to accelerate and supports our capital structure. We retain a lot of flexibility around capital allocation and are highly committed to remaining investment-grade rated company. 
Importantly, we are well within the financial ratios prescribed by all 3 rating agencies for our current investment-grade BBB- debt rating. 
For the full year 2016, despite the anticipated difficult third quarter, I am very pleased, as previously mentioned, to raise our guidance for adjusted EPS from high teens to at least 20-plus percent. At the same time, we are reiterating our guidance for constant-currency free cash flow growth of at least high teens as well as our commitment to driving solid, constant-currency margin expansion. 
Importantly, today, we are also increasing our 2015 through 2018 3-year constant-currency adjusted EPS and free cash flow growth CAGRs from the low double-digit guidance we outlined at our Investor Day last September to now growing at least low teens or better. Even taking into account uncertain global ad and media market dynamics, we are able to very confidently today raise these 3-year financial growth commitments given our increased visibility in 3 specific areas. First, our global affiliate growth rates, which make up 50% of our revenue base given our continued success in executing strong affiliate deals around the world with sustained pricing escalators. Second, with the restructuring efforts already completed, we have made significant progress in controlling our SG&A cost base and therefore slowing our total cost growth profile. And finally, our book and cash tax rates continue to trend down and are much more favorable than we had expected last September. 
Lastly, I want to update the expected year-over-year foreign exchange impact on our full year reported results. Thanks to our hedging strategy, the expected FX impact on our cash flows has not changed much since our last call despite recent weaker currencies in the U.K. and Europe. Assuming current spot rates stay constant for the rest of the year, FX is now expected to reduce our constant-currency revenues by $150 million to $160 million and our constant currency adjusted OIBDA by $80 million to $90 million. We also now expect a positive FX impact to adjusted EPS of $0.02 to $0.06 due to the net effect of this year's adjusted OIBDA impact and the year-over-year change in the below-the-line FX impact. 
In closing, I'm extremely pleased of Discovery's progress in the first half of 2016 and our outlook for the rest of the year. I remain extremely optimistic about our evolving global portfolio of well-loved brands in over 220 countries around the world, our optionality given our ownership and content and flexible cost structures and our overall financial and operating momentum.

Thanks, Kannan. So look, I think our company has really -- if look at where we were 3 years ago, 3.5 years ago with the beginning of a cycle of all of our deals coming up with distributors here in the U.S. and around the world and mostly our IP being nonfiction, we really -- we made a strategic decision that we were going to invest more in content. We were going to focus our brands to be really around tribes or super fans, get Discovery back on brand, science. We've driven Oprah to be #1 for African-American women, but we also felt that we needed to grow our IP to have strength to really drive our long-term affiliate fees in an aggressive way. And we had said all along that sports was a real lag mover that a lot of what you saw with ESPN in the '90s is the way we see the sports market. And the way that you saw the kid's market in the '90s is the way that we saw Brazil. So we've emerged now with much stronger IP, and we're spending more for it in Europe on the sports side, but we've been very disciplined around it. Almost all of our deals have been low-single or mid-single increases, and we've said we will be profitable on Eurosport with our sports bets. On top of that, we have the ability to sell that same sports IP to other platforms. As you go to Latin America, we have invested more in IP, but scripts never went down to Latin America. So we have the a #2 or 3 channel for women in Latin America, which is Home & Health. So that's the equivalent of home food and health down there, and we also invested in kids IP. And so as we look at ourselves today, we now have made most of our pivot. We don't need more sports content in Europe. We can be opportunistic. We have 3 sports channels in each country. We've been able to get big step-ups and better than double-digit increases. And you see our affiliate fees now growing double digit in -- outside the U.S. You can see that accelerate even further in Europe. And we're finding that having kids as well as a great female content, together with Discovery being #1 in most markets, is giving us a lot more strength in Latin America. And so our cost structure is really stabilized here in the U.S. We have Oprah working. We have Discovery #1 in the U.S., and we have our channels on brand. And I think we basically stabilized in Latin America and in Europe because we have enough sports IP now, we think, to go directly to consumers to service all platforms, whether it be the phone guys or whether it be satellite providers or content or going directly ourselves. So I think we're in much better position with real long-cycle sustainability on our affiliate domestically and internationally. And when I look at our bouquet of IP, we like our hand. And it's important for us now to get that kids IP, to get Discovery, which was last 2 weeks ago determined to be the #1 channel that people in America would want as a channel over the top to take advantage of our brands and our IP on other platforms, which would be a cherry on top."

Most of the rights we've gotten are in the 6- to 8-year range, and we have gotten all of our rights on all platforms. 4 years is shorter than we would like, but having 4 years start in '17 we think is attractive. And we don't need the Bundesliga on renewal. Right now, we have -- we're the leader in tennis. We have all the Winter Sports. We have track and field. We have cycling, and we have MotoGP in all German-speaking countries. And so getting the Bundesliga is we think for us kind of a real jump-start, and it allows us to play a lot of the games in terms of mobile and other providers that we think could be quite attractive, and we can learn a lot from it. We don't have any affiliate deals right now that are dependent on that, and we will be charging independently for the Bundesliga. So it will be a separate piece sort of the way -- the way it's been done here in the U.S. So for us, it's really a one-off. It's an ability to get the equivalent of Monday Night Football to go into a very strong market and to take advantage of all the strong IP we have. And the fact that this is the most competitive market in all of Europe, not just in terms of having a good advertising play, but you have a number of mobile players in that market. You have some very strong cable guys competing, and on top of that, you have Sky Deutschland fighting. And so there is a significant amount of interest in getting -- as I said before, one, there is no requirements, governmental requirements that will restrict us from offering certain things exclusive, certain sports exclusive. We did it in France with Volore [ph], and so we can make this available for everyone. We can make some of our sports exclusive. We can emerge with an exclusive deal for some of the Bundesliga games. So it just gives us a lot of vitality, and it takes us through '21, and then we'll see what happens. We do not need it."

That's not driven by subscriber growth. There hasn't been increased fees generically paid by distributors in Eastern Europe and Western Europe. We've been getting significant step-ups and long-term sustainable growth rates because of the overall package. And on top of that, we have the Olympics, which we said was going to be profitable.

We hired Paul Guyardo, who worked for Barry Diller and ran his new media and marketing operation. And he's now our Chief Commercial Officer, and he has deployed Discovery GO here in the U.S. And it isn't -- at this point, it isn't deployed on all the cable systems. It's about -- it's deployed to about 30 million cable homes in the U.S., but the -- it's an authenticated app. It's all 14 of our channels, and we're learning a ton. One is about 60% of the viewership on Discovery GO is in the 15- to 25-age demographics, so a very young demographic is watching our content. Our female content is a big surprise. It's doing exceptionally well. We really thought it was going to be mostly our male content, which research has always shown that people love Discovery. They love Velocity. And so we've hired Paul. We're going to roll that out by the end of the year probably everywhere in the U.S., and I think that will be a helper to us in terms of economics. But we're also getting to see what are people watching when they could watch anything. In Europe, we're learning a fair amount on our Eurosport app. Right now, our Eurosport app is everything. And we're finding that we have significant churn. But when we're talking to customers, we're finding that they came in for the French Open, and then they the left. And then they came in for the U.S. Open and they left, that they came in for Tour de France and they left. And so we've hired Mike Lang, who was Head of Development and Strategy for Rupert and Chernin. He also ran MGM. He was one of the architects of creating Hulu. And he's moved to London, and he built the direct -- building the direct-to-consumer team. And we're making some announcements, where we've hired some very strong people, and it's an independent operation that will be driving our Eurosport app and all the great IP that we have. And one of the things that we're learning is that it may be that these niches that getting a season's pass for tennis, where you get all the tennis majors; a season's pass for cycling, you get all the cycling; season's pass for Winter Sports. There are some research that's showing that this is -- that, that might be a more interesting product, and so we're doing a lot of research because these 55 countries in Europe, we -- in the French Open, we offered it 5 or 6 different ways, and we're now evaluating where we were stronger, where we were weaker, where was there more or less churn. So we're felling quite good about it, especially because our cost of IP for our direct-to-consumer business is 0 because we own all of it. And the fact that we now own so much strong IP I think works well for us. And so the final thing I would say is that when we look at Discovery and we look at science and we look at the auto category with Velocity, which around the world is called Turbo or DMAX, we're looking very hard at whether we create things like a Science Club for $2.99. We already have more science content than anyone in the world. And Guyardo and Lang are looking at creating a Science Club for $2.99 or $3.99, and you get that app, and you get all the science and STEM content, and you get it any language around the world. Or we can do that with animals on Animal Planet or we can do that with some of the sub-niches on Discovery. Maybe one of the most interesting pieces of data we got is we started pushing -- we're the leader with Eurosport.com online. We started to push a new app. Instead of going to Eurosport.com, you have your own app in your phone. We already have 17 million people that have downloaded and are regular users of that app. And so that is for free, but that becomes a group that we now get to talk to as we want to find out what they want when we want up-convert them to pay. So we got a whole lot to learn. We got 2 fantastic leaders in the company that are really in the marketing and direct-to-consumer business. And I think you'll be hearing a lot over the next years. If we can make this work, you're going to see huge -- I think huge growth, and I think you guys will give us a lot of credit for it because it's the -- it's kind of the next generation of our IP. Finally, on All3, it's a great partnership with Mike Fries and us. We own it 50-50. We have a fair amount of scripted content in there. and the thing that differentiates All3 from a lot of the production companies that are primarily U.S. is that you could do deals in Europe where you hold on to the digital rights or you get the digital rights back in a year, 2 years or 3 years. So we see that as a profitable business that we can continue to grow and scale up. But ultimately, those digital rights are rights that we could use on Dplay across Europe that Mike could use on Liberty Global together with our content. And we view it as a profitable content business but an IP form that could really generate more value for us in the aftermarket of mobile and direct to consumer as well as working with Mike and providing a better environment for Liberty Global customers."

As you know, we called our signal on 3 occasions in the last 6 months, so it was a cultural change of -- not only is our IP better, but we're going to stand up for the value of our content, and that's reverberated in Asia as well. The other piece that's helping our affiliate line, which I think has more sustainable opportunity for us, is that more and more content players want some exclusive content in order to do decommoditize their platforms. So whether it's a mobile player or whether it's a satellite operator or whether it's a cable operator in a particular market, more and more they want some exclusive content, so that when you buy their service, you get something you don't get anywhere else. And we've been able to take advantage of that with BeIN in the Middle East and OCN (sic) [ OSN ]. So we did our full package of services in the Middle East, and then we offered some extra content to BeIN and some extra content to OSN. That was all incremental, and that's exclusive content. We have a huge library. We're able to -- we did the same thing with Volore [ph] in France. And so more and more we're having discussions where we provide our basic services into the marketplace. But then because we have a real opportunity, we could just create a kids Science Channel. We can create a male channel very quickly in a market. We can launch another female channel. We could launch a young female channel, and we can do it at very low cost with our library. So that's the -- that's one of the things that's been helping to drive it. We can't -- we don't comment specifically with respect to Sky or any of the other players in the marketplace in terms of when their deals are coming up or what the status is."

But when you look at 50% of our revenue being long cycle, it's -- for us, I think, we've worked really hard over the last 3.5 to 4 years to get significant increases, and it's paying real dividends for us now. In an environment whether a universe declines, we're still growing very, very healthy, and we will, even if universe declines increase. In markets where there weren't increases, we fought to get the increases in Latin America and Europe. And we sit now with 50% of our revenue very strong, almost like a bond. And so if you have 50% of our revenue growing at 8%, 9% or 10%, then the question is what do we do with our IP and our existing platforms? And what happens to the advertising market? If we grow 2%, then maybe we're a 5% growth business. If we can get our -- if we can grow around the world 5%, then we're 7% -- 6% or 7% or 8% growth business. If the advertising market or we do a better job programming our channels and we can get advertising around the world up to 8% or 9%, then we're double-digit growth business. And so I think we are really going to focus in now. We've done a really good job on focusing our brands. We have done a good job of getting our IP strategy in place with kids in Latin America and sports in Europe. And in Asia now, we have sports and kids at a much lower cost. But the incremental on top is if we can now create extra revenue by going to other platforms, that's all incremental. And so we're going to spend a lot more time on the other 50%, which right now is ad sales and viewership share of all of our brands, as well as taking all of our IP to every other platform in every market in the world to get more dollars."

Shark Week was down this year, was still the number -- maybe fourth most successful Shark Week, but we think it should be most -- much better. We got it to a whole different level in the last 2 years, and it dropped off. Part of that I think is we made a mistake. We moved it too early. We did it for 2 reasons. One, we wanted to get out of the way of the Olympics; and two, we thought it could be helpful to us to align with the July 4th weekend. But I think in retrospect, doing a lot of the research, I think that it was too early, that there were a lot of people still working. And when we've done it in August, we get a huge boost in day and late night because people are just hanging out, and the kids are -- it's kind of the dog days of summer. So I think  you'll see next year, it will be going back into late July or early August where we found the most success. The only -- one other thing I would say about the overall ratings in advertising market. Advertising market feels strong. Scatter is better than double digit above last year. The volume is quite good. We have been hurt in the U.S. by the strength of the news networks. They were up almost 100%. The lot of that -- a lot of the viewership that's going for those networks is coming from some of our channels. Discovery is still the #1 channel in America for men, but there's no question that both our male and female channels are getting hurt a little bit by that. So we're looking forward to the Olympics being over and early November for the elections to be over because we think we have a good hand with our brands and a good hand with our channels. In terms of longer term, we really -- we can't predict. I would say we took some more money because the pricing was quite good. We were able to get more dollars into some -- and better pricing into some of our more successful channels like ID. It's broken through now and is a top 3 or 4 channel in America for women, and it's #1 in daytime and late night. We were able to do a lot better with that. And Guyardo has -- working with Abbruzese has done, I think, a good job of leveraging some money into digital, which should show up as incremental in value next year. Scatter right now is strong. I think the biggest narrative that's changed and I don't know how long it will change is that TV is a pretty good place to move products for advertisers. And a number of advertisers move to digital, and they weren't able to move as much product, and they weren't able to get the kind of metrics that they were comfortable with. And so more money has moved back to TV. And the ability through things like X1, the ability by -- through working with a number of the data services to really get better quantification for who's watching and target advertising on television is improving as well as TV Everywhere getting a little bit better. So overall, I think right now there's some momentum that TV is a pretty good place, a more favorable place to move money, more sustainable, more dependable. I think over time digital is probably going to make more of a comeback, but that whole in vogue of digital has, I think, worn off a little bit, and those that went in too hard I think got hurt a little bit. So for now it's good. We can't really make any long-term predictions, but we're certainly way ahead of where we thought it would be."

So we have TV Everywhere, which we now have deployed everywhere possible, and we have our own authenticated app, which allows us to get incremental advertising but also reach a very strong Millennial population, so our CPMs on that are quite good. Our viewing globally is up. One of the things that it's a little bit of A Tale of Two Cities. Northern Europe is a challenge. It's a -- it's been a challenge for the last year, and it continues to be a challenge. Advertising was actually down in Northern Europe. If you took Northern Europe out, we were double-digit growth everywhere else in the world. And so we are finding that Northern Europe through very high penetration of high-speed, very expensive cable, high penetration of HBO and of Netflix and a very strong appeal of U.S. content with a high English-speaking population that loves the U.S. stuff that it is having a significant impact on viewership in Northern Europe. SBS has been a good transaction for us. It's a free cash flow machine. It's been very efficient in terms of the price we bought it at and the synergy we got. But of all markets around the world, it seems to be the one that has the most challenge in terms of viewership on traditional platforms. The good news is it doesn't feel at all like it's contagion. In fact, Netflix penetration and SVOD penetration outside of Northern Europe is much lower than everybody thought. Local content is working more -- working better for those players throughout most of Western Europe and Latin America. So our viewership overall is up. It's up in the mid-single range, and we're fighting very difficult economies around the world. I mean, you have almost every country in either Latin America or Europe either flat or down, and advertising tends to follow GDP. The reason that we're still growing is that our share is growing, and we have some efficiency, and we've been able to get some -- a little bit of market power as we've gotten bigger. But we don't see the economies improving anytime soon, and we don't see Northern Europe improving anytime soon. But the rest of the market feels rather healthy to us, and our ability to get double digit feels sustainable."

22666093,337690396,1021810,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Discovery Communications had another quarter of strong operating and financial results as we remain focused on maximizing our global linear TV business, strengthening our position on digital and direct-to-co",1659,"Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Discovery Communications had another quarter of strong operating and financial results as we remain focused on maximizing our global linear TV business, strengthening our position on digital and direct-to-consumer platforms and controlling our cost base. 
A key element of Discovery's growth profile is our continued success in securing long-cycle distribution agreements that provide for steady and predictable revenue growth and the optionality for windowing our content on existing and new platforms. 
Today, I am pleased to announce we have reached a new long-term comprehensive affiliate deal with Liberty Global, one of our biggest international distribution partners. The new multiyear deal will deliver our full portfolio of networks to Liberty Global subscribers in 12 European countries and includes new linear distribution for some of our key brands. It also includes broad digital distribution on Liberty Global's Horizon platform that will guarantee our passionate super fans will have access to our content on the screen of their choice. The Liberty Global deal is a continuation of several recent renewals in Europe where we are fighting for the value of our investments in nonfiction, sports and the Olympic Games. These agreements validate our diversification approach and underscore the potential to drive long-term growth through these long-term affiliate deals. 
Our international distribution growth is returning to a double-digit increase for the full year of 2016, and it's poised to stay there for many years to come. This ensures cash flows and provide an investment pool to bolster our content to drive the next generation of growth. There is no question that the addition of sports to our nonfiction portfolio in Europe is bolstering our profile with distributors and reinforcing the must-have nature of our overall suite of brands. Our U.S. and international affiliate revenues comprise about 50% of our total company revenues, and growth of these revenue streams is now locked in for the next couple of years. 
Given the double-digit revenue growth internationally with our new Liberty deal and with recent agreements with Telenor and Telia across the Nordics and the favorable price increases and step-ups we've garnered in all of our recent domestic renewals, together they will register strong growth even assuming universe declines in some markets. The is solid guaranteed revenue growth for half of our company. It's like a favorable bond. Against our solid distribution revenue base, we have more variable ad rates, and we also have longer-term upside potential as we convert the intellectual property, our content that we control to new and emerging platforms. 
Along with the additional contributions to our international affiliate growth, investments in premium and exclusive sports rights also are opening up new opportunities to build our direct-to-consumer platform and businesses. A key example is our recent acquisition of Bundesliga rights in Germany. As you know, we look at every deal that comes available, but we are always financially disciplined in our approach. A number of things aligned that made the Bundesliga different and very attractive. First, there was a new law in Germany called the no single buyer rule that gave us an opportunity to acquire the rights on favorable terms so that the investment will be cash flow positive for us. 
Second, we acquired a package of 45 games, mostly on Friday nights. It's a unique offering of must-have content for German sports fans, similar to Monday Night Football in the U.S., and it makes our Eurosport pay-TV channel and the Eurosport Player the home of Friday night Bundesliga matches. The deal is also for all platforms allowing digital growth as it will help drive the Eurosport Player subscriptions while also providing a huge marketing platform for our whole portfolio. 
Finally, Germany is the fourth-largest economy in the world, and the German pay-TV market has never been healthier with multiple telcos, satellite players and other distributors all vying for the best and strongest IP. These are important potent sports rights that we now own across all platforms. As Andy will discuss in more detail, we will do well with this deal from a financial perspective, and it will also bring numerous strategic benefits to the business. 
Another example of our opportunistic and disciplined sports acquisition strategy for exclusive content is the multi-market deal for Wimbledon that we are announcing today. This agreement solidifies Eurosport as the home of all 4 Grand Slam tennis tournaments in 25 countries next year. 1 year ago, we had just 1 market with all 4 tournaments. Like the Bundesliga deal, these rights bolster our pay-TV offering, fuel our over-the-top sports product and give us exclusive premium content to attract more advertisers and viewers to our platforms. And with Rio a couple of days away, our Olympics team is in place, geared up and has started logistical planning for our first Olympic Games across Europe in 2018. 
With our focus on securing these exclusive rights, we feel that we have the real building blocks and value proposition to begin accelerating our direct-to-consumer sports strategy, and the market potential is huge. As Andy will outline in more detail, given only about half of the homes in Europe have the main Eurosport pay-TV channel, a little less than 150 million homes, there's significant opportunity for our sports IP to reach people on all devices throughout all of Europe, which has a population of over 700 million people. Our investments in premium IP in Europe and around the world are a key part of our strategy, and we're really seeing the benefits take hold. 
In the U.S., our expansion into crime and mystery with ID has been a home run. The Velocity and Oprah Winfrey's OWN network delivered top performances this quarter and this past year, further validating our differentiated and diverse portfolio. Specifically with its focus on Scripted with Tyler Perry and Greenleaf, the new series featuring Oprah and produced by Oprah, OWN's success is only accelerating. Oprah's Greanleaf's success, coupled with Tyler hugely successful scripted series already on OWN, has made OWN the #1 channel for African-American women and the top 10 cable network in America for all women, which is really incredible considering OWN didn't exist 5 years ago. This impressive growth trajectory is being recognized in the marketplace during this year's Upfront where we did very, very well. And we have a new scripted series, which is produced by Oprah Winfrey called Queen Sugar, and that will be premiering in a few weeks, and it also looks absolutely terrific. 
Our premium content strategy also is driving our digital business as we are leaning more into short-form, streaming and virtual reality platforms that appeal to Millennial digital natives. For example, Discovery virtual reality, VR, which we launched just a year ago, now has over 1.4 million downloads and over 60 million streams, and we recently launched our first VR-scripted, 4-part miniseries, The Satchel, in conjunction with Toyota. This innovative storytelling product brings our viewers closer to real, which has long been our aspiration, and we are a first-mover market leader with our virtual reality content gaining scale quickly and tapping into a potential next-generation growth business for Discovery that younger generations are deeply engaged in. 
We also are engaging younger viewers and adding value to pay-TV customers through our authenticated TV Everywhere product, Discovery GO; and exciting Millennials with our online brands, Seeker and SourceFed, which totaled over 1 billion worldwide streams during the quarter. In Latin America, our TV Everywhere product, Discovery K!ds Play, is off to a strong start with great engagement in 11 countries across 9 carriers. 
Another example of our platform-agnostic approach can be seen in Italy, where we completed a deal with Vodafone to provide our entire free-to-air portfolio to its subscribers across all platforms. 
Beyond our platforms, we are engaged with many players regarding other new and emerging products as we remain platform-agnostic in how and where we reach our viewers like our deals with Verizon Go90, Sony's PlayStation Vue and Hulu. These opportunities represent potential ways to reach new viewers and new revenue streams to drive growth. 
Viewers worldwide have made it clear they value our content. In a recent beta research study in the U.S. that asked which network's people would want in a à la carte world, Discovery Channel ranked #1 among all non-cable viewers, and many of our other channels were in the top 5 of their target demos. Discovery Channel is the #1 pay-TV brand in most of the markets around the world where we're in business. 
As we think about our U.S. business, I'd like to highlight some of our unique, competitive advantages that will help ensure we continue to have a stable, profitable domestic business going forward. Unlike many other content providers, we have very flexible cost structures and are not locked into long-term syndication-type deals, thus we have levers we can pull when and if needed. We also own almost all of our content and control it across all platforms. That makes us more platform-agnostic and gives us a lot of optionality as the world evolves. 
Additionally, given the demand for our brands and the value they represent, we believe we are extremely well positioned if the U.S. shifts toward more skinny bundles in the many years ahead. And with 85% of our economics coming from our top 6 networks, we could even benefit from smaller bundles, especially if they attract new audiences, which has been our experience in markets around the world where we have been on skinnier bundles. 
Our mission has transformed over time. From linear-only nonfiction programming to a multi-platform offering of nonfiction, sports and kids content today. The common thread has always been and continues to be real-world entertainment that engages passionate communities around the globe. I am very optimistic about the future and our continued ability to deliver strong financial results and enhance shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Andy for details on our financial results."
22666093,337690396,1021810,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As David mentioned, we are very pleased with the continued financial and strategic progress we made in the second quarter. Our strong sustained domestic and international long-cycle affiliate r",2622,"Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As David mentioned, we are very pleased with the continued financial and strategic progress we made in the second quarter. Our strong sustained domestic and international long-cycle affiliate revenue growth combined with mid-single-digit global ad growth drove 8% total company organic revenue growth. This solid top line performance, combined with our continued focus on controlling our operational costs, led to a 10% global organic adjusted OIBDA growth, more than triple last year's second quarter growth rate. 
As we have consistently noted, 2 of our critical competitive advantages are our flexible cost structures and the fact that we own or control the vast majority of our content across all platforms. These give us tremendous operational flexibility and optionality and allow us to fully maximize our profit growth. While our international advertising growth has recently been slowed by unusual market factors, such as Brexit, we booked very strong U.S. upfront ad volume. Our affiliate growth remains stable domestically, and it's accelerating internationally, and we remain hyper focused on controlling global cost growth. 
With our first half of the year constant-currency adjusted EPS of 25%, we are pacing well ahead of our earlier guidance of high teens growth. Therefore, we're increasing our full year guidance for constant-currency adjusted EPS growth from high teens to at least 20-plus percent. Similarly, our first half constant-currency free cash flow growth of 42% is also pacing well ahead of our high teens growth guidance range, which clearly validates our operational attraction and excellence. 
Before providing more details around the second quarter results, I want to answer directly several of the major questions analysts and investors have been asking us lately. First, with today's announcement, our new distribution deal with Liberty Global, we are now able to provide more information on the Bundesliga soccer right license in Germany that we announced mid-quarter. We are very mindful of your concerns about these additional costs and their potential impact on Eurosport's profitability. 
As David mentioned, given the new no single buyer rule, we are able to pickup a prime time package of 45 exclusive games per year over the next 4 years at attractive rates. Also, consistent with our imperative that we position Discovery's international business for the future, the deal includes a live streaming rights for games that we will now be able to market directly to all German consumers, including the 80% who do not subscribe to premium pay TV. With these rights starting in August of 2017 we'll recognize half of that annual cost next year, and given the favorable rights pricing terms, we can't commit to the Bundesliga being cash flow positive. It's very important for investors to know that we vet each and every sports rights deal rigorously to ensure that we could both generate a positive return in these investments and meaningfully enhance our strategic content position in key markets. Eurosport does not and will never have negative margins. No sports rights deal that we pursue will lead to Eurosport losing money, and Bundesliga is absolutely no exception to this commitment. 
Now I'll take a moment to talk through the future of our digital business in Europe, especially regarding Eurosport. Like you, we don't know exactly how the digital future and, in particular, mobile will progress. But we do know for sure that it's essential that we play and lead on this platform. Here are a few statistics and market perspectives that we use to inform our strategic and investment decision-making processes. First, data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, indicates that there are around 330 million mobile phone data subscribers in Europe. Also, peer research indicates smartphone penetration in major European countries to be between 50% and 70%. This, of course, means that these people all have smartphone video capability today. We also know that mobile operators are looking for sports content partners to help bundle their respective services. 
Second, our own analysis indicates that today, there are over 32 million OTT households in the top European markets, and clearly that number will continue to increase dramatically with higher broadband rates and more SVOD services, especially around sports. 
Third, we know that there are -- have already been over 17 million downloads to date of our free Eurosport news app. These users are our starting point or funnel for marketing access to all the digital sports content we have been smartly collecting. 
With these market dynamics, we could begin to build some strategic planning numbers around these facts to give us a sense of the potential scale and long-term value creation to tell us whether this is a line of business worth pursuing. You'll do your own models, but here is one of the ways we've been thinking about quantifying the opportunity. 1% of the OECD's 330 million mobile data subscribers at $8 per month would deliver approximately $330 million in additional annual revenues, and a 5% penetration would deliver $1.6 billion. Recognizing that we have already paid for most of these digital content rights and will need to continue to invest in the latest platform technologies, a 40% margin would provide between $100 million and $700 million of additional adjusted OIBDA at these 1% to 5% take rates. This is not assuming additional advertising and sponsorship revenues from our Eurosport digital apps as we will certainly sell across platform. We are also aware that the enterprise value multiples on these digital earnings are higher than those from traditional linear programming. 
To be clear, this is not guidance but an example of one of the ways we are exploring the digital future in Europe as we make our strategic investment and content decisions and one of the reasons that we need to assure that we have the content fully available for digital platforms as we execute our linear sports deals. 
Not surprisingly, another big question we've been getting is the impact of Brexit. For context, our U.K. business represents only 5% of total company revenues and a slightly higher percentage of total company advertising revenues. We are working through all the potential implications of Brexit on our business. But from an FX perspective, we expect minimal near-term impact on our cash flows. For 2016, our adjusted OIBDA is fully hedged against the weaker pound sterling and 80% hedged against movements in the euro. For 2017, we have currently hedged about half of our euro-denominated cash flow exposures as we have rolling 12 to 18 months foreign exchange hedges already in place. 
From a business perspective, we have not yet seen the recovery in the U.K. ad market that we expected had the Brexit vote gone the other way, but it is still early days. We are continuing to monitor policy developments but do fully expect the U.K. to remain a key market for us. 
Finally, an important question being asked is how the Olympics and Brexit will impact our Q3 results. While we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance for the year, we need to caution that Q3 will be challenged. The Olympics, as they always do, suck advertising dollars out of the market, and Brexit will negatively impact our U.K.-derived ad sales. 
Now let's talk about the second quarter results in more detail. As I stated, on an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as prior year contributions from the SBS Radio, which we sold on June 30, 2015, total company revenues were up 8%, and adjusted OIBDA grew 10%. 
Net income available to Discovery Communications are $408 million, was up 43% from the second quarter a year ago, primarily due to improved operating results, currency-related transactional gains, a decrease in taxes and lower stock compensation, partially offset by a decline in income from equity investees and higher restructuring charges. 
Our book tax income rate in the quarter was 19% due to a onetime settlement benefit. And therefore, we now expect our full year tax rate to be 28%, fully 500 basis points lower than our 2015 tax rate. 
Earnings per diluted share for the second quarter was $0.66, 50% above the second quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per diluted share, which excludes the impact from acquisition-related noncash amortization of intangible assets, was $0.71, a 45% improvement versus last year's second quarter. Excluding currency impacts, adjusted EPS was up 31% for the quarter and up 20% for the last 12 months over the prior 12 months. 
Second quarter free cash flow decreased 4% to $301 million as improved operating performance and lower cash taxes were more than offset by the timing of working capital and higher capital expenditures. 
Second quarter free cash flow ex FX increased 30% for the last 12-month period compared to the prior 12 months. 
Turning now to the operating units. Our U.S. Networks had another very solid quarter with total revenues up 7%, led by 8% distribution growth and 5% advertising growth and another quarter of double-digit adjusted OIBDA, up an impressive 10%. Our 5% advertising growth was again due to higher pricing and proactively managing and monetizing our inventory to take advantage of the strong demand in the scatter market. This was partially offset by weaker delivery, and in particular, a weaker-than-expected Shark Week due to its earlier positioning ahead of the Fourth of July. 
As we look ahead to the third quarter, we expect advertising revenues to be down low single digits versus last year's third quarter due to the Olympics and the tougher comp before rebounding back to positive growth in the fourth quarter. 
Our Domestic Distribution revenues again increased 8%, while total portfolio subs declined 2% for the second quarter last year. We continue to benefit from the higher locked-in rate increases earned in all of our recent affiliate deals. 
Domestic operating expenses in the quarter were up 3%. Our focus on controlling base costs led to an impressive domestic adjusted OIBDA growth of 10% with margins expanding by 100 basis points to 62%. 
As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we now expect expense growth to increase slightly in Q3 due to increased marketing spend and then abate in the fourth quarter. 
Turning now to our international operations, for comparability purposes, my following international comments will refer to our organic results only, so excluding the impact of FX and the SBS Radio sale. International organic revenues and adjusted OIBDA both increased 8%. The 8% second quarter revenue growth was comprised of 10% distribution and 5% advertising growth. Our 10% affiliate revenue growth was due to higher affiliate rates in CEEMEA and in Northern Europe, where we have been highly successful in leveraging our expanded content portfolio that now includes sports to drive higher-contracted pricing step-ups as well as increased subscribers in Latin America. Going forward, we expect our international affiliate growth rates to accelerate, so we are raising our growth expectation to the high single-digit, low double-digit range for the back half of 2016. 
Turning to our second quarter international advertising results. While we benefited from higher volume and ratings in Southern Europe and higher pricing and volumes in CEEMEA, growth in these markets was partially offset by declines in Northern Europe, our largest advertising region. Northern Europe was impacted by the U.K.'s lower ratings and softer demand due to uncertainty ahead of the Brexit vote. Given softer ratings and the fact that this uncertainty has not lifted post the decision to exit the EU and visibility remains limited, we expect an ad sales deceleration in the third quarter, which will also be impacted by the Olympics. We now expect total second half 2016 organic international advertising growth to be in the mid- to high single-digit range. 
International operating expenses grew 9% in the second quarter, primarily due to higher sports content and production costs. Looking ahead, we expect organic expense growth to moderate in the back half of the year as we're able to fully leverage our preexisting sports rights and local market people and infrastructure. 
Now taking a look at our share repurchases. In the second quarter, we repurchased a total of $377 million worth of shares. We have now spent over $7.4 billion buying back shares since we began our buyback program at the end of 2010. On a stock split-adjusted basis, we have reduced our outstanding share count by 33%. We still plan to buy back a total of $1.5 billion worth of shares in 2016 as we continue to find the mid to high teen IRR return on this investment highly attractive. 
Despite increased global uncertainties, we remain very comfortable with our current gross leverage ratio of 3.3x, given both our high degree of confidence and our free cash flow growth forecast as well as our robust 15% and growing free cash flow to debt yield. 
Additionally, OWN's free cash flow, while not included in our operating results, continues to accelerate and supports our capital structure. We retain a lot of flexibility around capital allocation and are highly committed to remaining an investment-grade rated company. 
Importantly, we are well within the financial ratios prescribed by all 3 rating agencies for our current investment-grade BBB- debt rating. 
For the full year 2016, despite the anticipated difficult third quarter, I am very pleased, as previously mentioned, to raise our guidance for adjusted EPS from high teens to at least 20-plus percent. At the same time, we are reiterating our guidance for constant-currency free cash flow growth of at least high teens as well as our commitment to driving solid, constant-currency margin expansion. 
Importantly, today, we are also increasing our 2015 through 2018 3-year constant-currency adjusted EPS and free cash flow growth CAGRs from the low double-digit guidance we outlined at our Investor Day last September to now growing at least low teens or better. Even taking into account uncertain global ad and media market dynamics, we are able to very confidently today raise these 3-year financial growth commitments given our increased visibility in 3 specific areas. First, our global affiliate growth rates, which make up 50% of our revenue base given our continued success in executing strong affiliate deals around the world with sustained pricing escalators. Second, with the restructuring efforts already completed, we have made significant progress in controlling our SG&A cost base and therefore slowing our total cost growth profile. And finally, our book and cash tax rates continue to trend down and are much more favorable than we had expected last September. 
Lastly, I want to update the expected year-over-year foreign exchange impact on our full year reported results. Thanks to our hedging strategy, the expected FX impact on our cash flows has not changed much since our last call despite recent weaker currencies in the U.K. and Europe. Assuming current spot rates stay constant for the rest of the year, FX is now expected to reduce our constant-currency revenues by $150 million to $160 million and our constant currency adjusted OIBDA by $80 million to $90 million. We also now expect a positive FX impact to adjusted EPS of $0.02 to $0.06 due to the net effect of this year's adjusted OIBDA impact and the year-over-year change in the below-the-line FX impact. 
In closing, I'm extremely pleased with Discovery's progress in the first half of 2016 and our outlook for the rest of the year. I remain extremely optimistic about our evolving global portfolio of well-loved brands in over 220 countries around the world, our optionality given our ownership and content and flexible cost structures and our overall financial and operating momentum. 
Thank you again for your time this morning, and now Dave and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have."

Thanks, Kannan. So look, I think our company has really -- if look at where we were 3 years ago, 3.5 years ago with the beginning of a cycle of all of our deals coming up with distributors here in the U.S. and around the world and mostly our IP being nonfiction, we really -- we made a strategic decision that we were going to invest more in content. We were going to focus our brands to be really around tribes or super fans, get Discovery back on brand, science. We've driven Oprah to be #1 for African-American women, but we also felt that we needed to grow our IP to have strength to really drive our long-term affiliate fees in an aggressive way. And we had said all along that sports was a real lag mover that a lot of what you saw with ESPN in the '90s is the way we see the sports market. And the way that you saw the kid's market in the '90s is the way that we saw Brazil. So we've emerged now with much stronger IP, and we're spending more for it in Europe on the sports side, but we've been very disciplined around it. Almost all of our deals have been low-single or mid-single increases, and we've said we will be profitable on Eurosport with our sports bets. On top of that, we have the ability to sell that same sports IP to other platforms. As you go to Latin America, we have invested more in IP, but scripts never went down to Latin America. So we have the a #2 or 3 channel for women in Latin America, which is Home & Health. So that's the equivalent of home food and health down there, and we also invested in kids IP. And so as we look at ourselves today, we now have made most of our pivot. We don't need more sports content in Europe. We can be opportunistic. We have 3 sports channels in each country. We've been able to get big step-ups and better than double-digit increases. And you see our affiliate fees now growing double digit in -- outside the U.S. You can see that accelerate even further in Europe. And we're finding that having kids as well as a great female content, together with Discovery being #1 in most markets, is giving us a lot more strength in Latin America. And so our cost structure is really stabilized here in the U.S. We have Oprah working. We have Discovery #1 in the U.S., and we have our channels on brand. And I think we've basically stabilized in Latin America and in Europe because we have enough sports IP now, we think, to go directly to consumers to service all platforms, whether it be the phone guys or whether it be satellite providers or content or going directly ourselves. So I think we're in much better position with real long-cycle sustainability on our affiliate domestically and internationally. And when I look at our bouquet of IP, we like our hand. And it's important for us now to get that kids IP, to get Discovery, which was last 2 weeks ago determined to be the #1 channel that people in America would want as a channel over the top to take advantage of our brands and our IP on other platforms, which would be a cherry on top."

After Rio, we'll get the rings and the Olympic library, and we'll be in business with the IOC throughout Europe for the next 4 Olympic Games, and I'm heading over to Rio tomorrow. Most of the rights we've gotten are in the 6- to 8-year range, and we have gotten all of our rights on all platforms. 4 years is shorter than we would like, but having 4 years start in '17 we think is attractive. And we don't need the Bundesliga on renewal. Right now, we have -- we're the leader in tennis. We have all the Winter Sports. We have track and field. We have cycling, and we have MotoGP in all German-speaking countries. And so getting the Bundesliga is, we think for us, kind of a real jump-start, and it allows us to play a lot of the games in terms of mobile and other providers that we think could be quite attractive, and we can learn a lot from it. We don't have any affiliate deals right now that are dependent on that, and we will be charging independently for the Bundesliga. So it will be a separate piece sort of the way -- the way it's been done here in the U.S. So for us, it's really a one-off. It's an ability to get the equivalent of Monday Night Football to go into a very strong market and to take advantage of all the strong IP we have. And the fact that this is the most competitive market in all of Europe, not just in terms of having a good advertising play, but you have a number of mobile players in that market. You have some very strong cable guys competing, and on top of that, you have Sky Deutschland fighting. And so there is a significant amount of interest in getting -- as I said before, one, there is no requirements, governmental requirements that will restrict us from offering certain things exclusive, certain sports exclusive. We did it in France with Volore [ph], and so we can make this available for everyone. We can make some of our sports exclusive. We can emerge with an exclusive deal for some of the Bundesliga games. So it just gives us a lot of vitality, and it takes us through '21, and then we'll see what happens. We do not need it."

We have a-direct-to consumer product. We've increased our IP, and Eurosport still remains -- it has a lower margin, but it's still profitable. It's in the double-digit profitability range, and we've said that we will keep it profitable. But when we look at that profitability, we say this is what we're making on Eurosport in advertising and the affiliate revenue that we assigned simply to Eurosport. But the way that we're doing those deals is we're packaging Eurosport together with our 10 or 12 channels in each country, and that's where you see the 10% affiliate growth. That's not driven by subscriber growth. There hasn't been increased fees generically paid by distributors in Eastern Europe and Western Europe. We've been getting significant step-ups and long-term sustainable growth rates because of the overall package. And on top of that, we have the Olympics, which we said was going to be profitable. But now based on the deals that we've done and we're only about 27% or 28% of the way there, but on the deals we've done already, they're substantially more attractive. And we think not only will we make money, but it will be quite profitable for us."

We hired Paul Guyardo, who worked for Barry Diller and ran his new media and marketing operation. And he's now our Chief Commercial Officer, and he has deployed Discovery GO here in the U.S. And it isn't -- at this point, it isn't deployed on all the cable systems. It's about -- it's deployed to about 30 million cable homes in the U.S., but the -- it's an authenticated app. It's all 14 of our channels, and we're learning a ton. One is about 60% of the viewership on Discovery GO is in the 15- to 25-age demographics, so a very young demographic is watching our content. Our female content is a big surprise. It's doing exceptionally well. We really thought it was going to be mostly our male content, which research has always shown that people love Discovery. They love Velocity. And so we've hired Paul. We're going to roll that out by the end of the year probably everywhere in the U.S., and I think that will be a helper to us in terms of economics. But we're also getting to see what are people watching when they could watch anything. In Europe, we're learning a fair amount on our Eurosport app. Right now, our Eurosport app is everything. And we're finding that we have significant churn. But when we're talking to customers, we're finding that they came in for the French Open, and then they the left. And then they came in for the U.S. Open and they left, that they came in for Tour de France and they left. And so we've hired Mike Lang, who was Head of Development and Strategy for Rupert and Chernin. He also ran MGM. He was one of the architects of creating Hulu. And he's moved to London, and he built the direct -- building the direct-to-consumer team. And we're making some announcements, where we've hired some very strong people, and it's an independent operation that will be driving our Eurosport app and all the great IP that we have. And one of the things that we're learning is that it may be that these niches that getting a season's pass for tennis, where you get all the tennis majors; a season's pass for cycling, you get all the cycling; season's pass for Winter Sports. There are some research that's showing that this is -- that, that might be a more interesting product, and so we're doing a lot of research. Because there's 55 countries in Europe, we -- in the French Open, we offered it 5 or 6 different ways, and we're now evaluating where we were stronger, where we were weaker, where was there more or less churn. So we're felling quite good about it, especially because our cost of IP for our direct-to-consumer business is 0 because we own all of it. And the fact that we now own so much strong IP I think works well for us. And so the final thing I would say is that when we look at Discovery and we look at science and we look at the auto category with Velocity, which around the world is called Turbo or DMAX, we're looking very hard at whether we create things like a Science Club for $2.99. We already have more science content than anyone in the world. And Guyardo and Lang are looking at creating a Science Club for $2.99 or $3.99, and you get that app, and you get all the science and STEM content, and you get it any language around the world. Or we can do that with animals on Animal Planet or we can do that with some of the sub-niches on Discovery. Maybe one of the most interesting pieces of data we got is we started pushing -- we're the leader with Eurosport.com online. We started to push a new app. Instead of going to Eurosport.com, you have your own app in your phone. We already have 17 million people that have downloaded and are regular users of that app. And so that is for free, but that becomes a group that we now get to talk to as we want to find out what they want when we want up-convert them to pay. So we got a whole lot to learn. We got 2 fantastic leaders in the company that are really in the marketing and direct-to-consumer business. And I think you'll be hearing a lot over the next years. If we can make this work, you're going to see huge -- I think huge growth, and I think you guys will give us a lot of credit for it because it's the -- it's kind of the next generation of our IP. Finally, on All3, it's a great partnership with Mike Fries and us. We own it 50-50. We have a fair amount of scripted content in there. and the thing that differentiates All3 from a lot of the production companies that are primarily U.S. is that you could do deals in Europe where you hold on to the digital rights or you get the digital rights back in a year, 2 years or 3 years. So we see that as a profitable business that we can continue to grow and scale up. But ultimately, those digital rights are rights that we could use on Dplay across Europe that Mike could use on Liberty Global together with our content. And we view it as a profitable content business but in IP form that could really generate more value for us in the aftermarket of mobile and direct to consumer as well as working with Mike and providing a better environment for Liberty Global customers."

As you know, we called our signal on 3 occasions in the last 6 months, so it was a cultural change of -- not only is our IP better, but we're going to stand up for the value of our content, and that's reverberated in Asia as well. The other piece that's helping our affiliate line, which I think has more sustainable opportunity for us, is that more and more content players want some exclusive content in order to decommoditize their platforms. So whether it's a mobile player or whether it's a satellite operator or whether it's a cable operator in a particular market, more and more they want some exclusive content, so that when you buy their service, you get something you don't get anywhere else. And we've been able to take advantage of that with BeIN in the Middle East and OCN (sic) [ OSN ]. So we did our full package of services in the Middle East, and then we offered some extra content to BeIN and some extra content to OSN. That was all incremental, and that's exclusive content. We have a huge library. We're able to -- we did the same thing with Volore [ph] in France. And so more and more we're having discussions where we provide our basic services into the marketplace. But then because we have a real opportunity, we could just create a kid's Science Channel. We can create a male channel very quickly in a market. We can launch another female channel. We could launch a young female channel, and we can do it at very low cost with our library. So that's the -- that's one of the things that's been helping to drive it. We can't -- we don't comment specifically with respect to Sky or any of the other players in the marketplace in terms of when their deals are coming up or what the status is."

For -- I mentioned this in my comments. But when you look at 50% of our revenue being long cycle, it's -- for us, I think, we've worked really hard over the last 3.5 to 4 years to get significant increases, and it's paying real dividends for us now. In an environment where the universe declines, we're still growing very, very healthy, and we will, even if universe declines increase. In markets where there weren't increases, we fought to get the increases in Latin America and Europe. And we sit now with 50% of our revenue very strong, almost like a bond. And so if you have 50% of our revenue growing at 8%, 9% or 10%, then the question is what do we do with our IP and our existing platforms? And what happens to the advertising market? If we grow 2%, then maybe we're a 5% growth business. If we can get our -- if we can grow around the world 5%, then we're a 7% -- 6% or 7% or 8% growth business. If the advertising market or we do a better job programming our channels and we can get advertising around the world up to 8% or 9%, then we're double-digit growth business. And so I think we are really going to focus in now. We've done a really good job on focusing our brands. We have done a good job of getting our IP strategy in place with kids in Latin America and sports in Europe. And in Asia now, we have sports and kids at a much lower cost. But the incremental on top is if we can now create extra revenue by going to other platforms, that's all incremental. And so we're going to spend a lot more time on the other 50%, which right now is ad sales and viewership share of all of our brands, as well as taking all of our IP to every other platform in every market in the world to get more dollars."

So I think  you'll see next year, it will be going back into late July or early August where we found the most success. The only -- one other thing I would say about the overall ratings in advertising market. Advertising market feels strong. Scatter is better than double digit above last year. The volume is quite good. We have been hurt in the U.S. by the strength of the news networks. They were up almost 100%. The lot of that -- a lot of the viewership that's going for those networks is coming from some of our channels. Discovery is still the #1 channel in America for men, but there's no question that both our male and female channels are getting hurt a little bit by that. So we're looking forward to the Olympics being over and early November for the elections to be over because we think we have a good hand with our brands and a good hand with our channels. In terms of longer term, we really -- we can't predict. I would say we took some more money because the pricing was quite good. We were able to get more dollars into some -- and better pricing into some of our more successful channels like ID. It's broken through now and is a top 3 or 4 channel in America for women, and it's #1 in daytime and late night. We were able to do a lot better with that. And Guyardo has -- working with Abbruzese has done, I think, a good job of leveraging some money into digital, which should show up as incremental in value next year. Scatter right now is strong. I think the biggest narrative that's changed and I don't know how long it will change is that TV is a pretty good place to move product for advertisers. And a number of advertisers moved to digital, and they weren't able to move as much product, and they weren't able to get the kind of metrics that they were comfortable with. And so more money has moved back to TV. And the ability through things like X1, the ability by -- through working with a number of the data services to really get better quantification for who's watching and target advertising on television is improving as well as TV Everywhere getting a little bit better. So overall, I think right now there's some momentum that TV is a pretty good place, a more favorable place to move money, more sustainable, more dependable. I think over time digital is probably going to make more of a comeback, but that whole in vogue of digital has, I think, worn off a little bit, and those that went in too hard I think got hurt a little bit. So for now it's good. We can't really make any long-term predictions, but we're certainly way ahead of where we thought it would be."

The -- Discovery GO, right, we're talking about an authenticated app, where we're working together with the distributors. So we have TV Everywhere, which we now have deployed everywhere possible, and we have our own authenticated app, which allows us to get incremental advertising but also reach a very strong Millennial population, so our CPMs on that are quite good. Our viewing globally is up. One of the things that it's a little bit of a tale of two cities. Northern Europe is a challenge. It's a -- it's been a challenge for the last year, and it continues to be a challenge. Advertising was actually down in Northern Europe. If you took Northern Europe out, we were double-digit growth everywhere else in the world. And so we are finding that Northern Europe through very high penetration of high-speed, very expensive cable, high penetration of HBO and of Netflix and a very strong appeal of U.S. content with a high English-speaking population that loves the U.S. stuff, that it is having a significant impact on viewership in Northern Europe. SBS has been a good transaction for us. It's a free cash flow machine. It's been very efficient in terms of the price we bought it at and the synergy we got. But of all markets around the world, it seems to be the one that has the most challenge in terms of viewership on traditional platforms. The good news is it doesn't feel at all like a contagion. In fact, Netflix penetration and SVOD penetration outside of Northern Europe is much lower than everybody thought. Local content is working more -- working better for those players throughout most of Western Europe and Latin America. So our viewership overall is up. It's up in the mid-single range, and we're fighting very difficult economies around the world. I mean, you have almost every country in either Latin America or Europe either flat or down, and advertising tends to follow GDP. The reason that we're still growing is that our share is growing, and we have some efficiency, and we've been able to get some -- a little bit of market power as we've gotten bigger. But we don't see the economies improving anytime soon, and we don't see Northern Europe improving anytime soon. But the rest of the market feels rather healthy to us, and our ability to continue to get double digit feels sustainable."

Discovery Communications had another quarter of strong operating and financial results as we remain focused on maximizing our global linear TV business, strengthening our position on digital and direct-to-consumer platforms and controlling our cost base. 
A key element of Discovery's growth profile is our continued success in securing long-cycle distribution agreements that provide for steady and predictable revenue growth and the optionality for windowing our content on existing and new platforms. 
Today, I am pleased to announce we have reached a new long-term comprehensive affiliate deal with Liberty Global, one of our biggest international distribution partners. The new multiyear deal will deliver our full portfolio of networks to Liberty Global subscribers in 12 European countries and includes new linear distribution for some of our key brands. It also includes broad digital distribution on Liberty Global's Horizon platform that will guarantee our passionate super fans will have access to our content on the screen of their choice. The Liberty Global deal is a continuation of several recent renewals in Europe where we are fighting for the value of our investments in nonfiction, sports and the Olympic Games. These agreements validate our diversification approach and underscore the potential to drive long-term growth through these long-term affiliate deals. 
Our international distribution growth is returning to a double-digit increase for the full year of 2016, and it's poised to stay there for many years to come. This ensures cash flows and provide an investment pool to bolster our content to drive the next generation of growth. There is no question that the addition of sports to our nonfiction portfolio in Europe is bolstering our profile with distributors and reinforcing the must-have nature of our overall suite of brands. Our U.S. and international affiliate revenues comprise about 50% of our total company revenues, and growth of these revenue streams is now locked in for the next couple of years. 
Given the double-digit revenue growth internationally with our new Liberty deal and with recent agreements with Telenor and Telia across the Nordics and the favorable price increases and step-ups we've garnered in all of our recent domestic renewals, together they will register strong growth even assuming universe declines in some markets. The is solid guaranteed revenue growth for half of our company. It's like a favorable bond. Against our solid distribution revenue base, we have more variable ad rates, and we also have longer-term upside potential as we convert the intellectual property, our content that we control to new and emerging platforms. 
Along with the additional contributions to our international affiliate growth, investments in premium and exclusive sports rights also are opening up new opportunities to build our direct-to-consumer platform and businesses. A key example is our recent acquisition of Bundesliga rights in Germany. As you know, we look at every deal that comes available, but we are always financially disciplined in our approach. A number of things aligned that made the Bundesliga different and very attractive. First, there was a new law in Germany called the no single buyer rule that gave us an opportunity to acquire the rights on favorable terms so that the investment will be cash flow positive for us. 
Second, we acquired a package of 45 games, mostly on Friday nights. It's a unique offering of must-have content for German sports fans, similar to Monday Night Football in the U.S., and it makes our Eurosport pay-TV channel and the Eurosport Player the home of Friday night Bundesliga matches. The deal is also for all platforms allowing digital growth as it will help drive the Eurosport Player subscriptions while also providing a huge marketing platform for our whole portfolio. 
Finally, Germany is the fourth-largest economy in the world, and the German pay-TV market has never been healthier with multiple telcos, satellite players and other distributors all vying for the best and strongest IP. These are important potent sports rights that we now own across all platforms. As Andy will discuss in more detail, we will do well with this deal from a financial perspective, and it will also bring numerous strategic benefits to the business. 
Another example of our opportunistic and disciplined sports acquisition strategy for exclusive content is the multi-market deal for Wimbledon that we are announcing today. This agreement solidifies Eurosport as the home of all 4 Grand Slam tennis tournaments in 25 countries next year. 1 year ago, we had just 1 market with all 4 tournaments. Like the Bundesliga deal, these rights bolster our pay-TV offering, fuel our over-the-top sports product and give us exclusive premium content to attract more advertisers and viewers to our platforms. And with Rio a couple of days away, our Olympics team is in place, geared up and has started logistical planning for our first Olympic Games across Europe in 2018. 
With our focus on securing these exclusive rights, we feel that we have the real building blocks and value proposition to begin accelerating our direct-to-consumer sports strategy, and the market potential is huge. As Andy will outline in more detail, given only about half of the homes in Europe have the main Eurosport pay-TV channel, a little less than 150 million homes, there's significant opportunity for our sports IP to reach people on all devices throughout all of Europe, which has a population of over 700 million people. Our investments in premium IP in Europe and around the world are a key part of our strategy, and we're really seeing the benefits take hold. 
In the U.S., our expansion into crime and mystery with ID has been a home run. The Velocity and Oprah Winfrey's OWN network delivered top performances this quarter and this past year, further validating our differentiated and diverse portfolio. Specifically with its focus on Scripted with Tyler Perry and Greenleaf, the new series featuring Oprah and produced by Oprah, OWN's success is only accelerating. Oprah's Greanleaf's success, coupled with Tyler hugely successful scripted series already on OWN, has made OWN the #1 channel for African-American women and the top 10 cable network in America for all women, which is really incredible considering OWN didn't exist 5 years ago. This impressive growth trajectory is being recognized in the marketplace during this year's Upfront where we did very, very well. And we have a new scripted series, which is produced by Oprah Winfrey called Queen Sugar, and that will be premiering in a few weeks, and it also looks absolutely terrific. 
Our premium content strategy also is driving our digital business as we are leaning more into short-form, streaming and virtual reality platforms that appeal to Millennial digital natives. For example, Discovery virtual reality, VR, which we launched just a year ago, now has over 1.4 million downloads and over 60 million streams, and we recently launched our first VR-scripted, 4-part miniseries, The Satchel, in conjunction with Toyota. This innovative storytelling product brings our viewers closer to real, which has long been our aspiration, and we are a first-mover market leader with our virtual reality content gaining scale quickly and tapping into a potential next-generation growth business for Discovery that younger generations are deeply engaged in. 
We also are engaging younger viewers and adding value to pay-TV customers through our authenticated TV Everywhere product, Discovery GO; and exciting Millennials with our online brands, Seeker and SourceFed, which totaled over 1 billion worldwide streams during the quarter. In Latin America, our TV Everywhere product, Discovery K!ds Play, is off to a strong start with great engagement in 11 countries across 9 carriers. 
Another example of our platform-agnostic approach can be seen in Italy, where we completed a deal with Vodafone to provide our entire free-to-air portfolio to its subscribers across all platforms. 
Beyond our platforms, we are engaged with many players regarding other new and emerging products as we remain platform-agnostic in how and where we reach our viewers like our deals with Verizon Go90, Sony's PlayStation Vue and Hulu. These opportunities represent potential ways to reach new viewers and new revenue streams to drive growth. 
Viewers worldwide have made it clear they value our content. In a recent beta research study in the U.S. that asked which network's people would want in a à la carte world, Discovery Channel ranked #1 among all non-cable viewers, and many of our other channels were in the top 5 of their target demos. Discovery Channel is the #1 pay-TV brand in most of the markets around the world where we're in business. 
As we think about our U.S. business, I'd like to highlight some of our unique, competitive advantages that will help ensure we continue to have a stable, profitable domestic business going forward. Unlike many other content providers, we have very flexible cost structures and are not locked into long-term syndication-type deals, thus we have levers we can pull when and if needed. We also own almost all of our content and control it across all platforms. That makes us more platform-agnostic and gives us a lot of optionality as the world evolves. 
Additionally, given the demand for our brands and the value they represent, we believe we are extremely well positioned if the U.S. shifts toward more skinny bundles in the many years ahead. And with 85% of our economics coming from our top 6 networks, we could even benefit from smaller bundles, especially if they attract new audiences, which has been our experience in markets around the world where we have been on skinnier bundles. 
Our mission has transformed over time. From linear-only nonfiction programming to a multi-platform offering of nonfiction, sports and kids content today. The common thread has always been and continues to be real-world entertainment that engages passionate communities around the globe. I am very optimistic about the future and our continued ability to deliver strong financial results and enhance shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Andy for details on our financial results."
22666093,337690396,1022442,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros.

As David mentioned, we are very pleased with the continued financial and strategic progress we made in the second quarter.

As David mentioned, we are very pleased with the continued financial and strategic progress we made in the second quarter. Our strong sustained domestic and international long-cycle affiliate revenue growth combined with mid-single-digit global ad growth drove 8% total company organic revenue growth. This solid top line performance, combined with our continued focus on controlling our operational costs, led to a 10% global organic adjusted OIBDA growth, more than triple last year's second quarter growth rate. 
As we have consistently noted, 2 of our critical competitive advantages are our flexible cost structures and the fact that we own or control the vast majority of our content across all platforms. These give us tremendous operational flexibility and optionality and allow us to fully maximize our profit growth. While our international advertising growth has recently been slowed by unusual market factors, such as Brexit, we booked very strong U.S. upfront ad volume. Our affiliate growth remains stable domestically, and it's accelerating internationally, and we remain hyper focused on controlling global cost growth. 
With our first half of the year constant-currency adjusted EPS of 25%, we are pacing well ahead of our earlier guidance of high teens growth. Therefore, we're increasing our full year guidance for constant-currency adjusted EPS growth from high teens to at least 20-plus percent. Similarly, our first half constant-currency free cash flow growth of 42% is also pacing well ahead of our high teens growth guidance range, which clearly validates our operational attraction and excellence. 
Before providing more details around the second quarter results, I want to answer directly several of the major questions analysts and investors have been asking us lately. First, with today's announcement, our new distribution deal with Liberty Global, we are now able to provide more information on the Bundesliga soccer right license in Germany that we announced mid-quarter. We are very mindful of your concerns about these additional costs and their potential impact on Eurosport's profitability. 
As David mentioned, given the new no single buyer rule, we are able to pick up a prime time package of 45 exclusive games per year over the next 4 years at attractive rates. Also, consistent with our imperative that we position Discovery's international business for the future, the deal includes a live streaming rights for games that we will now be able to market directly to all German consumers, including the 80% who do not subscribe to premium pay TV. With these rights starting in August of 2017 we'll recognize half of that annual cost next year, and given the favorable rights pricing terms, we can't commit to the Bundesliga being cash flow positive. It's very important for investors to know that we vet each and every sports rights deal rigorously to ensure that we could both generate a positive return in these investments and meaningfully enhance our strategic content position in key markets. Eurosport does not and will never have negative margins. No sports rights deal that we pursue will lead to Eurosport losing money, and Bundesliga is absolutely no exception to this commitment. 
Now I'll take a moment to talk through the future of our digital business in Europe, especially regarding Eurosport. Like you, we don't know exactly how the digital future and, in particular, mobile will progress. But we do know for sure that it's essential that we play and lead on this platform. Here are a few statistics and market perspectives that we use to inform our strategic and investment decision-making processes. First, data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, indicates that there are around 330 million mobile phone data subscribers in Europe. Also, peer research indicates smartphone penetration in major European countries to be between 50% and 70%. This, of course, means that these people all have smartphone video capability today. We also know that mobile operators are looking for sports content partners to help bundle their respective services. 
Second, our own analysis indicates that today, there are over 32 million OTT households in the top European markets, and clearly that number will continue to increase dramatically with higher broadband rates and more SVOD services, especially around sports. 
Third, we know that there are -- have already been over 17 million downloads to date of our free Eurosport news app. These users are our starting point or funnel for marketing access to all the digital sports content we have been smartly collecting. 
With these market dynamics, we could begin to build some strategic planning numbers around these facts to give us a sense of the potential scale and long-term value creation to tell us whether this is a line of business worth pursuing. You'll do your own models, but here is one of the ways we've been thinking about quantifying the opportunity. 1% of the OECD's 330 million mobile data subscribers at $8 per month would deliver approximately $330 million in additional annual revenues, and a 5% penetration would deliver $1.6 billion. Recognizing that we have already paid for most of these digital content rights and will need to continue to invest in the latest platform technologies, a 40% margin would provide between $100 million and $700 million of additional adjusted OIBDA at these 1% to 5% take rates. This is not assuming additional advertising and sponsorship revenues from our Eurosport digital apps as we will certainly sell across platform. We are also aware that the enterprise value multiples on these digital earnings are higher than those from traditional linear programming. 
To be clear, this is not guidance but an example of one of the ways we are exploring the digital future in Europe as we make our strategic investment and content decisions and one of the reasons that we need to assure that we have the content fully available for digital platforms as we execute our linear sports deals. 
Not surprisingly, another big question we've been getting is the impact of Brexit. For context, our U.K. business represents only 5% of total company revenues and a slightly higher percentage of total company advertising revenues. We are working through all the potential implications of Brexit on our business. But from an FX perspective, we expect minimal near-term impact on our cash flows. For 2016, our adjusted OIBDA is fully hedged against the weaker pound sterling and 80% hedged against movements in the euro. For 2017, we have currently hedged about half of our euro-denominated cash flow exposures as we have rolling 12 to 18 months foreign exchange hedges already in place. 
From a business perspective, we have not yet seen the recovery in the U.K. ad market that we expected had the Brexit vote gone the other way, but it is still early days. We are continuing to monitor policy developments but do fully expect the U.K. to remain a key market for us. 
Finally, an important question being asked is how the Olympics and Brexit will impact our Q3 results. While we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance for the year, we need to caution that Q3 will be challenged. The Olympics, as they always do, suck advertising dollars out of the market, and Brexit will negatively impact our U.K.-derived ad sales. 
Now let's talk about the second quarter results in more detail. As I stated, on an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as prior year contributions from the SBS Radio, which we sold on June 30, 2015, total company revenues were up 8%, and adjusted OIBDA grew 10%. 
Net income available to Discovery Communications are $408 million, was up 43% from the second quarter a year ago, primarily due to improved operating results, currency-related transactional gains, a decrease in taxes and lower stock compensation, partially offset by a decline in income from equity investees and higher restructuring charges. 
Our book tax income rate in the quarter was 19% due to a onetime settlement benefit. And therefore, we now expect our full year tax rate to be 28%, fully 500 basis points lower than our 2015 tax rate. 
Earnings per diluted share for the second quarter was $0.66, 50% above the second quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per diluted share, which excludes the impact from acquisition-related noncash amortization of intangible assets, was $0.71, a 45% improvement versus last year's second quarter. Excluding currency impacts, adjusted EPS was up 31% for the quarter and up 20% for the last 12 months over the prior 12 months. 
Second quarter free cash flow decreased 4% to $301 million as improved operating performance and lower cash taxes were more than offset by the timing of working capital and higher capital expenditures. 
Second quarter free cash flow ex FX increased 30% for the last 12-month period compared to the prior 12 months. 
Turning now to the operating units. Our U.S. Networks had another very solid quarter with total revenues up 7%, led by 8% distribution growth and 5% advertising growth and another quarter of double-digit adjusted OIBDA, up an impressive 10%. Our 5% advertising growth was again due to higher pricing and proactively managing and monetizing our inventory to take advantage of the strong demand in the scatter market. This was partially offset by weaker delivery, and in particular, a weaker-than-expected Shark Week due to its earlier positioning ahead of the Fourth of July. 
As we look ahead to the third quarter, we expect advertising revenues to be down low single digits versus last year's third quarter due to the Olympics and the tougher comp before rebounding back to positive growth in the fourth quarter. 
Our Domestic Distribution revenues again increased 8%, while total portfolio subs declined 2% for the second quarter last year. We continue to benefit from the higher locked-in rate increases earned in all of our recent affiliate deals. 
Domestic operating expenses in the quarter were up 3%. Our focus on controlling base costs led to an impressive domestic adjusted OIBDA growth of 10% with margins expanding by 100 basis points to 62%. 
As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we now expect expense growth to increase slightly in Q3 due to increased marketing spend and then abate in the fourth quarter. 
Turning now to our international operations, for comparability purposes, my following international comments will refer to our organic results only, so excluding the impact of FX and the SBS Radio sale. International organic revenues and adjusted OIBDA both increased 8%. The 8% second quarter revenue growth was comprised of 10% distribution and 5% advertising growth. Our 10% affiliate revenue growth was due to higher affiliate rates in CEEMEA and in Northern Europe, where we have been highly successful in leveraging our expanded content portfolio that now includes sports to drive higher-contracted pricing step-ups as well as increased subscribers in Latin America. Going forward, we expect our international affiliate growth rates to accelerate, so we are raising our growth expectation to the high single-digit, low double-digit range for the back half of 2016. 
Turning to our second quarter international advertising results. While we benefited from higher volume and ratings in Southern Europe and higher pricing and volumes in CEEMEA, growth in these markets was partially offset by declines in Northern Europe, our largest advertising region. Northern Europe was impacted by the U.K.'s lower ratings and softer demand due to uncertainty ahead of the Brexit vote. Given softer ratings and the fact that this uncertainty has not lifted post the decision to exit the EU and visibility remains limited, we expect an ad sales deceleration in the third quarter, which will also be impacted by the Olympics. We now expect total second half 2016 organic international advertising growth to be in the mid- to high single-digit range. 
International operating expenses grew 9% in the second quarter, primarily due to higher sports content and production costs. Looking ahead, we expect organic expense growth to moderate in the back half of the year as we're able to fully leverage our preexisting sports rights and local market people and infrastructure. 
Now taking a look at our share repurchases. In the second quarter, we repurchased a total of $377 million worth of shares. We have now spent over $7.4 billion buying back shares since we began our buyback program at the end of 2010. On a stock split-adjusted basis, we have reduced our outstanding share count by 33%. We still plan to buy back a total of $1.5 billion worth of shares in 2016 as we continue to find the mid to high teen IRR return on this investment highly attractive. 
Despite increased global uncertainties, we remain very comfortable with our current gross leverage ratio of 3.3x, given both our high degree of confidence and our free cash flow growth forecast as well as our robust 15% and growing free cash flow to debt yield. 
Additionally, OWN's free cash flow, while not included in our operating results, continues to accelerate and supports our capital structure. We retain a lot of flexibility around capital allocation and are highly committed to remaining an investment-grade rated company. 
Importantly, we are well within the financial ratios prescribed by all 3 rating agencies for our current investment-grade BBB- debt rating. 
For the full year 2016, despite the anticipated difficult third quarter, I am very pleased, as previously mentioned, to raise our guidance for adjusted EPS from high teens to at least 20-plus percent. At the same time, we are reiterating our guidance for constant-currency free cash flow growth of at least high teens as well as our commitment to driving solid, constant-currency margin expansion. 
Importantly, today, we are also increasing our 2015 through 2018 3-year constant-currency adjusted EPS and free cash flow growth CAGRs from the low double-digit guidance we outlined at our Investor Day last September to now growing at least low teens or better. Even taking into account uncertain global ad and media market dynamics, we are able to very confidently today raise these 3-year financial growth commitments given our increased visibility in 3 specific areas. First, our global affiliate growth rates, which make up 50% of our revenue base given our continued success in executing strong affiliate deals around the world with sustained pricing escalators. Second, with the restructuring efforts already completed, we have made significant progress in controlling our SG&A cost base and therefore slowing our total cost growth profile. And finally, our book and cash tax rates continue to trend down and are much more favorable than we had expected last September. 
Lastly, I want to update the expected year-over-year foreign exchange impact on our full year reported results. Thanks to our hedging strategy, the expected FX impact on our cash flows has not changed much since our last call despite recent weaker currencies in the U.K. and Europe. Assuming current spot rates stay constant for the rest of the year, FX is now expected to reduce our constant-currency revenues by $150 million to $160 million and our constant currency adjusted OIBDA by $80 million to $90 million. We also now expect a positive FX impact to adjusted EPS of $0.02 to $0.06 due to the net effect of this year's adjusted OIBDA impact and the year-over-year change in the below-the-line FX impact. 
In closing, I'm extremely pleased with Discovery's progress in the first half of 2016 and our outlook for the rest of the year. I remain extremely optimistic about our evolving global portfolio of well-loved brands in over 220 countries around the world, our optionality given our ownership and content and flexible cost structures and our overall financial and operating momentum.

Thanks, Kannan. So look, I think our company has really -- if look at where we were 3 years ago, 3.5 years ago with the beginning of a cycle of all of our deals coming up with distributors here in the U.S. and around the world and mostly our IP being nonfiction, we really -- we made a strategic decision that we were going to invest more in content. We were going to focus our brands to be really around tribes or super fans, get Discovery back on brand, science. We've driven Oprah to be #1 for African-American women, but we also felt that we needed to grow our IP to have strength to really drive our long-term affiliate fees in an aggressive way. And we had said all along that sports was a real lag mover that a lot of what you saw with ESPN in the '90s is the way we see the sports market. And the way that you saw the kid's market in the '90s is the way that we saw Brazil. So we've emerged now with much stronger IP, and we're spending more for it in Europe on the sports side, but we've been very disciplined around it. Almost all of our deals have been low-single or mid-single increases, and we've said we will be profitable on Eurosport with our sports bets. On top of that, we have the ability to sell that same sports IP to other platforms. As you go to Latin America, we have invested more in IP, but scripts never went down to Latin America. So we have the a #2 or 3 channel for women in Latin America, which is Home & Health. So that's the equivalent of home food and health down there, and we also invested in kids IP. And so as we look at ourselves today, we now have made most of our pivot. We don't need more sports content in Europe. We can be opportunistic. We have 3 sports channels in each country. We've been able to get big step-ups and better than double-digit increases. And you see our affiliate fees now growing double digit in -- outside the U.S. You can see that accelerate even further in Europe. And we're finding that having kids as well as a great female content, together with Discovery being #1 in most markets, is giving us a lot more strength in Latin America. And so our cost structure is really stabilized here in the U.S. We have Oprah working. We have Discovery #1 in the U.S., and we have our channels on brand. And I think we've basically stabilized in Latin America and in Europe because we have enough sports IP now, we think, to go directly to consumers to service all platforms, whether it be the phone guys or whether it be satellite providers or content or going directly ourselves. So I think we're in much better position with real long-cycle sustainability on our affiliate domestically and internationally. And when I look at our bouquet of IP, we like our hand. And it's important for us now to get that kids IP, to get Discovery, which was last 2 weeks ago determined to be the #1 channel that people in America would want as a channel over the top to take advantage of our brands and our IP on other platforms, which would be a cherry on top."

After Rio, we'll get the rings and the Olympic library, and we'll be in business with the IOC throughout Europe for the next 4 Olympic Games, and I'm heading over to Rio tomorrow. Most of the rights we've gotten are in the 6- to 8-year range, and we have gotten all of our rights on all platforms. 4 years is shorter than we would like, but having 4 years start in '17 we think is attractive. And we don't need the Bundesliga on renewal. Right now, we have -- we're the leader in tennis. We have all the Winter Sports. We have track and field. We have cycling, and we have MotoGP in all German-speaking countries. And so getting the Bundesliga is, we think for us, kind of a real jump-start, and it allows us to play a lot of the games in terms of mobile and other providers that we think could be quite attractive, and we can learn a lot from it. We don't have any affiliate deals right now that are dependent on that, and we will be charging independently for the Bundesliga. So it will be a separate piece sort of the way -- the way it's been done here in the U.S. So for us, it's really a one-off. It's an ability to get the equivalent of Monday Night Football to go into a very strong market and to take advantage of all the strong IP we have. And the fact that this is the most competitive market in all of Europe, not just in terms of having a good advertising play, but you have a number of mobile players in that market. You have some very strong cable guys competing, and on top of that, you have Sky Deutschland fighting. And so there is a significant amount of interest in getting -- as I said before, one, there is no requirements, governmental requirements that will restrict us from offering certain things exclusive, certain sports exclusive. We did it in France with Volore [ph], and so we can make this available for everyone. We can make some of our sports exclusive. We can emerge with an exclusive deal for some of the Bundesliga games. So it just gives us a lot of vitality, and it takes us through '21, and then we'll see what happens. We do not need it."

It's in the double-digit profitability range, and we've said that we will keep it profitable.

But the way that we're doing those deals is we're packaging Eurosport together with our 10 or 12 channels in each country, and that's where you see the 10% affiliate growth. That's not driven by subscriber growth. There hasn't been increased fees generically paid by distributors in Eastern Europe and Western Europe. We've been getting significant step-ups and long-term sustainable growth rates because of the overall package. And on top of that, we have the Olympics, which we said was going to be profitable.

We hired Paul Guyardo, who worked for Barry Diller and ran his new media and marketing operation. And he's now our Chief Commercial Officer, and he has deployed Discovery GO here in the U.S. And it isn't -- at this point, it isn't deployed on all the cable systems. It's about -- it's deployed to about 30 million cable homes in the U.S., but the -- it's an authenticated app. It's all 14 of our channels, and we're learning a ton. One is about 60% of the viewership on Discovery GO is in the 15- to 25-age demographics, so a very young demographic is watching our content. Our female content is a big surprise. It's doing exceptionally well. We really thought it was going to be mostly our male content, which research has always shown that people love Discovery. They love Velocity. And so we've hired Paul. We're going to roll that out by the end of the year probably everywhere in the U.S., and I think that will be a helper to us in terms of economics. But we're also getting to see what are people watching when they could watch anything. In Europe, we're learning a fair amount on our Eurosport app. Right now, our Eurosport app is everything. And we're finding that we have significant churn. But when we're talking to customers, we're finding that they came in for the French Open, and then they the left. And then they came in for the U.S. Open and they left, that they came in for Tour de France and they left. And so we've hired Mike Lang, who was Head of Development and Strategy for Rupert and Chernin. He also ran MGM. He was one of the architects of creating Hulu. And he's moved to London, and he built the direct -- building the direct-to-consumer team. And we're making some announcements, where we've hired some very strong people, and it's an independent operation that will be driving our Eurosport app and all the great IP that we have. And one of the things that we're learning is that it may be that these niches that getting a season's pass for tennis, where you get all the tennis majors; a season's pass for cycling, you get all the cycling; season's pass for Winter Sports. There are some research that's showing that this is -- that, that might be a more interesting product, and so we're doing a lot of research. Because there's 55 countries in Europe, we -- in the French Open, we offered it 5 or 6 different ways, and we're now evaluating where we were stronger, where we were weaker, where was there more or less churn. So we're felling quite good about it, especially because our cost of IP for our direct-to-consumer business is 0 because we own all of it. And the fact that we now own so much strong IP I think works well for us. And so the final thing I would say is that when we look at Discovery and we look at science and we look at the auto category with Velocity, which around the world is called Turbo or DMAX, we're looking very hard at whether we create things like a Science Club for $2.99. We already have more science content than anyone in the world. And Guyardo and Lang are looking at creating a Science Club for $2.99 or $3.99, and you get that app, and you get all the science and STEM content, and you get it any language around the world. Or we can do that with animals on Animal Planet or we can do that with some of the sub-niches on Discovery. Maybe one of the most interesting pieces of data we got is we started pushing -- we're the leader with Eurosport.com online. We started to push a new app. Instead of going to Eurosport.com, you have your own app in your phone. We already have 17 million people that have downloaded and are regular users of that app. And so that is for free, but that becomes a group that we now get to talk to as we want to find out what they want when we want up-convert them to pay. So we got a whole lot to learn. We got 2 fantastic leaders in the company that are really in the marketing and direct-to-consumer business. And I think you'll be hearing a lot over the next years. If we can make this work, you're going to see huge -- I think huge growth, and I think you guys will give us a lot of credit for it because it's the -- it's kind of the next generation of our IP. Finally, on All3, it's a great partnership with Mike Fries and us. We own it 50-50. We have a fair amount of scripted content in there. and the thing that differentiates All3 from a lot of the production companies that are primarily U.S. is that you could do deals in Europe where you hold on to the digital rights or you get the digital rights back in a year, 2 years or 3 years. So we see that as a profitable business that we can continue to grow and scale up. But ultimately, those digital rights are rights that we could use on Dplay across Europe that Mike could use on Liberty Global together with our content. And we view it as a profitable content business but in IP form that could really generate more value for us in the aftermarket of mobile and direct to consumer as well as working with Mike and providing a better environment for Liberty Global customers."

As you know, we called our signal on 3 occasions in the last 6 months, so it was a cultural change of -- not only is our IP better, but we're going to stand up for the value of our content, and that's reverberated in Asia as well. The other piece that's helping our affiliate line, which I think has more sustainable opportunity for us, is that more and more content players want some exclusive content in order to decommoditize their platforms. So whether it's a mobile player or whether it's a satellite operator or whether it's a cable operator in a particular market, more and more they want some exclusive content, so that when you buy their service, you get something you don't get anywhere else. And we've been able to take advantage of that with BeIN in the Middle East and OCN (sic) [ OSN ]. So we did our full package of services in the Middle East, and then we offered some extra content to BeIN and some extra content to OSN. That was all incremental, and that's exclusive content. We have a huge library. We're able to -- we did the same thing with Volore [ph] in France. And so more and more we're having discussions where we provide our basic services into the marketplace. But then because we have a real opportunity, we could just create a kid's Science Channel. We can create a male channel very quickly in a market. We can launch another female channel. We could launch a young female channel, and we can do it at very low cost with our library. So that's the -- that's one of the things that's been helping to drive it. We can't -- we don't comment specifically with respect to Sky or any of the other players in the marketplace in terms of when their deals are coming up or what the status is."

And look, on the affiliate line, no question that our pricing escalators certainly reflect the 8-plus percent growth that we're now at. The question is you all can model this yourselves is what would happen obviously with the sub universes and what those declines may or may not be. And again, a lot of our penetration rights protect us. But clearly, the pricing escalators and other deals we've done reflect that sustainability of growth."

For -- I mentioned this in my comments. But when you look at 50% of our revenue being long cycle, it's -- for us, I think, we've worked really hard over the last 3.5 to 4 years to get significant increases, and it's paying real dividends for us now.",337,"Yes. For -- I mentioned this in my comments. But when you look at 50% of our revenue being long cycle, it's -- for us, I think, we've worked really hard over the last 3.5 to 4 years to get significant increases, and it's paying real dividends for us now. In an environment where the universe declines, we're still growing very, very healthy, and we will, even if universe declines increase. In markets where there weren't increases, we fought to get the increases in Latin America and Europe. And we sit now with 50% of our revenue very strong, almost like a bond. And so if you have 50% of our revenue growing at 8%, 9% or 10%, then the question is what do we do with our IP and our existing platforms? And what happens to the advertising market? If we grow 2%, then maybe we're a 5% growth business. If we can get our -- if we can grow around the world 5%, then we're a 7% -- 6% or 7% or 8% growth business. If the advertising market or we do a better job programming our channels and we can get advertising around the world up to 8% or 9%, then we're double-digit growth business. And so I think we are really going to focus in now. We've done a really good job on focusing our brands. We have done a good job of getting our IP strategy in place with kids in Latin America and sports in Europe. And in Asia now, we have sports and kids at a much lower cost. But the incremental on top is if we can now create extra revenue by going to other platforms, that's all incremental. And so we're going to spend a lot more time on the other 50%, which right now is ad sales and viewership share of all of our brands, as well as taking all of our IP to every other platform in every market in the world to get more dollars."

Shark Week was down this year, was still the number -- maybe fourth most successful Shark Week, but we think it should be most -- much better. We got it to a whole different level in the last 2 years, and it dropped off. Part of that I think is we made a mistake. We moved it too early. We did it for 2 reasons. One, we wanted to get out of the way of the Olympics; and two, we thought it could be helpful to us to align with the July 4th weekend. But I think in retrospect, doing a lot of the research, I think that it was too early, that there were a lot of people still working. And when we've done it in August, we get a huge boost in day and late night because people are just hanging out, and the kids are -- it's kind of the dog days of summer. So I think you'll see next year, it will be going back into late July or early August where we found the most success. The only -- one other thing I would say about the overall ratings in advertising market. Advertising market feels strong. Scatter is better than double digit above last year. The volume is quite good. We have been hurt in the U.S. by the strength of the news networks. They were up almost 100%. The lot of that -- a lot of the viewership that's going for those networks is coming from some of our channels. Discovery is still the #1 channel in America for men, but there's no question that both our male and female channels are getting hurt a little bit by that. So we're looking forward to the Olympics being over and early November for the elections to be over because we think we have a good hand with our brands and a good hand with our channels. In terms of longer term, we really -- we can't predict. I would say we took some more money because the pricing was quite good. We were able to get more dollars into some -- and better pricing into some of our more successful channels like ID. It's broken through now and is a top 3 or 4 channel in America for women, and it's #1 in daytime and late night. We were able to do a lot better with that. And Guyardo has -- working with Abbruzese has done, I think, a good job of leveraging some money into digital, which should show up as incremental in value next year. Scatter right now is strong. I think the biggest narrative that's changed and I don't know how long it will change is that TV is a pretty good place to move product for advertisers. And a number of advertisers moved to digital, and they weren't able to move as much product, and they weren't able to get the kind of metrics that they were comfortable with. And so more money has moved back to TV. And the ability through things like X1, the ability by -- through working with a number of the data services to really get better quantification for who's watching and target advertising on television is improving as well as TV Everywhere getting a little bit better. So overall, I think right now there's some momentum that TV is a pretty good place, a more favorable place to move money, more sustainable, more dependable. I think over time digital is probably going to make more of a comeback, but that whole in vogue of digital has, I think, worn off a little bit, and those that went in too hard I think got hurt a little bit. So for now it's good. We can't really make any long-term predictions, but we're certainly way ahead of where we thought it would be."

The -- Discovery GO, right, we're talking about an authenticated app, where we're working together with the distributors. So we have TV Everywhere, which we now have deployed everywhere possible, and we have our own authenticated app, which allows us to get incremental advertising but also reach a very strong Millennial population, so our CPMs on that are quite good. Our viewing globally is up. One of the things that it's a little bit of a tale of 2 cities. Northern Europe is a challenge. It's a -- it's been a challenge for the last year, and it continues to be a challenge. Advertising was actually down in Northern Europe. If you took Northern Europe out, we were double-digit growth everywhere else in the world. And so we are finding that Northern Europe through very high penetration of high-speed, very expensive cable, high penetration of HBO and of Netflix and a very strong appeal of U.S. content with a high English-speaking population that loves the U.S. stuff, that it is having a significant impact on viewership in Northern Europe. SBS has been a good transaction for us. It's a free cash flow machine. It's been very efficient in terms of the price we bought it at and the synergy we got. But of all markets around the world, it seems to be the one that has the most challenge in terms of viewership on traditional platforms. The good news is it doesn't feel at all like a contagion. In fact, Netflix penetration and SVOD penetration outside of Northern Europe is much lower than everybody thought. Local content is working more -- working better for those players throughout most of Western Europe and Latin America. So our viewership overall is up. It's up in the mid-single range, and we're fighting very difficult economies around the world. I mean, you have almost every country in either Latin America or Europe either flat or down, and advertising tends to follow GDP. The reason that we're still growing is that our share is growing, and we have some efficiency, and we've been able to get some -- a little bit of market power as we've gotten bigger. But we don't see the economies improving anytime soon, and we don't see Northern Europe improving anytime soon. But the rest of the market feels rather healthy to us, and our ability to continue to get double digit feels sustainable."

I'm pleased to join you this morning during a very exciting time for the media industry. As the industry continues to evolve in an increasingly rapid pace, we know that powerful and loved content is still king. 
Discovery remains focused on diversifying and augmenting the value of our global content portfolio of strong brands and franchises in over 220 markets around the world.
We have continued to strengthen our traditional pay-TV dual revenue streams, while investing to drive additional value on PayTV and across new digital platforms. 
Since our last call, we've made some key strategic investments. We have seen expected, but still difficult, third quarter advertising results, in part due to the Olympics.
We've completed a major U.S. distribution deal and we've watched a continuation of strong trends in distribution revenue, which are 50% of our U.S. and 50% of our international businesses.
That long cycle domestic and international revenue mix makes Discovery unlike any other U.S.-based multichannel network company.
Today, I want to talk about 5 major developments since our last earnings call: our new CFO; 2 strategic investments; the financial foundation provided by our large distribution deals; and gains in our digital rollout that bring increased focus on our digital monetization.
First, as you know, Gunner Withenfelds [ph] will join us early next year as CFO. Andy Warren has graciously agreed to extend his contract term to ensure a smooth transition of CFO responsibilities. And a big thank you for that Andy, and for all of your service -- great service over the past 5 years. 
Gunner's experience as CFO of publicly-traded Proceben [ph] is perfectly aligned with Discovery's future and growth portfolio. Proceben, one of Europe's major media companies, operates multiple broadcast and cable networks and is also Germany's leading online video marketer. We are excited to bring Gunner onto the team as Discovery continues our rapid growth and diversification in new content and digital platforms around the world.
Second, is a key strategic partnership for Europe. Today, I'm extremely pleased to announce that Discovery and MLB Advanced Media have created a joint venture to form BAMTech Europe. This platform partnership leverages Eurosport, the dominant player in sports rights across Europe with unparalleled reach and BAMTech's world-class digital technology service.
Discovery will remain 100% owner of Eurosport and all of its IP as well as its digital platforms.
This partnership will greatly accelerate Eurosport's access to over 700 million people in Europe, gaining just 1% of the European population to subscribe to the Eurosport Player, with equal [ph] 7 million subscribers.
BAMTech's state of the art back-end video platform and service will be implemented in 2017 across all of Eurosport's digital products, which today include Eurosport.com, the continent's #1 sports new website, with 60 million users a month; and the Eurosport Player, what we call our sports Netflix, the leading subscription-based OTT sports platform across Europe, giving fans an all-access pass, any time and on any device in 52 countries.
In addition, we will have access to select ML BAM content in Europe for direct-to-consumer distribution.
BAMTech Europe also will work with a broad set of sports and entertainment content owners, broadcasters and OTT platforms and to enhance their digital capabilities, reach and performance across the continent.
Third is an investment that changed our content and IP mix and helped Discovery grow into a leader in short form and mobile content for the next decade. 
Last month, we announced that we will be investing $100 million in entering into a strategic partnership to create a new media holding company called Group Nine Media.
We will contribute 2 of our digital assets, Seeker [ph] and SourceFed Studios, digital networks and we'll combine them with independent digital networks, 3 List [ph] , Now This, which is the #1 video news publisher on Facebook, the Dodo [ph] as well as 2 SnapChat channels that belong to the Now This portfolio.
With 3.5 billion monthly video views across all of these millennial-focused brands, Group Nine will be a top 5 digital-first content and social video company on day 1, with a best-in-class leadership team, tremendous brands, reach and scale. We will own 39% of Group Nine, and importantly, we will have the option to acquire full ownership in the future.
Fourth is another big distribution agreement. We completed a successful renegotiation with AT&T DIRECTV so we will continue to reach their 25 million subscribers in the U.S. at very favorable rates. 
The DIRECTV agreement is in line with our other recent deals. This long-term contract not only help secure our leader distribution growth, but it also means discovers content will be available across all DIRECTV platforms on a favorable basis, including the soon-to-be launched OTT DIRECTV Now streaming product. 
The importance of long-term international and domestic distribution deals like our recent deals with DIRECTV, Liberty Global and Telenor cannot be overstated. 
In the U.S. with the successful completion of our DIRECTV deal, we won't have another major renewal until the end of next year. Internationally, while there were some onetime items last year that impact third quarter growth, we expect double-digit underlying organic growth for the next few years.
As our stronger premium content portfolio that now includes leadership and sports in Europe, it is translating into a much stronger price increases as deals are renewed. There is no question that the addition of sports and the upcoming Olympics to our nonfiction portfolio in Europe is bolstering our profile with distributors and reinforcing the must-have nature of our suite of brands. 
Half of our total company revenues come from these agreements. And our built-in price escalators provide a solid, stable foundation of growth, even as advertising fluctuates. This stability is what gives us of the optionality to monetize our content on existing and emerging platforms and is further evidence of the strength of our brands and our content.
Two recent examples of our brands resonating with audiences are OWN [ph] and ID.
With new hits like Queen Sugar and Greenleaf, a strong Saturday night and Tyler Perry [ph] programming continued to deliver audiences. OWN is the #1 network for African-American women in America and prime delivery is up 12%, year-to-date.  And for a few weeks this quarter, OWN was a top 10 network in America for women. 
ID continued to score big in the third quarter. Ranking as the #1 network for women in August, September and October, #1. 
John Binet [ph], an American mystery story, is this year's best new nonfiction cable series, and ID's best ever across demos. And this series also drew record audiences in the U.K. and ID's international viewership growth was up double digits, yet again.
The fifth topic I want to discuss is our digital strategy. Our global digital strategy is pretty simple, get our own content to as many people as possible across all screens and platforms and fill in with digital only content as needed. 
A key tenet of our digital strategy and driving incremental revenue growth is TV Everywhere. In Latin America, our kids digital product continues to gain traction, with Discovery Kids Play, now in front of over 40 million households. 
In the U.S., Paul Guyardo and team have done a great job with the recent launch of our authenticated network apps and websites, which now give cable and satellite customers the ability to watch our longform content anytime, anywhere and on practically any device.
We've made real significant progress with our authenticated offering in this past year. A year ago, our TV Everywhere footprint was in just over 20% of the U.S. Today, our footprint covers over 70% of the country. 
The national launch of our TV Everywhere apps that we call Go, occurred on August 9. It's early days, but we have already learned a lot and initial results are quite promising.
First, 50% of the streams are coming from 18 to 34 -year-olds. This gives us confidence that our content is relevant to a younger audience. We just had to put it on a different platform to freedom to consume it. 
Second, we are seeing strong pricing. CPMs for Go are at a big premium versus our Linear Nets [ph], largely because the length of view is almost an hour and the Millennial delivery is so strong.
Third, consumption patterns appear to be 60% recent episodes and 40% older titles. Which is a strong testament to our deep, rich library and the fact that the consumers are seeking out our programming, even over a week after it's aired. 
Finally, our only real material challenge is our authentication rate, which is a common challenge for all programmers and distributors.
But we are working with our distribution partners to address it. For example, we've just launched a home-based authentication with Comcast, which removes a huge barrier by eliminating the password requirement on sign in and roadmaps to do the same with other MBPDs [ph] are in the works.
We also continue to make strides in Europe. In some markets of Europe, the pay television penetration is lower than in mature markets. And that provides new digital opportunities to leverage the investments we have been making in sports rights beyond our linear business. But the 320 million homes in Europe, 160 million homes currently have Eurosport, but 160 million homes currently do not have access to Eurosport on TV, probably because they are non-pay TV households.
That 160 million is more than all the households in the U.S. For future digital delivery, there are nearly 200 million wired broadband subscriptions and nearly $600 million mobile data subscriptions across Europe, more than all the fixed and wireless data subs in the U.S. Together, making Europe the most important continent for sports growth and opportunity, over-the-top.
So there are clearly 2 roots to sports expansion in Europe: linear and digital, and we are attacking both.
To help drive our Eurosport Digital effort, I've asked Paul Guyardo to now oversee Eurosport Digital businesses. Paul worked with Barry Diller for many years at HSN, and worked at DIRECTV, where Paul and his subscriber-acquisition team built DIRECTV from 15 million subs to over 20 million subs.
Following the successful launch of our Go apps in the U.S, Paul will take his skills to Eurosport Digital operations. And we're building a world-class team with new expertise to manage our direct-to-consumer business out of London. 
We recently hired Ralph Rivera to be the Managing Director of Eurosport Digital, and he will take over the day-to-day operations. Ralph joins us from the BBC, where he was responsible for all of the BBC's digital media services, leading the implementation and operation of BBC iPlayer, as it grew by over 300%. And not coincidentally, he delivered BBC's first truly digital Olympic Games for London in 2012, providing solid, in-house expertise as we get access to the Olympic Rings on January 1 of next year.
Today, we own the content for our linear businesses, and we have the right to use that content to build our global, digital businesses. 
As I've told many of you, because we own a sports content for both senior and digital, I've begun to think of this as an opportunity to build a Netflix for sports in Europe. 
We are also exploring, creating services for science, in the auto space and for other niche on the U.S. and around the world. 
Additional direct-to-consumer opportunities, so our super fans can access our content, where they want on whatever device, whenever they want. 
So in closing, we continue to secure important, long-term distribution deals and invest in key personnel to support global growth across all platforms to assure that Discovery Communications continues to evolve globally and digitally, way beyond the way the traditional U.S.-based multichannel network company can evolve.
And now I'll turn the call over to Andy."

Thank you for joining us today.

Thank you for joining us today. As expected, and previously communicated, our third quarter was challenging, but our financial and operating trends in the fourth quarter are much better and our robust full year outlook is still very much intact. 
Importantly, as David mentioned, media landscape is rapidly changing, Discovery's global content portfolio of well-loved and increasingly-diversified brands makes us uniquely well-positioned for long-term growth. 
Half of our revenue base is derived from affiliate, which is well-positioned for strong and sustained growth, given a multiyear nature of our contracts, with built in price escalators. We also remain highly focused on controlling our non-content operating cost growth, while thoughtfully investing in content and OTT platforms.
As we have consistently highlighted, 2 of our most critical competitive advantages are our flexible cost structures and the fact that we own or control the vast majority of our content across all global platforms. These advantages give us tremendous flexibility and optionality and allow us to fully maximize our long-term profit growth.
Now let's dive into our third quarter results.
Excluding currency, total company revenues were up 3% and adjusted OIBDA grew 1%. 
Net income, available to Discovery Communications of $290 million decreased versus the third quarter a year ago, primarily due to a $50 million or $0.08 per share noncash after-tax write-down of our Lionsgate's equity position.
Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter was $0.36 and adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.40, down 15% versus last year's third quarter.
Excluding the $0.08 impact from this onetime Lionsgate write-down, third quarter adjusted EPS would have been $0.48, up slightly year-over-year.
Excluding both, negative currency impacts, as well as a Lionsgate write-down, adjusted EPS was up 5% from the third quarter and up fully 18% for the year-to-date.
Third quarter free cash flow increased 75% to $410 million, primarily due to lower cash taxes and improved working capital turns. Impressively, constant currency free cash flow increased 112% for the quarter and increased 72% for the first 9 months of the year. Our total company free cash flow growth has clearly accelerated.
Turning now to the operating units. Our U.S. network revenues were up 2%, as our 7% affiliate growth was offset by a 3% decline in advertising growth, which was fully  expected due to the Olympics as well as the timing of Shark Week this year.
Excluding the Olympic impact, U.S. advertising would have been up low single digits.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect fourth quarter advertising to be flat after taking into account the small, approximately 50-basis-point impact from the consolidation of our Discovery Digital Networks relating to our recently announced Group Nine deal.
Our domestic distribution revenues were up 7%, while total portfolio subs again, declined almost 2% versus the third quarter of last year. We continue to benefit from the significantly higher locked-in rate increases we've solidified in all of our recent affiliate deals, including our new deal with DIRECTV. 
We are extremely pleased with the outcome of this latest renewal, which was completed at very favorable rates and in line with our other strong U.S. affiliate deals.
The DIRECTV renewal was truly a win-win as our content will be available across all DIRECTV platforms, including their soon-to-be-launched OTT DIRECTV Now streaming product.
Domestic operating expenses in the quarter were actually down, 1% as we remain laser focused on controlling our non-content cost growth, resulting in 3% adjusted OIBDA growth and 100 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion to 58%.  Total domestic operating expenses are expected to be flat to down again in the fourth quarter. 
Turning now to our international operations. The 3Q comps to last year are simpler, as there are no major acquisitions or divestitures to normalize. So my following comments will refer to our organic results, which need to only exclude currency impacts. 
International organic revenues increased 2%, with distribution revenues up, 8% and advertising revenues down, 2%. Our 8% affiliate revenue growth was primarily due to higher affiliate rates in Latin America, CEMEA  [ph] and in Northern Europe where we have been successful in leveraging our expanded content portfolio that now includes sports to drive higher contracted pricing step-ups, but was partially offset by a couple of onetime items in Europe and Asia in the third quarter of last year.
We still expect constant currency distribution growth over the next several years to be up at least low double digits, as we continue to benefit from our stronger, more diversified portfolio of networks and higher contracted price escalators.
Turning to our third quarter national advertising, overall results were meaningfully impacted by the Olympics and while we benefited from higher volumes in Southern Europe and higher pricing and volumes in CEMEA, growth in these markets was more than offset by declines in Northern Europe, our largest advertising region.
Northern Europe was clearly heavily impacted by Brexit and other macro-related weaknesses as well as softer ratings at our female skewing networks.  Trends, however, are improving in the fourth quarter, with all regions seeing improved results. And therefore, we expect fourth quarter year-over-year advertising growth to improve by several hundred basis points versus this third quarter's growth rate.
International operating expenses grew 6% in the third quarter, primarily due to higher sports content and production costs. The total international cost growth will flow in the fourth quarter.
Now taking a look at share repurchases. In the third quarter, we repurchased a total of $374 million worth of shares, and we have repurchased $1.5 billion of stock over the last 4 quarters as we committed to on last year's third quarter call.
We now have spent a total of $7.8 billion buying back shares as we began our buyback program at the end of 2010. On a stock split-adjusted basis, we have now reduced our gross outstanding share count by 34% and by 30% net of employee equity awards.
We were still very comfortable with our current gross leverage ratio of 3.3x, given both our high degree of confidence and our free cash flow, growth forecast as well as our robust 16% [ph] and growing free cash flow to debt yield. We have significant flexibility around our deployment of capital and are extremely committed to remaining an investment-grade rated company.
Very importantly, we are well within the financial ratios prescribed by all 3 rating agencies to maintain our current investment-grade debt rating. 
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we will continue our share repurchases, so our available capital for buybacks will be impacted by the $100 million investment in Group Nine, but 4Q share repurchases will not be impacted by the BAMTech Europe deal due to its immaterial investment size.
Now let's review our forward-looking guidance. For full year 2016, we still expect constant currency free cash flow to grow in the high teen range and constant currency adjusted EPS, excluding the Lionsgate write down, to grow at least 20%. 
We are also reiterating our 2015 to 2018 3-year guidance of constant currency adjusted EPS and free cash flow growth CAGRs [ph] , both growing at least low teens or better.
I also want to update the expected year-over-year foreign exchange impact on our full year operating results. 
Thanks to our effective hedging strategy, the expected year-over-year FX impact on our financials has not changed since our last call, despite some of our major currencies, especially the pound, recently weakening. 
Assuming current spot rates stay constant for the rest of the year, FX is still expected to reduce our constant currency revenues by $150 million to $160 million, and our constant currency adjusted OIBDA by $80 million to $90 million. 
In addition, we still expect a positive FX impact to adjusted EPS of $0.02 to $0.06, due to net effect of this year's adjusted OIBDA impact and the year-over-year change in the below the line FX impact.
In closing, as I near the end of my tenure in Discovery, I'm extremely optimistic about Discovery's current global content portfolio, optionality given our ownership of content and flexible cost structures and our overall financial and operating momentum. 
Now David and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have."

Both Showtime and HBO were also doing some nonfiction and documentaries. And so we don't really see them as a competitor with our brands. Our focus really has been to get -- tighten up our brands, but focus more on nourishing our audiences so that we have super fans and we could be reaching them and build a steady and longer viewership on each of our brands around the world. And we've seen that with Discovery outside the U.S. which is continuing to grow globally. ID which is breaking out, it's growing 10% this year, domestically. And more than that outside the U.S. as well as Oprah and Science and Animal Planet.

BAMTech and getting it to business with Bob Bowman is a big piece of that in the middle ware perspective as well as access to some additional IP through them. But joint venturing with the BAMTech and sharing on investing in a tech platform that we build out throughout Europe, it gives us the best-in-class platform that can hold all the streams and provide a very positive consumer interface, which we think is an improvement over what we have today. And addition, we have Ralph Rivera, who ran the iPlayer, and that's sort of the how do we aggregate all the content and how do we offer it? Right now, we're offering it as a broad offering. Ralph is looking at subdividing that to specialty groups. We now have all the majors in tennis, we have all the cycling, we have all the winter sports that we start to break that out as the seasons passes and we started to experiment with that and Ralph will create the content working with Paul. But Paul's job at DIRECTV was subscriber acquisition and marketing job. And that's what he did for ages and, that's what he did at DIRECTV. He had a team of over 300 people that drove DIRECTV from 15 million subscribers to 20 million. And he had dashboards that related to customer service, reducing churn, subscriber acquisition, how do you -- where do you go, what are the affinity groups that you go and how do you attack those groups at what pricing. And so we have started to hire a significant number of people. We made the decision to put them in London, because we view this group as a disruptive group. So rather than have our existing team that's doing a world-class building Eurosport and acquiring that IP, so we have our 3 Eurosport channels across all of Europe, and we Eurosport.com that Peter Hutton and his team is running and that is profitable and we've been able to get great IP. Now we have our BAMTech middleware together whether IP and their know-how, we put it on top of that one of the best guys in the industry with you to experience and offering content consumers. And then Paul, on top of all of it, is responsible to drive it. And look, there is no -- when you think about Europe, with almost 700 million people and only 50% pay penetration, there's huge opportunity here, we think, to go over-the-top. There's 50% that aren't getting any of Eurosport content at all. And then, even when we're issuing Eurosport content on our channels, we have so much IP that a huge amount is now being seen. And so that will be an attack, our sport Netflix in Europe is something that we are taking seriously, and we see that as a disruptive, and we think it could be a huge value creator. But we think it's just the beginning, because when we look at all of our IP now, we've spent the last 4 years building our content, owning it on all platforms and whether it's Science, whether it's Auto, whether it's African-American, we think that there's an opportunity with all that content paid for, to go direct-to-consumer, either for a fee or for free, and build additional economics and some additional bite of the apple."

And each of these channels are a bit -- at times are a bit of challenged. Oprah was a challenge for us, the OWN Network, and now it's a top 10 or 12 network in America, and it's #1 for African-Americans. For a period of time, ID, 1.5 years ago was stall. And Henry and his team really focused on what ID how do we nourish that audience and now it's back on track and growing in a meaningful way and it's #1 for women.

But I'd say that, look, we had a very good equitable argument when we went into our renewals a few years ago. When we did the deals, 8 years ago, 7 years ago, 5 years ago, we were getting about 5% or 6% share, we were getting about 4% or 5% of the money. Our share went up to 12% or 13%. We launched ID. It became #1 for women. We launched OWN and it was successful. Discovery came back to being #1. And we invested a lot more in content. So when we went out to all the distributors, we were able to get a significant step up and double-digit increases. And now we are done with all of our deals and that's true across the board. We were also able to secure good protection for our channels against tearing. And production that we were going to get carried in a meaningful way in any offering. And it helps us that our Top 5 or 6 channels represent about 85% or 87% of the money. Exactly what happens with DIRECTV Now and where that growth comes from? We don't see that as being an issue. We see it as being an opportunity. There's a lot of people that probably were unable to afford the traditional DIRECTV product. They may buy that $35 product. And if they do, we're going to have a lot of channels on there. Each of those channels are very strong brands, and we've seen in markets like Brazil and Mexico and in many of the markets in Europe where we only have half of our channels carry. If we can preserve most of the economics, the viewership on those channels growth brands grow. And so we are rooting for DIRECTV with now. We're also think that creates a nice market Place driver. So the other distributors in the market, decide to do something like that, the biggest impediment right now is the prize of cable in the U.S. It something like we don't see in many markets around the world. And its mostly driven by high sports fees. And so the biggest issue that we have in Northern Europe which is where the few markets where cable TV is $100. And the result of cable being $100 is that there have been a lot of people that have gone to other services or disconnected. And that's not across all most of or Latin America. And here in the U.S., though things that steps that have stumped the growth of cable is pricing sports. So the idea that somebody can do a $35 offering, we can get most of our economics and more share, that the positive. The second thing is we've already gone directly to consumers with Discovery GO am a which is going very well so far. And as I said, 50% of the people that are spending time with Discovery GO are under 34 and about 40% are under 25. And they are watching all the commercial. And so we've already said that next year, we expect at least 1% of additional growth in ad sales because of Discovery GO. And we think it could be north of that. And we have a deep lay product in Europe, where we are also going direct-to-consumer. So her learning a lot about that and I think, you'll see all the work that we did come out what we said let's not fight for ratings. Let's fight for super fans and strength of brand that will be able to take the brand to people around the world. Now I've said it before, but we take a science product. What would a science app that's $1.99 or $2.99 when we already have it in 55 languages look like, if we could take it around the world and make it available to the over billion subscribers that currently get our content. And so we think with our content pay for, direct-to-consumer is an opportunity. But I would say that we really view the existing system is quite solid. So I think, owning great content that has super fans and being able to take that to consumers is a real opportunity for additional meaningful growth in the case in sports. It could be a huge driver for us, but the existing ecosystem around the world remained strong. And I think, it's more of what's going to be in 4, 5, and 6 years, in terms of getting directly to consumer or 7 and in the next few, where thing seems pretty stable around the world when you look at subscribers."

The answer to question around volume growth in Southern Europe, it also applies to Latin America in Eastern Europe. It's what we called the power ratio. We've talked before about the share of economics following the share of viewership. And if you look at those 2 regions, Latin America, Southern Europe and Eastern Europe, you're still seeing strong double-digit growth or because so much catch up to do, relative to economics following it viewership and share. So you'll continue to see yes talk about what some headwind in those markets, no question that the overall trend of our performance or from a macro perspective, from economics perspective it continues to be a great tailwind for us. With regard to Eurosport, look, we don't anymore split out Eurosport, not only because it's so integrated now with the rest of the business. We go to the affiliate marketplace as one company, a lot of the ad sales now, obviously, value growth on Eurosport given its new platform. We don't think of it as being a scant stand-alone entity anymore from a reporting perspective. So while margins are a little less, it's still positive, a little less given the dynamics of sports rights relative to some of the third quarter ad sales challenges that we talked about. No question the trend there is still positive. We're still seeing a growth in the topline for Eurosport related product, and we're still seeing, over the long term, profit growth and margin growth for that asset."

So when you look to Northern Europe, if you exclude that and you exclude the U.K. where Brexit has presented, real challenges in terms of the advertising market, we are seeing in Latin America and throughout Europe high single mostly double-digit growth so.

We are fighting that fight. We think we can improve it a little bit, but we can't say right now whether the -- the viewership levels on television continued to decline or something. Right now it looks like a slow steady decline up there. more so that we're seeing across most of Europe, which is contrary to what we are seeing in Latin America of meaningful breath.

And then just sort of bigger picture on domestic advertising, what are you seeing in the marketplace? Is there a budget shift to the Facebook, the Google, SnapChats going on out there? And then another one for -- a separate one for David. Also, question about getting your content closer to the consumer. The more about marketing, so you talked about Discovery GO, you reached critical mass with that. You've talked about Deep Play, the Eurosport player, does it make sense to start marketing these Digital Products like Discovery GO more aggressively? And just at a higher level, how do you think about the returns of marketing this digital products to consumers? Does it make sense at all to do it directly?

And so the market continues to be our friend and there's good volume and good pricing there. And so clearly there's a positive favor. We're also still seeing some positives from pricing as we go and we talked about the audience profile there, skewing so much younger and more female. So those are clearly still positive trends that exist to the fourth quarter. I think they -- on the negative side, one, is the deconsolidation of our digitnets due to the deal we announced where we are combining our assets to get a much bigger viewership share of. The other is the universe client and some pretty conservative view in our ratings. Clearly, there's no potential there. We're seeing some traction and we talked about ID. We talked about velocity. But we taken a pretty conservative view on ratings. And I think, we have a real chance to over deliver on that expectation but we're trying to set expectations right as we think about the next kind of 2 months."

So we feel like that's on a good track. We are really working on driving the authentication. When it comes to our sports product, we are putting in place a team that will work best in the best case is one of the things that do so with AT&T is something that I've been talking about for 1.5 years that we've been seeing. We've been seeing -- it used to be the triple play, but more and more in Europe now you're seeing the quadruple play. You're seeing wireless, broadband, multi channels in the whole. There still some fixed font, but it's much less relevant as well know. And so with that type, there comes a commoditization, and we saw it across Europe as BT start -- try to decommoditize [ph] their platform by owning special but IP, you see it with Deutsche Telecom, you see it Vodafone, you see it Telenor, you see it in Latin America. So for a long time, I've been say that, that type is getting commoditized. And when you're holding onto that type, if there's 1 or 2 guys next door that are offering the same thing, it becomes a real challenge. And it's almost a race to the bottom. And so we've seen that around the world. And the reach when that happens is IP to decommoditize the platform. And so some of the deals that we've been able to do whether it's with, whether it's discussions with the mobile guys, which is something that we're having now much more aggressively, everyone is looking for IP to attach to their pipe, to do something. And so when -- I think that the -- the positive side of AT&T is it's an affirmation that owning great IP is important. Of course, it's racism significant issues and for content owners in terms of how they're going to be carried on their platform here but point is the right deals for us in Europe or Latin America could be quite advantageous to driving this product. There is no region why this product shouldn't be driven by the mobile players across Europe. And so if you buy a particular wireless product, you can get the Eurosport Player. If you sign up for particular distributor, you can get the Eurosport Player. They can build for it. So expected over the next period of time that they'll be some bonding of product just like Netflix is now getting bundled in liberty global or bundled with other distributors that it's a way of making on offering. The differences in some of the markets in Europe, it could be exclusive that. So we could be marketing ourselves directly -- directed a consumer. We have Eurosport so people are watching the sport that they love. We could be telling them next match is on the Eurosport Player. So sign up. So we could be our own direct promotion through announce old directory which make us unique a different from that place. So we have our direct reach, and we had 10 to 12 channels in each market, where we are reaching specific demos. But then there's also we think the opportunity over time -- over the near term, over the next year or 2, once we have this best-in-class player working with a Bowman and BAMTech and we have the product that we think works because we have the IP that we think works. And we're starting to have the stupidest of become subdistrict routers for us which we think also will reduce churn in a meaningful-way because buckets on with other billing by distributors. So this idea of the could Drupal play and it spiked to be commoditized some of the pipe for people that own IP and could offer it across all the different platforms is going to be a real meaningful opportunity for growth."

So we've gone from investing $500 million in content to over $2 billion. And as opposed to just growing and defending Discovery and TLC and Animal Planet, there's a number of channels right now that are having a real impact in the U.S. and around the world that didn't exist, whether it's ID, Velocity, which we call D Max or Turbo around the world, Oprah, which didn't exist a few years ago. And so if you look at our channels, the top 6 represent 85% or 87% of the ratings and 85% or 87% of the economics. That is where our primary focus is. But we have some other niche channels that we're playing around with and they have also been a farm team for us. Some of the content that starts on those channels ends up going to our bigger networks and it's a little bit of a secret sauce for us, Survivor Man and How It's Made started out Science, and it became real strong performers on Discovery. And we're still funding that around the world. But directionally, even though we have between 10 and 12 channels, in most markets, we have 8, it represents 85% or 90% of our economics and --  or 85% or 90% of our share.

So putting this together with Thrillist, The Dodo and Now This, we get a number of things. One is we get 35 billion to 4 billion streams a month, which gives us -- makes us the#3, #4, or #5 player in the space. So already advertisers are calling us saying we like the demo that you have, would like the scale that you have, how can we do more business with you. That's number one. Two is there's an ad sales team that's now working for very strong CEO that's running the whole business, and we'll be able to take advantage of having one big sales team sell the 3.5 billion to 4 billion streams, which is a real advantage. The third is they have fantastic pay to analytics business, which is -- we were faced with a question of the we build a very big sales team? Do we build a Big Data analytics structure and how do we scale up our half a billion. So we view this is a three-part. We've got the 3.5 billion to 4 billion, so we've got scale, we have a great sales team as we picked that best and brightest of all these companies and Ben [ph] pulls it together. And the third is we've got a great data analytics structure. And that data analytics structure built Now This in the 1.5 years to be the #1 provider of news on Facebook. And they also have 2 SnapChat channels. So for us, we've got scale, we have data analytics, we have an ad sales team that we could rely on. We are more in the front of the line and we were out in San Francisco last week, with the Facebook guys and we met their transitioning their platform to video and we're in the top 2 or 3 providers of video to Facebook and we've got to work on how do we monetize that content and that's why we were out there talking to them. Our 1 and 1.5 minute videos are generating so much energy for Facebook, how do we get more value out of that? It's not in our plan right now but it's going to happen. But it does happen, which I think that eventually hopefully, it will, this -- the value of our business like this could be huge. And finally, what we pick up a stronger relationship with SnapChat when we pick up 2 channels. And so I think, for us, we now own 39% of it, we got a great leadership running it, we'll see over the next few years how it develops and it gives us great optionality and it gives us great support system. Finally, Eurosport and the whole partnership with them, that relates to sports. And we're going to going at that very hard. And remember, the reason why we think it's so compelling is that Netflix spends over $6 billion or $7 billion a year on content. We're going to be offering our sports content across Europe and our cost of content is 0 because we are already making our margins are already in the teens for Eurosport. And so this could be a very profitable business for us. If it's not that different from the cable players that we are able to build the business model on the cable and multichannel to the home and then being able to take a second bite at the apple and offer broad band without a lot of cost. So we have to prove it out, but we think we've got -- we have something quite strong. When it comes to Science or Auto, that's something we can offer globally. And we can offer it direct-to-consumer, we can offer it through distributors because we already -- we have a huge amount of that content in language, and we're just  playing that with the best way to offer it. And we're having a lot of discussions with consumers about what they like, what they like about our content and how to package it."

I'm pleased to join you this morning during a very exciting time for the media industry. As the industry continues to evolve at an increasingly rapid pace, we know that powerful and loved content is still king. Discovery remains",1949,"Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to join you this morning during a very exciting time for the media industry. As the industry continues to evolve at an increasingly rapid pace, we know that powerful and loved content is still king. 
Discovery remains focused on diversifying and augmenting the value of our global content portfolio of strong brands and franchises in over 220 markets around the world.
We have continued to strengthen our traditional pay-TV dual revenue streams, while investing to drive additional value on pay-TV and across new digital platforms. 
Since our last call, we've made some key strategic investments. We have seen expected, but still difficult, third quarter advertising results, in part due to the Olympics.
We've completed a major U.S. distribution deal and we've watched a continuation of strong trends in distribution revenue, which are 50% of our U.S. and 50% of our international businesses.
That long cycle domestic and international revenue mix makes Discovery unlike any other U.S.-based multichannel network company.
Today, I want to talk about 5 major developments since our last earnings call: our new CFO; two strategic investments; the financial foundation provided by our large distribution deals; and gains in our digital rollout that bring increased focus on our digital monetization.
First, as you know, Gunnar Wiedenfels will join us early next year as CFO. Andy Warren has graciously agreed to extend his contract term to ensure a smooth transition of CFO responsibilities. And a big thank you for that, Andy, and for all of your service -- great service over the past 5 years. 
Gunnar's experience as CFO of publicly-traded ProSieben is perfectly aligned with Discovery's future and growth portfolio. ProSieben, one of Europe's major media companies, operates multiple broadcast and cable networks and is also Germany's leading online video marketer. We are excited to bring Gunnar onto the team as Discovery continues our rapid growth and diversification in new content and digital platforms around the world.
Second, is a key strategic partnership for Europe. Today, I'm extremely pleased to announce that Discovery and MLB Advanced Media have created a joint venture to form BAMTech Europe. This platform partnership leverages Eurosport, the dominant player in sports rights across Europe with unparalleled reach and BAMTech's world-class digital technology service.
Discovery will remain 100% owner of Eurosport and all of its IP as well as its digital platforms.
This partnership will greatly accelerate Eurosport's access to over 700 million people in Europe, gaining just 1% of the European population to subscribe to the Eurosport Player, would equal 7 million subscribers.
BAMTech's state-of-the-art back-end video platform and service will be implemented in 2017 across all of Eurosport's digital products, which today include Eurosport.com, the continent's #1 sports new website, with 60 million users a month; and the Eurosport Player, what we call our sports Netflix, the leading subscription-based OTT sports platform across Europe, giving fans an all-access pass, any time and on any device in 52 countries.
In addition, we will have access to select ML BAM content in Europe for direct-to-consumer distribution.
BAMTech Europe also will work with a broad set of sports and entertainment content owners, broadcasters and OTT platforms to enhance their digital capabilities, reach and performance across the continent.
Third is an investment that changed our content and IP mix and helped Discovery grow into a leader in short form and mobile content for the next decade. 
Last month, we announced that we will be investing $100 million in entering into a strategic partnership to create a new media holding company called Group Nine Media.
We will contribute 2 of our digital assets, Seeker and SourceFed Studios, digital networks and we'll combine them with independent digital networks, Thrillist, Now This, which is the #1 video news publisher on Facebook, The Dodo as well as 2 SnapChat channels that belong to the Now This portfolio.
With 3.5 billion monthly video views across all of these millennial-focused brands, Group Nine will be a top 5 digital-first content and social video company on Day 1, with a best-in-class leadership team, tremendous brands, reach and scale. We will own 39% of Group Nine, and importantly, we have the option to acquire full ownership in the future.
Fourth is another big distribution agreement. We completed a successful renegotiation with AT&T DIRECTV, so we will continue to reach their 25 million subscribers in the U.S. at very favorable rates. 
The DIRECTV agreement is in line with our other recent deals. This long-term contract not only help secure our linear distribution growth, but it also means Discovery's content will be available across all DIRECTV platforms on a favorable basis, including the soon-to-be launched OTT DIRECTV NOW streaming product. 
The importance of long-term international and domestic distribution deals like our recent deals with DIRECTV, Liberty Global and Telenor cannot be overstated. 
In the U.S. with the successful completion of our DIRECTV deal, we won't have another major renewal until the end of next year. Internationally, while there were some onetime items last year that impact third quarter growth, we expect double-digit underlying organic growth for the next few years.
As our stronger premium content portfolio that now includes leadership in sports in Europe is translating into a much stronger price increases as deals are renewed. There is no question that the addition of sports and the upcoming Olympics to our nonfiction portfolio in Europe is bolstering our profile with distributors and reinforcing the must-have nature of our suite of brands. 
Half of our total company revenues come from these agreements. And our built-in price escalators provide a solid, stable foundation of growth, even as advertising fluctuates. This stability is what gives us of the optionality to monetize our content on existing and emerging platforms and is further evidence of the strength of our brands and our content.
Two recent examples of our brands resonating with audiences are OWN and ID.
With new hits like Queen Sugar and Greenleaf, a strong Saturday night and Tyler Perry programming continued to deliver audiences. OWN is the #1 network for African-American women in America and prime delivery is up 12%, year-to-date.  And for a few weeks this quarter, OWN was a top 10 network in America for women. 
ID continued to score big in the third quarter. Ranking as the #1 network for women in August, September and October. Number one. 
JonBenet, an American mystery story, is this year's best new nonfiction cable series, and ID's best ever across demos. And this series also drew record audiences in the U.K. and ID's international viewership growth was up double digits, yet again.
The fifth topic I want to discuss is our digital strategy. Our global digital strategy is pretty simple, get our own content to as many people as possible across all screens and platforms and fill in with digital-only content as needed. 
A key tenant of our digital strategy and driving incremental revenue growth is TV Everywhere. In Latin America, our kids digital product continues to gain traction, with Discovery Kids Play, now in front of over 40 million households. 
In the U.S., Paul Guyardo and team have done a great job with the recent launch of our authenticated network apps and websites, which now give cable and satellite customers the ability to watch our long-form content anytime, anywhere and on practically any device.
We've made real significant progress with our authenticated offering in this past year. A year ago, our TV Everywhere footprint was in just over 20% of the U.S. Today, our footprint covers over 70% of the country. 
The national launch of our TV Everywhere apps that we call GO, occurred on August 9. It's early days, but we have already learned a lot and initial results are quite promising.
First, 50% of the streams are coming from 18 to 34-year-olds. This gives us confidence that our content is relevant to a younger audience. We just had to put it on a different platform for them to consume it. 
Second, we're seeing strong pricing. CPMs for GO are at a big premium versus our linear nets, largely because the length of view is almost an hour and the Millennial delivery is so strong.
Third, consumption patterns appear to be 60% recent episodes and 40% older titles. Which is a strong testament to our deep, rich library and the fact that consumers are seeking out our programming, even over a week after it's aired. 
Finally, our only real material challenge is our authentication rate, which is a common challenge for all programmers and distributors.
But we're working with our distribution partners to address it. For example, we've just launched home-based authentication with Comcast, which removes a huge barrier by eliminating the password requirement on sign in and roadmaps to do the same with other MVPDs are in the works.
We also continue to make strides in Europe. In some markets of Europe, the pay television penetration is lower than in mature markets. And that provides new digital opportunities to leverage the investments we have been making in sports rights beyond our linear business. Of the 320 million homes in Europe, 160 million homes currently have Eurosport, but 160 million homes currently do not have access to Eurosport on TV, primarily because they are non-pay-TV households.
That 160 million is more than all the households in the U.S. For future digital delivery, there are nearly 200 million wired broadband subscriptions and nearly $600 million mobile data subscriptions across Europe, more than all the fixed and wireless data subs in the U.S. Together, making Europe the most important continent for sports growth and opportunity, over-the-top.
So there are clearly 2 roots to sports expansion in Europe: linear and digital, and we are attacking both.
To help drive our Eurosport Digital effort, I've asked Paul Guyardo to now oversee Eurosport Digital businesses. Paul worked with Barry Diller for many years at HSN, and worked at DIRECTV, where Paul and his subscriber-acquisition team built DIRECTV from 15 million subs to over 20 million subs.
Following the successful launch of our GO apps in the U.S., Paul will take his skills to Eurosport's Digital operations. And we're building a world-class team with new expertise to manage our direct-to-consumer business out of London. 
We recently hired Ralph Rivera to be the Managing Director of Eurosport Digital, and he will take over the day-to-day operations. Ralph joins us from the BBC, where he was responsible for all of the BBC's digital media services, leading the implementation and operation of BBC iPlayer, as it grew by over 300%. And not coincidentally, he delivered BBC's first truly digital Olympic Games for London in 2012, providing solid in-house expertise as we get access to the Olympic Rings on January 1 of next year.
Today, we own the content for our linear businesses, and we have the right to use that content to build our global digital businesses. 
As I've told many of you, because we own the sports content for both senior and digital, I've begun to think of this as an opportunity to build a Netflix for sports in Europe. 
We are also exploring, creating services for science, in the auto space and for other niche genres in the U.S. and around the world. 
Additional direct-to-consumer opportunities, so our super fans can access our content, where they want on whatever device, whenever they want. 
So in closing, we continue to secure important, long-term distribution deals and invest and add key personnel to support global growth across all platforms to assure that Discovery Communications continues to evolve globally and digitally, way beyond the way the traditional U.S.-based multichannel network company can evolve.
And now I'll turn the call over to Andy."
22666093,382600100,1068472,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.

Thank you for joining us today. As expected and previously communicated, our third quarter was challenging, but our financial and operating trends in the fourth quarter are much better and our robust full year outlook is still very much intact. 
Importantly, as David mentioned, while the media landscape is rapidly changing, Discovery's global content portfolio of well-loved and increasingly diversified brands makes us uniquely well-positioned for long-term growth. 
Half of our revenue base is derived from affiliate, which is well-positioned for strong and sustained growth, given a multiyear nature of our contracts, with built-in price escalators. We also remain highly focused on controlling our noncontent operating cost growth, while thoughtfully investing in content and OTT platforms.
As we have consistently highlighted, 2 of our most critical competitive advantages are our flexible cost structures and the fact that we own or control the vast majority of our content across all global platforms. These advantages give us tremendous operational flexibility and optionality and it allow us to fully maximize our long-term profit growth.
Now let's dive into our third quarter results.
Excluding currency, total company revenues were up 3% and adjusted OIBDA grew 1%. 
Net income, available to Discovery Communications of $290 million decreased versus the third quarter a year ago, primarily due to a $50 million or $0.08 per share noncash after-tax write-down of our Lionsgate's equity position.
Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter were $0.36 and adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.40, down 15% versus last year's third quarter.
Excluding the $0.08 impact from this onetime Lionsgate write-down, third quarter adjusted EPS would have been $0.48, up slightly year-over-year.
Excluding both, negative currency impacts, as well as a Lionsgate write-down, adjusted EPS was up 5% for the third quarter and up fully 18% for the year-to-date.
Third quarter free cash flow increased 75% to $410 million, primarily due to lower cash taxes and improved working capital turns. Impressively, constant currency free cash flow increased 112% for the quarter and increased 72% for the first 9 months of the year. Our total company free cash flow growth has clearly accelerated.
Turning now to the operating units. Our U.S. network revenues were up 2%, as our 7% affiliate growth was offset by a 3% decline in advertising growth, which was fully expected due to the Olympics as well as the timing of Shark Week this year.
Excluding the Olympic impact, U.S. advertising would have been up low single digits.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect fourth quarter advertising to be flat after taking into account the small, approximately 50-basis-point impact from the deconsolidation of our Discovery Digital Networks relating to our recently announced Group Nine deal.
Our domestic distribution revenues were up 7%, while total portfolio subs again declined almost 2% versus the third quarter of last year. We continue to benefit from the significantly higher locked-in rate increases we've solidified in all of our recent affiliate deals, including our new deal with DIRECTV. 
We are extremely pleased with the outcome of this latest renewal, which was completed at very favorable rates and in line with our other strong U.S. affiliate deals.
The DIRECTV renewal was truly a win-win as our content will be available across all DIRECTV platforms, including their soon-to-be-launched OTT DIRECTV NOW streaming product.
Domestic operating expenses in the quarter were actually down, 1% as we remain laser-focused on controlling our non-content cost growth, resulting in 3% adjusted OIBDA growth and 100 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion to 58%. Total domestic operating expenses are expected to be flat to down again in the fourth quarter. 
Turning now to our international operations. The 3Q comps to last year are simpler, as there were no major acquisitions or divestitures to normalize. So my following comments will refer to our organic results, which need to only exclude currency impacts. 
International organic revenues increased 2%, with distribution revenues up 8% and advertising revenues down 2%. Our 8% affiliate revenue growth was primarily due to higher affiliate rates in Latin America, CEEMEA and in Northern Europe, but we have been successful in leveraging our expanded content portfolio that now includes sports to drive higher contracted pricing step-ups, but was partially offset by a couple of onetime items in Europe and Asia in the third quarter of last year.
We still expect constant currency distribution growth over the next several years to be up at least low double digits, as we continue to benefit from our stronger, more diversified portfolio of networks and higher contracted price escalators.
Turning to our third quarter national advertising, overall results were meaningfully impacted by the Olympics and while we benefited from higher volumes in Southern Europe and higher pricing and volumes in CEEMEA, growth in these markets was more than offset by declines in Northern Europe, our largest advertising region.
Northern Europe was clearly heavily impacted by Brexit and other macro-related weaknesses as well as softer ratings at our female-skewing networks.  Trends, however, are improving in the fourth quarter, with all regions seeing improved results. Therefore, we expect fourth quarter year-over-year advertising growth to improve by several hundred basis points versus this third quarter's growth rate.
International operating expenses grew 6% in the third quarter, primarily due to higher sports content and production costs. The total international cost growth will flow in the fourth quarter.
Now taking a look at share repurchases. In the third quarter, we repurchased a total of $374 million worth of shares, and we have repurchased $1.5 billion of stock over the last 4 quarters as we committed to on last year's third quarter call.
We now have spent a total of $7.8 billion buying back shares as we began our buyback program at the end of 2010. On a stock split-adjusted basis, we have now reduced our gross outstanding share count by 34% and by 30% net of employee equity awards.
We were still very comfortable with our current gross leverage ratio of 3.3x, given both our high degree of confidence and our free cash flow, growth forecast as well as our robust 16% and growing free cash flow to debt yield. We have significant flexibility around our deployment of capital and are extremely committed to remaining an investment-grade rated company.
Very importantly, we are well within the financial ratios prescribed by all 3 rating agencies to maintain our current investment-grade debt rating. 
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we will continue our share repurchases, but our available capital for buybacks will be impacted by the $100 million investment in Group Nine. But 4Q share repurchases will not be impacted by the BAMTech Europe deal due to its immaterial investment size.
Now let's review our forward-looking guidance. For full year 2016, we still expect constant currency free cash flow to grow in the high teen range and constant currency adjusted EPS, excluding the Lionsgate write down to grow at least 20%. 
We are also reiterating our 2015 to 2018 3-year guidance of constant currency adjusted EPS and free cash flow growth CAGRs, both growing at least low teens or better.
I also want to update the expected year-over-year foreign exchange impact on our full year operating results. 
Thanks to our effective hedging strategy, the expected year-over-year FX impact on our financials has not changed since our last call, despite some of our major currencies, especially the pound, recently weakening. 
Assuming current spot rates stay constant for the rest of the year, FX is still expected to reduce our constant currency revenues by $150 million to $160 million, and our constant currency adjusted OIBDA by $80 million to $90 million. 
In addition, we still expect a positive FX impact to adjusted EPS of $0.02 to $0.06, due to net effect of this year's adjusted OIBDA impact and the year-over-year change in the below the line FX impact.
In closing, as I near the end of my tenure at Discovery, I'm extremely optimistic about Discovery's current global content portfolio or optionality given our ownership of content and flexible cost structures and our overall financial and operating momentum. 
Now, David and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have."

I",487,"Okay, sure. Look, I think, Netflix is a terrific company and they've had a lot of success in putting together quality content as well as acquiring content from existing players and they've been in nonfiction and they're continuing to do some nonfiction. I think, directionally, it's -- it move to be more like an HBO. And so I think, in terms of where Netflix sits with us, we see them more as a premium service. Both Showtime and HBO were also were doing some nonfiction and documentaries. And so we don't really see them as a competitor with our brands. Our focus really has been to get -- to tighten up our brands, by focus more on nourishing our core audiences so that we have super fans and we could be reaching them and build a steadier and longer viewership on each of our brands around the world. And we've seen that with Discovery outside the U.S., which is continuing to grow globally. ID which is breaking out, it's growing 10% this year, domestically. And more than that outside the U.S. as well as Oprah and Science and Animal Planet. And so we're really focused on curating through brands and we're finding that our pipeline is strong particular because of our leadership, with Discovery as the #1 channel for men in the U.S. Yet in the U.S. and almost every market around the world we're a first place that producers are coming to. Also, because of the amount of volume as well as for each of our other channels. On crime we're #1, because we buy the most in the African-American space now with Oprah. Oprah has become the #1 play. So I think focusing on our brands and nourishing our audience is really the key for us for growth. And I think Netflix is doing quite well and it just reiterate the fact that nonfiction is strong. 
On DIRECTV NOW, we were able to work out a deal that, I think, works really well for work DIRECTV and for us. The idea with Now is that they're going to have an opportunity to reach out to subscribers that maybe they couldn't otherwise get. And for us, we think a lot of that at least, hearing from DIRECTV is going to be a younger demo or cord nevers at least in the initial tranche, but for us, we're well covered. A number of our services are going to be carried and at least 85% of the economics will be reaping from each subscriber. And we expect that to the extent that it rolls out and it's meaningful that we'll find what we have found on smaller bundles around the world that our viewership become stronger. So we've been able to secure a strong position, which I think, works well for us and works well for DIRECTV because they have very high-quality services to offer on DIRECTV NOW."

BAMTech and getting it to business with Bob Bowman is a big piece of that from the middleware perspective as well as access to some additional IP through them. But joint venturing with BAMTech and sharing and investing in a tech platform that we build out throughout Europe, it gives us the best-of-class platform that can hold all the streams and provide a very positive consumer interface, which we think is an improvement over what we have today. In addition, we have Ralph Rivera, who ran the iPlayer, and that's sort of the how do we aggregate all the content and how do we offer it? Is there -- right now, we're offering it as a broad offering. Ralph is looking at subdividing that to specialty groups. We now have all the majors in tennis, we have all the cycling, we have all the winter sports that we start to break that out as the seasons passes and we've started to experiment with that and Ralph will create the content working with Paul. But Paul's job at DIRECTV was subscriber acquisition and marketing job. And that's what he did for Barry at HSN, that's what he did at DIRECTV. He had a team of over 300 people that drove DIRECTV from 15 million subscribers to 20 million. And he had dashboards that related to customer service, reducing churn, subscriber acquisition, how do you -- where do you go, what are the affinity groups that you go to and how do you attack those groups at what pricing. And so we have started to hire a significant number of people. We made the decision to put them in London, because we view this group as a disruptor group. So rather than have our existing team that's doing a world-class of building Eurosport and acquiring that IP, so we have our 3 Eurosport channels across all of Europe, and we have Eurosport.com that Peter Hutton and his team is running and that is profitable and we've been able to get great IP. Now we have our BAMTech middleware together with their IP and their know-how, we put it on top of that one of the best guys in the industry with huge experience in offering content to equity consumers. And then Paul, on top of all of it, is responsible to drive it. And look, there is no -- when you think about Europe, with over 700 million people and only 50% pay penetration, there's huge opportunity here, we think, to go over-the-top. There's the 50% that aren't getting any of Eurosport content at all. And then, even when we're showing the Eurosport content on our channels, we have so much IP that there's huge amount that's not being seen. And so that will be an attack, our sport Netflix in Europe is something that we're taking seriously, and we see it as a disruptive, and we think it could be a huge value creator. But we think it's just the beginning, because when we look at all of our IP now, we've spent the last 4 years building our content, owning it on all platforms and whether it's Science, whether it's auto, whether it's African-American, we think that there's an opportunity with all that content paid for to go direct-to-consumer, either for a fee or for free, and build additional economics and some additional bites of the apple."

We could put more content on there just to get ratings or we could put content on there that would be very U.S. centric. But we've really look at Discovery as a global platform and measure it in terms of how we're gaining share around the world. Rich Ross, had a huge success with miniseries Harley and the Davidsons, and we took that around the world and we're finding some meaningful success with that. Gold Rush is back and doing quite well. Alaska: The Last Frontier is back. So we have a lot of content coming in the fourth quarter. I think, you'll see some meaningful improvement, but most importantly, the channels aren't brand. We've done well with our scripted series and we have some real documentaries that are meaningful that have been on the air that are reminding people of what Discovery is when it's at its best. So we feel good about Discovery. TLC has been a challenge. But I think, we're making the turn. We now have a Sunday night, that's really strong with 90 Day Fiancé, where we're #1 or #2 for women on Sunday night again. The overall trend in the last few weeks has been better. But we've worked really hard over the last 18 months on our development and on figuring out how -- what is TLC when it's at its best. And how has it changed over the last couple of years. Where did we lose some acceleration. And Nancy Daniels and her team, together with the global TLC team has been digging in, and we think we have some good content coming up in the fourth and first quarter, so we think that we can help turn that around. And each of these channels are a bit of a -- at times are a bit of challenged. Oprah was a challenge for us, the OWN Network, and now it's a top 10 or 12 network in America, and it's #1 for African-Americans. For a period of time, ID, 1.5 years ago was strong. And Henry and his team, we got -- really focused on what is ID, how do we nourish that audience and now it's back on track and growing in a meaningful way and it's #1 for women. And so I think, our creative teams are strong. We're not going to have all 14 of our channels growing all at the same time. But as we look at our overall share globally whether it's in the women's category or the men's, over the last year, we continue to grow."

But I'll say that, look, we had a very good equitable argument when we went into our renewals a few years ago. When we did the deals, 8 years ago, 7 years ago, 5 years ago, we were getting about 5% or 6% share, we were getting about 4% or 5% of the money. Our share went up to 12% or 13%. We launched ID. It became #1 for women. We launched OWN and it was successful. Discovery came back to being #1. And we invested a lot more in content. So when we went out to all the distributors, we were able to get a significant step up and double-digit increases. And now we're done with all of our deals and that's true across the board. We were also able to secure good protection for our channels against tiering. And real protection that we were going to get carried in a meaningful way in any offering. It helps us that our Top 5 or 6 channels represent about 85% or 87% of the money. Exactly what happens with DIRECTV NOW and where that growth comes from? We don't see that as being an issue. We see it as being an opportunity. There's a lot of people that probably were unable to afford the traditional DIRECTV product. They may buy that $35 product. And if they do, we're going to have a lot of channels on there. Each of those channels are very strong brands, and we've seen in markets like Brazil and Mexico and in many of the markets in Europe where we only have half of our channels carry. If we can preserve most of the economics, the viewership on those channels grow and the strength of the brands grow. And so we're rooting for DIRECTV with Now. We also think that creates a nice marketplace driver. So if the other distributors in the market decide to do something like that, the biggest impediment right now is the price of cable in the U.S. It's something that we don't see in most markets around the world. And it's mostly driven by high sports fees. And so the biggest issue that we have in Northern Europe, Rich, is it's one of the few markets where cable TV is $100. And the result of cable being $100 is that there have been a lot of people that have gone to other services or disconnected. And that's not true across all most of Europe or Latin America. And here in the U.S., one of the things that stops -- that has stopped the growth of cable is pricing in all that sports. So the idea that somebody can do a $35 offering, we can get most of our economics and more share, that's a positive. The second thing is we've already gone directly to consumers with Discovery GO, which is going very well so far. And as I said, 50% of the people that are spending time with Discovery GO are under 34 and about 40% are under 25. And they are watching an hour and they're watching all the commercials. And so we've already said that next year, we expect at least 1% of additional growth in ad sales because of Discovery GO. And we think it could be north of that. And we have a Dplay product in Europe, where we're also going direct-to-consumer. So we're learning a lot about all that and I think, you'll see all the work that we did, where we said, ""Let's not fight for ratings. Let's fight for super fans and strength of brand,"" that we'll be able to take that brand to people around the world. I know I've said it before, but when you -- we take it like a science product. What would a science app that's $1.99 or $2.99 when we already have it in 55 languages look like, if we could take it around the world and make it available to the over billion subscribers that currently get our content. And so we think with our content paid for, direct-to-consumer is an opportunity. But I would say that we really view the existing system is quite solid. So I think, owning great content that has super fans and being able to take that to consumers is a real opportunity for additional meaningful growth. And in the case in sports there could be a huge driver for us, but the existing ecosystem around the world remained strong. And I think, it's more of what's going to be in 4, 5, and 6 years, in terms of getting directly to consumer or 7, and then the next few, where thing seems really pretty stable around the world when you look at subscribers."

Yes, so the answer to the question around volume growth in Southern Europe and really it also applies to Latin America and Eastern Europe. It's what we called the power ratio.

And if you look at those 3 regions, Latin America, Southern Europe and Eastern Europe, you're still seeing strong double-digit growth there because we just have so much catch up to do, relative to economics following viewership and share. So you'll continue to see us talk about while Olympics certainly was some headwind in those markets, no question that just the overall trend of our performance from a macro perspective, from an economics perspective continues to be a great tailwind for us. With regard to Eurosport, look, we don't anymore split out Eurosport, but not only because it's so integrated now with the rest of the business. We go to the affiliate marketplace as one company, a lot of the ad sales now while we're seeing some tremendous ad growth on Eurosport given its new platform. We don't think of it as being a stand-alone entity anymore from a reporting perspective. So while margins are a little less, it's still positive, a little less given the dynamics of sports rights relative to some of the third quarter ad sales challenges that we talked about. No question the trend there is still positive. We're still seeing a growth in the top line for Eurosport-related product, and we're still seeing, over the long term, profit growth and margin growth for that asset."

So when you look to Northern Europe, if you exclude that and you exclude the U.K. where Brexit has presented real challenges in terms of the advertising market, we're seeing in Latin America and throughout Europe high single mostly double-digit growth still.

We think we can improve it a little bit, but we can't say right now whether the viewership levels on television are going to continued to decline or ameliorate. Right now it looks like a slow steady decline up there. More so than we're seeing across most of Europe, which is contrary to what we are seeing in Latin America where there's still meaningful growth.

So we feel like that's on a good track. We're really working on driving the authentication. When it comes to our sports product, we are putting in place a team that will work on [ph] in the best in the best case is one of the things that you with AT&T is something that I've been talking about for 1.5 years that we've been seeing. We've been seeing -- it used to be the triple play, but more and more in Europe now you're seeing the quadruple play. You're seeing wireless, broadband, multi channel to the home. There's still some fixed problem, but it's much less relevant as we are know. And so with that type, there comes a commoditization, and we saw it across Europe as BT start -- try to decommoditize their platform by owning special but IP, you see it with Deutsche Telecom, you see it with Vodafone, you see it Telenor, you see it in Latin America. So for a long time, I've been saying that, that type is getting commoditized. And when you're holding onto that type, if there's 1 or 2 guys next door that are offering the same thing, it becomes a real challenge. And it's almost a race to the bottom. And so we've seen that around the world. And the reach when that happens is IT to decommoditize the platform. And so some of the deals that we've been able to do whether it's with Canal Plus, whether it's discussions with the mobile guys, which is something that we're having now much more aggressively. Where everyone is looking for IP to attach to their pipe, to decommoditize it. And so when -- I think that the -- the positive side of AT&T is it's an affirmation that owning great IP is important. Of course, it's raises some significant issues for content owners in terms of how they're going to be carried on their platform. But point is that the right deals for us in Europe or Latin America could be quite advantageous to driving this product. There is no reason why this product shouldn't be driven by the mobile players across Europe. And so if you buy a particular wireless product, you can get the Eurosport Player. If you sign up for a particular distributor, you can get the Eurosport Player. They can build for it. So we expect that over the next period of time that they'll be some bundling of our product just like Netflix is now getting bundled with Liberty Global or bundled with other distributors that it's a way of making an offering. The difference is that in some of the markets in Europe, it could be exclusive. So we could be marketing ourselves direct to the consumer. We have Eurosport, so people are watching the sport that they love. We could be telling them the next match is on the Eurosport Player. So sign up. So we could be our own direct promotion through unsold inventory, which make us unique and different from Netflix. But -- so we have our direct reach, and we have 10 to 12 channels in each market, where we're reaching specific demos. But then there's also, we think, the opportunity over time -- over the near term, over the next year or 2, once we have this best-in-class player working with a Bowman and BAMTech and we have the product that we think works because we have the IP that we think works. Then we start to have distributors become subdistributors for us, which we think also will reduce churn in a meaningful way because we'll be packaged along with other billing by distributors. So this idea of the quadruple play and this fight to decommoditized the pipe, I think for people that own IP and could offer it across all of the different platforms is going to be a real meaningful opportunity for growth."

So we've gone from investing $500 million in content to over $2 billion.

But if it does happen, which I think eventually hopefully, it will, this -- the value of a business like this could be huge. And finally, we pick up a stronger relationship with SnapChat when we pick up 2 channels. And so I think, for us, we now own 39% of it, we got a great leadership team running it, we'll see over the next few years how it develops and it gives us great optionality and it gives us a great support system. Finally, Eurosport and the whole partnership with them and that relates to sports. And we're going to be going at that very hard. And remember, the reason why we think it's so compelling is that Netflix spends over $6 billion or $7 billion a year on content. We're going to be offering our sports content across Europe and our cost of content is 0 because we're already making, our margins are already in the teens for Eurosport. And so this could be a very profitable business for us. It's not that different from the cable players that we're able to build the business model on the coaxial cable and multichannel to the home and then being able to take a second bite at the apple and offer broadband without a lot of cost. And so we have to prove it out, but we think we got -- we have something quite strong. When it comes to Science or Auto, that's something we can offer globally. It's -- and we can offer it direct-to-consumer, we can offer it through distributors because we already -- we have a huge amount of that content in language, and we're just playing that with the best way to offer it. And we're having a lot of discussions with consumers about what they like, what they like about our content and how to package it."

I'm pleased to join you this morning during a very exciting time for the media industry. As the industry continues to evolve at an increasingly rapid pace, we know that powerful and loved content is still king. Discovery remains",1946,"Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to join you this morning during a very exciting time for the media industry. As the industry continues to evolve at an increasingly rapid pace, we know that powerful and loved content is still king. 
Discovery remains focused on diversifying and augmenting the value of our global content portfolio of strong brands and franchises in over 220 markets around the world.
We have continued to strengthen our traditional pay-TV dual revenue streams, while investing to drive additional value on pay-TV and across new digital platforms. 
Since our last call, we've made some key strategic investments. We have seen expected, but still difficult, third quarter advertising results, in part due to the Olympics.
We've completed a major U.S. distribution deal and we've watched a continuation of strong trends in distribution revenue, which are 50% of our U.S. and 50% of our international businesses. That long-cycle domestic and international revenue mix makes Discovery unlike any other U.S.-based multichannel network company.
Today, I want to talk about 5 major developments since our last earnings call: our new CFO; 2 strategic investments; the financial foundation provided by our large distribution deals; and gains in our digital rollout that bring increased focus on our digital monetization.
First, as you know, Gunnar Wiedenfels will join us early next year as CFO. Andy Warren has graciously agreed to extend his contract term to ensure a smooth transition of CFO responsibilities. And a big thank you for that, Andy, and for all of your service -- great service over the past 5 years. 
Gunnar's experience as CFO of publicly-traded ProSieben is perfectly aligned with Discovery's future and growth portfolio. ProSieben, one of Europe's major media companies, operates multiple broadcast and cable networks and is also Germany's leading online video marketer. We are excited to bring Gunnar onto the team as Discovery continues our rapid growth and diversification in new content and digital platforms around the world.
Second, is a key strategic partnership for Europe. Today, I'm extremely pleased to announce that Discovery and MLB Advanced Media have created a joint venture to form BAMTech Europe. This platform partnership leverages Eurosport, the dominant player in sports rights across Europe with unparalleled reach, and BAMTech's world-class digital technology service. 
Discovery will remain the 100% owner of Eurosport and all of its IP as well as its digital platforms. This partnership will greatly accelerate Eurosport's access to over 700 million people in Europe, gaining just 1% of the European population to subscribe to the Eurosport Player, would equal 7 million subscribers.
BAMTech's state-of-the-art back-end video platform and service will be implemented in 2017 across all of Eurosport Digital products, which today include Eurosport.com, the continent's #1 sports new website with 60 million users a month; and the Eurosport Player, what we call our sports Netflix, the leading subscription-based OTT sports platform across Europe, giving fans an all-access pass, any time and on any device in 52 countries.
In addition, we will have access to select MLBAM content in Europe for direct-to-consumer distribution.
BAMTech Europe also will work with a broad set of sports and entertainment content owners, broadcasters and OTT platforms to enhance their digital capabilities, reach and performance across the continent.
Third is an investment to change our content and IP mix and help Discovery grow into a leader in short form and mobile content for the next decade. Last month, we announced that we will be investing $100 million in entering into a strategic partnership to create a new media holding company called Group Nine Media. We will contribute 2 of our digital assets, Seeker and SourceFed Studios, digital networks and we'll combine them with independent digital networks, Thrillist, Now This, which is the #1 video news publisher on Facebook, The Dodo as well as 2 SnapChat channels that belong to the Now This portfolio.
With 3.5 billion monthly video views across all of these millennial-focused brands, Group Nine will be a top 5 digital-first content and social video company on day 1, with a best-in-class leadership team, tremendous brands, reach and scale. We will own 39% of Group Nine, and importantly, we have the option to acquire full ownership in the future.
Fourth is another big distribution agreement. We completed a successful renegotiation with AT&T DIRECTV, so we will continue to reach their 25 million subscribers in the U.S. at very favorable rates. The DIRECTV agreement is in line with our other recent deals. This long-term contract not only helps secure our linear distribution growth, but it also means Discovery's content will be available across all DIRECTV platforms on a favorable basis, including the soon-to-be-launched OTT DIRECTV NOW streaming product. 
The importance of long-term international and domestic distribution deals like our recent deals with DIRECTV, Liberty Global and Telenor cannot be overstated. In the U.S., with the successful completion of our DIRECTV deal, we won't have another major renewal until the end of next year. 
Internationally, while there were some onetime items last year that impact third quarter growth, we expect double-digit underlying organic growth for the next few years.
As our stronger premium content portfolio that now includes leadership in sports in Europe is translating into much stronger price increases as deals are renewed, there is no question that the addition of sports and the upcoming Olympics to our nonfiction portfolio in Europe is bolstering our profile with distributors and reinforcing the must-have nature of our suite of brands. 
Half of our total company revenues come from these agreements. And our built-in price escalators provide a solid, stable foundation of growth, even as advertising fluctuates. This stability is what gives us the optionality to monetize our content on existing and emerging platforms and is further evidence of the strength of our brands and our content.
Two recent examples of our brands resonating with audiences are OWN and ID. With new hits like Queen Sugar and Greenleaf, a strong Saturday night and Tyler Perry programming continued to deliver audiences. OWN is the #1 network for African-American women in America and prime delivery is up 12% year-to-date. And for a few weeks this quarter, OWN was a top 10 network in America for women. ID continued to score big in the third quarter, ranking as the #1 network for women in August, September and October. Number one. 
JonBenet, an American mystery story, is this year's best new nonfiction cable series, and ID's best ever across demos. And this series also drew record audiences in the U.K. and ID's international viewership growth was up double digits, yet again.
The fifth topic I want to discuss is our digital strategy. Our global digital strategy is pretty simple, get our own content to as many people as possible across all screens and platforms and fill in with digital-only content as needed. 
A key tenant of our digital strategy and driving incremental revenue growth is TV Everywhere. In Latin America, our kids' digital product continues to gain traction, with Discovery Kids Play now in front of over 40 million households. 
In the U.S., Paul Guyardo and team have done a great job with the recent launch of our authenticated network apps and websites, which now give cable and satellite customers the ability to watch our long-form content anytime, anywhere and on practically any device. We've made real significant progress with our authenticated offering in this past year. 
A year ago, our TV Everywhere footprint was in just over 20% of the U.S. Today, our footprint covers over 70% of the country. The national launch of our TV Everywhere apps that we call GO, occurred on August 9. It's early days, but we have already learned a lot and initial results are quite promising.
First, 50% of the streams are coming from 18- to 34-year-olds. This gives us confidence that our content is relevant to a younger audience. We just had to put it on a different platform for them to consume it. 
Second, we're seeing strong pricing. CPMs for GO are at a big premium versus our linear nets, largely because the length of view is almost an hour and the Millennial delivery is so strong.
Third, consumption patterns appear to be 60% recent episodes and 40% older titles, which is a strong testament to our deep, rich library and the fact that consumers are seeking out our programming, even over a week after it's aired. 
Finally, our only real material challenge is our authentication rate, which is a common challenge for all programmers and distributors. But we're working with our distribution partners to address it. For example, we've just launched home-based authentication with Comcast, which removes a huge barrier by eliminating the password requirement on sign in, and road maps to do the same with other MVPDs are in the works.
We also continue to make strides in Europe. In some markets of Europe, the pay television penetration is lower than in mature markets. And that provides new digital opportunities to leverage the investments we have been making in sports rights beyond our linear business. Of the 320 million homes in Europe, 160 million homes currently have Eurosport, but 160 million homes currently do not have access to Eurosport on TV, primarily because they are non-pay-TV households.
That 160 million is more than all the households in the U.S. For future digital delivery, there are nearly 200 million wired broadband subscriptions and nearly 600 million mobile data subscriptions across Europe, more than all the fixed and wireless data subs in the U.S., together, making Europe the most important continent for sports growth an opportunity over-the-top.
So there are clearly 2 routes to sports expansion in Europe: linear and digital, and we are attacking both. To help drive our Eurosport Digital effort, I've asked Paul Guyardo to now oversee Eurosport's digital businesses. Paul worked with Barry Diller for many years at HSN, and worked at DIRECTV, where Paul and his subscriber-acquisition team built DIRECTV from 15 million subs to over 20 million subs. Following the successful launch of our GO apps in the U.S., Paul will take his skills to Eurosport's digital operations. 
And we're building a world-class team with new expertise to manage our direct-to-consumer business out of London. We recently hired Ralph Rivera to be the Managing Director of Eurosport Digital, and he will take over the day-to-day operations. Ralph joins us from the BBC, where he was responsible for all of the BBC's digital media services, leading the implementation and operation of BBC iPlayer as it grew by over 300%. And not coincidentally, he delivered BBC's first truly digital Olympic Games for London in 2012, providing solid in-house expertise as we get access to the Olympic Rings on January 1 of next year.
Today, we own the content for our linear businesses, and we have the right to use that content to build our global digital businesses. As I've told many of you, because we own the sports content for both linear and digital, I've begun to think of this as an opportunity to build a Netflix for sports in Europe. 
We are also exploring creating services for Science, in the auto space and for other niche genres in the U.S. and around the world. Additional direct-to-consumer opportunities, so our super fans can access our content where they want, on whatever device, whenever they want. 
So in closing, we continue to secure important, long-term distribution deals and invest and add key personnel to support global growth across all platforms to assure that Discovery Communications continues to evolve globally and digitally, way beyond the way the traditional U.S.-based multichannel network company can evolve.
And now I'll turn the call over to Andy."
22666093,382600100,1068639,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.

Thank you for joining us today. As expected and previously communicated, our third quarter was challenging, but our financial and operating trends in the fourth quarter are much better and our robust full year outlook is still very much intact. 
Importantly, as David mentioned, while the media landscape is rapidly changing, Discovery's global content portfolio of well-loved and increasingly diversified brands makes us uniquely well-positioned for long-term growth. 
Half of our revenue base is derived from affiliate, which is well-positioned for strong and sustained growth, given the multiyear nature of our contracts with built-in price escalators. We also remain highly focused on controlling our noncontent operating cost growth, while thoughtfully investing in content and OTT platforms.
As we have consistently highlighted, 2 of our most critical competitive advantages are our flexible cost structures and the fact that we own or control the vast majority of our content across all global platforms. These advantages give us tremendous operational flexibility and optionality and allow us to fully maximize our long-term profit growth.
Now let's dive into our third quarter results. Excluding currency, total company revenues were up 3% and adjusted OIBDA grew 1%. Net income available to Discovery Communications of $290 million decreased versus the third quarter a year ago, primarily due to a $50 million or $0.08 per share noncash after-tax write-down of our Lionsgate's equity position.
Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter were $0.36 and adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.40, down 15% versus last year's third quarter. Excluding the $0.08 impact from this onetime Lionsgate write-down, third quarter adjusted EPS would have been $0.48, up slightly year-over-year. Excluding both, negative currency impacts, as well as a Lionsgate write-down, adjusted EPS was up 5% for the third quarter and up fully 18% for the year-to-date.
Third quarter free cash flow increased 75% to $410 million, primarily due to lower cash taxes and improved working capital turns. Impressively, constant-currency free cash flow increased 112% for the quarter and increased 72% for the first 9 months of the year. Our total company free cash flow growth has clearly accelerated.
Turning now to the operating units. Our U.S. network revenues were up 2% as our 7% affiliate growth was offset by a 3% decline in advertising growth, which was fully expected due to the Olympics as well as the timing of Shark Week this year. Excluding the Olympic impact, U.S. advertising would have been up low single digits.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect fourth quarter advertising to be flat after taking into account the small, approximately 50-basis-point impact from the deconsolidation of our Discovery Digital Networks relating to our recently announced Group Nine deal.
Our domestic distribution revenues were up 7%, while total portfolio subs again declined almost 2% versus the third quarter of last year. We continue to benefit from the significantly higher locked-in rate increases we've solidified in all of our recent affiliate deals, including our new deal with DIRECTV. We are extremely pleased with the outcome of this latest renewal, which was completed at very favorable rates and in line with our other strong U.S. affiliate deals. The DIRECTV renewal was truly a win-win as our content will be available across all DIRECTV platforms, including their soon-to-be-launched OTT DIRECTV NOW streaming product.
Domestic operating expenses in the quarter were actually down 1% as we remain laser-focused on controlling our non-content cost growth, resulting in 3% adjusted OIBDA growth and 100 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion to 58%. Total domestic operating expenses are expected to be flat to down again in the fourth quarter. 
Turning now to our international operations. The 3Q comps to last year are simpler, as there were no major acquisitions or divestitures to normalize. So my following comments will refer to our organic results, which need to only exclude currency impacts. 
International organic revenues increased 2%, with distribution revenues up 8% and advertising revenues down 2%. Our 8% affiliate revenue growth was primarily due to higher affiliate rates in Latin America, CEEMEA and in Northern Europe, where we have been successful in leveraging our expanded content portfolio that now includes sports to drive higher contracted pricing step-ups, but was partially offset by a couple of onetime items in Europe and Asia in the third quarter of last year.
We still expect constant-currency distribution growth over the next several years to be up at least low double digits as we continue to benefit from our stronger, more diversified portfolio of networks and higher contracted price escalators.
Turning to our third quarter national advertising. Overall results were meaningfully impacted by the Olympics and while we benefited from higher volumes in Southern Europe and higher pricing and volumes in CEEMEA, growth in these markets was more than offset by declines in Northern Europe, our largest advertising region.
Northern Europe was clearly heavily impacted by Brexit and other macro-related weaknesses as well as softer ratings at our female-skewing networks. Trends, however, are improving in the fourth quarter, with all regions seeing improved results. Therefore, we expect fourth quarter year-over-year advertising growth to improve by several hundred basis points versus this third quarter's growth rate.
International operating expenses grew 6% in the third quarter, primarily due to higher sports content and production costs, but total international cost growth will slow in the fourth quarter.
Now taking a look at share repurchases. In the third quarter, we repurchased a total of $374 million worth of shares, and we have repurchased $1.5 billion of stock over the last 4 quarters as we committed to on last year's third quarter call.
We now have spent a total of $7.8 billion buying back shares as we began our buyback program at the end of 2010. On a stock split-adjusted basis, we have now reduced our gross outstanding share count by 34% and by 30% net of employee equity awards.
We were still very comfortable with our current gross leverage ratio of 3.3x, given both our high degree of confidence and our free cash flow, growth forecast as well as our robust 16% and growing free cash flow to debt yield. We have significant flexibility around our deployment of capital and are extremely committed to remaining investment-grade rated company.
Very importantly, we are well within the financial ratios prescribed by all 3 rating agencies to maintain our current investment-grade debt rating. 
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we will continue our share repurchases, but our available capital for buybacks will be impacted by the $100 million investment in Group Nine. But 4Q share repurchases will not be impacted by the BAMTech Europe deal due to its immaterial investment size.
Now let's give you our forward-looking guidance. For full year 2016, we still expect constant-currency free cash flow to grow in the high teen range and constant-currency adjusted EPS, excluding the Lionsgate write-down, to grow at least 20%. 
We are also reiterating our 2015 to 2018 3-year guidance of constant-currency adjusted EPS and free cash flow growth CAGRs, both growing at least low teens or better.
I also want to update the expected year-over-year foreign exchange impact on our full year operating results. Thanks to our effective hedging strategy, the expected year-over-year FX impact on our financials has not changed since our last call, despite some of our major currencies, especially the pound, recently weakening. 
Assuming current spot rates stay constant for the rest of the year, FX is still expected to reduce our constant-currency revenues by $150 million to $160 million, and our constant-currency adjusted OIBDA by $80 million to $90 million. 
In addition, we still expect a positive FX impact to adjusted EPS of $0.02 to $0.06, due to the net effect of this year's adjusted OIBDA impact and the year-over-year change in the below-the-line FX impact.
In closing, as I near the end of my tenure at Discovery, I'm extremely optimistic about Discovery's current global content portfolio, our optionality given our ownership of content and flexible cost structures, and our overall financial and operating momentum. 
Now, David and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have."

Look, I think Netflix is a terrific company and they've had a lot of success in putting together quality content as well as acquiring content from existing players and they've been in nonfiction and they're continuing to do some nonfiction. I",484,"Okay, sure. Look, I think Netflix is a terrific company and they've had a lot of success in putting together quality content as well as acquiring content from existing players and they've been in nonfiction and they're continuing to do some nonfiction. I think, directionally, it's -- they've moved to be more like an HBO. And so I think in terms of where Netflix sits with us, we see them more as a premium service. Both Showtime and HBO also were doing some nonfiction and documentaries. And so we don't really see them as a competitor with our brands. Our focus really has been to get -- to tighten up our brands, focus more on nourishing our core audiences so that we have super fans and we could be reaching them and build a steadier and longer viewership on each of our brands around the world. And we've seen that with Discovery outside the U.S., which is continuing to grow globally; ID which is breaking out, it's growing 10% this year, domestically and more than that outside the U.S.; as well as Oprah and Science and Animal Planet. And so we're really focused on curating through brands and we're finding that our pipeline is strong particularly because of our leadership, with Discovery as the #1 channel for men in the U.S. Yet in the U.S. and almost every market around the world, we're a first place that producers are coming to. Also, because of the amount of volume as well as for each of our other channels. On crime we're #1, because we buy the most in the African-American space now with Oprah. Oprah has become the #1 play. So I think focusing on our brands and nourishing our audience is really the key for us for growth. And I think Netflix is doing quite well and it just reiterates the fact that nonfiction is strong. On DIRECTV NOW, we were able to work out a deal that I think works really well for DIRECTV and for us. The idea with NOW is that they're going to have an opportunity to reach out to subscribers that maybe they couldn't otherwise get. And for us, we think a lot of that, at least hearing from DIRECTV, is going to be a younger demo or cord nevers at least in the initial tranche, but for us, we're well covered. A number of our services are going to be carried and at least 85% of the economics we'll be reaping from each subscriber. And we expect that to the extent that it rolls out and it's meaningful, that we'll find what we have found on smaller bundles around the world; that our viewership becomes stronger. So we've been able to secure a strong position, which I think works well for us and works well for DIRECTV because they have very high-quality services to offer on DIRECTV NOW."

We now have all the majors in tennis, we have all the cycling, we have all the winter sports, that we start to break that out into seasons passes and we've started to experiment with that and Ralph will create the content working with Paul. But Paul's job at DIRECTV was subscriber acquisition and marketing job. And that's what he did for Barry at HSN, that's what he did at DIRECTV. He had a team of over 300 people that drove DIRECTV from 15 million subscribers to 20 million. And he had dashboards that related to customer service, reducing churn, subscriber acquisition, how do you -- where do you go, what are the affinity groups that you go to and how do you attack those groups, at what pricing. And so we have started to hire a significant number of people. We made the decision to put them in London, because we view this group as a disruptor group. So rather than have our existing team that's doing a world-class job of building Eurosport and acquiring that IP, so we have our 3 Eurosport channels across all of Europe, and we have Eurosport.com that Peter Hutton and his team is running and that is profitable and we've been able to get great IP, now we have our BAMTech middleware together with their IP and their know-how. We put it on top of that one of the best guys in the industry with huge experience in offering content to equity consumers. And then Paul, on top of all of it, is responsible to drive it. And look, there is no -- when you think about Europe, with over 700 million people and only 50% pay penetration, there's huge opportunity here, we think, to go over-the-top. There's the 50% that aren't getting any of the Eurosport content at all. And then, even when we're showing the Eurosport content on our channels, we have so much IP that there's a huge amount that's not being seen. And so that will be an attack. Our sports Netflix in Europe is something that we're taking seriously, and we see it as a disruptor, and we think it could be a huge value creator. But we think it's just the beginning, because when we look at all of our IP now, we've spent the last 4 years building our content, owning it on all platforms and whether it's Science, whether it's auto, whether it's African-American, we think that there's an opportunity with all that content paid for to go direct-to-consumer, either for a fee or for free, and build additional economics and some additional bites of the apple."

So this year, globally, Discovery is up in a meaningful way. In the U.S., we are down a little bit. We're still the #1 network for men in the U.S. We still beat ESPN 6 of the last 12 months. And we have -- but we have a group that we're talking to everyday that feels like Discovery really is on brand. We could put more content on there just to get ratings or we could put content on there that would be very U.S. centric. But we really look at Discovery as a global platform and measure it in terms of how we're gaining share around the world. Rich Ross had a huge success with his mini-series, Harley and the Davidsons. And we took that around the world and we're finding some meaningful success with that. Gold Rush is back and doing quite well. Alaska: The Last Frontier is back. So we have a lot of content coming in the fourth quarter. I think you'll see some meaningful improvement, but most importantly, the channel's on brand. We've done well with our scripted series and we have some real documentaries that are meaningful that have been on the air that are reminding people of what Discovery is when it's at its best. So we feel good about Discovery. TLC has been a challenge. But I think we're making the turn. We now have a Sunday night that's really strong with 90 Day Fiancé, where we're #1 or #2 for women on Sunday night again. The overall trend in the last few weeks has been better. But we've worked really hard over the last 18 months on our development and on figuring out how -- what is TLC when it's at its best. And how has it changed over the last couple of years. Where did we lose some acceleration? And Nancy Daniels and her team, together with the global TLC team has been digging in, and we think we have some good content coming up in the fourth and first quarter, so we think that we can help turn that around. And each of these channels are a bit of a -- at times are a bit of challenge. Oprah was a challenge for us, the OWN Network, and now it's a top 10 or 12 network in America, and it's #1 for African-Americans. For a period of time, ID 1.5 years ago was strong. And Henry and his team, we got -- really focused on what is ID, how do we nourish that audience and now it's back on track and growing in a meaningful way and it's #1 for women. And so I think our creative teams are strong. We're not going to have all 14 of our channels growing all at the same time. But as we look at our overall share globally, whether it's in the women's category or the men's, over the last year, we continue to grow."

But I'll say that, look, we had a very good equitable argument when we went into our renewals a few years ago. When we did the deals, 8 years ago, 7 years ago, 5 years ago, we were getting about 5% or 6% share, we were getting about 4% or 5% of the money. Our share went up to 12% or 13%. We launched ID. It became #1 for women. We launched OWN and it was successful. Discovery came back to being #1. And we invested a lot more in content. So when we went out to all the distributors, we were able to get a significant step up and double-digit increases. And now we're done with all of our deals and that's true across the board. We were also able to secure good protection for our channels against tiering and real protection that we were going to get carried in a meaningful way in any offering. It helps us that our Top 5 or 6 channels represent about 85% or 87% of the money. Exactly what happens with DIRECTV NOW and where that growth comes from, we don't see that as being an issue. We see it as being an opportunity. There's a lot of people that probably were unable to afford the traditional DIRECTV product; that may buy that $35 product. And if they do, we're going to have a lot of channels on there. Each of those channels are very strong brands, and we've seen in markets like Brazil and Mexico and in many of the markets in Europe where we only have half of our channels carried, if we can preserve most of the economics, the viewership on those channels grow and the strength of the brands grow. And so we're rooting for DIRECTV with NOW. We also think that creates a nice marketplace driver. So if the other distributors in the market decide to do something like that, the biggest impediment right now is the price of cable in the U.S. It's something that we don't see in most markets around the world. And it's mostly driven by high sports fees. And so the biggest issue that we have in Northern Europe, Rich, is it's one of the few markets where cable TV is $100. And the result of cable being $100 is that there have been a lot of people that have gone to other services or disconnected. And that's not true across all most of Europe or Latin America. And here in the U.S., one of the things that stops -- that has stopped the growth of cable is pricing in all that sports. So the idea that somebody can do a $35 offering, we can get most of our economics and more share, that's a positive. The second thing is we've already gone directly to consumers with Discovery GO, which is going very well so far. And as I said, 50% of the people that are spending time with Discovery GO are under 34 and about 40% are under 25. And they're watching an hour and they're watching all the commercials. And so we've already said that next year, we expect at least 1% of additional growth in ad sales because of Discovery GO. And we think it could be north of that. And we have a Dplay product in Europe, where we're also going direct-to-consumer. So we're learning a lot about all that and I think you'll see all the work that we did, where we said, ""Let's not fight for ratings; let's fight for super fans and strength of brand,"" that we'll be able to take that brand to people around the world. I've said it before, but when you -- you take like a science product. What would a science app that's $1.99 or $2.99 when we already have it in 55 languages look like if we could take it around the world and make it available to the over billion subscribers that currently get our content. And so we think with our content paid for, direct-to-consumer is an opportunity. But I would say that we really view the existing ecosystem as quite solid. So I think owning great content that has super fans and being able to take that to consumers is a real opportunity for additional meaningful growth. And in the case of sports, it could be a huge driver for us. But the existing ecosystem around the world remains strong. And I think it's more of what's going to be in 4, 5, and 6 years, in terms of getting directly to consumer or 7, and in the next few, where things seem really pretty stable around the world when you look at subscribers."

Yes, so the answer to the question around volume growth in Southern Europe and really, it also applies to Latin America and Eastern Europe, it's what we called the power ratio. We've talked before about the share of economics following the share of viewership. And if you look at those 3 regions, Latin America, Southern Europe and Eastern Europe, you're still seeing strong double-digit growth there because we just have so much catch up to do relative to economics following viewership and share. So you'll continue to see us talk about while Olympics certainly was some headwind in those markets, no question that just the overall trend of our performance, from a macro perspective and from an economics perspective, continues to be a great tailwind for us. With regard to Eurosport, look, we don't anymore split out Eurosport, but only because it's so integrated now with the rest of the business. We go to the affiliate marketplace as one company, a lot of the ad sales now while we're seeing some tremendous ad growth on Eurosport given its new platform, we don't think of it as being a stand-alone entity anymore from a reporting perspective. So while margins are a little less -- still positive, a little less given the dynamics of sports rights relative to some of the third quarter ad sales challenges that we talked about, no question the trend there is still positive. We're still seeing a growth in the top line for Eurosport-related product, and we're still seeing, over the long term, profit growth and margin growth for that asset."

So when you look to Northern Europe, if you exclude that and you exclude the U.K. where Brexit has presented real challenges in terms of the advertising market, we're seeing in Latin America and throughout Europe high single mostly double-digit growth still.

We think we can improve it a little bit, but we can't say right now whether the viewership levels on television are going to continue to decline or ameliorate.

So we feel like that's on a good track. We're really working on driving new authentication. When it comes to our sports product, we are putting in place a team that will work on margin. The best in the best case is one of the things that you saw with AT&T is something that I've been talking about for 1.5 years that we've been seeing. We've been seeing -- it used to be the triple play, but more and more in Europe now, you're seeing the quadruple play. You're seeing wireless, broadband, multichannel to the home. There's still some fixed phone, but it's much less relevant as we all know. And so with that type, there comes a commoditization, and we saw it across Europe as BT started -- tried to decommoditize their platform by owning special IP, you see it with Deutsche Telekom, you see it with Vodafone, you see it with Telenor, you see it in Latin America. So for a long time, I've been saying that, that type is getting commoditized. And when you're holding onto that type, if there's 1 or 2 guys next door that are offering the same thing, it becomes a real challenge and it's almost a race to the bottom. And so we've seen that around the world. And the reach when that happens is IT to decommoditize the platform. And so some of the deals that we've been able to do whether it's with Canal Plus, whether it's discussions with the mobile guys, which is something that we're having now much more aggressively, where everyone's looking for IP to attach to their pipe, to decommoditize it. And so when -- I think that the -- the positive side of AT&T is it's an affirmation that owning great IP is important. Of course, it's raises some significant issues for content owners in terms of how they're going to be carried on, on their platform. But the point is that the right deals for us in Europe or Latin America could be quite advantageous to driving this product. There's no reason why this product shouldn't be driven by the mobile players across Europe. And so if you buy a particular wireless product, you can get the Eurosport Player. If you sign up for a particular distributor, you can get the Eurosport Player. They can build for it. So we expect that over the next period of time that there'll be some bundling of our product just like Netflix is now getting bundled with Liberty Global or bundled with other distributors, that it's a way of making an offering. The difference is that in some of the markets in Europe, it could be exclusive. So we could be marketing ourselves direct to the consumer. We have Eurosport, so people are watching the sport that they love. We could be telling them the next match is on the Eurosport Player, so sign up. So we could be our own direct promotion through unsold inventory, which makes us unique and different from Netflix. But -- so we have our direct reach, and we have 10 to 12 channels in each market, where we're reaching specific demos. But then there's also, we think, the opportunity over time -- over the near term, over the next year or 2, once we have this best-of-class player working with Bowman and BAMTech and we have the product that we think works because we have the IP that we think works, that we start to have distributors become subdistributors for us, which we think also will reduce churn in a meaningful way because we'll be packaged along with other billing by distributors. So this idea of the quadruple play and this fight to decommoditized the pipe, I think for people that own IP and could offer it across all of the different platforms, it's going to be a real meaningful opportunity for growth."

But directionally, even though we have between 10 and 12 channels, in most markets, we have 8 that represents 85% or 90% of our economics or 85% or 90% of our share. And so that's where we're focusing. And as we look at a world that's going to be changing over the next couple of years, we've been spending most of our time making sure those channels are stronger, those brands are stronger and the people that are watching those networks feel more connected and affiliated with."

We were doing with Seeker and SourceFed about 0.5 billion streams. And we found that those streams actually had very good CPMs, but we needed a sales team, which we had, that was selling those 500 million streams, and when we went to talk to advertisers, they liked the demo that we had, but we were like the -- we were #20 in line. So putting this together with Thrillist, The Dodo and Now This, we get a number of things. One is we get 3.5 billion to 4 billion streams a month, which gives us -- makes us the #3, #4, or #5 player in the space. So already advertisers are calling us saying we like the demo that you have, we like the scale that you have, how can we do more business with you? That's number one. Two is there's an ad sales team that's now working for Ben Lerer, a very strong CEO that's running the whole business, and we'll be able to take advantage of having 1 big sales team sell the 3.5 billion to 4 billion streams, which is a real advantage. The third is they have a fantastic data analytics business, which is -- we were faced with the question of do we build a very big sales team, do we build a big data analytics structure and how do we scale up our 0.5 billion? And so we view this is a 3-part. We got the 3.5 billion to 4 billion, so we got scale. We have a great sales team as we picked the best and the brightest of all these companies and Ben pulls it together. And the third is we got a great data analytics structure. I mean that data analytics structure built Now This in the last 1.5 years to be the #1 provider of news on Facebook. And they also have 2 SnapChat channels. So for us, we got scale, we have data analytics, we have an ad sales team that we could rely on. We're more in the front of the line. And we were out in San Francisco last week, we're with the Facebook guys and we're -- they're transitioning their platform to video and we're in the top 2 or 3 providers of video for Facebook. And we got to work on how do we monetize that content and that's why we were out there talking to them. Our 1 and 1.5 minute videos are generating so much energy for Facebook, how do we get more value out of that? It's not in our plan right now that it's going to happen. But if it does happen, which I think eventually hopefully, it will, this -- the value of a business like this could be huge. And finally, we pick up a stronger relationship with SnapChat where we pick up 2 channels. And so I think, for us, we now own 39% of it, we got a great leadership team running it, we'll see over the next few years how it develops and it gives us great optionality and it gives us a great support system. Finally, Eurosport and the whole partnership with them, that relates to sports. And we're going to be going at that very hard. And remember, the reason why we think it's so compelling is that Netflix spends over $6 billion or $7 billion a year on content. We're going to be offering our sports content across Europe and our cost of content is 0 because we're already making -- our margins are already in the teens for Eurosport. And so this could be a very profitable business for us. It's not that different from the cable players that were able to build a business model on the coaxial cable and multichannel to the home and then being able to take a second bite at the apple and offer broadband without a lot of cost. And so we have to prove it out, but we think we got -- we have something quite strong. When it comes to Science or auto, that's something we can offer globally. It's -- and we can offer it direct-to-consumer, we can offer it through distributors because we already are -- we have a huge amount of that content in language, and we're just playing that with the best way to offer it. And we're having a lot of discussions with consumers about what they like, what they like about our content and how to package it."

I'm pleased to join you this morning during a very exciting time for the media industry. As the industry continues to evolve at an increasingly rapid pace, we know that powerful and loved content is still king. Discovery remains",1946,"Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to join you this morning during a very exciting time for the media industry. As the industry continues to evolve at an increasingly rapid pace, we know that powerful and loved content is still king. 
Discovery remains focused on diversifying and augmenting the value of our global content portfolio of strong brands and franchises in over 220 markets around the world.
We have continued to strengthen our traditional pay-TV dual revenue streams, while investing to drive additional value on pay-TV and across new digital platforms. 
Since our last call, we've made some key strategic investments. We have seen expected, but still difficult, third quarter advertising results, in part due to the Olympics.
We've completed a major U.S. distribution deal and we've watched a continuation of strong trends in distribution revenue, which are 50% of our U.S. and 50% of our international businesses. That long-cycle domestic and international revenue mix makes Discovery unlike any other U.S.-based multichannel network company.
Today, I want to talk about 5 major developments since our last earnings call: our new CFO; 2 strategic investments; the financial foundation provided by our large distribution deals; and gains in our digital rollout that bring increased focus on our digital monetization.
First, as you know, Gunnar Wiedenfels will join us early next year as CFO. Andy Warren has graciously agreed to extend his contract term to ensure a smooth transition of CFO responsibilities. And a big thank you for that, Andy, and for all of your service -- great service over the past 5 years. 
Gunnar's experience as CFO of publicly-traded ProSieben is perfectly aligned with Discovery's future and growth portfolio. ProSieben, one of Europe's major media companies, operates multiple broadcast and cable networks and is also Germany's leading online video marketer. We are excited to bring Gunnar onto the team as Discovery continues our rapid growth and diversification in new content and digital platforms around the world.
Second, is a key strategic partnership for Europe. Today, I'm extremely pleased to announce that Discovery and MLB Advanced Media have created a joint venture to form BAMTech Europe. This platform partnership leverages Eurosport, the dominant player in sports rights across Europe with unparalleled reach, and BAMTech's world-class digital technology service. 
Discovery will remain the 100% owner of Eurosport and all of its IP as well as its digital platforms. This partnership will greatly accelerate Eurosport's access to over 700 million people in Europe, gaining just 1% of the European population to subscribe to the Eurosport Player, would equal 7 million subscribers.
BAMTech's state-of-the-art back-end video platform and service will be implemented in 2017 across all of Eurosport Digital products, which today include Eurosport.com, the continent's #1 sports new website with 60 million users a month; and the Eurosport Player, what we call our sports Netflix, the leading subscription-based OTT sports platform across Europe, giving fans an all-access pass, any time and on any device in 52 countries.
In addition, we will have access to select MLBAM content in Europe for direct-to-consumer distribution.
BAMTech Europe also will work with a broad set of sports and entertainment content owners, broadcasters and OTT platforms to enhance their digital capabilities, reach and performance across the continent.
Third is an investment to change our content and IP mix and help Discovery grow into a leader in short form and mobile content for the next decade. Last month, we announced that we will be investing $100 million in entering into a strategic partnership to create a new media holding company called Group Nine Media. We will contribute 2 of our digital assets, Seeker and SourceFed Studios, digital networks and we'll combine them with independent digital networks, Thrillist, Now This, which is the #1 video news publisher on Facebook, The Dodo as well as 2 SnapChat channels that belong to the Now This portfolio.
With 3.5 billion monthly video views across all of these millennial-focused brands, Group Nine will be a top 5 digital-first content and social video company on day 1, with a best-in-class leadership team, tremendous brands, reach and scale. We will own 39% of Group Nine, and importantly, we have the option to acquire full ownership in the future.
Fourth is another big distribution agreement. We completed a successful renegotiation with AT&T DIRECTV, so we will continue to reach their 25 million subscribers in the U.S. at very favorable rates. The DIRECTV agreement is in line with our other recent deals. This long-term contract not only helps secure our linear distribution growth, but it also means Discovery's content will be available across all DIRECTV platforms on a favorable basis, including the soon-to-be-launched OTT DIRECTV NOW streaming product. 
The importance of long-term international and domestic distribution deals like our recent deals with DIRECTV, Liberty Global and Telenor cannot be overstated. In the U.S., with the successful completion of our DIRECTV deal, we won't have another major renewal until the end of next year. 
Internationally, while there were some onetime items last year that impact third quarter growth, we expect double-digit underlying organic growth for the next few years.
As our stronger premium content portfolio that now includes leadership in sports in Europe is translating into much stronger price increases as deals are renewed, there is no question that the addition of sports and the upcoming Olympics to our nonfiction portfolio in Europe is bolstering our profile with distributors and reinforcing the must-have nature of our suite of brands. 
Half of our total company revenues come from these agreements. And our built-in price escalators provide a solid, stable foundation of growth, even as advertising fluctuates. This stability is what gives us the optionality to monetize our content on existing and emerging platforms and is further evidence of the strength of our brands and our content.
Two recent examples of our brands resonating with audiences are OWN and ID. With new hits like Queen Sugar and Greenleaf, a strong Saturday night and Tyler Perry programming continued to deliver audiences. OWN is the #1 network for African-American women in America and prime delivery is up 12% year-to-date. And for a few weeks this quarter, OWN was a top 10 network in America for women. ID continued to score big in the third quarter, ranking as the #1 network for women in August, September and October. Number one. 
JonBenet, an American mystery story, is this year's best new nonfiction cable series, and ID's best ever across demos. And this series also drew record audiences in the U.K. and ID's international viewership growth was up double digits, yet again.
The fifth topic I want to discuss is our digital strategy. Our global digital strategy is pretty simple, get our own content to as many people as possible across all screens and platforms and fill in with digital-only content as needed. 
A key tenant of our digital strategy and driving incremental revenue growth is TV Everywhere. In Latin America, our kids' digital product continues to gain traction, with Discovery Kids Play now in front of over 40 million households. 
In the U.S., Paul Guyardo and team have done a great job with the recent launch of our authenticated network apps and websites, which now give cable and satellite customers the ability to watch our long-form content anytime, anywhere and on practically any device. We've made real significant progress with our authenticated offering in this past year. 
A year ago, our TV Everywhere footprint was in just over 20% of the U.S. Today, our footprint covers over 70% of the country. The national launch of our TV Everywhere apps that we call GO, occurred on August 9. It's early days, but we have already learned a lot and initial results are quite promising.
First, 50% of the streams are coming from 18- to 34-year-olds. This gives us confidence that our content is relevant to a younger audience. We just had to put it on a different platform for them to consume it. 
Second, we're seeing strong pricing. CPMs for GO are at a big premium versus our linear nets, largely because the length of view is almost an hour and the Millennial delivery is so strong.
Third, consumption patterns appear to be 60% recent episodes and 40% older titles, which is a strong testament to our deep, rich library and the fact that consumers are seeking out our programming, even over a week after it's aired. 
Finally, our only real material challenge is our authentication rate, which is a common challenge for all programmers and distributors. But we're working with our distribution partners to address it. For example, we've just launched home-based authentication with Comcast, which removes a huge barrier by eliminating the password requirement on sign in, and road maps to do the same with other MVPDs are in the works.
We also continue to make strides in Europe. In some markets of Europe, the pay television penetration is lower than in mature markets. And that provides new digital opportunities to leverage the investments we have been making in sports rights beyond our linear business. Of the 320 million homes in Europe, 160 million homes currently have Eurosport, but 160 million homes currently do not have access to Eurosport on TV, primarily because they are non-pay-TV households.
That 160 million is more than all the households in the U.S. For future digital delivery, there are nearly 200 million wired broadband subscriptions and nearly 600 million mobile data subscriptions across Europe, more than all the fixed and wireless data subs in the U.S., together, making Europe the most important continent for sports growth an opportunity over-the-top.
So there are clearly 2 routes to sports expansion in Europe: linear and digital, and we are attacking both. To help drive our Eurosport Digital effort, I've asked Paul Guyardo to now oversee Eurosport's digital businesses. Paul worked with Barry Diller for many years at HSN, and worked at DIRECTV, where Paul and his subscriber-acquisition team built DIRECTV from 15 million subs to over 20 million subs. Following the successful launch of our GO apps in the U.S., Paul will take his skills to Eurosport's digital operations. 
And we're building a world-class team with new expertise to manage our direct-to-consumer business out of London. We recently hired Ralph Rivera to be the Managing Director of Eurosport Digital, and he will take over the day-to-day operations. Ralph joins us from the BBC, where he was responsible for all of the BBC's digital media services, leading the implementation and operation of BBC iPlayer as it grew by over 300%. And not coincidentally, he delivered BBC's first truly digital Olympic Games for London in 2012, providing solid in-house expertise as we get access to the Olympic Rings on January 1 of next year.
Today, we own the content for our linear businesses, and we have the right to use that content to build our global digital businesses. As I've told many of you, because we own the sports content for both linear and digital, I've begun to think of this as an opportunity to build a Netflix for sports in Europe. 
We are also exploring creating services for Science, in the auto space and for other niche genres in the U.S. and around the world. Additional direct-to-consumer opportunities, so our super fans can access our content where they want, on whatever device, whenever they want. 
So in closing, we continue to secure important, long-term distribution deals and invest and add key personnel to support global growth across all platforms to assure that Discovery Communications continues to evolve globally and digitally, way beyond the way the traditional U.S.-based multichannel network company can evolve.
And now I'll turn the call over to Andy."
22666093,382600100,1069246,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As expected and previously communicated, our third quarter was challenging, but our financial and operating trends in the fourth quarter are much better and our robust full year outlook is still very",1356,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As expected and previously communicated, our third quarter was challenging, but our financial and operating trends in the fourth quarter are much better and our robust full year outlook is still very much intact. 
Importantly, as David mentioned, while the media landscape is rapidly changing, Discovery's global content portfolio of well-loved and increasingly diversified brands makes us uniquely well-positioned for long-term growth. 
Half of our revenue base is derived from affiliate, which is well-positioned for strong and sustained growth, given the multiyear nature of our contracts with built-in price escalators. We also remain highly focused on controlling our noncontent operating cost growth, while thoughtfully investing in content and OTT platforms.
As we have consistently highlighted, 2 of our most critical competitive advantages are our flexible cost structures and the fact that we own or control the vast majority of our content across all global platforms. These advantages give us tremendous operational flexibility and optionality and allow us to fully maximize our long-term profit growth.
Now let's dive into our third quarter results. Excluding currency, total company revenues were up 3% and adjusted OIBDA grew 1%. Net income available to Discovery Communications of $290 million decreased versus the third quarter a year ago, primarily due to a $50 million or $0.08 per share noncash after-tax write-down of our Lionsgate's equity position.
Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter were $0.36 and adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.40, down 15% versus last year's third quarter. Excluding the $0.08 impact from this onetime Lionsgate write-down, third quarter adjusted EPS would have been $0.48, up slightly year-over-year. Excluding both, negative currency impacts, as well as a Lionsgate write-down, adjusted EPS was up 5% for the third quarter and up fully 18% for the year-to-date.
Third quarter free cash flow increased 75% to $410 million, primarily due to lower cash taxes and improved working capital turns. Impressively, constant-currency free cash flow increased 112% for the quarter and increased 72% for the first 9 months of the year. Our total company free cash flow growth has clearly accelerated.
Turning now to the operating units. Our U.S. network revenues were up 2% as our 7% affiliate growth was offset by a 3% decline in advertising growth, which was fully expected due to the Olympics as well as the timing of Shark Week this year. Excluding the Olympic impact, U.S. advertising would have been up low single digits.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect fourth quarter advertising to be flat after taking into account the small, approximately 50-basis-point impact from the deconsolidation of our Discovery Digital Networks relating to our recently announced Group Nine deal.
Our domestic distribution revenues were up 7%, while total portfolio subs again declined almost 2% versus the third quarter of last year. We continue to benefit from the significantly higher locked-in rate increases we've solidified in all of our recent affiliate deals, including our new deal with DIRECTV. We are extremely pleased with the outcome of this latest renewal, which was completed at very favorable rates and in line with our other strong U.S. affiliate deals. The DIRECTV renewal was truly a win-win as our content will be available across all DIRECTV platforms, including their soon-to-be-launched OTT DIRECTV NOW streaming product.
Domestic operating expenses in the quarter were actually down 1% as we remain laser-focused on controlling our non-content cost growth, resulting in 3% adjusted OIBDA growth and 100 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion to 58%. Total domestic operating expenses are expected to be flat to down again in the fourth quarter. 
Turning now to our international operations. The 3Q comps to last year are simpler, as there were no major acquisitions or divestitures to normalize. So my following comments will refer to our organic results, which need to only exclude currency impacts. 
International organic revenues increased 2%, with distribution revenues up 8% and advertising revenues down 2%. Our 8% affiliate revenue growth was primarily due to higher affiliate rates in Latin America, CEEMEA and in Northern Europe, where we have been successful in leveraging our expanded content portfolio that now includes sports to drive higher contracted pricing step-ups, but was partially offset by a couple of onetime items in Europe and Asia in the third quarter of last year.
We still expect constant-currency distribution growth over the next several years to be up at least low double digits as we continue to benefit from our stronger, more diversified portfolio of networks and higher contracted price escalators.
Turning to our third quarter national advertising. Overall results were meaningfully impacted by the Olympics and while we benefited from higher volumes in Southern Europe and higher pricing and volumes in CEEMEA, growth in these markets was more than offset by declines in Northern Europe, our largest advertising region.
Northern Europe was clearly heavily impacted by Brexit and other macro-related weaknesses as well as softer ratings at our female-skewing networks. Trends, however, are improving in the fourth quarter, with all regions seeing improved results. Therefore, we expect fourth quarter year-over-year advertising growth to improve by several hundred basis points versus this third quarter's growth rate.
International operating expenses grew 6% in the third quarter, primarily due to higher sports content and production costs, but total international cost growth will slow in the fourth quarter.
Now taking a look at share repurchases. In the third quarter, we repurchased a total of $374 million worth of shares, and we have repurchased $1.5 billion of stock over the last 4 quarters as we committed to on last year's third quarter call.
We now have spent a total of $7.8 billion buying back shares as we began our buyback program at the end of 2010. On a stock split-adjusted basis, we have now reduced our gross outstanding share count by 34% and by 30% net of employee equity awards.
We were still very comfortable with our current gross leverage ratio of 3.3x, given both our high degree of confidence and our free cash flow, growth forecast as well as our robust 16% and growing free cash flow to debt yield. We have significant flexibility around our deployment of capital and are extremely committed to remaining investment-grade rated company.
Very importantly, we are well within the financial ratios prescribed by all 3 rating agencies to maintain our current investment-grade debt rating. 
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we will continue our share repurchases, but our available capital for buybacks will be impacted by the $100 million investment in Group Nine. But 4Q share repurchases will not be impacted by the BAMTech Europe deal due to its immaterial investment size.
Now let's give you our forward-looking guidance. For full year 2016, we still expect constant-currency free cash flow to grow in the high teen range and constant-currency adjusted EPS, excluding the Lionsgate write-down, to grow at least 20%. 
We are also reiterating our 2015 to 2018 3-year guidance of constant-currency adjusted EPS and free cash flow growth CAGRs, both growing at least low teens or better.
I also want to update the expected year-over-year foreign exchange impact on our full year operating results. Thanks to our effective hedging strategy, the expected year-over-year FX impact on our financials has not changed since our last call, despite some of our major currencies, especially the pound, recently weakening. 
Assuming current spot rates stay constant for the rest of the year, FX is still expected to reduce our constant-currency revenues by $150 million to $160 million, and our constant-currency adjusted OIBDA by $80 million to $90 million. 
In addition, we still expect a positive FX impact to adjusted EPS of $0.02 to $0.06, due to the net effect of this year's adjusted OIBDA impact and the year-over-year change in the below-the-line FX impact.
In closing, as I near the end of my tenure at Discovery, I'm extremely optimistic about Discovery's current global content portfolio, our optionality given our ownership of content and flexible cost structures, and our overall financial and operating momentum. 
Now, David and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have."

I think, directionally, it's -- they've moved to be more like an HBO. And so I think in terms of where Netflix sits with us, we see them more as a premium service. Both Showtime and HBO also were doing some nonfiction and documentaries. And so we don't really see them as a competitor with our brands. Our focus really has been to get -- to tighten up our brands, focus more on nourishing our core audiences so that we have super fans and we could be reaching them and build a steadier and longer viewership on each of our brands around the world.

And so we're really focused on curating through brands and we're finding that our pipeline is strong particularly because of our leadership, with Discovery as the #1 channel for men in the U.S. Yet in the U.S. and almost every market around the world, we're a first place that producers are coming to. Also, because of the amount of volume as well as for each of our other channels. On crime we're #1, because we buy the most in the African-American space now with Oprah. Oprah has become the #1 play. So I think focusing on our brands and nourishing our audience is really the key for us for growth. And I think Netflix is doing quite well and it just reiterates the fact that nonfiction is strong. On DIRECTV NOW, we were able to work out a deal that I think works really well for DIRECTV and for us. The idea with NOW is that they're going to have an opportunity to reach out to subscribers that maybe they couldn't otherwise get. And for us, we think a lot of that, at least hearing from DIRECTV, is going to be a younger demo or cord nevers at least in the initial tranche, but for us, we're well covered. A number of our services are going to be carried and at least 85% of the economics we'll be reaping from each subscriber. And we expect that to the extent that it rolls out and it's meaningful, that we'll find what we have found on smaller bundles around the world; that our viewership becomes stronger. So we've been able to secure a strong position, which I think works well for us and works well for DIRECTV because they have very high-quality services to offer on DIRECTV NOW."

BAMTech and getting into business with Bob Bowman is a big piece of that from a middleware perspective as well as access to some additional IP through them. But joint venturing with BAMTech and sharing and investing in a tech platform that we build out throughout Europe, it gives us the best-of-class platform that can hold all the streams and provide a very positive consumer interface, which we think is an improvement over what we have today. In addition, we have Ralph Rivera, who ran the iPlayer, and that's sort of the how do we aggregate all the content and how do we offer it. Is there -- right now, we're offering it as a broad offering. Ralph is looking at subdividing that to specialty groups. We now have all the majors in tennis, we have all the cycling, we have all the winter sports, that we start to break that out into seasons passes and we've started to experiment with that and Ralph will create the content working with Paul. But Paul's job at DIRECTV was subscriber acquisition and marketing job. And that's what he did for Barry at HSN, that's what he did at DIRECTV. He had a team of over 300 people that drove DIRECTV from 15 million subscribers to 20 million. And he had dashboards that related to customer service, reducing churn, subscriber acquisition, how do you -- where do you go, what are the affinity groups that you go to and how do you attack those groups, at what pricing. And so we have started to hire a significant number of people. We made the decision to put them in London, because we view this group as a disruptor group. So rather than have our existing team that's doing a world-class job of building Eurosport and acquiring that IP, so we have our 3 Eurosport channels across all of Europe, and we have Eurosport.com that Peter Hutton and his team is running and that is profitable and we've been able to get great IP, now we have our BAMTech middleware together with their IP and their know-how. We put it on top of that one of the best guys in the industry with huge experience in offering content to equity consumers. And then Paul, on top of all of it, is responsible to drive it. And look, there is no -- when you think about Europe, with over 700 million people and only 50% pay penetration, there's huge opportunity here, we think, to go over-the-top. There's the 50% that aren't getting any of the Eurosport content at all. And then, even when we're showing the Eurosport content on our channels, we have so much IP that there's a huge amount that's not being seen. And so that will be an attack. Our sports Netflix in Europe is something that we're taking seriously, and we see it as a disruptor, and we think it could be a huge value creator. But we think it's just the beginning, because when we look at all of our IP now, we've spent the last 4 years building our content, owning it on all platforms and whether it's Science, whether it's auto, whether it's African-American, we think that there's an opportunity with all that content paid for to go direct-to-consumer, either for a fee or for free, and build additional economics and some additional bites of the apple."

So this year, globally, Discovery is up in a meaningful way. In the U.S., we are down a little bit. We're still the #1 network for men in the U.S. We still beat ESPN 6 of the last 12 months. And we have -- but we have a group that we're talking to everyday that feels like Discovery really is on brand. We could put more content on there just to get ratings or we could put content on there that would be very U.S. centric. But we really look at Discovery as a global platform and measure it in terms of how we're gaining share around the world. Rich Ross had a huge success with his mini-series, Harley and the Davidsons. And we took that around the world and we're finding some meaningful success with that. Gold Rush is back and doing quite well. Alaska: The Last Frontier is back. So we have a lot of content coming in the fourth quarter. I think you'll see some meaningful improvement, but most importantly, the channel's on brand. We've done well with our scripted series and we have some real documentaries that are meaningful that have been on the air that are reminding people of what Discovery is when it's at its best. So we feel good about Discovery. TLC has been a challenge. But I think we're making the turn. We now have a Sunday night that's really strong with 90 Day Fiancé, where we're #1 or #2 for women on Sunday night again. The overall trend in the last few weeks has been better. But we've worked really hard over the last 18 months on our development and on figuring out how -- what is TLC when it's at its best. And how has it changed over the last couple of years. Where did we lose some acceleration? And Nancy Daniels and her team, together with the global TLC team has been digging in, and we think we have some good content coming up in the fourth and first quarter, so we think that we can help turn that around. And each of these channels are a bit of a -- at times are a bit of challenge. Oprah was a challenge for us, the OWN Network, and now it's a top 10 or 12 network in America, and it's #1 for African-Americans. For a period of time, ID 1.5 years ago was strong. And Henry and his team, we got -- really focused on what is ID, how do we nourish that audience and now it's back on track and growing in a meaningful way and it's #1 for women. And so I think our creative teams are strong. We're not going to have all 14 of our channels growing all at the same time. But as we look at our overall share globally, whether it's in the women's category or the men's, over the last year, we continue to grow."

But I'll say that, look, we had a very good equitable argument when we went into our renewals a few years ago. When we did the deals, 8 years ago, 7 years ago, 5 years ago, we were getting about 5% or 6% share, we were getting about 4% or 5% of the money. Our share went up to 12% or 13%. We launched ID. It became #1 for women. We launched OWN and it was successful. Discovery came back to being #1. And we invested a lot more in content. So when we went out to all the distributors, we were able to get a significant step up and double-digit increases. And now we're done with all of our deals and that's true across the board. We were also able to secure good protection for our channels against tiering and real protection that we were going to get carried in a meaningful way in any offering. It helps us that our Top 5 or 6 channels represent about 85% or 87% of the money. Exactly what happens with DIRECTV NOW and where that growth comes from, we don't see that as being an issue. We see it as being an opportunity. There's a lot of people that probably were unable to afford the traditional DIRECTV product; that may buy that $35 product. And if they do, we're going to have a lot of channels on there. Each of those channels are very strong brands, and we've seen in markets like Brazil and Mexico and in many of the markets in Europe where we only have half of our channels carried, if we can preserve most of the economics, the viewership on those channels grow and the strength of the brands grow. And so we're rooting for DIRECTV with NOW. We also think that creates a nice marketplace driver. So if the other distributors in the market decide to do something like that, the biggest impediment right now is the price of cable in the U.S. It's something that we don't see in most markets around the world. And it's mostly driven by high sports fees. And so the biggest issue that we have in Northern Europe, Rich, is it's one of the few markets where cable TV is $100. And the result of cable being $100 is that there have been a lot of people that have gone to other services or disconnected. And that's not true across all most of Europe or Latin America. And here in the U.S., one of the things that stops -- that has stopped the growth of cable is pricing in all that sports. So the idea that somebody can do a $35 offering, we can get most of our economics and more share, that's a positive. The second thing is we've already gone directly to consumers with Discovery GO, which is going very well so far. And as I said, 50% of the people that are spending time with Discovery GO are under 34 and about 40% are under 25. And they're watching an hour and they're watching all the commercials. And so we've already said that next year, we expect at least 1% of additional growth in ad sales because of Discovery GO. And we think it could be north of that. And we have a Dplay product in Europe, where we're also going direct-to-consumer. So we're learning a lot about all that and I think you'll see all the work that we did, where we said, ""Let's not fight for ratings; let's fight for super fans and strength of brand,"" that we'll be able to take that brand to people around the world. I've said it before, but when you -- you take like a science product. What would a science app that's $1.99 or $2.99 when we already have it in 55 languages look like if we could take it around the world and make it available to the over billion subscribers that currently get our content. And so we think with our content paid for, direct-to-consumer is an opportunity. But I would say that we really view the existing ecosystem as quite solid. So I think owning great content that has super fans and being able to take that to consumers is a real opportunity for additional meaningful growth. And in the case of sports, it could be a huge driver for us. But the existing ecosystem around the world remains strong. And I think it's more of what's going to be in 4, 5, and 6 years, in terms of getting directly to consumer or 7, and in the next few, where things seem really pretty stable around the world when you look at subscribers."

Yes, so the answer to the question around volume growth in Southern Europe and really, it also applies to Latin America and Eastern Europe, it's what we called the power ratio. We've talked before about the share of economics following the share of viewership. And if you look at those 3 regions, Latin America, Southern Europe and Eastern Europe, you're still seeing strong double-digit growth there because we just have so much catch up to do relative to economics following viewership and share. So you'll continue to see us talk about while Olympics certainly was some headwind in those markets, no question that just the overall trend of our performance, from a macro perspective and from an economics perspective, continues to be a great tailwind for us. With regard to Eurosport, look, we don't anymore split out Eurosport, but only because it's so integrated now with the rest of the business. We go to the affiliate marketplace as one company, a lot of the ad sales now while we're seeing some tremendous ad growth on Eurosport given its new platform, we don't think of it as being a stand-alone entity anymore from a reporting perspective. So while margins are a little less -- still positive, a little less given the dynamics of sports rights relative to some of the third quarter ad sales challenges that we talked about, no question the trend there is still positive. We're still seeing a growth in the top line for Eurosport-related product, and we're still seeing, over the long term, profit growth and margin growth for that asset."

So we feel like that's on a good track. We're really working on driving new authentication. When it comes to our sports product, we are putting in place a team that will work on margin. The best in the best case is one of the things that you saw with AT&T is something that I've been talking about for 1.5 years that we've been seeing. We've been seeing -- it used to be the triple play, but more and more in Europe now, you're seeing the quadruple play. You're seeing wireless, broadband, multichannel to the home. There's still some fixed phone, but it's much less relevant as we all know. And so with that type, there comes a commoditization, and we saw it across Europe as BT started -- tried to decommoditize their platform by owning special IP, you see it with Deutsche Telekom, you see it with Vodafone, you see it with Telenor, you see it in Latin America. So for a long time, I've been saying that, that type is getting commoditized. And when you're holding onto that type, if there's 1 or 2 guys next door that are offering the same thing, it becomes a real challenge and it's almost a race to the bottom. And so we've seen that around the world. And the reach when that happens is IT to decommoditize the platform. And so some of the deals that we've been able to do whether it's with Canal Plus, whether it's discussions with the mobile guys, which is something that we're having now much more aggressively, where everyone's looking for IP to attach to their pipe, to decommoditize it. And so when -- I think that the -- the positive side of AT&T is it's an affirmation that owning great IP is important. Of course, it's raises some significant issues for content owners in terms of how they're going to be carried on, on their platform. But the point is that the right deals for us in Europe or Latin America could be quite advantageous to driving this product. There's no reason why this product shouldn't be driven by the mobile players across Europe. And so if you buy a particular wireless product, you can get the Eurosport Player. If you sign up for a particular distributor, you can get the Eurosport Player. They can build for it. So we expect that over the next period of time that there'll be some bundling of our product just like Netflix is now getting bundled with Liberty Global or bundled with other distributors, that it's a way of making an offering. The difference is that in some of the markets in Europe, it could be exclusive. So we could be marketing ourselves direct to the consumer. We have Eurosport, so people are watching the sport that they love. We could be telling them the next match is on the Eurosport Player, so sign up. So we could be our own direct promotion through unsold inventory, which makes us unique and different from Netflix. But -- so we have our direct reach, and we have 10 to 12 channels in each market, where we're reaching specific demos. But then there's also, we think, the opportunity over time -- over the near term, over the next year or 2, once we have this best-of-class player working with Bowman and BAMTech and we have the product that we think works because we have the IP that we think works, that we start to have distributors become subdistributors for us, which we think also will reduce churn in a meaningful way because we'll be packaged along with other billing by distributors. So this idea of the quadruple play and this fight to decommoditized the pipe, I think for people that own IP and could offer it across all of the different platforms, it's going to be a real meaningful opportunity for growth."

David, you mentioned before the 14 network brands in the States, something like 85% of the economics in the top 6. So my question is how do you think about those 8 networks, from both a strategic and financial perspective in their role in your portfolio? Do you still subscribe to the philosophy of just basically trying to invest and grow those and find the next sort of ID? Or maybe is the world changing about how you think of those -- the role of those networks going forward, both in their distribution and their investment and the overhead that's required to maintain them and all of that stuff? Just your thoughts here would be really helpful."

We have been focused on trying to grow. I think, more than anybody else, we've been growing brands domestically and around the world and as you've seen our company evolve over the last 10 years that I've been here, we've taken a meaningful amount of investment and content in new brands. So we've gone from investing $500 million in content to over $2 billion. And as opposed to just growing and defending Discovery and TLC and Animal Planet, there's a number of channels right now that are having a real impact in the U.S. and around the world that didn't exist, whether it's ID, Velocity, which we call DMAX or Turbo around the world, Oprah, which didn't exist a few years ago. And so if you look at our channels, the top 6 represent 85% or 87% of the ratings and 85% or 87% of the economics. That is where our primary focus is. But we have some other niche channels that we're playing around with and they've also been a farm team for us. Some of the content that starts on those channels ends up going to our bigger networks and it's a little bit of a secret sauce for us, Survivorman and How It's Made started on Science, and it became real strong performers on Discovery. And we're still finding that around the world. But directionally, even though we have between 10 and 12 channels, in most markets, we have 8 that represents 85% or 90% of our economics or 85% or 90% of our share. And so that's where we're focusing. And as we look at a world that's going to be changing over the next couple of years, we've been spending most of our time making sure those channels are stronger, those brands are stronger and the people that are watching those networks feel more connected and affiliated with."

You mentioned the other categories you were interested in, like Science and auto. Is that all under Eurosport or is it a European service you're thinking of or something more global? And the second question is on the creation of Group Nine, can you talk about some of the metrics that you're looking at? And when and how will you buy the balance of the 61%?"

We were doing with Seeker and SourceFed about 0.5 billion streams. And we found that those streams actually had very good CPMs, but we needed a sales team, which we had, that was selling those 500 million streams, and when we went to talk to advertisers, they liked the demo that we had, but we were like the -- we were #20 in line. So putting this together with Thrillist, The Dodo and Now This, we get a number of things. One is we get 3.5 billion to 4 billion streams a month, which gives us -- makes us the #3, #4, or #5 player in the space. So already advertisers are calling us saying we like the demo that you have, we like the scale that you have, how can we do more business with you? That's number one. Two is there's an ad sales team that's now working for Ben Lerer, a very strong CEO that's running the whole business, and we'll be able to take advantage of having 1 big sales team sell the 3.5 billion to 4 billion streams, which is a real advantage. The third is they have a fantastic data analytics business, which is -- we were faced with the question of do we build a very big sales team, do we build a big data analytics structure and how do we scale up our 0.5 billion? And so we view this is a 3-part. We got the 3.5 billion to 4 billion, so we got scale. We have a great sales team as we picked the best and the brightest of all these companies and Ben pulls it together. And the third is we got a great data analytics structure. I mean that data analytics structure built Now This in the last 1.5 years to be the #1 provider of news on Facebook. And they also have 2 SnapChat channels. So for us, we got scale, we have data analytics, we have an ad sales team that we could rely on. We're more in the front of the line. And we were out in San Francisco last week, we're with the Facebook guys and we're -- they're transitioning their platform to video and we're in the top 2 or 3 providers of video for Facebook. And we got to work on how do we monetize that content and that's why we were out there talking to them. Our 1 and 1.5 minute videos are generating so much energy for Facebook, how do we get more value out of that? It's not in our plan right now that it's going to happen. But if it does happen, which I think eventually hopefully, it will, this -- the value of a business like this could be huge. And finally, we pick up a stronger relationship with SnapChat where we pick up 2 channels. And so I think, for us, we now own 39% of it, we got a great leadership team running it, we'll see over the next few years how it develops and it gives us great optionality and it gives us a great support system. Finally, Eurosport and the whole partnership with them, that relates to sports. And we're going to be going at that very hard. And remember, the reason why we think it's so compelling is that Netflix spends over $6 billion or $7 billion a year on content. We're going to be offering our sports content across Europe and our cost of content is 0 because we're already making -- our margins are already in the teens for Eurosport. And so this could be a very profitable business for us. It's not that different from the cable players that were able to build a business model on the coaxial cable and multichannel to the home and then being able to take a second bite at the apple and offer broadband without a lot of cost. And so we have to prove it out, but we think we got -- we have something quite strong. When it comes to Science or auto, that's something we can offer globally. It's -- and we can offer it direct-to-consumer, we can offer it through distributors because we already are -- we have a huge amount of that content in language, and we're just playing that with the best way to offer it. And we're having a lot of discussions with consumers about what they like, what they like about our content and how to package it."
