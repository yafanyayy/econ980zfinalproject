398625,316307303,919488,"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2016",2016-01-20,"Earnings Calls","The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the fourth quarter and full year results, and I'm happy to answer any questions. Before outlining our results, I would like to discuss the previously announced settlement for legac",2198,"Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the fourth quarter and full year results, and I'm happy to answer any questions. Before outlining our results, I would like to discuss the previously announced settlement for legacy mortgage activities. As you know, we took a total net provision for litigation and regulatory matters in the fourth quarter of $1.95 billion. The RMBS Working Group matter was the most significant outstanding piece of litigation facing the firm. As you would expect, following the settlement, there has been insignificant decline in our reasonably possible loss number. We are currently estimating a more than 60% decline compared to third quarter levels of $5.3 billion. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Net revenues were $7.3 billion; net earnings were $765 million; and earnings per diluted share were $1.27. With respect to our annual results, we had firm-wide net revenues of $33.8 billion; net earnings of $6.1 billion; earnings per diluted share of $12.14 and a return on common equity of 7.4%. Revenues were down slightly compared with last year, and expenses were significantly higher due to approximately $4 billion of net provisions for litigation and regulatory matters. Despite these headwinds, we grew book value per share by 5%. 
The growth, combined with our risk-reduction efforts, strengthened all of our regulatory capital ratios. Excluding the litigation charges related to the RMBS Working Group, our 2015 return on common equity would have been 380 basis points higher. 
2015 presented both challenges and opportunities. The challenges were more acutely felt in the back half of the year as concerns about global growth intensified. This was reflected in public equity markets with the MSCI World down 5.7% over the last 6 months of the year. Credit markets also reflected these concerns, particularly within the noninvestment-grade space and most acutely within the commodity sector. For example, U.S. high-yield spreads were 157 basis points wider in the second half of 2015. And at the end of 2015, the trailing 12-month default rate for U.S. noninvestment-grade bonds more than doubled year-over-year, climbing to 4.3%. These factors negatively impacted the broader opportunity set for our clients and, as a consequence, for the firm. To varying degrees, the firm faced headwinds within certain of our fixed businesses, underwriting within Investment Banking and our Investing & Lending activities. However, these significant headwinds were largely offset by client activity in other businesses. Many of our clients decided to pursue M&A as the best means for creating shareholder value. Announced M&A volumes for the industry increased by 47% in 2015. The firm's volumes increased by 81%, a significant expansion of our market share. 
Our global Equities franchise also posted strong results for the year. Clients continue to place significant value on the integration of our various services: electronic, cash, derivatives and Prime Brokerage as well as our global footprint. Our performance in 2015 highlighted these strengths. 
In addition, the combination of continued strong performance for our clients and the diversified set of offerings drove a record year for our Investment Management business. We ended the year with record assets under supervision of $1.25 trillion and robust net inflows, which totaled $94 billion. Ultimately, 2015 reinforced a long-standing operating principle that there is tremendous value to having a diversified set of global businesses. More importantly, it is the value of being a leader in these businesses that really counts. 
Now let's discuss the individual businesses in greater detail. As it relates to the quarter, Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.5 billion, slightly lower than the third quarter. A pickup in M&A was offset by a decline in underwriting activity. For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $7 billion, up 9% from 2014 on the back of a 40% increase in Financial Advisory revenues. This was partially offset by lower equity and debt underwriting revenues. 
Our franchise remains very strong. 2015 was our second-highest annual revenues for Investment Banking. We ended the year ranked first in global and announced and completed M&A. Our completed M&A volumes were approximately $350 billion higher than our next closest competitor, a record gap since we've been a public company. We were also ranked first in global equity and equity related and common stock offerings for 2015. 
Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the fourth quarter. Advisory revenues were $879 million, a 9% improvement relative to the third quarter reflects an increase in a number of completed M&A transactions. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, including: SunGard's $9.1 billion sale to Fidelity National Information Services; General Electric Capital Corporation's $9 billion sale for transportation finance business to BMO Financial Group; and HCC Insurance Holdings $7.5 billion sale to Tokyo Marine Holdings. We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter, including: DuPont's combination with Dow Chemical, in a $130 billion merger of equals; Knowwhat Rubbermaid's $20 billion acquisition of Jordan Corporation; and SanDisk's approximately $19 billion sale to Western Digital. 
Moving to Underwriting. Net revenues were $668 million in the fourth quarter, down 11% sequentially as debt issuance slowed. Equity Underwriting revenues of $228 million were up 20% compared to the third quarter as IPOs increased from very low levels last quarter. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 21% to $440 million due to a decline in leveraged finance activity. 
During the fourth quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Visa's $16 billion investment-grade offering to support its purchase of Visa Europe, McDonald's $6 billion investment-grade offering and World Group $3.8 billion IPO. Our Investment Banking backlog improved from third quarter levels and finished at its second-highest level. 
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our fixed and Equities businesses. Net revenues were $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, down 10% compared to the third quarter. For the full year, $15.2 billion of net revenues were roughly consistent with 2014. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down 23% sequentially and included $54 million of DVA losses. Excluding DVA, revenues were down 10% quarter-over-quarter, as many businesses were impacted by either lower client activity or more difficult market-making conditions. Credit decreased significantly as the market was characterized by widening high-yield spreads in the U.S. and low levels of liquidity. Interest rate and currencies were lower sequentially as client activity declined. Mortgages continue to be challenged as spreads widened and the prospect for higher rates and client activity remained generally low. Commodities was essentially unchanged, as client activity was muted and energy prices remain under pressure. 
For the full year, FICC Client Execution net revenues were $7.3 billion, down 13% year-over-year. Challenging market conditions and lower levels of client activity in our micro businesses, credit and mortgages offset stronger client activity and a favorable backdrop for our micro businesses, particularly rates and currencies. 
In Equities, which includes Equities, Client Execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.8 billion, flat sequentially and included $14 million in DVA losses. Equities Client Execution revenues were roughly consistent sequentially at $562 million. Commissions and fees were $763 million, down 7% relative to the third quarter as global client volumes declined. Security services generated net revenues of $430 million, up 13% sequentially. For the full year, Equities produced net revenues of $7.8 billion, up 16% year-over-year.  2015, we benefited from several factors, a better market backdrop and a more favorable environment for security services. 
Turning to Risk. Average daily borrowing in the fourth quarter was $71 million, down from $74 million in the third quarter. 
Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities. Collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1 billion, primarily reflecting company-specific events, including financings, sales and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt security and loans were $299 million, which was largely driven by net interest income. For the full year, Investing & Lending generated net revenues of $5.4 billion, driven by $3.78 billion in gains from equity securities and $1.66 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans. 
In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion. This was up 9% from the third quarter, primarily as a result of $190 million in incentive fees largely from alternative asset products. Management and other fees were up 2% sequentially to $1.24 billion. For the full year, Investment Management net revenues were a record $6.2 billion, up 3% from 2014 on record management and other fees and higher transaction revenues. 
During the fourth quarter, assets under supervision increased $64 billion to a record $1.25 trillion, primarily due to net inflows into liquidity products. On a full-year basis, we had long-term fixed income flows of $41 billion, equity inflows of $23 billion and alternative inflows of $7 billion. 
Moving to our performance. 73% of our client mutual fund assets ranked in the top 2 quartiles on a 3-year and a 5-year basis. 
Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, remain roughly flat at $12.7 billion for 2015 and translated into a compensation to net revenues ratio of 37.5%. Fourth quarter noncompensation expenses were $4.1 billion and incorporated $1.95 billion in litigation and regulatory expenses. The quarter also included a $123 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor-advised charitable fund. For the full year, noncompensation expenses were up 30% due to $4 billion in provisions for litigation and regulatory matters. Excluding litigation provisions, noncompensation expenses would have been down 4% year-over-year. 
Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the end of the year. Total staff at year-end was approximately 36,800, up 8% from year-end 2014. This is a significant increase so let's break down the drivers. Of the 2,800 of incremental staff, a little more than half was due to our continued investment in regulatory compliance and other federation initiatives largely in technology and operations. The remainder was focused on business growth initiatives, particularly within Investment Management. Our effective tax rate was 30.7% for 2015. Our global core liquid assets into the year at $199 billion. While our balance sheet was roughly flat year-over-year, Level 3 assets declined by 33% to $24 billion. 
Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.4% under the Basel III Advanced Approach. It was 13.6% using the Standardized Approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.9%. 
With respect to our Method 2 [ph] GSIP surcharge, we currently estimate to be at or near the lower bucket given the decline in Level 3 assets and derivative notionals over the course of the year. 
And finally, we repurchased 8.9 million shares of common stock for $1.65 billion in the quarter. For the full year, we repurchased $4.2 billion. Year-over-year, our average fully diluted share count declined by approximately 15 million. In addition, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.65 per share in the second quarter and paid out approximately $1.2 billion of common dividends during the year. In total, we returned $5.4 billion of capital to shareholders in 2015. 
Before taking questions, a few closing thoughts. Clearly, it has been a challenging environment for the entire industry. 2015 marks the fourth consecutive year that we have posted revenues of approximately $34 billion. Excluding litigation charges related to the RMBS Working Group, it is also the fourth consecutive year that we have produced strong positive results and returns that exceeded our cost of capital. We have been able to post consistent, strong relative results despite the difficult operating environment, which is the statement to the strength of our global client franchise, the caliber of our people and our culture of teamwork and adaptability. 
Over the past 4 years, we've also grown book value per share by 7% per annum, returned nearly $25 billion in capital to our shareholders and reduced our basic share count by 75 million shares or 14%. And most importantly, we have been able to accomplish these things while maintaining leading positions across all of our businesses, transforming our financial profile, prudently managing our risk, adapting to regulatory change, continuing to invest in our future and positioning the firm to provide significant operating leverage when the environment improves. 
There's no doubt that the second half of 2015 had its fair share of challenges, which significantly impacted market sentiment and client activity. It's quite natural for all of us to be influenced by recent events, and we maintain a healthy respect for them. We certainly don't control the opportunity set. However, we do control several things: how we build our client relationships, how we invest in our people, how we adapt to change, how we allocate our capital, manage our risks and control our costs and finally, how we invest in the future. We believe our firm's commitment to excellence in these areas had been and will continue to be what drives outperformance over the long term.

And the last half of the year and continuing the dramatic decline in commodity prices broadly has been disruptive for the market. I think if you talk to our folks, obviously, that sector of prices remain where they are is going to be under stress. That's an inevitability. But it does feel at this stage where perhaps the market is discounting some of the benefits of the decline in commodity prices. We'll have to see how the market evolves. Look, these things are never going to be a straight line, and so it's not surprising to some extent that the markets responding to China, reduced activity, volatility in markets this way. In terms of our exposures to debt sector, they haven't moved materially since earlier calls. Across the entire oil and gas sector, Glen, funded and unfunded, we had just more than $10 billion of exposure. But to really dial it in for you, funded exposure to noninvestment-grade entities in that sector was $1.5 billion as we finished the quarter. So from our perspective, we feel well positioned and in this kind of market environment, it's a type of market environment where your clients really want you to stay close to them, and that's what we're doing."

But even right now, you're seeing the market, which has been under stress, be thoughtfully selective about those transactions, and there's been a lot of appetite for certain parts of the market.

We've seen it in parts of equity derivatives during the course of really know last year, 1.5 years. And then in fixed income, one of the things that shouldn't get lost about a fixed income discussion in 2015 for our firm is that while it was a difficult market for the micro products for credit and mortgages, it was actually an improved year for interest rates for currencies and while commodities was an improvement came up very strong year prior, I think that we're seeing it when activity picks up. Now in terms of the announcements and the retrenchment from competitors, one of these things it's not surprising that you need to have a couple of for several tough years and that announcements will generally lag.

Everyone has to acknowledge that financial services is a cyclical industry. And one of the things that we've been very thoughtful about is not overinvesting at the top of the markets. So you didn't see us to add that in 2009, when FICC had a record year, and making sure that we don't overshoot in the bottom part of the cycle. Now we were early to the cost cutting because we felt the activity levels declining after 2009. And that's how we managed through the cycle, and you've seen us do this in the equity businesses and sometimes these cycles are long. We cut thousands of people in our equity franchise in the early 2000s. But right now, given all the work we've done on the cost side, we don't feel like we need to catch up.

I think you have to take a step back and he had ask yourself, what are the factors that drove the M&A environment over the past 18 months? And are they still in place? And those core factors are was really limited organic growth. The companies were struggling to find top line growth. You have positive but modest economic growth in major economies. And companies had done quite a bit of work both on cost and refinancing going into that cycle, and there was high level of CEO and Board confidence. Those were the factors that drove the big pickup in activity. As we sit here today after a couple of weeks of volatile markets, we wouldn't say that those factors are significantly diminished. We saw a very volatile August, and yet in the fourth quarter, M&A activity continued and we finished our backlog higher than last year. And so I think that we'll have to see, obviously, if markets stay under stress and you get into questions about financeability and other headwinds into a loss of confidence. But we wouldn't say that 2 weeks of volatile markets would stop a pretty powerful M&A trend. We will see how these markets keep going."

398625,316307303,919557,"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2016",2016-01-20,"Earnings Calls","The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the fourth quarter and full year results, and I'm happy to answer any questions. Before outlining our results, I would like to discuss the previously announced settlement for leg",2201,"Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the fourth quarter and full year results, and I'm happy to answer any questions. 
Before outlining our results, I would like to discuss the previously announced settlement for legacy mortgage activities. As you know, we took a total net provision for litigation and regulatory matters in the fourth quarter of $1.95 billion. The RMBS Working Group matter was the most significant outstanding piece of litigation facing the firm. As you would expect, following the settlement, there has been a significant decline in our ""reasonably possible"" loss number. We are currently estimating a more than 60% decline compared to third quarter levels of $5.3 billion. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Net revenues were $7.3 billion; net earnings were $765 million; and earnings per diluted share were $1.27. With respect to our annual results, we had firm-wide net revenues of $33.8 billion; net earnings of $6.1 billion; earnings per diluted share of $12.14; and a return on common equity of 7.4%. Revenues were down slightly compared with last year, and expenses were significantly higher due to approximately $4 billion of net provisions for litigation and regulatory matters. Despite these headwinds, we grew book value per share by 5%. 
The growth, combined with our risk-reduction efforts, strengthened all of our regulatory capital ratios. Excluding the litigation charges related to the RMBS Working Group, our 2015 return on common equity would have been 380 basis points higher. 
2015 presented both challenges and opportunities. The challenges were more acutely felt in the back half of the year as concerns about global growth intensified. This was reflected in public equity markets with the MSCI World down 5.7% over the last 6 months of the year. Credit markets also reflected these concerns, particularly within the noninvestment-grade space and most acutely within the commodity sector. For example, U.S. high-yield spreads were 157 basis points wider in the second half of 2015. And at the end of 2015, the trailing 12-month default rate for U.S. noninvestment-grade bonds more than doubled year-over-year, climbing to 4.3%. 
These factors negatively impacted the broader opportunity set for our clients and, as a consequence, for the firm. To varying degrees, the firm faced headwinds within certain of our FICC businesses, underwriting within Investment Banking and our Investing & Lending activities. However, these significant headwinds were largely offset by client activity in other businesses. Many of our clients decided to pursue M&A as the best means for creating shareholder value. Announced M&A volumes for the industry increased by 47% in 2015. The firm's volumes increased by 81%, a significant expansion of our market share. 
Our global Equities franchise also posted strong results for the year. Clients continue to place significant value on the integration of our various services: electronic, cash, derivatives and Prime Brokerage as well as our global footprint. Our performance in 2015 highlighted these strengths. 
In addition, the combination of continued strong performance for our clients and the diversified set of offerings drove a record year for our Investment Management business. We ended the year with record assets under supervision of $1.25 trillion and robust net inflows, which totaled $94 billion. 
Ultimately, 2015 reinforced a long-standing operating principle that there is tremendous value to having a diversified set of global businesses. More importantly, it is the value of being a leader in these businesses that really counts. 
Now let's discuss the individual businesses in greater detail. As it relates to the quarter, Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.5 billion, slightly lower than the third quarter. A pickup in M&A was offset by a decline in underwriting activity. For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $7 billion, up 9% from 2014 on the back of a 40% increase in Financial Advisory revenues. This was partially offset by lower equity and debt underwriting revenues. 
Our franchise remains very strong. 2015 was our second-highest annual revenues for Investment Banking. We ended the year ranked first in global and announced and completed M&A. Our completed M&A volumes were approximately $350 billion higher than our next closest competitor, a record gap since we've been a public company. We were also ranked first in global equity and equity related and common stock offerings for 2015. 
Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the fourth quarter. Advisory revenues were $879 million, a 9% improvement relative to the third quarter reflects an increase in a number of completed M&A transactions. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, including: SunGard's $9.1 billion sale to Fidelity National Information Services; General Electric Capital Corporation's $9 billion sale of its transportation finance business to BMO Financial Group; and HCC Insurance Holdings $7.5 billion sale to Tokyo Marine Holdings. We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter, including: DuPont's combination with Dow Chemical in a $130 billion merger of equals; Newell Rubbermaid's $20 billion acquisition of Jordan Corporation; and SanDisk's approximately $19 billion sale to Western Digital. 
Moving to Underwriting. Net revenues were $668 million in the fourth quarter, down 11% sequentially as debt issuance slowed. Equity Underwriting revenues of $228 million were up 20% compared to the third quarter as IPOs increased from very low levels last quarter. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 21% to $440 million due to a decline in leveraged finance activity. 
During the fourth quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Visa's $16 billion investment-grade offering to support its purchase of Visa Europe, McDonald's $6 billion investment-grade offering and Worldpay Group's $3.8 billion IPO. Our Investment Banking backlog improved from third quarter levels and finished at its second-highest level. 
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses. Net revenues were $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, down 10% compared to the third quarter. For the full year, $15.2 billion of net revenues were roughly consistent with 2014. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down 23% sequentially and included $54 million of DVA losses. Excluding DVA, revenues were down 10% quarter-over-quarter, as many businesses were impacted by either lower client activity or more difficult market-making conditions. 
Credit decreased significantly as the market was characterized by widening high-yield spreads in the U.S. and low levels of liquidity. Interest rate and currencies were lower sequentially as client activity declined. Mortgages continue to be challenged as spreads widened and the prospect for higher rates and client activity remained generally low. Commodities was essentially unchanged, as client activity was muted and energy prices remain under pressure. 
For the full year, FICC Client Execution net revenues were $7.3 billion, down 13% year-over-year. But challenging market conditions and lower levels of client activity in our micro businesses, credit and mortgages offset stronger client activity and have favorable backdrop for our micro businesses, particularly rates and currencies. 
In Equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.8 billion, flat sequentially and included $14 million in DVA losses. Equities client execution revenues were roughly consistent sequentially at $562 million. Commissions and fees were $763 million, down 7% relative to the third quarter as global client volumes declined. Security services generated net revenues of $430 million, up 13% sequentially. For the full year, Equities produced net revenues of $7.8 billion, up 16% year-over-year.  2015, we benefited from several factors, a better market backdrop and a more favorable environment for security services. 
Turning to Risk. Average daily VaR in the fourth quarter was $71 million, down from $74 million in the third quarter. 
Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities. Collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1 billion, primarily reflecting company-specific events, including financings, sales and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt security and loans were $299 million, which was largely driven by net interest income. For the full year, Investing & Lending generated net revenues of $5.4 billion, driven by $3.78 billion in gains from equity securities and $1.66 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans. 
In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion. This was up 9% from the third quarter, primarily as a result of $190 million in incentive fees, largely from alternative asset products. Management and other fees were up 2% sequentially to $1.24 billion. For the full year, Investment Management net revenues were a record $6.2 billion, up 3% from 2014 on record management and other fees and higher transaction revenues. 
During the fourth quarter, assets under supervision increased $64 billion to a record $1.25 trillion, primarily due to net inflows into liquidity products. On a full-year basis, we had long-term Fixed Income flows of $41 billion, equity inflows of $23 billion and alternative inflows of $7 billion. 
Moving to our performance. 73% of our client mutual fund assets ranked in the top 2 quartiles on a 3-year and a 5-year basis. 
Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, remain roughly flat at $12.7 billion for 2015 and translated into a compensation to net revenues ratio of 37.5%. Fourth quarter noncompensation expenses were $4.1 billion and incorporated $1.95 billion in litigation and regulatory expenses. The quarter also included a $123 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor-advised charitable fund. For the full year, noncompensation expenses were up 30% due to $4 billion in provisions for litigation and regulatory matters. Excluding litigation provisions, noncompensation expenses would have been down 4% year-over-year. 
Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the end of the year. Total staff at year-end was approximately 36,800, up 8% from year-end 2014. This is a significant increase so let's break down the drivers. Of the 2,800 of incremental staff, a little more than half was due to our continued investment in regulatory compliance and other federation initiatives, largely in technology and operations. The remainder was focused on business growth initiatives, particularly within Investment Management. Our effective tax rate was 30.7% for 2015. Our global core liquid assets ended the year at $199 billion. While our balance sheet was roughly flat year-over-year, Level 3 assets declined by 33% to $24 billion. 
Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.4% under the Basel III Advanced Approach. It was 13.6% using the Standardized Approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.9%. 
With respect to our method 2 GSIB surcharge, we currently estimate to be at or near the lower bucket given the decline in Level 3 assets and derivative notionals over the course of the year. 
And finally, we repurchased 8.9 million shares of common stock for $1.65 billion in the quarter. For the full year, we repurchased $4.2 billion. Year-over-year, our average fully diluted share count declined by approximately 15 million. In addition, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.65 per share in the second quarter and paid out approximately $1.2 billion of common dividends during the year. In total, we returned $5.4 billion of capital to shareholders in 2015. 
Before taking questions, a few closing thoughts. Clearly, it has been a challenging environment for the entire industry. 2015 marks the fourth consecutive year that we have posted revenues of approximately $34 billion. Excluding litigation charges related to the RMBS Working Group, it is also the fourth consecutive year that we have produced strong relative results and returns that exceeded our cost of capital. We have been able to post consistent, strong relative results despite the difficult operating environment, which is a statement to the strength of our global client franchise, the caliber of our people and our culture of teamwork and adaptability. 
Over the past 4 years, we've also grown book value per share by 7% per annum, returned nearly $25 billion in capital to our shareholders and reduced our basic share count by 75 million shares or 14%. And most importantly, we have been able to accomplish these things while maintaining leading positions across all of our businesses, transforming our financial profile, prudently managing our risk, adapting to regulatory change, continuing to invest in our future and positioning the firm to provide significant operating leverage when the environment improves. 
There's no doubt that the second half of 2015 had its fair share of challenges, which significantly impacted market sentiment and client activity. It's quite natural for all of us to be influenced by recent events, and we maintain a healthy respect for them. We certainly don't control the opportunity set. However, we do control several things: how we build our client relationships; how we invest in our people; how we adapt to change; how we allocate our capital, manage our risks and control our costs; and finally, how we invest in the future. We believe our firm's commitment to excellence in these areas had been and will continue to be what drives the outperformance over the long term.

And the last half of the year and continuing the dramatic decline in commodity prices broadly had been disruptive to the market. I think if you talk to our folks, obviously, that sector of prices remain where they are is going to be under stress. That's an inevitability. But it does feel at this stage where perhaps the market is discounting some of the benefits of the decline in commodity prices. We'll have to see how the market evolves. Look, these things are never going to be a straight line, and so it's not surprising to some extent that the market's responding to China, reduced activity, volatility in markets this way. In terms of our exposures to that sector, they haven't moved materially since earlier calls. Across the entire oil and gas sector, Glenn, funded and unfunded, we had just more than $10 billion of exposure. But to really dial it in for you, funded exposure to noninvestment-grade entities in that sector was $1.5 billion as we finished the quarter. So from our perspective, we feel well positioned. And in this kind of market environment, it's a type of market environment where your clients really want you to stay close to them, and that's what we're doing."

The obvious offset to that end, and it maybe more acute in the U.S. is, obviously, there's a lot of pain in the sector, and that will lead to increased unemployment, specifically, in the sector and has infrastructure spend impact. In terms of hedging, we can hedge on a case-by-case basis. It really depends, specifically, under the underlying and where we can and we think we should. Obviously, we do. As it relates to client activity, one of the things about this move because it came down so quickly, is it really it did not give a lot of our clients the opportunity to hedge to the downside. Obviously, in these low-priced levels across commodities, you would expect to see a pickup in the consumer side of hedging activity, and we expect to start seeing that. But these moves have been pretty dramatic and usually what happens when there this sudden is there's a bit of stepping back. But certainly, we're well positioned to provide hedges across the broad commodity space."

We've seen it in Securities Services and Prime Brokerage, a bit of a retrenchment. I think that was more regulatory driven as people began to focus on balance sheet and capital related to that business. We've seen it in parts of equity derivatives during the course of really now last year, 1.5 years. And then in fixed income, one of the things that shouldn't get lost about the fixed income discussion in 2015 for our firm is that while it was a difficult market for the micro products for credit and mortgages, it was actually an improved year for interest rates for currencies, and while commodities [indiscernible] came up a very strong year prior, I think that we're seeing it when activity picks up. Now in terms of the announcements and the retrenchment from competitors, one of these things is its not surprising that you need to have a couple of or several tough years, and that announcements will generally lag. And so, I think, we may see this over the next couple of years now that we've been in this period of a tough couple of years in FICC and where the vast majority of the industry has had multiple years of performing below their cost of capital. So all these things, all these constraints are now really starting to come into the fray, particularly as we get into the 2018, 2019 compliance periods. So I gave a long answer, but it was a big question, but it was a long answer."

Look, in terms of monitoring the businesses, we're always monitoring the businesses. I think one of the things that we haven't talked a lot about, and we haven't talked directly about is our philosophy and how we manage cyclical businesses. Everyone has to acknowledge that financial services is a cyclical industry. And one of the things that we've been very thoughtful about is not overinvesting at the top of the markets. So you didn't see us do that in 2009 when FICC had a record year, and making sure that we don't overshoot in the bottom part of the cycle. Now we were early to the cost cutting because we felt the activity levels declining after 2009. And that's how we managed through the cycle, and you've seen us do this in the equity businesses and sometimes these cycles are long. We cut thousands of people in our equity franchise in the early 2000s. But right now, given all the work we've done on the cost side, we don't feel like we need to catch up. So we'll see how the year goes. If the trends in fixed income continue, we'll be continuing to manage the business as efficiently as possible."

I think you have to take a step back and you've to ask yourself, what are the factors that drove the M&A environment record over the past 18 months? And are they still in place? And those core factors are was really limited organic growth. Companies were struggling to find top line growth. You had positive, but modest economic growth in major economies. And companies had done quite a bit of work both on cost and refinancing going into that cycle, and there was high level of CEO and Board confidence. Those were the factors that drove the big pickup in activity. As we sit here today after a couple of weeks of volatile markets, we wouldn't say that those factors are significantly diminished. We saw a very volatile August, and yet in the fourth quarter, M&A activity continued and we finished our backlog higher than last year. And so I think that we'll have to see, obviously, if markets stay under stress, then you get into questions about financeability and other headwinds, and then it leads to a loss of confidence. But we wouldn't say that 2 weeks of volatile markets would stop a pretty powerful M&A trend. We will see how these markets keep growing."

The dialogue with the client. So let's take M&A. We just talked about. These things are interesting because now the current concern is that M&A may slow down. Five years ago, you'll remember the dialogue was M&A is never coming back. And last year, we had dominant market share and tremendous activity levels across the industry. In 2009, our client dialogue told us they were factors that were influencing decisions, that were delaying decisions, but it certainly didn't tell us that no one would ever do mergers again. And so when we see -- when we listen to the client and we know, for example, that our clients in fixed income still value the services, there just maybe lower volumes. That's how we'll inform our strategy over the long run. But obviously, we're not being complacent. You've seen all the things we've done. We returned significant capital. We've cut cost. We were early to all those things. We reduced risk, improved our ratio. So we're certainly not sitting still here. Revenues might be $34 billion for a couple of years, but there's a lot going on."

398625,316307303,919651,"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2016",2016-01-20,"Earnings Calls","The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the fourth quarter and full year results, and I'm happy to answer any questions. Before outlining our results, I would like to discuss the previously announced settlement for leg",2201,"Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the fourth quarter and full year results, and I'm happy to answer any questions. 
Before outlining our results, I would like to discuss the previously announced settlement for legacy mortgage activities. As you know, we took a total net provision for litigation and regulatory matters in the fourth quarter of $1.95 billion. The RMBS Working Group matter was the most significant outstanding piece of litigation facing the firm. As you would expect, following the settlement, there has been a significant decline in our ""reasonably possible"" loss number. We are currently estimating a more than 60% decline compared to third quarter levels of $5.3 billion. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Net revenues were $7.3 billion; net earnings were $765 million; and earnings per diluted share were $1.27. With respect to our annual results, we had firm-wide net revenues of $33.8 billion; net earnings of $6.1 billion; earnings per diluted share of $12.14; and a return on common equity of 7.4%. Revenues were down slightly compared with last year, and expenses were significantly higher due to approximately $4 billion of net provisions for litigation and regulatory matters. Despite these headwinds, we grew book value per share by 5%. 
The growth, combined with our risk-reduction efforts, strengthened all of our regulatory capital ratios. Excluding the litigation charges related to the RMBS Working Group, our 2015 return on common equity would have been 380 basis points higher. 
2015 presented both challenges and opportunities. The challenges were more acutely felt in the back half of the year as concerns about global growth intensified. This was reflected in public equity markets with the MSCI World down 5.7% over the last 6 months of the year. Credit markets also reflected these concerns, particularly within the noninvestment-grade space and most acutely within the commodity sector. For example, U.S. high-yield spreads were 157 basis points wider in the second half of 2015. And at the end of 2015, the trailing 12-month default rate for U.S. noninvestment-grade bonds more than doubled year-over-year, climbing to 4.3%. 
These factors negatively impacted the broader opportunity set for our clients and, as a consequence, for the firm. To varying degrees, the firm faced headwinds within certain of our FICC businesses, underwriting within Investment Banking and our Investing & Lending activities. However, these significant headwinds were largely offset by client activity in other businesses. Many of our clients decided to pursue M&A as the best means for creating shareholder value. Announced M&A volumes for the industry increased by 47% in 2015. The firm's volumes increased by 81%, a significant expansion of our market share. 
Our global Equities franchise also posted strong results for the year. Clients continue to place significant value on the integration of our various services: electronic, cash, derivatives and Prime Brokerage as well as our global footprint. Our performance in 2015 highlighted these strengths. 
In addition, the combination of continued strong performance for our clients and the diversified set of offerings drove a record year for our Investment Management business. We ended the year with record assets under supervision of $1.25 trillion and robust net inflows, which totaled $94 billion. 
Ultimately, 2015 reinforced a long-standing operating principle that there is tremendous value to having a diversified set of global businesses. More importantly, it is the value of being a leader in these businesses that really counts. 
Now let's discuss the individual businesses in greater detail. As it relates to the quarter, Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.5 billion, slightly lower than the third quarter. A pickup in M&A was offset by a decline in underwriting activity. For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $7 billion, up 9% from 2014 on the back of a 40% increase in Financial Advisory revenues. This was partially offset by lower equity and debt underwriting revenues. 
Our franchise remains very strong. 2015 was our second-highest annual revenues for Investment Banking. We ended the year ranked first in global and announced and completed M&A. Our completed M&A volumes were approximately $350 billion higher than our next closest competitor, a record gap since we've been a public company. We were also ranked first in global equity and equity related and common stock offerings for 2015. 
Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the fourth quarter. Advisory revenues were $879 million, a 9% improvement relative to the third quarter reflects an increase in a number of completed M&A transactions. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, including: SunGard's $9.1 billion sale to Fidelity National Information Services; General Electric Capital Corporation's $9 billion sale of its transportation finance business to BMO Financial Group; and HCC Insurance Holdings $7.5 billion sale to Tokyo Marine Holdings. We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter, including: DuPont's combination with Dow Chemical in a $130 billion merger of equals; Newell Rubbermaid's $20 billion acquisition of Jarden Corporation; and SanDisk's approximately $19 billion sale to Western Digital. 
Moving to Underwriting. Net revenues were $668 million in the fourth quarter, down 11% sequentially as debt issuance slowed. Equity Underwriting revenues of $228 million were up 20% compared to the third quarter as IPOs increased from very low levels last quarter. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 21% to $440 million due to a decline in leveraged finance activity. 
During the fourth quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Visa's $16 billion investment-grade offering to support its purchase of Visa Europe, McDonald's $6 billion investment-grade offering and Worldpay Group's $3.8 billion IPO. Our Investment Banking backlog improved from third quarter levels and finished at its second-highest level. 
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses. Net revenues were $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, down 10% compared to the third quarter. For the full year, $15.2 billion of net revenues were roughly consistent with 2014. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down 23% sequentially and included $54 million of DVA losses. Excluding DVA, revenues were down 10% quarter-over-quarter, as many businesses were impacted by either lower client activity or more difficult market-making conditions. 
Credit decreased significantly as the market was characterized by widening high-yield spreads in the U.S. and low levels of liquidity. Interest rate and currencies were lower sequentially as client activity declined. Mortgages continue to be challenged as spreads widened and the prospects for higher rates and client activity remained generally low. Commodities was essentially unchanged, as client activity was muted and energy prices remain under pressure. 
For the full year, FICC Client Execution net revenues were $7.3 billion, down 13% year-over-year. But challenging market conditions and lower levels of client activity in our micro businesses, credit and mortgages offset stronger client activity and have favorable backdrop for our micro businesses, particularly rates and currencies. 
In Equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.8 billion, flat sequentially and included $14 million in DVA losses. Equities client execution revenues were roughly consistent sequentially at $562 million. Commissions and fees were $763 million, down 7% relative to the third quarter as global client volumes declined. Security services generated net revenues of $430 million, up 13% sequentially. For the full year, Equities produced net revenues of $7.8 billion, up 16% year-over-year. 2015, we benefited from several factors, a better market backdrop and a more favorable environment for security services. 
Turning to Risk. Average daily VaR in the fourth quarter was $71 million, down from $74 million in the third quarter. 
Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities. Collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1 billion, primarily reflecting company-specific events, including financings, sales and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt security and loans were $299 million, which was largely driven by net interest income. For the full year, Investing & Lending generated net revenues of $5.4 billion, driven by $3.78 billion in gains from equity securities and $1.66 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans. 
In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion. This was up 9% from the third quarter, primarily as a result of $190 million in incentive fees, largely from alternative asset products. Management and other fees were up 2% sequentially to $1.24 billion. For the full year, Investment Management net revenues were a record $6.2 billion, up 3% from 2014 on record management and other fees and higher transaction revenues. 
During the fourth quarter, assets under supervision increased $64 billion to a record $1.25 trillion, primarily due to net inflows into liquidity products. On a full-year basis, we had long-term Fixed Income flows of $41 billion, equity inflows of $23 billion and alternative inflows of $7 billion. 
Moving to our performance. 73% of our client mutual fund assets ranked in the top 2 quartiles on a 3-year and a 5-year basis. 
Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, remain roughly flat at $12.7 billion for 2015 and translated into a compensation to net revenues ratio of 37.5%. Fourth quarter noncompensation expenses were $4.1 billion and incorporated $1.95 billion in litigation and regulatory expenses. The quarter also included a $123 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor-advised charitable fund. For the full year, noncompensation expenses were up 30% due to $4 billion in provisions for litigation and regulatory matters. Excluding litigation provisions, noncompensation expenses would have been down 4% year-over-year. 
Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the end of the year. Total staff at year-end was approximately 36,800, up 8% from year-end 2014. This is a significant increase so let's break down the drivers. Of the 2,800 of incremental staff, a little more than half was due to our continued investment in regulatory compliance and other federation initiatives, largely in technology and operations. The remainder was focused on business growth initiatives, particularly within Investment Management. Our effective tax rate was 30.7% for 2015. Our global core liquid assets ended the year at $199 billion. While our balance sheet was roughly flat year-over-year, Level 3 assets declined by 33% to $24 billion. 
Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.4% under the Basel III Advanced Approach. It was 13.6% using the Standardized Approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.9%. 
With respect to our method 2 GSIB surcharge, we currently estimate to be at or near the lower bucket given the decline in Level 3 assets and derivative notionals over the course of the year. 
And finally, we repurchased 8.9 million shares of common stock for $1.65 billion in the quarter. For the full year, we repurchased $4.2 billion. Year-over-year, our average fully diluted share count declined by approximately 15 million. In addition, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.65 per share in the second quarter and paid out approximately $1.2 billion of common dividends during the year. In total, we returned $5.4 billion of capital to shareholders in 2015. 
Before taking questions, a few closing thoughts. Clearly, it has been a challenging environment for the entire industry. 2015 marks the fourth consecutive year that we have posted revenues of approximately $34 billion. Excluding litigation charges related to the RMBS Working Group, it is also the fourth consecutive year that we have produced strong relative results and returns that exceeded our cost of capital. We have been able to post consistent, strong relative results despite the difficult operating environment, which is a statement to the strength of our global client franchise, the caliber of our people and our culture of teamwork and adaptability. 
Over the past 4 years, we've also grown book value per share by 7% per annum, returned nearly $25 billion in capital to our shareholders and reduced our basic share count by 75 million shares or 14%. And most importantly, we have been able to accomplish these things while maintaining leading positions across all of our businesses, transforming our financial profile, prudently managing our risk, adapting to regulatory change, continuing to invest in our future and positioning the firm to provide significant operating leverage when the environment improves. 
There's no doubt that the second half of 2015 had its fair share of challenges, which significantly impacted market sentiment and client activity. It's quite natural for all of us to be influenced by recent events, and we maintain a healthy respect for them. We certainly don't control the opportunity set. However, we do control several things: how we build our client relationships; how we invest in our people; how we adapt to change; how we allocate our capital, manage our risks and control our costs; and finally, how we invest in the future. We believe our firm's commitment to excellence in these areas had been and will continue to be what drives the outperformance over the long term. 
Thank you again for dialing in, and I'm happy to answer your questions."

And the last half of the year and continuing the dramatic decline in commodity prices broadly had been disruptive to the market. I think if you talk to our folks, obviously, that sector of prices remain where they are is going to be under stress. That's an inevitability. But it does feel at this stage where perhaps the market is discounting some of the benefits of the decline in commodity prices. We'll have to see how the market evolves. Look, these things are never going to be a straight line, and so it's not surprising to some extent that the market's responding to China, reduced activity, volatility in markets this way. In terms of our exposures to that sector, they haven't moved materially since earlier calls. Across the entire oil and gas sector, Glenn, funded and unfunded, we had just more than $10 billion of exposure. But to really dial it in for you, funded exposure to noninvestment-grade entities in that sector was $1.5 billion as we finished the quarter. So from our perspective, we feel well positioned. And in this kind of market environment, it's a type of market environment where your clients really want you to stay close to them, and that's what we're doing."

Look, as we go through parts of the credit cycle, it's very natural for spreads to widen after having a period of such strength in the contraction. But even right now, you're seeing the market, which had been under stress, be thoughtfully selective about those transactions, and there's been a lot of appetite for certain parts of the market. So I think we look forward over the next couple of years, when you start adding in things like the competitive environments, all the potential activity around hedging and other activities, I think you can construct a pretty aggressive bull book case for Fixed Income.

The obvious offset to that end, and it may be more acute in the U.S. is, obviously, there's a lot of pain in the sector, and that will lead to increased unemployment, specifically, in the sector and has infrastructure spend impact. In terms of hedging, we can hedge on a case-by-case basis. It really depends, specifically, under the underlying and where we can and we think we should. Obviously, we do. As it relates to client activity, one of the things about this move because it came down so quickly, is it really it did not give a lot of our clients the opportunity to hedge to the downside. Obviously, in these low-priced levels across commodities, you would expect to see a pickup in the consumer side of hedging activity, and we expect to start seeing that. But these moves have been pretty dramatic and usually what happens when they're this sudden is there's a bit of stepping back.

We've seen it in Securities Services and Prime Brokerage, a bit of a retrenchment. I think that was more regulatory driven as people began to focus on balance sheet and capital related to that business. We've seen it in parts of equity derivatives during the course of really now last year, 1.5 years. And then in fixed income, one of the things that shouldn't get lost about the fixed income discussion in 2015 for our firm is that while it was a difficult market for the micro products for credit and mortgages, it was actually an improved year for interest rates for currencies, and while commodities wasn't improving, it came up a very strong year prior, I think that we're seeing it when activity picks up. Now in terms of the announcements and the retrenchment from competitors, one of these things is it's not surprising that you need to have a couple of or several tough years, and that announcements will generally lag. And so, I think, we may see this over the next couple of years now that we've been in this period of a tough couple of years in FICC and where the vast majority of the industry has had multiple years of performing below their cost of capital. So all these things, all these constraints are now really starting to come into the fray, particularly as we get into the 2018, 2019 compliance periods.

Everyone has to acknowledge that financial services is a cyclical industry. And one of the things that we've been very thoughtful about is not overinvesting at the top of the markets. So you didn't see us do that in 2009 when FICC had a record year, and making sure that we don't overshoot in the bottom part of the cycle. Now we were early to the cost cutting because we felt the activity levels declining after 2009. And that's how we managed through the cycle, and you've seen us do this in the equity businesses and sometimes these cycles are long. We cut thousands of people in our equity franchise in the early 2000s. But right now, given all the work we've done on the cost side, we don't feel like we need to catch up.

I think you have to take a step back and you've to ask yourself, what are the factors that drove the M&A environment, we'll call it, over the past 18 months? And are they still in place? And those core factors are was really limited organic growth. Companies were struggling to find top line growth. You had positive, but modest economic growth in major economies. And companies had done quite a bit of work both on cost and refinancing going into that cycle, and there was high level of CEO and board confidence. Those were the factors that drove the big pickup in activity. As we sit here today after a couple of weeks of volatile markets, we wouldn't say that those factors are significantly diminished. We saw a very volatile August, and yet in the fourth quarter, M&A activity continued and we finished our backlog higher than last year. And so I think that we'll have to see, obviously, if markets stay under stress, then you get into questions about financeability and other headwinds, and then it leads to a loss of confidence.

The one good thing -- look, the regulators have been very thoughtful about the runway to rule adoption, and this is something that we have till 2019. So the industry is going to have time to make adjustments. And I think that's in everyone's best interests because it actually will be less disruptive to market to the extent of which a rule is significant, and we've see that in all the rules. So you'll see us approach this rule the way we approached all the other rules. but we haven't even seen, as I said, a Fed MPR, so we'll see how that goes, but any reduction in market risk-weighted assets is really a reflection of client activity."

Five years ago, you'll remember the dialogue was M&A is never coming back. And last year, we had dominant market share and tremendous activity levels across the industry. In 2009, our client dialogue told us they were factors that were influencing decisions, that were delaying decisions, but it certainly didn't tell us that no one would ever do mergers again. And so when we see -- when we listen to the client and we know, for example, that our clients in fixed income still value the services, there just may be lower volumes.

398625,316307303,956439,"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2016",2016-01-20,"Earnings Calls","The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the fourth quarter and full year results, and I'm happy to answer any questions. Before outlining our results, I would like to discuss the previously announced settlement for leg",2202,"Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the fourth quarter and full year results, and I'm happy to answer any questions. 
Before outlining our results, I would like to discuss the previously announced settlement for legacy mortgage activities. As you know, we took a total net provision for litigation and regulatory matters in the fourth quarter of $1.95 billion. The RMBS Working Group matter was the most significant outstanding piece of litigation facing the firm. As you would expect, following the settlement, there has been a significant decline in our reasonably possible loss number. We are currently estimating a more than 60% decline compared to third quarter levels of $5.3 billion. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Net revenues were $7.3 billion; net earnings were $765 million; and earnings per diluted share were $1.27. With respect to our annual results, we had firm-wide net revenues of $33.8 billion; net earnings of $6.1 billion; earnings per diluted share of $12.14; and a return on common equity of 7.4%. Revenues were down slightly compared with last year, and expenses were significantly higher due to approximately $4 billion of net provisions for litigation and regulatory matters. Despite these headwinds, we grew book value per share by 5%. 
The growth, combined with our risk-reduction efforts, strengthened all of our regulatory capital ratios. Excluding the litigation charges related to the RMBS Working Group, our 2015 return on common equity would have been 380 basis points higher. 
2015 presented both challenges and opportunities. The challenges were more acutely felt in the back half of the year as concerns about global growth intensified. This was reflected in public equity markets with the MSCI World down 5.7% over the last 6 months of the year. Credit markets also reflected these concerns, particularly within the noninvestment-grade space and most acutely within the commodity sector. For example, U.S. high-yield spreads were 157 basis points wider in the second half of 2015. And at the end of 2015, the trailing 12-month default rate for U.S. noninvestment-grade bonds more than doubled year-over-year, climbing to 4.3%. 
These factors negatively impacted the broader opportunity set for our clients and, as a consequence, for the firm. To varying degrees, the firm faced headwinds within certain of our FICC businesses, underwriting within Investment Banking and our Investing & Lending activities. However, these significant headwinds were largely offset by client activity in other businesses. Many of our clients decided to pursue M&A as the best means for creating shareholder value. Announced M&A volumes for the industry increased by 47% in 2015. The firm's volumes increased by 81%, a significant expansion of our market share. 
Our global Equities franchise also posted strong results for the year. Clients continue to place significant value on the integration of our various services: electronic, cash, derivatives and Prime Brokerage as well as our global footprint. Our performance in 2015 highlighted these strengths. 
In addition, the combination of continued strong performance for our clients and the diversified set of offerings drove a record year for our Investment Management business. We ended the year with record assets under supervision of $1.25 trillion and robust net inflows, which totaled $94 billion. 
Ultimately, 2015 reinforced a long-standing operating principle that there is tremendous value to having a diversified set of global businesses. More importantly, it is the value of being a leader in these businesses that really counts. 
Now let's discuss the individual businesses in greater detail. As it relates to the quarter, Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.5 billion, slightly lower than the third quarter. A pickup in M&A was offset by a decline in underwriting activity. For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $7 billion, up 9% from 2014 on the back of a 40% increase in Financial Advisory revenues. This was partially offset by lower equity and debt underwriting revenues. 
Our franchise remains very strong. 2015 was our second-highest annual revenues for Investment Banking. We ended the year ranked first in global and announced and completed M&A. Our completed M&A volumes were approximately $350 billion higher than our next-closest competitor, a record gap since we've been a public company. We were also ranked first in global equity and equity-related and common stock offerings for 2015. 
Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the fourth quarter. Advisory revenues were $879 million. The 9% improvement relative to the third quarter reflects an increase in the number of completed M&A transactions. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, including: SunGard's $9.1 billion sale to Fidelity National Information Services; General Electric Capital Corporation's $9 billion sale of its transportation finance business to BMO Financial Group; and HCC Insurance Holdings' $7.5 billion sale to Tokyo Marine Holdings. We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter, including: DuPont's combination with Dow Chemical in a $130 billion merger of equals; Newell Rubbermaid's $20 billion acquisition of Jarden Corporation; and SanDisk's approximately $19 billion sale to Western Digital. 
Moving to Underwriting. Net revenues were $668 million in the fourth quarter, down 11% sequentially as debt issuance slowed. Equity Underwriting revenues of $228 million were up 20% compared to the third quarter as IPOs increased from very low levels last quarter. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 21% to $440 million due to a decline in leverage finance activity. 
During the fourth quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Visa's $16 billion investment-grade offering to support its purchase of Visa Europe, McDonald's $6 billion investment-grade offering and Worldpay Group's $3.8 billion IPO. Our Investment Banking backlog improved from third quarter levels and finished at its second-highest level. 
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses. Net revenues were $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, down 10% compared to the third quarter. For the full year, $15.2 billion of net revenues were roughly consistent with 2014. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down 23% sequentially and included $54 million of DVA losses. Excluding DVA, revenues were down 10% quarter-over-quarter, as many businesses were impacted by either lower client activity or more difficult market-making conditions. 
Credit decreased significantly as the market was characterized by widening high-yield spreads in the U.S. and low levels of liquidity. Interest rate and currencies were lower sequentially as client activity declined. Mortgages continue to be challenged as spreads widen and the prospects for higher rates and client activity remain generally low. Commodities was essentially unchanged, as client activity was muted and energy prices remained under pressure. 
For the full year, FICC Client Execution net revenues were $7.3 billion, down 13% year-over-year. More challenging market conditions and lower levels of client activity in our micro businesses, credit and mortgages ,offset stronger client activity and a favorable backdrop for our macro businesses, particularly rates and currencies. 
In Equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.8 billion, flat sequentially and included $14 million in DVA losses. Equities client execution revenues were roughly consistent sequentially at $562 million. Commissions and fees were $763 million, down 7% relative to the third quarter as global client volumes declined. Security services generated net revenues of $430 million, up 13% sequentially. For the full year, Equities produced net revenues of $7.8 billion, up 16% year-over-year. 2015, we benefited from several factors, a better market backdrop and a more favorable environment for security services. 
Turning to Risk. Average daily VaR in the fourth quarter was $71 million, down from $74 million in the third quarter. 
Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities. Collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1 billion, primarily reflecting company-specific events, including financings, sales and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt security and loans were $299 million, which was largely driven by net interest income. For the full year, Investing & Lending generated net revenues of $5.4 billion, driven by $3.78 billion in gains from equity securities and $1.66 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans. 
In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion. This was up 9% from the third quarter, primarily as a result of $190 million in incentive fees, largely from alternative asset products. Management and other fees were up 2% sequentially to $1.24 billion. For the full year, Investment Management net revenues were a record $6.2 billion, up 3% from 2014 on record management and other fees and higher transaction revenues. 
During the fourth quarter, assets under supervision increased $64 billion to a record $1.25 trillion, primarily due to net inflows into liquidity products. On a full year basis, we had long-term Fixed Income flows of $41 billion, equity inflows of $23 billion and alternative inflows of $7 billion. 
Moving to our performance. 73% of our client mutual fund assets ranked in the top 2 quartiles on a 3-year and a 5-year basis. 
Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits remained roughly flat at $12.7 billion for 2015 and translated into a compensation to net revenues ratio of 37.5%. Fourth quarter noncompensation expenses were $4.1 billion and incorporated $1.95 billion in litigation and regulatory expenses. The quarter also included a $123 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor-advised charitable fund. For the full year, noncompensation expenses were up 30% due to $4 billion in provisions for litigation and regulatory matters. Excluding litigation provisions, noncompensation expenses would have been down 4% year-over-year. 
Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the end of the year. Total staff at year-end was approximately 36,800, up 8% from year-end 2014. This is a significant increase so let's break down the drivers. Of the 2,800 of incremental staff, a little more than half was due to our continued investment in regulatory compliance and other federation initiatives, largely in technology and operations. The remainder was focused on business growth initiatives, particularly within Investment Management. Our effective tax rate was 30.7% for 2015. Our global core liquid assets ended the year at $199 billion. While our balance sheet was roughly flat year-over-year, Level 3 assets declined by 33% to $24 billion. 
Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.4% under the Basel III Advanced Approach. It was 13.6% using the Standardized Approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.9%. 
With respect to our method 2 GSIB surcharge, we currently estimate that we are at or near the lower bucket given the decline in Level 3 assets and derivative notionals over the course of the year. 
And finally, we repurchased 8.9 million shares of common stock for $1.65 billion in the quarter. For the full year, we repurchased $4.2 billion. Year-over-year, our average fully diluted share count declined by approximately 15 million. In addition, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.65 per share in the second quarter and paid out approximately $1.2 billion of common dividends during the year. In total, we returned $5.4 billion of capital to shareholders in 2015. 
Before taking questions, a few closing thoughts. Clearly, it has been a challenging environment for the entire industry. 2015 marks the fourth consecutive year that we have posted revenues of approximately $34 billion. Excluding the litigation charges related to the RMBS Working Group, it is also the fourth consecutive year that we have produced strong relative results and returns that exceeded our cost of capital. We have been able to post consistent, strong relative results despite the difficult operating environment, which is a statement to the strength of our global client franchise, the caliber of our people and our culture of teamwork and adaptability. 
Over the past 4 years, we've also grown book value per share by 7% per annum, returned nearly $25 billion in capital to our shareholders and reduced our basic share count by 75 million shares or 14%. And most importantly, we have been able to accomplish these things while maintaining leading positions across all of our businesses, transforming our financial profile, prudently managing our risk, adapting to regulatory change, continuing to invest in our future and positioning the firm to provide significant operating leverage when the environment improves. 
There's no doubt that the second half of 2015 had its fair share of challenges, which significantly impacted market sentiment and client activity. It's quite natural for all of us to be influenced by recent events, and we maintain a healthy respect for them. We certainly don't control the opportunity set. However, we do control several things: how we build our client relationships; how we invest in our people; how we adapt to change; how we allocate our capital, manage our risks and control our costs; and finally, how we invest in the future. We believe our firm's commitment to excellence in these areas had been and will continue to be what drives the outperformance over the long term.

And the last half of the year and continuing the dramatic decline in commodity prices broadly had been disruptive to the market. I think if you talk to our folks, obviously, that sector of prices remain where they are is going to be under stress. That's an inevitability. But it does feel at this stage where perhaps the market is discounting some of the benefits of the decline in commodity prices. We'll have to see how the market evolves. Look, these things are never going to be a straight line, and so it's not surprising to some extent that the market's responding to China reduced activity, volatility in markets this way. In terms of our exposures to that sector, they haven't moved materially since early calls. Across the entire oil and gas sector, Glenn, funded and unfunded, we had just north of $10 billion of exposure. But to really dial it in for you, funded exposure to noninvestment-grade entities in that sector was $1.5 billion as we finished the quarter. So from our perspective, we feel well positioned. And in this kind of market environment, it's a type of market environment where your clients really want you to stay close to them, and that's what we're doing."

The stable to improving global growth, and we're seeing that in the U.S. and we're seeing that across Europe certainly, could be a tailwind. Diverging monetary policy could be a tailwind. Look, as we go through parts of the credit cycle, it's very natural for spreads to widen after having a period of such strength in the contraction. But even right now, you're seeing the market, which had been under stress, be thoughtfully selective about those transactions, and there's been a lot of appetite for certain parts of the market. So I think we look forward over the next couple of years, when you start adding in things like the competitive environments, all the potential activity around hedging and other activities, I think you could construct a pretty aggressive bull book case for Fixed Income. Again, it's not the way we generally run the businesses. We'll react to that as we see it. But there's a -- there certainly is an upside case."

In terms of hedging, we can hedge on a case-by-case basis. It really depends, specifically, under the underlying. And where we can and we think we should, obviously, we do. As it relates to client activity, one of the things about this move, because it came down so quickly, is it really it did not give a lot of our clients the opportunity to hedge to the downside. Obviously, in these low-priced levels across commodities, you would expect to see a pickup in the consumer side of hedging activity, and we expect to start seeing that.

We've seen it in Securities Services and Prime Brokerage, a bit of a retrenchment. I think that was more regulatory driven as people began to focus on balance sheet and capital related to that business. We've seen it in parts of equity derivatives during the course of really now last year, 1.5 years. And then in fixed income, one of the things that shouldn't get lost about the fixed income discussion in 2015 for our firm is that while it was a difficult market for the micro products for credit and mortgages, it was actually an improved year for interest rates for currencies. And while commodities wasn't improving, it came up a very strong year prior, I think that we're seeing it when activity picks up. Now in terms of the announcements and the retrenchment from competitors, one of these things is it's not surprising that you need to have a couple of or several tough years and that announcements will generally lag. And so I think we may see this over the next couple of years now that we've been in this period of a tough couple of years in FICC and where the vast majority of the industry has had multiple years of performing below their cost of capital. So all these things, all these constraints are now really starting to come into the fray, particularly as we get into the 2018, 2019 compliance periods.

So you didn't see us do that in 2009 when FICC had a record year, and making sure that we don't overshoot in the bottom part of the cycle. Now we were early to the cost cutting because we felt the activity levels declining after 2009. And that's how we managed through the cycle, and you've seen us do this in the equity businesses and sometimes these cycles are long. We cut thousands of people in our equity franchise in the early 2000s. But right now, given all the work we've done on the cost side, we don't feel like we need to catch up.

I think you have to take a step back and you have to ask yourself, what are the factors that drove the M&A environment, call it, over the past 18 months? And are they still in place? And those core factors are -- was really limited organic growth. Companies were struggling to find top line growth. You had positive but modest economic growth in major economies. And companies had done quite a bit of work both on cost and refinancing going into that cycle, and there was high level of CEO and board confidence. Those were the factors that drove the big pickup in activity. As we sit here today after a couple of weeks of volatile markets, we wouldn't say that those factors are significantly diminished. We saw a very volatile August, and yet in the fourth quarter, M&A activity continued and we finished our backlog higher than last year. And so I think that we'll have to see, obviously, if markets stay under stress, then you get into questions about financeability and other headwinds, and then it leads to a loss of confidence.

Net revenues were $6.3 billion; net earnings, $1.1 billion; and earnings per diluted share, $2.68. Net earnings common included a $161 million benefit related to the successful tender of our APAC securities. The tender added $0.36 per diluted share.
The first quarter of 2016 was challenging. It started with renewed uncertainty about the global economic outlook with the possibility of a recession even being raised. These concerns included growth prospects for China, plummeting oil prices, a strengthening U.S. dollar and multiple geopolitical events, to name a few. All of these came into focus during an eventful first quarter. These concerns translated into significant price pressure at the beginning of the quarter across both equity and fixed income markets. The Dow declined by 6% in the first week. This is the worst start in its nearly 90-year history. The index ultimately reached its low point in mid-February, declining 10%. Equity markets in other geographies endured even more material declines during the quarter, with the Shanghai down as much as 25% and the U.K. down as much as 21%. Credits spreads also widened significantly intra-quarter, particularly for high-yield and energy-related issuers. Global central bank activity, which front and center again during the quarter. After raising rates in December for the first time in more than 9 years, the market heavily debated the Federal Reserve's future actions. 
In the Eurozone, European Central Bank took additional stimulus measures well beyond with initially expected by the market. And finally, the Bank of Japan moved interest rates into negative territory. With all of these factors at work, it isn't surprising that it resulted in a difficult operating environment for our clients and by extension, constrained opportunities in each of our business segments. 
Within Investment Banking, for example, industry-wide equity underwriting volumes declined by 57% year-over-year. Performance was challenged for many of our IPS client. For example, nearly 80% of the largest active U.S. equity mutual funds underperformed their benchmarks in the quarter. As you would expect, with markets flat to down worldwide, our equity investing business was negatively impacted. 
And finally, incentive fees declined during the quarter due to limited harvesting opportunities. 
With that as a backdrop, let's now discuss individual business performance in greater detail. Investment Banking produced first quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, 5% lower than the fourth quarter, as we saw lower client activity across M&A and equity underwriting. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased since the end of the year, but is still up relative to a year ago. 
Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the first quarter. Advisory revenues were $771 million, the 12% decline relative to the fourth quarter reflects a decrease in the number of completed M&A transactions. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide-announced M&A. We advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the first quarter, including Syngenta's $43.6 billion cash tender offer from Chem China; Bell $11.3 billion acquisition by Sherman Williams; and ADP's $12 billion acquisition by Apollo. 
We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the first quarter, including EG Groups $47 billion sterling acquisition by Royal Dutch Shell. Group's $12.5 billion sterling acquisition of EE Limited and Petco Animal Supplies $4.6 billion sale to a consortium of investors. 
Moving to underwriting. Net revenues were $692 million in the first quarter, up 4% sequentially as a pickup in debt underwriting more than offset a slowdown in equity issuance. Equity underwriting revenues were $183 million. This was down significantly compared to the fourth quarter due to a decrease in offerings industry-wide. Debt underwriting revenues were up 16% to $509 million and benefited from strong investment-grade issuance. 
During the first quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Rubbermaid $8 billion financing to support its acquisition of Jordan. This is $4 billion loan in bond offering to support its acquisition of Solara and Debit Energies $1.5 billion follow-on offering.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses. Net revenues were $3.4 billion in the first quarter, up 20% compared to the fourth quarter. In the quarter, we early adopted the new accounting standard for DVA, which is now captured in other comprehensive income. DVA for the current quarter was immaterial. 
FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.7 billion in the first quarter, up 48% sequentially as client activity improved in many businesses from weak fourth quarter levels. As I mentioned, the operating environment across the FICC complex was quite difficult due to macro uncertainty and volatile markets. This led to a challenging backdrop for our clients with weak investment performance and drove difficult market-making conditions of the firm. The environment in the first quarter of 2016 stands in stark contrast to the environment in the first quarter of last year. Consequently, there was a substantial downward revenue pressure year-over-year. 
Interest rates and currencies were significantly lower. Client activity and interest rates held up relatively well. However, activity within currencies in -- excuse me, declined compared to a strong first quarter of last year. Credit also decreased significantly as market conditions remained difficult, particularly in Europe. Commodities was weaker as client activity was muted with energy prices remaining low. Mortgages continue to be challenged as spreads widened for some products and client activity remained low. In Equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the first quarter were $1.8 billion, up 1% sequentially. First quarter results in Equities were roughly consistent with the back half of last year, but significantly weaker compared to a robust performance in the first quarter of 2015. Net revenues declined 23% year-over-year and reflected the impact of a challenging environment for our clients and the firm. Equities client execution net revenues of $470 million were down significantly year-over-year. Higher volatility and global equity market weakness at the beginning of a quarter impacted investor conviction and risk appetite. Commissions and fees were $878 million, up 9% year-over-year as client activity increased in our lower-touch electronic channels. Security services generated net revenues of $432 million, up 10% year-over-year on improved spreads. 
Turning to risk. Average daily VaR in the first quarter was $72 million, up slightly from $71 million in the fourth quarter. 
Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities. Collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $87 million in the first quarter. In equity securities, markdowns on public investments entirely offset net revenues and private investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $87 million. Revenues were driven by net interest income. This was partially offset by increased provisions on our corporate energy exposures. 
In Investment Management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion. This was down 13% from the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of lower incentive fees and management and other fees. During the quarter, management and other fees were down 6% sequentially to $1.2 billion due to a change in the mix of client assets and strategies. Assets under supervision increased $35 billion sequentially to a record $1.29 trillion, primarily due to net inflows into liquidity and long-term fee-based products. We had $16 billion of net inflows into liquidity products, $10 billion of long-term net inflows, primarily driven by Fixed Income and Equity products and $9 billion of market appreciation.
Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, declined by 40% versus the first quarter of 2015. The significant reduction in compensation and benefits expense reflects the more challenging revenue environment and translated into a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%. First quarter noncompensation expenses were $2.1 billion, significantly lower than the fourth quarter and 6% lower than the first quarter of 2015. This is the lowest quarterly level since the second quarter of 2009. 
Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the first quarter. Total staff was approximately 36,500, down 1% from year-end 2015. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28%. Our global core liquid assets ended the first quarter at $196 billion, and our balance sheet and Level 3 assets were $878 billion and $24 billion, respectively. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.2% under the Basel III Advanced Approach. It was 13.4% using the Standardized Approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6%. 
And finally, we repurchased 10 million shares of common stock for $1.55 billion in the quarter. 
In conclusion, the first quarter was obviously a difficult period for our clients, the markets and our opportunity set. While clearly we don't control the opportunity set, we proactively took action in key areas that we do control: Our cost structure and our capital. In addition, this is the first quarter in a while that we face significant headwinds across each of our business segments. Given that we operate in a cyclical industry, it shouldn't be surprising that there will be difficult quarters. 
That being said, we don't create deep client relationships in the quarter. We don't hire our people for a quarter, and we certainly don't build businesses for a quarter. Our success has been predicated on having a strong culture that promotes both a long-term perspective while simultaneously being very focused on managing in the current environment. That long-term focus has been the foundation for building a leading global investment bank and creating superior results for our shareholders. As we look forward, we are committed to remaining nimble and efficient operators, disciplined capital allocators and prudent risk managers. Our commitment to these principles has been and will continue to be the basis for our performance over time. Thanks again for dialing in, and I'm happy to answer your questions."

And although the market feels a little fragile from all that, it feels like, for the most part, that feels like that's behind it, but we'll see how the year progresses. In terms of the longer-term observation around the competitive dynamic, again, in a quarter like this, it's hard to see it when our clients are experiencing such volatility and such stress.

Commitment does not mean inaction. And I think that's a little bit confused in this message. And actually, as far as I can tell, Mike, all of our U.S. peers, they're committed to FICC, too. But back to Goldman Sachs for a second. If you think about the things we've done over the last couple of years, since the middle of 2013, we've taken the ICS balance sheet down 25% and the FICC RWAs and credit down 30%. On the cost side, we've been very focused on the capital side. And on the cost side, since the beginning of 2012, we've taken FICC with a headcount down 10, and we've taken compensation down by more than 20%. So I wouldn't say that there's been any inaction. However, I would reiterate that we've been quite committed to our clients and committed to the returns. Now look, this has been and I admit it I agree with Mike, this has been a tough period and this has been a long cycle. But we have a long history of managing our business across the cycle.

While that evolution in historical perspective feels short, it was a multiyear process that really began in 1999 and it finished in the mid-2000s and continues to evolve. I wouldn't -- I don't know necessarily that I would agree with that word the tipping point. It's all about opinions. But it feels like we're in an evolution where obviously clients are looking for efficiencies and we're looking for efficiencies. But the reality is that a vast majority of the Fixed Income market is more bespoke. It won't lend itself to that. But to the extent to which we can deliver to our clients and drive efficiencies, we're obviously very focused on it."

I think the safety and soundness of the large U.S. banks and the whole system, they deserve a lot of credit for driving some of that. Obviously, we made a lot of changes to our balance sheet even prior to the regulation. But I think you have to give them a lot of credit for. I think that all these good benefits, which we all benefit from, they come at some marginal cost. It's very hard to measure that marginal cost. I don't know -- I have yet to see a very good analysis that breaks down in great detail the impact of negative rates, the fact that we had declining spreads for multiple years that increased asset holdings for mutual funds compared to the shrinkage of bank balance sheets and come up with something that really does a great cost-benefit analysis. I don't think we've seen that. But I think we have to argue the benefits are pretty clear. Now as it informs our strategy, we have an obligation to deliver to our clients, and we have an obligation to make sure that we comply with the rules in the way that we can most thoughtfully. And so that's how we approach our strategy. To the extent which there was demand for the balance sheet and client activity picked up and that demand was accretive to returns, we'd be happy to grow the balance sheet given the strength of our capital ratios. But we just haven't seen that. So we are not seeing us do this. But over time, the system's going to have to balance liquidity needs. And I think that'll happen. It just may take a while."

I think so far, the markets have adjusted the things, as I said before, very well. And the regulatory has done a good job in introducing swap execution facilities and gradually implementing these things. So I think the extent to which those things have occurred it's been helpful. I think what most people talk about liquidity in the marketplace really relates to transacting corporate credit and high-yield credit. And I don't know of a technological solution that is sort of a cure-all for that. It's all very bespoke. And that may be an area that for a while the market struggles with.

Net revenues were $6.3 billion; net earnings, $1.1 billion; and earnings per diluted share, $2.68. Net earnings to common included a $161 million benefit related to the successful tender of our APEX securities. The tender added $0.36 per diluted share.
The first quarter of 2016 was challenging. It started with renewed uncertainty about the global economic outlook with the possibility of a recession even being raised. These concerns included growth prospects for China, plummeting oil prices, a strengthening U.S. dollar and multiple geopolitical events to name a few. All of these came into focus during an eventful first quarter. These concerns translated into significant price pressure at the beginning of the quarter across both equity and fixed income markets. The Dow declined by 6% in the first week. This is the worst start in its nearly 90-year history. The index ultimately reached its low point in mid-February, declining 10%. Equity markets in other geographies endured even more material declines during the quarter, with the Shanghai down as much as 25% and the Nikkei down as much as 21%. Credit spreads also widened significantly intra-quarter, particularly for high-yield and energy-related issuers.
Global central bank activity was front and center again during the quarter. After raising rates in December for the first time in more than 9 years, the market heavily debated the Federal Reserve's future actions. In the Eurozone, European Central Bank took additional stimulus measures well beyond what was initially expected by the market. And finally, the Bank of Japan moved interest rates into negative territory. With all of these factors at work, it isn't surprising that it resulted in a difficult operating environment for our clients and, by extension, constrained opportunities in each of our business segments.
Within Investment Banking, for example, industry-wide equity underwriting volumes declined by 57% year-over-year. Performance was challenged for many of our ICS clients. For example, nearly 80% of the largest active U.S. equity mutual funds underperformed their benchmarks in the quarter.
As you would expect, with markets flat to down worldwide, our equity investing business was negatively impacted.
And finally, incentive fees declined during the quarter due to limited harvesting opportunities.
With that as a backdrop, let's now discuss individual business performance in greater detail. Investment Banking produced first quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, 5% lower than the fourth quarter, as we saw lower client activity across M&A and equity underwriting. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased since the end of the year but is still up relative to a year ago.
Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the first quarter. Advisory revenues were $771 million. The 12% decline relative to the fourth quarter reflects a decrease in the number of completed M&A transactions. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide-announced M&A. We advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the first quarter, including Syngenta's $43.6 billion cash tender offer from ChemChina, Valspar's $11.3 billion acquisition by Sherwin-Williams and ADT's $12 billion acquisition by Apollo.
We also advised on a number of significant transaction that closed during the first quarter, including BG Group's GBP 47 billion acquisition by Royal Dutch Shell, BT Group's GBP 12.5 billion acquisition of EE Limited and Petco Animal Supplies $4.6 billion sale to a consortium of investors. 
Moving to underwriting. Net revenues were $692 million in the first quarter, up 4% sequentially, as a pickup in debt underwriting more than offset a slowdown in equity issuance. Equity underwriting revenues were $183 million. This was down significantly compared to the fourth quarter due to a decrease in offerings industry-wide. Debt underwriting revenues were up 16% to $509 million and benefited from strong investment-grade issuance.
During the first quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Newell Rubbermaid $8 billion financing to support its acquisition of Jarden, Vista's $4 billion loan in bond offering to support its acquisition of Solera and Devon Energy's $1.5 billion follow-on offering.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses. Net revenues were $3.4 billion in the first quarter, up 20% compared to the fourth quarter. In the quarter, we early adopted a new accounting standard for DVA, which is now captured in other comprehensive income. DVA for the current quarter was immaterial. 
FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.7 billion in the first quarter, up 48% sequentially, as client activity improved in many businesses from weak fourth quarter levels. As I mentioned, the operating environment across the FICC complex was quite difficult due to macro uncertainty and volatile markets. This led to a challenging backdrop for our clients with weak investment performance and drove difficult market-making conditions for the firms. The environment in the first quarter of 2016 stands in stark contrast to the environment in the first quarter of last year. Consequently, there was a substantial downward revenue pressure year-over-year.
Interest rates and currencies were significantly lower. Client activity and interest rates held up relatively well. However, activity within currencies in -- excuse me, declined compared to a strong first quarter of last year. Credit also decreased significantly as market conditions remained difficult, particularly in Europe. Commodities was weaker as client activity was muted with energy prices remaining low. Mortgages continued to be challenged as spreads widened for some products and client activity remained low. 
In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the first quarter were $1.8 billion, up 1% sequentially. First quarter results in equities were roughly consistent with the back half of last year but significantly weaker compared to a robust performance in the first quarter of 2015. Net revenues declined 23% year-over-year and reflected the impact of a challenging environment for our clients and the firm. Equities client execution net revenues of $470 million were down significantly year-over-year. Higher volatility and global equity market weakness at the beginning of the quarter impacted investor conviction and risk appetite. Commissions and fees were $878 million, up 9% year-over-year as client activity increased in our lower-touch electronic channels. Security services generated net revenues of $432 million, up 10% year-over-year on improved spreads.
Turning to risk. Average daily VaR in the first quarter was $72 million, up slightly from $71 million in the fourth quarter.
Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities. Collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $87 million in the first quarter. In equity securities, markdowns on public investments entirely offset net revenues in private investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $87 million. Revenues were driven by net interest income. This was partially offset by increased provisions on our corporate energy exposures.
In Investment Management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion. This was down 13% from the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of lower incentive fees and management and other fees. During the quarter, management and other fees were down 6% sequentially to $1.2 billion due to a change in the mix of client assets and strategies. Assets under supervision increased $35 billion sequentially to a record $1.29 trillion, primarily due to net inflows into liquidity and long-term fee-based products. We had $16 billion of net inflows into liquidity products; $10 billion of long-term net inflows, primarily driven by fixed income and equity products; and $9 billion of market appreciation.
Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, declined by 40% versus the first quarter of 2015. The significant reduction in compensation and benefits expense reflects the more challenging revenue environment and translated into a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%. First quarter noncompensation expenses were $2.1 billion, significantly lower than the fourth quarter and 6% lower than the first quarter of 2015. This is the lowest quarterly level since the second quarter of 2009.
Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the first quarter. Total staff was approximately 36,500, down 1% from year-end 2015. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28%. Our global core liquid assets ended the first quarter at $196 billion and our balance sheet and Level 3 assets were $878 billion and $24 billion, respectively. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.2% under the Basel III Advanced Approach. It was 13.4% using the Standardized Approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6%. And finally, we repurchased 10 million shares of common stock for $1.55 billion in the quarter.
In conclusion, the first quarter was obviously a difficult period for our clients, the markets and our opportunity set. While clearly we don't control the opportunity set, we proactively took action in key areas that we do control: our cost structure and our capital. In addition, this is the first quarter in a while that we faced significant headwinds across each of our business segments. Given that we operate in a cyclical industry, it shouldn't be surprising that there will be difficult quarters.
That being said, we don't create deep client relationships in a quarter, we don't hire our people for a quarter and we certainly don't build businesses for a quarter. Our success has been predicated on having a strong culture that promotes both a long-term perspective while simultaneously being very focused on managing through the current environment. That long-term focus has been the foundation for building a leading global investment bank and creating superior results for our shareholders. As we look forward, we are committed to remaining nimble and efficient operators, disciplined capital allocators and prudent risk managers. Our commitment to these principles has been and will continue to be the basis for our performance over time.
Thanks again for dialing in, and I'm happy to answer your questions."

And obviously, all firms have adjusted to Volcker. So I don't think those are drivers. I think when you look at year-over-year, obviously, we had a very strong first quarter '15 relative to the peer set. And I know revenues is the most transparent benchmark you have. But when you look at the performance in the first quarter, obviously, we outperformed in the first quarter of last year and obviously much more challenging for us this quarter."

So the -- in terms of the I&L balance sheet, let's just start there. The I&L balance sheet is $99 billion. Of that, in terms of -- you spoke about equity, roughly $15 billion of that is corporate equity. In terms of the equity line, both private and public, basically, the public portfolio was down roughly $140 million during the quarter, and that was offset by private marks. Of those marks that were positive, they were virtually all event related. And remember, that's the language we use going to describe the fact that there's a sale or a refinancing, and then there were negative marks in the portfolio obviously also. So that's really the structure in terms of the course of the quarter. In terms of Volcker, because I think you're asking about the equity funds, so the -- in terms of Volcker, basically, we stop at the -- we start at the top of, let's just say, the waterfall [ph]. There's $7.5 billion in covered funds. You then have to take out approved Volcker activities, then you take out the public money. And the way we ask you to look at it is there's roughly $4.5 billion remaining, and that money obviously sits alongside our clients in these funds. Is there anything else you asked that I missed?"

We're looking to basically provide service to all those clients as best we can through long, long cycles. But you're seeing obviously the positive inflows, which are quite good.

And although the market feels a little fragile from all that, it feels like -- for the most part, that feels like that's behind us, but we'll see how the year progresses. In terms of the longer-term observation around the competitive dynamic, again, in a quarter like this, hard to see it when our clients are experiencing such volatility and such stress. But I think based on announcements and parts of the business where we're seeing client flows move, engagement with clients is quite good and we're getting good feedback.

When you look at what has happened through the quarter and the rebound in the markets, I'm trying to just gauge on the parts of the business that are as simple as markets are up, and so you should start to see some improving trends versus maybe unlike the I&L, you mentioned the provision on the debt side. So how significant or how much follow through are we going to see that could maybe weigh on that part of the business. And same thing on the incentives -- on the incentive fees and the performance fees in Investment Management. I don't know if there's a way to gauge the types of products that generate the performance fees. How much are absolute versus relative or what products are below hurdles?"

And so that's why I provided it that way. So as I mentioned, for example, there are parts of the portfolio, as you know, that are public equity securities where, again, we may sit alongside our clients. As those are monetized out of a fund, there are restrictions and lockup periods. And so that portfolio, as I mentioned, was negative, roughly $140 million during the course of the quarter. And so there will be some element, idiosyncratic movement, sometimes that portfolio outperformed. When you look at history, it has generally outperformed. Even if you take the last 8 quarters, including this quarter, the entire I&L segment has generated $11 billion in revenues. In terms of incentive fees, it's going to be specific, obviously, to performance, which has been solid. But obviously, mortgage is going to have an influence on incentive fees also."

We have expressed a commitment to FICC. What we mean by that very explicitly is we're committed to our clients and we're committed to providing superior returns over the cycle. Commitment does not mean inaction. And I think that's what gets a little bit confused in this message. And actually, as far as I can tell, Mike, all of our U.S. peers, they're committed to FICC, too. But back to Goldman Sachs for a second. If you think about the things we've done over the last couple of years, since the middle of 2013, we've taken the ICS balance sheet down 25% and FICC RWAs market and credit down 30%. On the cost side -- so we've been very focused on the capital side. And on the cost side, since the beginning of 2012, we've taken FICC, the headcount down 10, and we've taken compensation down by more than 20%. So I wouldn't say that there's been any inaction. However, I would reiterate that we've been quite committed to our clients and committed to the returns. Now look, this has been -- and I admit it, I agree with you, Mike, this has been a tough period and this has been a long cycle. But we have a long history of managing our business across the cycle. In 2009, we didn't overinvest in the top. And we're going to be thoughtful about not underinvesting, but we are certainly responding to the last several years of decline in industry revenue."

I think that the safety and soundness of the large U.S. banks and the whole system, they deserve a lot of credit for driving some of that. Obviously, we made a lot of changes to our balance sheet even prior to the regulation. But I think you have to give them a lot of credit for. I think that all these good benefits, which we all benefit from, they come at some marginal cost. It's very hard to measure that marginal cost. I don't know -- I have yet to see a very good analysis that breaks down in great detail the impact of negative rates, the fact that we had declining spreads for multiple years, that increased asset holdings for mutual funds compared to the shrinkage of bank balance sheets and come up with something that really does a great cost-benefit analysis. I don't think we've seen that. But I think we have to argue the benefits are pretty clear. Now as it informs our strategy, we have an obligation to deliver to our clients, and we have an obligation to make sure that we comply with the rules in the way that we can most thoughtfully. And so that's how we approach our strategy. To the extent to which there was demand for the balance sheet and client activity picked up and that demand was accretive to returns, we'd be happy to grow the balance sheet given the strength of our capital ratios. But we just haven't seen that. So we are not seeing us do this. But I mean, over time, the system's going to have to balance liquidity needs. And I think that'll happen. It just may take a while."

I think so far, the markets have adjusted to things, as I said before, very well. And the regulators have done a very good job of introducing swap execution facilities and gradually implementing these things. So I think to the extent to which those things have occurred, it's been helpful. I think when most people talk about liquidity in the marketplace, really relates to transacting corporate credit and high-yield credit. And I don't know of a technological solution that is sort of a cure-all for that. It's all very bespoke. And that may be an area that for a while the market struggles with.

Its revenues have been flatlining for, let's say, 5 years. Its earnings -- pretax earnings this year, certainly last year, are half of what you did in 2007. When does Goldman say the time has come for transformational change, that we must do something radically different because we're getting nowhere? We're just treading water for 9 years now.

I'll walk you through the first quarter results, then I'm happy to answer any questions. Net revenues were $6.3 billion; net earnings, $1.1 billion; and earnings per diluted share, $2.68. Net earnings t",1656,"Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the first quarter results, then I'm happy to answer any questions. Net revenues were $6.3 billion; net earnings, $1.1 billion; and earnings per diluted share, $2.68. Net earnings to common included a $161 million benefit related to the successful tender of our APEX securities. The tender added $0.36 per diluted share.
The first quarter of 2016 was challenging. It started with renewed uncertainty about the global economic outlook with the possibility of a recession even being raised. These concerns included growth prospects for China, plummeting oil prices, a strengthening U.S. dollar and multiple geopolitical events, to name a few. All of these came into focus during an eventful first quarter. These concerns translated into significant price pressure at the beginning of the quarter across both equity and fixed income markets. The Dow declined by 6% in the first week. This is the worst start in its nearly 90-year history. The index ultimately reached its low point in mid-February, declining 10%. Equity markets in other geographies endured even more material declines during the quarter, with the Shanghai down as much as 25% and the Nikkei down as much as 21%. Credit spreads also widened significantly intra-quarter, particularly for high-yield and energy-related issuers.
Global central bank activity was front and center again during the quarter. After raising rates in December for the first time in more than 9 years, the market heavily debated the Federal Reserve's future actions. In the Eurozone, the European Central Bank took additional stimulus measures well beyond what was initially expected by the market. And finally, the Bank of Japan moved interest rates into negative territory. With all of these factors at work, it isn't surprising that it resulted in a difficult operating environment for our clients, and by extension, constrained opportunities in each of our business segments.
Within Investment Banking, for example, industry-wide equity underwriting volumes declined by 57% year-over-year. Performance was challenged for many of our ICS clients. For example, nearly 80% of the largest active U.S. equity mutual funds underperformed their benchmarks in the quarter.
As you would expect, with markets flat to down worldwide, our equity investing business was negatively impacted.
And finally, incentive fees declined during the quarter due to limited harvesting opportunities.
With that as a backdrop, let's now discuss individual business performance in greater detail. Investment Banking produced first quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, 5% lower than the fourth quarter, as we saw lower client activity across M&A and equity underwriting. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased since the end of the year, but is still up relative to a year ago.
Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the first quarter, advisory revenues were $771 million. The 12% decline relative to the fourth quarter reflects a decrease in the number of completed M&A transactions. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced M&A. We advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the first quarter, including Syngenta's $43.6 billion cash tender offer from ChemChina, Valspar's $11.3 billion acquisition by Sherwin-Williams and ADT's $12 billion acquisition by Apollo.
We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the first quarter, including BG Group's GBP 47 billion acquisition by Royal Dutch Shell, BT Group's GBP 12.5 billion acquisition of EE Limited and Petco Animal Supplies' $4.6 billion sale to a consortium of investors. 
Moving to underwriting. Net revenues were $692 million in the first quarter, up 4% sequentially, as a pickup in debt underwriting more than offset a slowdown in equity issuance. Equity underwriting revenues were $183 million. This was down significantly compared to the fourth quarter due to a decrease in offerings industry-wide. Debt underwriting revenues were up 16% to $509 million and benefited from strong investment-grade issuance.
During the first quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Newell Rubbermaid's $8 billion financing to support its acquisition of Jarden, Vista's $4 billion loan and bond offering to support its acquisition of Solera and Devon Energy's $1.5 billion follow-on offering.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.4 billion in the first quarter, up 20% compared to the fourth quarter. In the quarter, we early adopted the new accounting standard for DVA, which is now captured in other comprehensive income. DVA for the current quarter was immaterial. 
FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.7 billion in the first quarter, up 48% sequentially, as client activity improved in many businesses from weak fourth quarter levels. As I mentioned, the operating environment across the FICC complex was quite difficult due to macro uncertainty and volatile markets. This led to a challenging backdrop for our clients with weak investment performance and drove difficult market-making conditions for the firms. The environment in the first quarter of 2016 stands in stark contrast to the environment in the first quarter of last year. Consequently, there was a substantial downward revenue pressure year-over-year.
Interest rates and currencies were significantly lower. Client activity and interest rates held up relatively well. However, activity within currencies to -- excuse me, declined compared to a strong first quarter of last year. Credit also decreased significantly as market conditions remained difficult, particularly in Europe. Commodities was weaker, as client activity was muted with energy prices remaining low. Mortgages continued to be challenged as spreads widened for certain products and client activity remained low. 
In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the first quarter were $1.8 billion, up 1% sequentially. First quarter results in equities were roughly consistent with the back half of last year but significantly weaker compared to a robust performance in the first quarter of 2015. Net revenues declined 23% year-over-year and reflected the impact of a challenging environment for our clients and the firm. Equities client execution net revenues of $470 million were down significantly year-over-year. Higher volatility and global equity market weakness at the beginning of the quarter impacted investor conviction and risk appetite. Commissions and fees were $878 million, up 9% year-over-year as client activity increased in our lower-touch electronic channels. Security services generated net revenues of $432 million, up 10% year-over-year on improved spreads.
Turning to risk. Average daily VaR in the first quarter was $72 million, up slightly from $71 million in the fourth quarter.
Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities. Collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $87 million in the first quarter. In equity securities, markdowns on public investments entirely offset net revenues in private investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $87 million. Revenues were driven by net interest income. This was partially offset by increased provisions on our corporate energy exposures.
In Investment Management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion. This was down 13% from the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of lower incentive fees and management and other fees. During the quarter, management and other fees were down 6% sequentially to $1.2 billion due to a change in the mix of client assets and strategies. Assets under supervision increased $35 billion sequentially to a record $1.29 trillion, primarily due to net inflows into liquidity and long-term fee-based products. We had $16 billion of net inflows into liquidity products; $10 billion of long-term net inflows, primarily driven by fixed income and equity products; and $9 billion of market appreciation.
Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, declined by 40% versus the first quarter of 2015. The significant reduction in compensation and benefits expense reflects the more challenging revenue environment and translated into a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%. First quarter noncompensation expenses were $2.1 billion, significantly lower than the fourth quarter and 6% lower than the first quarter of 2015. This is the lowest quarterly level since the second quarter of 2009.
Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the first quarter. Total staff was approximately 36,500, down 1% from year-end 2015. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28%. Our global core liquid assets ended the first quarter at $196 billion and our balance sheet and Level 3 assets were $878 billion and $24 billion, respectively. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.2% under the Basel III Advanced Approach. It was 13.4% using the Standardized Approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6%. And finally, we repurchased 10 million shares of common stock for $1.55 billion in the quarter.
In conclusion, the first quarter was obviously a difficult period for our clients, the markets and our opportunity set. While clearly we don't control the opportunity set, we proactively took action in key areas that we do control: our cost structure and our capital. In addition, this is the first quarter in a while that we faced significant headwinds across each of our business segments. Given that we operate in a cyclical industry, it shouldn't be surprising that there will be difficult quarters.
That being said, we don't create deep client relationships in a quarter, we don't hire our people for a quarter and we certainly don't build businesses for a quarter. Our success has been predicated on having a strong culture that promotes both a long-term perspective while simultaneously being very focused on managing to the current environment. That long-term focus has been the foundation for building a leading global investment bank and creating superior results for our shareholders. As we look forward, we are committed to remaining nimble and efficient operators, disciplined capital allocators and prudent risk managers.

Of that, in terms of -- you spoke about equity, roughly $15 billion of that is corporate equity. In terms of the equity line, both private and public, basically, the public portfolio was down roughly $140 million during the quarter, and that was offset by private marks. Of those marks that were positive, they were virtually all event related. And remember, that's the language we use going to describe the fact that there's a sale or a refinancing, and then there were negative marks in the portfolio obviously also. So that's really the structure in terms of the course of the quarter. In terms of Volcker, because I think you're asking about the equity funds, so the -- in terms of Volcker, basically, we stop at the -- we start at the top of, let's just say, the waterfall, there's $7.5 billion in covered funds. You then have to take out approved Volcker activities, then you take out the public money. And the way we ask you to look at it is there's roughly $4.5 billion remaining, and that money obviously sits alongside our clients in these funds. Is there anything else you asked that I missed?"

In terms of the longer-term observation around the competitive dynamic, again, in a quarter like this, hard to see it when our clients are experiencing such volatility and such stress.

And so there will be some element of idiosyncratic movement, sometimes that portfolio outperformed. When you look at history, it has generally outperformed. Even if you take the last 8 quarters, including this quarter, the entire I&L segment has generated $11 billion in revenues.

Commitment does not mean inaction. And I think that's what gets a little bit confused in this message. And actually, as far as I can tell, Mike, all of our U.S. peers, they're committed to FICC, too. But back to Goldman Sachs for a second. If you think about the things we've done over the last couple of years, since the middle of 2013, we've taken the ICS balance sheet down 25% and FICC RWAs market and credit down 30%. On the cost side -- so we've been very focused on the capital side. And on the cost side, since the beginning of 2012, we've taken FICC-related headcount down 10%, and we've taken compensation down by more than 20%. So I wouldn't say that there's been any inaction. However, I would reiterate that we've been quite committed to our clients and committed to the returns. Now look, this has been -- and I admit it, because I agree with you, Mike, this has been a tough period and this has been a long cycle.

And obviously, we made a lot of changes to our balance sheet even prior to the regulation. But I think you have to give them a lot of credit for it. I think that all these good benefits, which we all benefit from, they come at some marginal cost. It's very hard to measure that marginal cost. I don't know -- I have yet to see a very good analysis that breaks down in great detail the impact of negative rates, the fact that we had declining spreads for multiple years, that increased asset holdings for mutual funds compared to the shrinkage of bank balance sheets and come up with something that really does a great cost-benefit analysis. I don't think we've seen that. But I think we have to argue the benefits are pretty clear. Now as it informs our strategy, we have an obligation to deliver to our clients, and we have an obligation to make sure that we comply with the rules in the way that we can most thoughtfully. And so that's how we approach our strategy. To the extent to which there was demand for the balance sheet and client activity picked up and that demand was accretive to returns, we'd be happy to grow the balance sheet given the strength of our capital ratios.

And the regulators have done a very good job of introducing swap execution facilities and gradually implementing these things. So I think the extent to which those things have occurred, it's been helpful. I think when most people talk about liquidity in the marketplace, it really relates to transacting corporate credit and high-yield credit. And I don't know of a technological solution that is sort of a cure-all for that. It's all very bespoke. And that may be an area that for a while the market struggles with. But not just because of regulation, it's because of all the factors I talked about before."

But the volatility does create pressures and then also advantages in certain quarters. What is your just range? And just kind of you're not -- take out a recession, but just kind of think about in general, what would be the range of outcomes, given that you do have some NII in there and you would typically have some flow of deals?

And now the majority of the balance sheet -- and this has been a transition over several years, the balance sheet has transitioned more to debt and lending activities. But that is not something, again, that we drove top-down. That was driven by the client demand and the opportunity set. As I said, look, you have to look at this over the long term. As I said earlier, including the first quarter, it's driven $11 billion of revenue over the last 8 quarters.

I'll walk you through the second quarter results, then I'm happy to answer any questions.
Net revenues, $7.9 billion; net earnings, $1.8 billion; earnings per diluted share, $3.72; and our annualized return on common equity was 8.7%.
As you all remember, the first quarter of 2016 was dominated by renewed uncertainty regarding the global economic outlook. This impacted prices across various asset classes and drove macro headwinds in each of our businesses. Many of the concerns that exist in the first quarter moderated as we started the second quarter. This is a better environment for our clients and our performance.
This was also reflected in equity markets. For example, the S&P 500 was relatively unchanged for most of April and May. In addition, we saw sequential improvements in global investment banking volumes. Activity for the first 2 months of the quarter was on pace to be up over 20% for equity offerings and nearly 15% for announced M&A. However, as we approach June, the market became increasingly focused on Brexit. The focus was on both the economic uncertainties surrounding the potential outcome and the potential economic implications of leaving the EU. These concerns negatively impacted client sentiment, risk appetites and activity levels heading into the vote.
In response to the lead vote on June 23, market volatility spiked and global equity markets declined significantly with the MSCI roll [ph] down roughly 7% in 2 days. While equity markets largely reversed those losses in the last 3 days of the quarter, clients and the broader marketplace continue to wrestle with the Brexit vote and related uncertainty.
With that as a backdrop, let's now discuss individual business performance in greater detail. 
Investment Banking produced second quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion, 22% higher than the first quarter, as we saw increased client activity across equity and debt underwriting. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased relative to the end of the first quarter and the year ago.
Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the second quarter. Advisory revenues were $794 million, up 3% from the first quarter. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. 
We advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the second quarter, including: Northstar asset management's $16.9 billion tri-party [ph] merger with Cowan and Capital and Northstar Realty Finance; Great Plant Energy's $12.2 billion acquisition of Westar Energy; and Hewlett-Packard's enterprise's $8.5 billion spin-off in merger of its enterprise services business with Computer Sciences Corporation. 
We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the second quarter, including: Charter Communications $78.7 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable and $10.4 billion acquisition of Bright House Networks; Visa Inc.'s EUR 18.7 billion acquisition of Visa Europe; and Airgas Inc.'s $13.4 billion sale to Air [indiscernible].
Moving to Underwriting. Now revenues were $993 million in the second quarter, up 43% sequentially is capital markets activity picked up from the first quarter. Equity underwriting revenues were $269 million. This was up significantly compared to weak activity in the first quarter due to an increase in IPOs. Debt underwriting revenues were up 42% to $724 million and benefited from asset-backed issuance and strong leverage finance activity.
During the second quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Milan's [ph] $6.5 billion investment-grade offering to support its acquisition of Med AB [ph]; U.S. Foods' $1.2 billion IPO; and the approximately EUR 850 million IPO of Philips Lighting.
Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses. Net revenues were $3.7 billion in the second quarter, up 7% compared to the first quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $1.9 billion in the second quarter, up 16% sequentially as market-making conditions improved in many businesses from the first quarter.
Credit and mortgages increased as the backdrop for providing liquidity was more normalized compared to the first quarter. Rates was also higher sequentially given better market-making conditions. Currencies declined relative to solid type activity levels in the first quarter, and commodities declined slightly during the quarter.
In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.8 billion, down slightly quarter-over-quarter. Equities client execution net revenues of $587 [ph] million were up 25% sequentially. Better market conditions for most of the quarter and select corporate activity drove improved performance. 
Commissions and fees were $745 million, down 15% quarter-over-quarter, as client activity decreased following heightened volumes in the first quarter. Security services generated net revenues of $422 million, down 2% relative to the first quarter as seasonally stronger client activity was offset by slightly lower customer balances and spreads.
Turning to risk. Average daily borrowing in the second quarter was $62 million, down from $72 million in the first quarter.
Moving on to our investing and lending activities. Collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.1 billion in the second quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $626 million, primarily reflecting company-specific events, sales and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $485 million and included more than $250 million of net interest income.
Investment Management. We reported second quarter net revenues of $1.4 billion, consistent with the first quarter. During the quarter, management and other fees were roughly flat sequentially at $1.2 billion. Assets under supervision increased $23 billion sequentially to a record $1.31 trillion. The $23 billion increase was substantially driven by $19 billion of net market appreciation. We also had $4 billion of net inflows with $3 billion from liquidity products and the remainder from long-term fee-based products.
Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense for the year-to-date, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%, consistent with the first half of last year.
To respond to the more challenging backdrop, we completed an expense initiative during the first and second quarter. The run rate expense savings will be roughly $700 million. In 2016, these expected savings will be partially offset by severance and other related costs. Second quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.1 billion, up slightly compared to the first quarter.
Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics. Total staff was approximately 34,800, down 5% from the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 26.8%. Our global core liquid assets ended the second quarter at $211 billion and our balance sheet was $897 billion.
Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.2% under the Basel III advanced approach. It was 13.7% using the standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.1%. All of our capital ratios are well in excess of regulatory requirements. This reflects our multiyear effort to derisk the firm and strengthen our financial profile. Given robust capital ratios, the firm is well positioned to return excess capital to shareholders. In the quarter, we repurchased 11.1 million shares of common stock for $1.7 billion.
For the 5 quarter CCAR cycle for 2015, we provided shareholders with $6.2 billion in share buybacks and $1.5 billion in common stock dividends. In terms of this year's CCAR test, we announced that the Federal Reserve Board did not object to our plan.
In conclusion, the first half of 2016 has certainly presented its fair share of challenges and concerns. At the core of these concerns is the outlook for the global economy. As you have heard us state many times before, confidence in economic growth is the most important long-term driver of our business. Confidence incentives client activity, which increases demand for our advice, our content and our execution capabilities. While like the rest of the world, we would welcome more robust economic growth, ultimately, we have to manage the firm for both the current environment and potential future opportunities.
How we've navigated the difficult environment in the first half of 2016 demonstrates both the strength and resilience of our culture. We have remained vigilant regarding our cost structure, our capital usage and our risk profile. And at the same time, we've maintained the necessary commitment to ensure that we can meet our clients' needs as they grow.
Being in a position to deliver for our clients and our shareholders requires ongoing investment and a long-term perspective. While we continue to invest in our existing set of businesses, we're also looking for new opportunities. 
One example is our digital consumer lending platform. While still in its early stages, we expect to begin the initial phase of engaging consumers this fall. As we have discussed with you in the past, we are taking a very deliberate and methodical approach to this effort. We are looking to build a durable business so it will take time. Similar to our other businesses, creating a valuable and differentiated service for our client is core to our strategy.
In summary, our ability to both react to the current world and simultaneously invest in the future will position the firm to deliver superior value to our clients and our shareholders in the years ahead. Thanks again for dialing in, and I'm happy to answer your questions."

Obviously, our market shares had been really significant. In terms of Brexit, where we sit today, given I think were the base case expectation is that the dynamic is going to play out over a long period of time. And in some respect, it might contributive some of the same factors that contributed to a very active M&A environment other than maybe very specific transactions that are geographic in nature that are really driven by geography, which is generally few.

We've had in excess of 20,000 consumers open up new accounts for us, so we've had very significant growth in a short period of time.

So we're obviously keenly aware of the fact that this is a new business opportunity for us and importantly, a new client base.

So if we saw a big uptick in client demand for our capital, we would be very happy to deploy that capital then actually not return it to shareholders. And so this really reflects the fact that the client demand for a period of time hasn't been there. Now the second thing we do, the strength of the financial footing to the firm. Obviously, you've seen us do a huge amount of work. And if you see it reflected in our ratios with 13 7 standardized at the end of this quarter, obviously we've been very focused on how we've been derisking the firm and deploying that capital when demanded from us. And ultimately, that gives you the flexibility [indiscernible] either return or not, and that's why you've seen the uptick over the past couple of years in terms of levels of activity but the average diluted share count as you pointed is at a low level --"

And this is actually -- it turns out to be a related question. You caveated in the release that the environment for FICC continues to be pretty challenging because of low rates and volumes and low client activity, which implies that there is a more normal run rate that you think is achievable. Can you give us a sense of what that might be? And does that take into account revenue pressures from shift to electronic trading as well as the -- alternatively the potential to gain share from global competitors who maybe retrenching?"

Guy, I'd say that, first, in terms of client activity levels and run rate, if you will, run rate's a difficult thing but I don't think anyone would disagree that when you look at the trading activity level and the industry trends over the last couple of years obviously it been in decline. When you look at the factors in terms of our clients and what they need, our clients are still there and they still need our services, they need them from us. And so the type of environment we've been, and if you actually look set of the, for lack of a language, the violence of the first quarter in January and February and then the concerns about Brexit in the second quarter, I think it's fair to us to say this feel like low level -- in these are the types of factors that contribute to reduced client sentiment. They reduce confidence. And as a result, they reduced activity. Now one interesting takeaway, and we've seen this before sporadically, is after Brexit, when the volumes were much higher for those couple of days, in all the things that we watch, we could see a demonstrable uptick in our market shares. That maybe the result of the current competitive environment and as we talked about a number of the global competitors are going through restructuring they've been quite challenged. And so when volumes pick up, we feel like we see it. But it's difficult for me to tell you what the run rate will be over a long period of time given the dynamic nature of market. It's an entirely unique find themselves with respect to global rate and interest rates."

So those normalization was so quick that it actually may be something that's a better a harbinger in the near term usually following one of these events for activity levels. And I could frame that for your little bit in more detail. So let's take -- so I talked about the merger business earlier. If we stay in this low growth environment, unless something is really unique impacted by Brexit and the negotiation process takes a long period of time, then as I said our, bankers don't necessarily see this being a headwind. If we stay in this low interest rate environments and you take a look over asset management business, then this is really an environment where clients need advice. And that also translates into our ICS business.

I'll walk you through the second quarter results, then I'm happy to answer any questions.
Net revenues, $7.9 billion; net earnings, $1.8 billion; earnings per diluted share, $3.72; and our annualized return on common equity was 8.7%.
As you all remember, the first quarter of 2016 was dominated by renewed uncertainty regarding the global economic outlook. This impacted prices across various asset classes and drove macro headwinds in each of our businesses. Many of the concerns that exist in the first quarter moderated as we started the second quarter. This is a better environment for our clients and our performance.
This was also reflected in equity markets. For example, the S&P 500 was relatively unchanged for most of April and May. In addition, we saw sequential improvements in global investment banking volumes. Activity for the first 2 months of the quarter was on pace to be up over 20% for equity offerings and nearly 15% for announced M&A. However, as we approach June, the market became increasingly focused on Brexit. The focus was on both the economic uncertainties surrounding the potential outcome and the potential economic implications of leaving the EU. These concerns negatively impacted client sentiment, risk appetite and activity levels heading into the vote.
In response to the leave vote on June 23, market volatility spiked and global equity markets declined significantly, with the MSCI World down roughly 7% in 2 days. While equity markets largely reversed those losses in the last 3 days of the quarter, clients and the broader marketplace continue to wrestle with the Brexit vote and related uncertainty.
With that as the backdrop, let's now discuss individual business performance in greater detail. 
Investment Banking produced second quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion, 22% higher than the first quarter as we saw increased client activity across equity and debt underwriting. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased relative to the end of the first quarter and the year ago.
Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the second quarter. Advisory revenues were $794 million, up 3% from the first quarter. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. 
We advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the second quarter, including: NorthStar Asset Management's $16.9 billion tri-party merger with Colony Capital and NorthStar Realty Finance; Great Plains Energy's $12.2 billion acquisition of Westar Energy; and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's $8.5 billion spin-off and merger of its enterprise services business with Computer Sciences Corporation. 
We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the second quarter, including: Charter Communication's $78.7 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable and $10.4 billion acquisition of Bright House Networks; Visa Inc.'s EUR 18.7 billion acquisition of Visa Europe; and Airgas, Inc.'s $13.4 billion sale to Air Liquide.
Moving to underwriting. Net revenues were $993 million in the second quarter, up 43% sequentially as capital markets activity picked up from the first quarter. Equity underwriting revenues were $269 million. This was up significantly compared to weak activity in the first quarter due to an increase in IPOs. Debt underwriting revenues were up 42% to $724 million and benefited from asset-backed issuance and strong leverage finance activity.
During the second quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Mylan's $6.5 billion investment-grade offering to support its acquisition of Meda AB; U.S. Foods' $1.2 billion IPO; and the approximately EUR 850 million IPO of Philips Lighting.
Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses. Net revenues were $3.7 billion in the second quarter, up 7% compared to the first quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $1.9 billion in the second quarter, up 16% sequentially as market-making conditions improve in many businesses from the first quarter.  Credit and mortgages increased as the backdrop for providing liquidity was more normalized compared to the first quarter. Rates was also higher sequentially given better market-making conditions. Currencies declined relative to solid client activity levels in the first quarter. And commodities declined slightly during the quarter.
In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.8 billion, down slightly quarter-over-quarter. Equities client execution net revenues of $587 million were up 25% sequentially. Better market making conditions for most of the quarter and select corporate activity drove improved performance. 
Commissions and fees were $745 million, down 15% quarter-over-quarter as client activity decreased following heightened volumes in the first quarter. Security services generated net revenues of $422 million, down 2% relative to the first quarter as seasonally stronger client activity was offset by slightly lower customer balances and spreads.
Turning to risk. Average daily borrowing in the second quarter was $62 million, down from $72 million in the first quarter.
Moving on to our investing and lending activities. Collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.1 billion in the second quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $626 million, primarily reflecting company-specific events, sales and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $485 million and included more than $250 million of net interest income.
In Investment Management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.4 billion, consistent with the first quarter. During the quarter, management and other fees were roughly flat sequentially at $1.2 billion. Assets under supervision increased $23 billion sequentially to a record $1.31 trillion. The $23 billion increase was substantially driven by $19 billion of net market appreciation. We also had $4 billion of net inflows with $3 billion from liquidity products and the remainder from long-term fee-based products.
Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense for the year-to-date, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%, consistent with the first half of last year.  To respond to the more challenging backdrop, we completed an expense initiative during the first and second quarter. The run rate expense savings will be roughly $700 million. In 2016, these expected savings will be partially offset by severance and other related costs. Second quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.1 billion, up slightly compared to the first quarter.
Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics. Total staff was approximately 34,800, down 5% from the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 26.8%. Our global core liquid assets ended the second quarter at $211 billion and our balance sheet was $897 billion.
Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.2% under the Basel III advanced approach. It was 13.7% using the standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.1%. All of our capital ratios are well in excess of regulatory requirements. This reflects our multiyear effort to derisk the firm and strengthen our financial profile. Given robust capital ratios, the firm is well-positioned to return excess capital to shareholders. In the quarter, we repurchased 11.1 million shares of common stock for $1.7 billion.
For the 5 quarter CCAR cycle for 2015, we provided shareholders with $6.2 billion in share buybacks and $1.5 billion in common stock dividends. In terms of this year's CCAR test, we announced that the Federal Reserve Board did not object to our plan.
In conclusion, the first half of 2016 has certainly presented its fair share of challenges and concerns. At the core of these concerns is the outlook for the global economy. As you have heard us state many times before, confidence in economic growth is the most important long-term driver of our business. Confidence incentivizes client activity, which increases demand for our advice, our content and our execution capabilities. While like the rest of the world, we would welcome more robust economic growth, ultimately, we have to manage the firm for both the current environment and potential future opportunities.
How we've navigated the difficult environment in the first half of 2016 demonstrates both the strength and resilience of our culture. We have remained vigilant regarding our cost structure, our capital usage and our risk profile. And at the same time, we've maintained the necessary commitment to ensure that we can meet our clients' needs as they grow.
Being in a position to deliver for our clients and our shareholders requires ongoing investment and a long-term perspective. 
While we continue to invest in our existing set of businesses, we're also looking for new opportunities.  One example is our digital consumer lending platform. While still in its early stages, we expect to begin the initial phase of engaging consumers this fall. As we have discussed with you in the past, we are taking a very deliberate and methodical approach to this effort. We are looking to build a durable business, so it will take time. Similar to our other businesses, creating a valuable and differentiated service for our client is core to our strategy.
In summary, our ability to both react to the current world and simultaneously invest in the future will position the firm to deliver superior value to our clients and our shareholders in the years ahead. 
Thanks again for dialing in, and I'm happy to answer your questions."

Obviously, our market shares have been very significant. In terms of Brexit, where we sit today, given I think that the base case expectation is that the dynamic is going to play out over a long period of time, and in some respects, it may contribute to some of the same factors that contributed to a very active M&A environment. Other than maybe very specific transactions that are geographic in nature that are really driven by geography, which is generally few, when we talk to our bankers, if we continue in this low growth environment, they don't feel sitting here today that Brexit's going to be a headwind. But obviously, it's going to be a dynamic situation."

So that's an issue obviously we monitor very closely in terms of our foreign currency risk broadly across the globe, managing a global business, but I wouldn't point to that as a significant consideration, although it's a consideration of the many things we look at. In terms of Brexit, the way I would frame it for you is I'd say there are sort of the near-term observations I can give you, and then sort of a longer-term perspective. The near-term ones would be just sort of just going through the process. Now obviously, we were preparing for Brexit well in advance, even though we all expected it to be a very, very unlikely outcome, but we were significantly prepared for that. And it really left us in a position we feel to be very front-footed with clients. Now going into Brexit, client activity tapered off. But at the point of Brexit and shortly thereafter, in a number of our businesses, we either hit near peak volumes or peak volumes or new peaks. And -- so that was quite good to see. In terms of the longer-term perspective on Brexit, as I said before, this looks like this process is going to take a while. And look, we're hopeful, along with everyone else, that the parties that are engaged in these negotiations will be prudent and thoughtful, because, obviously, look, for all of us, a thoughtful negotiation outcome will just be good for economic growth. As it relates to our business, we've been in Europe and the U.K. for a very long period of time, and we're completely committed to our clients in the region. And regardless of how these negotiations go, we're going to make sure that we're there for them. That will be my broad comments on Brexit."

So we view those, obviously, that separate in terms of like -- obviously, we view asset liability management as an integrated exercise, but those 2 efforts are separate. But having said that, the acquisition went quite well, added in excess of $15 billion of deposits to the firm. And it's great for us because it diversifies our source of the funding, which as you know, we're always looking to do. Since the acquisition date, it's been well received by consumers. We've had in excess of 20,000 consumers open up new accounts for us. So it's had very significant growth in a short period of time. So it really states -- it really speaks to the brand strength, which have been very nice to see. Now in terms of the longer-term objectives, maybe I'll just take an opportunity to level set you on where we are in the online lending. So as we talked about, we hired Harit over a year ago and he's been a fantastic addition to the team. And he's built a very capable team over that period of time. And so I think it's probably important just to level set you on where -- how we approach this process. So we're obviously keenly aware of the fact that this is a new business opportunity for us, and importantly, a new client base. And so one of the things we did is we reached out to thousands of consumers to really understand what they want and their borrowing priorities. And through that, we learned some things that probably aren't so surprising. They want a product that's simple, it's straightforward, it provides a lot of value. And they also want what they refer to as really a high-quality user experience. And so what we've attempted to do, taking all this feedback, we developed one product. I've emphasized -- we've emphasized a number of times that we're going to be very deliberate and slow with this. So we've developed one product which we plan to launch later this fall.

The first and most important is that we put ourselves in a very strong financial position so that we're there for our clients. So if we saw a big uptick in client demand for our capital, we would be very happy to deploy that capital then actually not return it to shareholders. And so this really reflects the fact that the client demand for a period of time hasn't been there. Now the second thing we do in the strength of the financial footings of the firm, obviously, you've seen us do a huge amount of work. And if you see it reflected in our ratios with 13 7 standardized at the end of this quarter, obviously we've been very focused on how we've been derisking the firm and deploying that capital when demanded for us.

Guy, I'd say that, first, in terms of client activity levels and run rate, if you will, run rate's a difficult thing. But I don't think anyone would disagree that when you look at the trading activity levels and the industry trends over the last couple of years, obviously, that'd been in decline. When you look at the factors in terms of our clients and what they need, our clients are still there and they still need those services, they need them from us. And so the type of environment we've been, and if you actually look at sort of the, for lack of better language, the violence of the first quarter in January and February and then the concerns about Brexit in the second quarter, I think it's fair for us to say these feel like low level -- these are the types of factors that contribute to reduced client sentiment. They reduce confidence. And as a result, they reduce activity. Now one interesting takeaway, and we've seen this before sporadically, is after Brexit, when volumes were much higher for those couple of days, in all the things that we watch, we could see a demonstrable uptick in our market shares. That may be the result of the current competitive environment. As we talked about, a number of the global competitors are going through restructurings. They've been quite challenged. And so when volumes pick up, we feel like we see it. But it's difficult for me to tell you what the run rate will be over a long period of time given the dynamic nature of markets.

It's interesting how the world -- so the market reaction, I kind of remember, right around Brexit. Obviously, I don't think surprising to any of us. I think you could've sat there, those last -- those couple of days after Brexit, and if you were forecasting the next month of activity, I think you might have been surprised if we could have known in advance that equity markets would be down so strongly. There'd be a rebound in currencies and then the world would sort of normalize. And I think that may be a little bit different, to go back to the core of your question, about things we've seen in the past. So this normalization was so quick that it actually may be something that's a better a harbinger in the near term usually following one of these events for activity levels. And I could frame that for you a little bit in more detail. So let's take -- so I talked about the merger business earlier. If we stay in this low growth environment, unless something is really uniquely impacted by Brexit and if the negotiation process takes a long period of time, then as I said, our bankers don't necessarily see this being a headwind. If we stay in this low interest rate environment and you take a look at over our asset management business, then this is really an environment where clients need advice. And that also translates into our ICS business. This is a very content rich environment now and markets have stabilized so quickly, whether it's debt or equity, et cetera, that I don't know if I would've guessed, a couple of weeks ago that the market would have rebounded so quickly? But it feels pretty normalized for now."

But in the first quarter of 2015, when we had improved market environment, we were very quickly able to deliver lots of operating leverage. And you saw in the year, 15% ROE in that quarter. Like I said, feels like a long time ago now. We continually review all the businesses to ensure that we're maintaining the right footprint. So this is all about making sure that we find the right balance between our commitment to our clients over the long term and expense management. And obviously, the first half of this year has not been the greatest environment, and so you're just seeing us respond to it."

I'll walk you through the second quarter results, then I'm happy to answer any questions.
Net revenues, $7.9 billion; net earnings, $1.8 billion; earnings per diluted share, $3.72; and our annualized return on common equity was 8.7%.
As you all remember, the first quarter of 2016 was dominated by renewed uncertainty regarding the global economic outlook. This impacted prices across various asset classes and drove macro headwinds in each of our businesses. Many of the concerns that exist in the first quarter moderated as we started the second quarter. This was a better environment for our clients and our performance.
This was also reflected in equity markets. For example, the S&P 500 was relatively unchanged for most of April and May. In addition, we saw sequential improvements in global investment banking volumes. Activity for the first 2 months of the quarter was on pace to be up over 20% for equity offerings and nearly 15% for announced M&A. However, as we approach June, the market became increasingly focused on Brexit. The focus was on both the economic uncertainties surrounding the potential outcome and the potential economic implications of leaving the EU. These concerns negatively impacted client sentiment, risk appetite and activity levels heading into the vote.
In response to the leave vote on June 23, market volatility spiked and global equity markets declined significantly, with the MSCI World down roughly 7% in 2 days. While equity markets largely reversed those losses in the last 3 days of the quarter, clients and the broader marketplace continue to wrestle with the Brexit vote and related uncertainty.
With that as the backdrop, let's now discuss individual business performance in greater detail. 
Investment Banking produced second quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion, 22% higher than the first quarter as we saw increased client activity across equity and debt underwriting. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased relative to the end of the first quarter and the year ago.
Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the second quarter. Advisory revenues were $794 million, up 3% from the first quarter. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. 
We advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the second quarter, including: NorthStar Asset Management's $16.9 billion tri-party merger with Colony Capital and NorthStar Realty Finance; Great Plains Energy's $12.2 billion acquisition of Westar Energy; and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's $8.5 billion spin-off and merger of its enterprise services business with Computer Sciences Corporation. 
We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the second quarter, including: Charter Communication's $78.7 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable and $10.4 billion acquisition of Bright House Networks; Visa Inc.'s EUR 18.7 billion acquisition of Visa Europe; and Airgas, Inc.'s $13.4 billion sale to Air Liquide.
Moving to underwriting. Net revenues were $993 million in the second quarter, up 43% sequentially as capital markets activity picked up from the first quarter. Equity underwriting revenues were $269 million. This was up significantly compared to weak activity in the first quarter due to an increase in IPOs. Debt underwriting revenues were up 42% to $724 million and benefited from asset-backed issuance and strong leverage finance activity.
During the second quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Mylan's $6.5 billion investment-grade offering to support its acquisition of Meda AB; U.S. Foods' $1.2 billion IPO; and the approximately EUR 850 million IPO of Philips Lighting.
Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses. Net revenues were $3.7 billion in the second quarter, up 7% compared to the first quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $1.9 billion in the second quarter, up 16% sequentially as market-making conditions improved in many businesses from the first quarter. Credit and mortgages increased as the backdrop for providing liquidity was more normalized compared to the first quarter. Rates was also higher sequentially given better market-making conditions. Currencies declined relative to solid client activity levels in the first quarter. And commodities declined slightly during the quarter.
In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.8 billion, down slightly quarter-over-quarter. Equities client execution net revenues of $587 million were up 25% sequentially. Better market making conditions for most of the quarter and select corporate activity drove improved performance. 
Commissions and fees were $745 million, down 15% quarter-over-quarter as client activity decreased following heightened volumes in the first quarter. Security services generated net revenues of $422 million, down 2% relative to the first quarter as seasonally stronger client activity was offset by slightly lower customer balances and spreads.
Turning to risk. Average daily VaR in the second quarter was $62 million, down from $72 million in the first quarter.
Moving on to our investing and lending activities. Collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.1 billion in the second quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $626 million, primarily reflecting company-specific events, sales and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $485 million and included more than $250 million of net interest income.
In Investment Management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.4 billion, consistent with the first quarter. During the quarter, management and other fees were roughly flat sequentially at $1.2 billion. Assets under supervision increased $23 billion sequentially to a record $1.31 trillion. The $23 billion increase was substantially driven by $19 billion of net market appreciation. We also had $4 billion of net inflows with $3 billion from liquidity products and the remainder from long-term fee-based products.
Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense for the year-to-date, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%, consistent with the first half of last year.  To respond to the more challenging backdrop, we completed an expense initiative during the first and second quarter. The run rate expense savings will be roughly $700 million. In 2016, these expected savings will be partially offset by severance and other related costs. Second quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.1 billion, up slightly compared to the first quarter.
Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics. Total staff was approximately 34,800, down 5% from the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 26.8%. Our global core liquid assets ended the second quarter at $211 billion and our balance sheet was $897 billion.
Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.2% under the Basel III advanced approach. It was 13.7% using the standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.1%. All of our capital ratios are well in excess of regulatory requirements. This reflects our multiyear effort to derisk the firm and strengthen our financial profile. Given robust capital ratios, the firm is well-positioned to return excess capital to shareholders. In the quarter, we repurchased 11.1 million shares of common stock for $1.7 billion.
For the 5 quarter CCAR cycle for 2015, we provided shareholders with $6.2 billion in share buybacks and $1.5 billion in common stock dividends. In terms of this year's CCAR test, we announced that the Federal Reserve Board did not object to our plan.
In conclusion, the first half of 2016 has certainly presented its fair share of challenges and concerns. At the core of these concerns is the outlook for the global economy. As you have heard us state many times before, confidence in economic growth is the most important long-term driver of our business. Confidence incentivizes client activity, which increases demand for our advice, our content and our execution capabilities. While like the rest of the world, we would welcome more robust economic growth, ultimately, we have to manage the firm for both the current environment and potential future opportunities.
How we've navigated the difficult environment in the first half of 2016 demonstrates both the strength and resilience of our culture. We have remained vigilant regarding our cost structure, our capital usage and our risk profile. And at the same time, we've maintained the necessary commitment to ensure that we can meet our clients' needs as they grow.
Being in the position to deliver for our clients and our shareholders requires ongoing investment and a long-term perspective. 
While we continue to invest in our existing set of businesses, we're also looking for new opportunities. One example is our digital consumer lending platform. While still in its early stages, we expect to begin the initial phase of engaging consumers this fall. As we have discussed with you in the past, we are taking a very deliberate and methodical approach to this effort. We are looking to build a durable business, so it will take time. Similar to our other businesses, creating a valuable and differentiated service for our clients is core to our strategy.
In summary, our ability to both react to the current world and simultaneously invest in the future will position the firm to deliver superior value to our clients and our shareholders in the years ahead. 
Thanks again for dialing in, and I'm happy to answer your questions."

Obviously, our market shares have been very significant. In terms of Brexit, where we sit today, given I think that the base case expectation is that the dynamic is going to play out over a long period of time, and in some respects, it may contribute to some of the same factors that contributed to a very active M&A environment. Other than maybe very specific transactions that are geographic in nature that are really driven by geography, which is generally few, when we talk to our bankers, if we continue in this low growth environment, they don't feel sitting here today that Brexit's going to be a headwind.

In terms of Brexit, the way I would frame it for you is I'd say there are sort of the near-term observations I can give you and then sort of a longer-term perspective. The near-term ones would be just sort of just going through the process. Now obviously, we were preparing for Brexit well in advance, even though we all expected it to be a very, very unlikely outcome, but we were significantly prepared for that. And it really left us in a position, we feel, to be very front-footed with clients. Now going into Brexit, client activity tapered off. But at the point of Brexit and shortly thereafter, in a number of our businesses, we either hit near peak volumes or peak volumes or new peaks. And -- so that was quite good to see. In terms of the longer-term perspective on Brexit, as I said before, this looks like this process is going to take a while. And look, we're hopeful, along with everyone else, that the parties that are engaged in these negotiations will be prudent and thoughtful, because, obviously, look, for all of us, a thoughtful negotiation outcome will just be good for economic growth. As it relates to our business, we've been in Europe and the U.K. for a very long period of time, and we're completely committed to our clients in the region. And regardless of how these negotiations go, we're going to make sure that we're there for them. That would be my broad comments on Brexit."

So why don't I just start there, and I'll take your question in reverse. So we view those -- obviously, that's separate in terms of like, obviously, we view asset liability management as an integrated exercise, but those 2 efforts are separate. But having said that, the acquisition went quite well, added in excess of $15 billion of deposits to the firm. And it's great for us because it diversifies our sources of funding, which as you know, we're always looking to do. Since the acquisition date, it's been well received by consumers. We've had in excess of 20,000 consumers open up new accounts for us. So it's had very significant growth in a short period of time. So it really states -- it really speaks to the brand strength, which has been very nice to see. Now in terms of the longer-term objectives, maybe I'll just take an opportunity to level set you on where we are in the online lending. So as we talked about, we hired Harit over a year ago and he's been a fantastic addition to the team. And he's built a very capable team over that period of time. And so I think it's probably important just to level set you on where -- how we approach this process. So we're obviously keenly aware of the fact that this is a new business opportunity for us, and importantly, a new client base. And so one of the things we did is we reached out to thousands of consumers to really understand what they want and their borrowing priorities. And through that, we learned some things that probably aren't so surprising. They want a product that's simple, it's straightforward, it provides a lot of value. And they also want what they refer to as really a high-quality user experience. And so what we've attempted to do, taking all this feedback, we developed one product. I've emphasized -- we've emphasized a number of times that we're going to be very deliberate and slow with this. So we've developed one product which we plan to launch later this fall. So that's where we stand [indiscernible] over the next couple of months."

So you have to think about -- and it's obviously more complicated than this, but you have to think about the 3 competing factors that we're always managing. The first and most important is that we put ourselves in a very strong financial position so that we're there for our clients. So if we saw a big uptick in client demand for our capital, we would be very happy to deploy that capital and actually not return it to shareholders. And so this really reflects the fact that the client demand for a period of time hasn't been there. Now the second thing we do in the terms of the strength of the financial footings of the firm, obviously, you've seen us do a huge amount of work. And it's -- you see it reflected in our ratios with 13.7% standardized at the end of this quarter, obviously we've been very focused on how we've been derisking the firm in deploying that capital when demanded for us.

Guy, I'd say that, first, in terms of client activity levels and run rate, if you will, run rate's a difficult thing. But I don't think anyone would disagree that when you look at the trading activity levels and the industry trends over the last couple of years, obviously, they've been in decline. When you look at the factors in terms of our clients and what they need, our clients are still there and they still need those services, they need them from us. And so the type of environment we've been in, if you actually look at sort of the, for lack of better language, the violence of the first quarter in January and February and then the concerns about Brexit in the second quarter, I think it's fair for us to say these feel like low -- these are the types of factors that contribute to reduced client sentiment. They reduce confidence. And as a result, they reduce activity. Now one interesting takeaway, and we've seen this before, sporadically, is after Brexit, when volumes were much higher for those couple of days, in all the things that we watch, we could see a demonstrable uptick in our market shares. That may be the result of the current competitive environment. As we talked about, a number of the global competitors are going through restructuring. They've been quite challenged. And so when volumes pick up, we feel like we see it. But it's difficult for me to tell you what the run rate will be over a long period of time given the dynamic nature of markets and kind of the unique place we find ourselves with respect to global growth and interest rates."

I think that's a reasonable question in terms of just the unique nature of Brexit. It's interesting how the world -- so the market reaction and the activity levels right around Brexit, Obviously, I don't think surprising to any of us. I think you could've sat there, those last -- those couple of days after Brexit, and if you were forecasting the next month of activity, I think you might have been surprised if we could have known in advance that equity markets would rebound so strongly. There'd be a rebound in currencies and then the world would sort of normalize. And I think I may be a little bit different, to go back to the core of your question, about things we've seen in the past. So this normalization was so quick that it actually may be something that's a better harbinger in the near term usually following one of these events for activity levels. And I could frame that for you a little bit in more detail. So let's take -- so I talked about the merger business earlier. If we stay in this low growth environment, unless something is really uniquely impacted by Brexit and if the negotiation process takes a long period of time, then as I said, our bankers don't necessarily see this being a headwind. If we stay in this low interest rate environment and you take a look at over our asset management business, then this is really an environment where clients need advice. And that also translates into our ICS business. This is a very content rich environment now and markets have stabilized so quickly, whether it's debt or equity, et cetera, that I don't know if I would've guessed, a couple of weeks ago that the market would have rebounded so quickly. But it feels pretty normalized -- for now."

This particular effort, when we looked at it, we really felt like best designed from scratch. And the reason for that is I think we're kind of uniquely positioned. It allows us to leverage our technology skills and our risk skills. But this is really about if you look at sort of the competitive landscape, there are benefits that online lending platforms provide to consumers and there are benefits that large commercial providers of credit provide to consumers. We're just really looking to bridge the gap between those strengths and offer consumers as best we can a really thoughtful, differentiated product."

So the industry, again, has been working with the regulators through various bodies, and we'll see how the regulators finally respond to that.

I'll walk you through the second quarter results, then I'm happy to answer any questions.
Net revenues, $7.9 billion; net earnings, $1.8 billion; earnings per diluted share, $3.72; and our annualized return on common equity was 8.7%.
As you all remember, the first quarter of 2016 was dominated by renewed uncertainty regarding the global economic outlook. This impacted prices across various asset classes and drove macro headwinds in each of our businesses. Many of the concerns that exist in the first quarter moderated as we started the second quarter. This was a better environment for our clients and our performance.
This was also reflected in equity markets. For example, the S&P 500 was relatively unchanged for most of April and May. In addition, we saw sequential improvements in global investment banking volumes. Activity for the first 2 months of the quarter was on pace to be up over 20% for equity offerings and nearly 15% for announced M&A. However, as we approach June, the market became increasingly focused on Brexit. The focus was on both the economic uncertainties surrounding the potential outcome and the potential economic implications of leaving the EU. These concerns negatively impacted client sentiment, risk appetite and activity levels heading into the vote.
In response to the leave vote on June 23, market volatility spiked and global equity markets declined significantly, with the MSCI World down roughly 7% in 2 days. While equity markets largely reversed those losses in the last 3 days of the quarter, clients and the broader marketplace continue to wrestle with the Brexit vote and related uncertainty.
With that as the backdrop, let's now discuss individual business performance in greater detail. 
Investment Banking produced second quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion, 22% higher than the first quarter as we saw increased client activity across equity and debt underwriting. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased relative to the end of the first quarter and the year ago.
Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the second quarter. Advisory revenues were $794 million, up 3% from the first quarter. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. 
We advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the second quarter, including: NorthStar Asset Management's $16.9 billion tri-party merger with Colony Capital and NorthStar Realty Finance; Great Plains Energy's $12.2 billion acquisition of Westar Energy; and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's $8.5 billion spin-off and merger of its enterprise services business with Computer Sciences Corporation. 
We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the second quarter, including: Charter Communication's $78.7 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable and $10.4 billion acquisition of Bright House Networks; Visa Inc.'s EUR 18.7 billion acquisition of Visa Europe; and Airgas, Inc.'s $13.4 billion sale to Air Liquide.
Moving to underwriting. Net revenues were $993 million in the second quarter, up 43% sequentially as capital markets activity picked up from the first quarter. Equity underwriting revenues were $269 million. This was up significantly compared to weak activity in the first quarter due to an increase in IPOs. Debt underwriting revenues were up 42% to $724 million and benefited from asset-backed issuance and strong leverage finance activity.
During the second quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Mylan's $6.5 billion investment-grade offering to support its acquisition of Meda AB; U.S. Foods' $1.2 billion IPO; and the approximately EUR 850 million IPO of Philips Lighting.
Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses. Net revenues were $3.7 billion in the second quarter, up 7% compared to the first quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $1.9 billion in the second quarter, up 16% sequentially as market-making conditions improved in many businesses from the first quarter. Credit and mortgages increased as the backdrop for providing liquidity was more normalized compared to the first quarter. Rates was also higher sequentially given better market-making conditions. Currencies declined relative to solid client activity levels in the first quarter. And commodities declined slightly during the quarter.
In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.8 billion, down slightly quarter-over-quarter. Equities client execution net revenues of $587 million were up 25% sequentially. Better market-making conditions for most of the quarter and select corporate activity drove improved performance. 
Commissions and fees were $745 million, down 15% quarter-over-quarter as client activity decreased following heightened volumes in the first quarter. Security services generated net revenues of $422 million, down 2% relative to the first quarter as seasonally stronger client activity was offset by slightly lower customer balances and spreads.
Turning to risk. Average daily VaR in the second quarter was $62 million, down from $72 million in the first quarter.
Moving on to our investing and lending activities. Collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.1 billion in the second quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $626 million, primarily reflecting company-specific events, sales and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $485 million and included more than $250 million of net interest income.
In Investment Management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.4 billion, consistent with the first quarter. During the quarter, management and other fees were roughly flat sequentially at $1.2 billion. Assets under supervision increased $23 billion sequentially to a record $1.31 trillion. The $23 billion increase was substantially driven by $19 billion of net market appreciation. We also had $4 billion of net inflows with $3 billion from liquidity products and the remainder from long-term fee-based products.
Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense for the year-to-date, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%, consistent with the first half of last year.  To respond to the more challenging backdrop, we completed an expense initiative during the first and second quarter. The run rate expense savings will be roughly $700 million. In 2016, these expected savings will be partially offset by severance and other related costs. Second quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.1 billion, up slightly compared to the first quarter.
Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics. Total staff was approximately 34,800, down 5% from the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 26.8%. Our global core liquid assets ended the second quarter at $211 billion and our balance sheet was $897 billion.
Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.2% under the Basel III advanced approach. It was 13.7% using the standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.1%. All of our capital ratios are well in excess of regulatory requirements. This reflects our multiyear effort to derisk the firm and strengthen our financial profile. Given robust capital ratios, the firm is well-positioned to return excess capital to shareholders. In the quarter, we repurchased 11.1 million shares of common stock for $1.7 billion.
For the 5 quarter CCAR cycle for 2015, we provided shareholders with $6.2 billion in share buybacks and $1.5 billion in common stock dividends. In terms of this year's CCAR test, we announced that the Federal Reserve Board did not object to our plan.
In conclusion, the first half of 2016 has certainly presented its fair share of challenges and concerns. At the core of these concerns is the outlook for the global economy. As you have heard us state many times before, confidence in economic growth is the most important long-term driver of our business. Confidence incentivizes client activity, which increases demand for our advice, our content and our execution capabilities. While like the rest of the world, we would welcome more robust economic growth, ultimately, we have to manage the firm for both the current environment and potential future opportunities.
How we've navigated the difficult environment in the first half of 2016 demonstrates both the strength and resilience of our culture. We have remained vigilant regarding our cost structure, our capital usage and our risk profile. And at the same time, we've maintained the necessary commitment to ensure that we can meet our clients' needs as they grow.
Being in the position to deliver for our clients and our shareholders requires ongoing investment and a long-term perspective. 
While we continue to invest in our existing set of businesses, we're also looking for new opportunities. One example is our digital consumer lending platform. While still in its early stages, we expect to begin the initial phase of engaging consumers this fall. As we have discussed with you in the past, we are taking a very deliberate and methodical approach to this effort. We are looking to build a durable business, so it will take time. Similar to our other businesses, creating a valuable and differentiated service for our clients is core to our strategy.
In summary, our ability to both react to the current world and simultaneously invest in the future will position the firm to deliver superior value to our clients and our shareholders in the years ahead. 
Thanks again for dialing in, and I'm happy to answer your questions."

So if you're actually standing here at the end of June last year, obviously, the second quarter and first half of last year were very dynamic. If you look at the backlog in aggregate, it's sort of down mid-single digits. And so that's the trajectory of the backlog. I don't think it's surprising coming off of high levels. It is where it is. Obviously, our market shares have been very significant. In terms of Brexit, where we sit today, given I think that the base case expectation is that the dynamic is going to play out over a long period of time, and in some respects, it may contribute to some of the same factors that contributed to a very active M&A environment. Other than maybe very specific transactions that are geographic in nature that are really driven by geography, which is generally few, when we talk to our bankers, if we continue in this low growth environment, they don't feel sitting here today that Brexit's going to be a headwind. But obviously, it's going to be a dynamic situation."

In terms of Brexit, the way I would frame it for you is I'd say there are sort of the near-term observations I can give you and then sort of a longer-term perspective. The near-term ones would be just sort of just going through the process. Now obviously, we were preparing for Brexit well in advance, even though we all expected it to be a very, very unlikely outcome, but we were significantly prepared for that. And it really left us in a position, we feel, to be very front-footed with clients. Now going into Brexit, client activity tapered off. But at the point of Brexit and shortly thereafter, in a number of our businesses, we either hit near-peak volumes or peak volumes or new peaks. And -- so that was quite good to see. In terms of the longer-term perspective on Brexit, as I said before, this looks like this process is going to take a while. And look, we're hopeful, along with everyone else, that the parties that are engaged in these negotiations will be prudent and thoughtful, because, obviously, look, for all of us, a thoughtful negotiation outcome will just be good for economic growth. As it relates to our business, we've been in Europe and the U.K. for a very long period of time, and we're completely committed to our clients in the region. And regardless of how these negotiations go, we're going to make sure that we're there for them. That would be my broad comments on Brexit."

But having said that, the acquisition went quite well, added in excess of $15 billion of deposits to the firm. And it's great for us because it diversifies our sources of funding, which as you know, we're always looking to do. Since the acquisition date, it's been well received by consumers. We've had in excess of 20,000 consumers open up new accounts for us. So it's had very significant growth in a short period of time. So it really states -- it really speaks to the brand strength, which has been very nice to see. Now in terms of the longer-term objectives, maybe I'll just take an opportunity to level set you on where we are in the online lending. So as we talked about, we hired Harit over a year ago and he's been a fantastic addition to the team. And he's built a very capable team over that period of time. And so I think it's probably important just to level set you on where -- how we approach this process. So we're obviously keenly aware of the fact that this is a new business opportunity for us, and importantly, a new client base. And so one of the things we did is we reached out to thousands of consumers to really understand what they want and their borrowing priorities. And through that, we learned some things that probably aren't so surprising. They want a product that's simple, it's straightforward, it provides a lot of value. And they also want what they refer to as really a high-quality user experience. And so what we've attempted to do, taking all this feedback, we developed one product. I've emphasized -- we've emphasized a number of times that we're going to be very deliberate and slow with this. So we've developed one product which we plan to launch later this fall.

So you have to think about -- and it's obviously more complicated than this, but you have to think about the 3 competing factors that we're always managing. The first and most important is that we put ourselves in a very strong financial position so that we're there for our clients. So if we saw a big uptick in client demand for our capital, we would be very happy to deploy that capital and actually not return it to shareholders. And so this really reflects the fact that the client demand for a period of time hasn't been there. Now the second thing we do in the terms of the strength of the financial footings of the firm, obviously, you've seen us do a huge amount of work. And it's -- you see it reflected in our ratios with 13.7% standardized at the end of this quarter, obviously we've been very focused on how we've been derisking the firm in deploying that capital when demanded for us.

Guy, I'd say that, first, in terms of client activity levels and run rate, if you will, run rate's a difficult thing. But I don't think anyone would disagree that when you look at the trading activity levels and the industry trends over the last couple of years, obviously, they've been in decline. When you look at the factors in terms of our clients and what they need, our clients are still there and they still need those services, they need them from us. And so the type of environment we've been in, if you actually look at sort of the, for lack of better language, the violence of the first quarter in January and February and then the concerns about Brexit in the second quarter, I think it's fair for us to say these feel like low -- these are the types of factors that contribute to reduced client sentiment. They reduce confidence. And as a result, they reduce activity. Now one interesting takeaway, and we've seen this before, sporadically, is after Brexit, when volumes were much higher for those couple of days, in all the things that we watch, we could see a demonstrable uptick in our market shares. That may be the result of the current competitive environment. As we talked about, a number of the global competitors are going through restructuring. They've been quite challenged. And so when volumes pick up, we feel like we see it. But it's difficult for me to tell you what the run rate will be over a long period of time given the dynamic nature of markets and kind of the unique place we find ourselves with respect to global growth and interest rates."

I think you could've sat there, those last -- those couple of days after Brexit, and if you were forecasting the next month of activity, I think you might have been surprised if we could have known in advance that equity markets would rebound so strongly. There'd be a rebound in currencies and then the world would sort of normalize. And I think I may be a little bit different, to go back to the core of your question, about things we've seen in the past. So this normalization was so quick that it actually may be something that's a better harbinger in the near term usually following one of these events for activity levels. And I could frame that for you a little bit in more detail. So let's take -- so I talked about the merger business earlier. If we stay in this low growth environment, unless something is really uniquely impacted by Brexit and if the negotiation process takes a long period of time, then as I said, our bankers don't necessarily see this being a headwind. If we stay in this low interest rate environment and you take a look at over our asset management business, then this is really an environment where clients need advice. And that also translates into our ICS business. This is a very content-rich environment now and markets have stabilized so quickly, whether it's debt or equity, et cetera, that I don't know if I would've guessed, a couple of weeks ago that the market would have rebounded so quickly.

So you were very accurate in your high-level commentary, but the balance sheet is down roughly $2 billion quarter-over-quarter, down to 97.1. And that breaks out between roughly $20.8 billion of what we call equity. And of that, $3.5 billion is public equity. And the total, $16.8 billion of corporate equity. And then the rest, as you said, is debt. And with respect to the NIM, in part, it has to do with deposits. But for the most part, it has to do with the quality of the portfolio. So as you know, a large portion of the portfolio is collateralized, so just less risky."

I was trying to think of the timing of the severance in relation to the gains in a sense of the expense savings and how that might have affected the second quarter."

So the industry, again, has been working with the regulators through various bodies, and we'll see how the regulators finally respond to that.

I'll walk you through the third quarter and year-to-date results, and I'm happy to answer any questions.Net revenues were $8.2 billion; net earnings, $2.1 billion; earnings per diluted share, $4.88; a",1470,"Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the third quarter and year-to-date results, and I'm happy to answer any questions.
Net revenues were $8.2 billion; net earnings, $2.1 billion; earnings per diluted share, $4.88; and our annualized return on common equity was 11.2%.
For the year-to-date, net revenues were $22.4 billion; net earnings, $5.1 billion; earnings per diluted share, $11.24; and our annualized return on common equity was 8.7%.
Relative to the first quarter of this year, the second, and now the third quarter, have shown steady improvements. This improvement is reflected in third quarter revenues, which increased 19% year-over-year. We also had a modest sequential increase, which is particularly noteworthy given the third quarter is often seasonally slower.
A few factors contributed to the enhanced operating environments. The markets generally improved with equity prices steadily moving higher. The S&P 500 was up 3.3% in the third quarter. The MSCI World increased by 4.8%, and the mix declined by 15%. Credit spreads also tightened during the quarter with U.S. investment-grade and high-yield cash spreads tighter by 12 basis points and 87 basis points, respectively. In addition, there weren't any major changes to the global economic outlook over the course of the quarter. For example, consensus estimates for global GDP growth remains roughly consistent.
Ultimately, a more favorable backdrop and improved client sentiment translated into year-over-year revenue growth in 3 of our 4 business segments.
Now let's discuss them. Investment Banking produced third quarter revenues of $1.5 billion, 14% lower than a strong second quarter. Although revenues declined sequentially, our Investment Banking backlog remained robust and was up versus last quarter.
Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the quarter, Advisory revenues were $658 million, down 17% [ph] compared to the second quarter as industry-wide completed activity declined. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A.
We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter, including: ARM Holdings' GBP 24.4 billion sale to Softbank Group; AGL Resources' $12 billion merger with Southern Company; and Lockheed Martin's $5 billion spinoff and merger of its IS&GS business into Leidos.
We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the third quarter, including: WhiteWave Foods' $12.5 billion sale to Groupe Danone; Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's $8.8 billion spinoff and merger of noncore software assets with Micro Focus International; and Abbott Medical Optics' $4.3 billion sale to Johnson & Johnson.
Moving to Underwriting. Revenues were $879 million in the third quarter, down 11% sequentially due to a decline in both debt and equity underwriting. Equity underwriting revenues were $227 million, down 16% compared to the second quarter due to a continued weak backdrop for equity issuance. However, the end of the quarter was significantly more active in the beginning with more than half of the quarter's IPO volume occurring in September. Debt underwriting revenues of $652 million were down 10% quarter-over-quarter, following a robust second quarter. For the first 9 months of the year, debt underwriting produced record year-to-date results.
During the third quarter, we actively supported our client financing needs, participating in Postal Savings Bank of China's $7.4 billion IPO; Great Plains Energy's $2.5 billion follow-on and convertible offerings to support its purchase of Westar; and Fortis' $2 billion investment-grade offering for the purchase of ITC.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses. Net revenues were $3.7 billion in the third quarter, up 2% compared to the second quarter. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $2 billion in the third quarter, up 2% sequentially. Credit increased and benefited from strong primary issuance and tighter spreads. Mortgages also increased and included better market-making conditions given tighter spreads. Rates is down slightly as client activity was driven by the continued discussion around potential Central Bank actions. Currencies was essentially unchanged compared to the second quarter with lower client activity, particularly post the Brexit vote. And commodities declined during the quarter as activity remained light.
In Equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.8 billion, up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Equities client execution net revenues of $678 million were up 16% sequentially, reflecting better market-making conditions. Commissions and fees were $719 million, down 3% quarter-over-quarter. Security services generated net revenues of $387 million, down 8% relative to the seasonally stronger second quarter.
Turning to risk, average daily borrowing in the third quarter declined to $57 million, down $5 million sequentially.
Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities. Collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.4 billion in the third quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $920 million, reflecting company-specific events, sales and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $478 million and included approximately $275 million of net interest income.
In Investment Management, we reported third quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, up 10% from the second quarter as incentive fees, management fees and transaction revenues all increased.
Assets under supervision increased $37 billion sequentially to a record $1.35 trillion. The increase was due to net market appreciation and net inflows. Long-term fee-based net inflows of $14 billion were primarily driven by fixed income products.
Now let me turn to expenses. Year-to-date compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization and prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, declined by 13%. This was roughly in line with net revenues. The 13% year-to-date decline results in a compensation to net revenues ratio of 41%. This is 100 basis points lower in the firm's accrual in the first half of this year.
Third quarter noncompensation expenses were $2.1 billion, down slightly compared to the second quarter.
Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics. Total staff was approximately 34,900, roughly flat with the second quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 26.9%. Our global core liquid assets ended the third quarter at $214 billion, and our balance sheet was $880 billion.
Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 14% using the Standardized Approach. It was 12.4% under the Basel III Advanced Approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.3%.
In the quarter, we repurchased 7.8 million shares for $1.3 billion.
In terms of capital, our ratios have significantly strengthened over the last several years. This reflects the transformation of our balance sheet and our cumulative efforts to derisk the firm. All of these actions, combined with more than $30 billion of earnings since 2011, position the firm to grow our capital ratios and simultaneously bring our basic share count to its lowest point ever.
Before I wrap up, I want to cover 3 topics: our client franchise, expense initiatives and new opportunities. With respect to our global client franchise, it's in great shape. We have a strong position in each of our 4 segments: Investment Banking, Institutional Client Services, Investing & Lending and Investment Management. While many of our clients are currently challenged by the low-growth environment, we are committed to partnering with them as they look to navigate these headwinds.
On expenses, last quarter, we discussed the $700 million savings initiative that we undertook in the first half of the year, and we continue to look at additional means of improving our efficiency without impacting our global client franchise.
Focusing on operating efficiency not only positions us for margin expansion and better environments, but it also provides additional benefits. It allows the firm to maintain its global footprint and to continue to invest in the future, which is an essential component of sustainable value creation. While there are currently economic headwinds in several countries globally, our focus on efficiency across all of our businesses and regions allows the firm not only to maintain but also to invest in our client franchise through the cycle. Additionally, our expense discipline allows us to invest in new opportunities.
Last week, we launched a new online personal loan platform, Marcus by Goldman Sachs. Marcus' goal is to enter the consumer credit market and provide a product that is simple, transparent, flexible and provides consumers with real value. Like any new effort, we are taking a slow and methodical approach with Marcus. We are leveraging all of the firm's preexisting strengths across risk management and technology, and we have broad and experienced team of consumer lending professionals to drive Marcus forward, led by Harit Talwar.
Before taking your questions, I'd like to leave you with one thought. The firm is as focused on navigating today's environment as we are on preparing for the future. You have to do the first really well to be in a position to do the latter.
Thanks again for dialing in, and I'm happy to answer your questions."

Now -- and some of this is not new for us, our technology skills, the risk management, but the interface through the technology with this new important client base, it's a different space for us. So we've hired, obviously, people with decades of experience. But I think the greatest mitigating factor is slow growth, monitoring it very closely. But also, when we put this together, we took input from consumers, and it really is, I don't know if it's the first-ever, but it really is a lending product that is driven by consumer input. And so that means providing them with flexibility, with real value, with simplicity. And that's why we've come out with something, and we got feedback, consumers don't necessarily like and they don't understand the fee structures. So we created a no-fee product, no small print.

So we manage the firm obviously on the forward-looking basis in terms of how we stress tests. We obviously also manage the spot capital ratios. And under our spot capital ratios, as you can see, we have lots of capacity. And so we'll have to see ultimately the details in the MPR, but again, they did the right thing here by giving the bank the opportunity to make adjustments. Because as you know, this won't be incorporated into the 2017 cycle. And so the extent to which firms need to adapt, will be able to adapt after we see the MPR.

So we welcome all that. With respect to our business, we've obviously been very vocal in our commitment to the commodity business, and some of that I think maybe that gets misunderstood. So I want to underscore for you a bit. What we're committed to is serving our clients and their needs, and you kind unpack that a bit and simplify by saying there's really 3 activities that are critical to our clients. It's critical for them to hedge, and that's consumers and producers would have commodity price exposure. Financing of those businesses is critical. And then obviously, market-making activities, which provide liquidity to the markets under a critical component of making those markets function. That's what we're most committed to. You've seen over the years, we've been reducing on balance sheet, investing in commodities. And so we'll work with the industry and with regulators like we would in any MPR process. But what we're more focused on ensuring that those services from a Goldman Sachs' perspective and across the industry can get provided to clients in a safe and cost-effective way. No different than if we were to approach any of the MPRs."

And maybe over time, you'll see price adjustments. But certainly, in things like more capital intensive parts of the business like Prime Brokerage where we're a market leader.

I think the most important takeaway is whether or not we move into that environment in the near term, we're incorporating all those current factors in how we're running the firm today, which in a pretty muted environment, we're able to grow revenues, demonstrate a double-digit ROE and we've truly believe we're well positioned in the franchise with significant operating leverage if the environment improves.

We feel like as an information sharing platform with better security, better compliance controls, we felt like that was something that are utilized by a broad range of market participants. And lastly, our own technology internally is quite important for making us more efficient and adapting to regulatory change and managing our risks, and that's obviously been very core to what we do.

I'll walk you through the third quarter and year-to-date results, and I'm happy to answer any questions.
Net revenues were $8.2 billion; net earnings, $2.1 billion; earnings per diluted share, $4.88; and our annualized return on common equity was 11.2%.
For the year-to-date, net revenues were $22.4 billion; net earnings, $5.1 billion; earnings per diluted share, $11.24; and our annualized return on common equity was 8.7%.
Relative to the first quarter of this year, the second, and now the third quarter, have shown steady improvements. This improvement is reflected in third quarter revenues, which increased 19% year-over-year. We also had a modest sequential increase, which is particularly noteworthy given the third quarter is often seasonally slower.
A few factors contributed to the enhanced operating environments. The markets generally improved with equity prices steadily moving higher. The S&P 500 was up 3.3% in the third quarter. The MSCI World increased by 4.8%, and the mix declined by 15%. Credit spreads also tightened during the quarter with U.S. investment-grade and high-yield cash spreads tighter by 12 basis points and 87 basis points, respectively. In addition, there weren't any major changes to the global economic outlook over the course of the quarter. For example, consensus estimates for global GDP growth remains roughly consistent.
Ultimately, a more favorable backdrop and improved client sentiment translated into year-over-year revenue growth in 3 of our 4 business segments.
Now let's discuss them. Investment Banking produced third quarter revenues of $1.5 billion, 14% lower than a strong second quarter. Although revenues declined sequentially, our Investment Banking backlog remained robust and was up versus last quarter.
Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the quarter, Advisory revenues were $658 million, down 17% compared to the second quarter as industry-wide completed activity declined. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A.
We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter, including: ARM Holdings' GBP 24.4 billion sale to Softbank Group; AGL Resources' $12 billion merger with Southern Company; and Lockheed Martin's $5 billion spinoff and merger of its IS&GS business into Leidos.
We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the third quarter, including: WhiteWave Foods' $12.5 billion sale to Groupe Danone; Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's $8.8 billion spinoff and merger of noncore software assets with Micro Focus International; and Abbott Medical Optics' $4.3 billion sale to Johnson & Johnson.
Moving to Underwriting. Revenues were $879 million in the third quarter, down 11% sequentially due to a decline in both debt and equity underwriting. Equity underwriting revenues were $227 million, down 16% compared to the second quarter due to a continued weak backdrop for equity issuance. However, the end of the quarter was significantly more active in the beginning with more than half of the quarter's IPO volume occurring in September. Debt underwriting revenues of $652 million were down 10% quarter-over-quarter, following a robust second quarter. For the first 9 months of the year, debt underwriting produced record year-to-date results.
During the third quarter, we actively supported our client financing needs, participating in Postal Savings Bank of China's $7.4 billion IPO; Great Plains Energy's $2.5 billion follow-on and convertible offerings to support its purchase of Westar; and Fortis' $2 billion investment-grade offering for the purchase of ITC.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses. Net revenues were $3.7 billion in the third quarter, up 2% compared to the second quarter. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $2 billion in the third quarter, up 2% sequentially. Credit increased and benefited from strong primary issuance and tighter spreads. Mortgages also increased and included better market-making conditions given tighter spreads. Rates is down slightly as client activity was driven by the continued discussion around potential Central Bank actions. Currencies was essentially unchanged compared to the second quarter with lower client activity, particularly post the Brexit vote. And commodities declined during the quarter as activity remained light.
In Equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.8 billion, up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Equities client execution net revenues of $678 million were up 16% sequentially, reflecting better market-making conditions. Commissions and fees were $719 million, down 3% quarter-over-quarter. Security services generated net revenues of $387 million, down 8% relative to the seasonally stronger second quarter.
Turning to risk, average daily borrowing in the third quarter declined to $57 million, down $5 million sequentially.
Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities. Collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.4 billion in the third quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $920 million, reflecting company-specific events, sales and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $478 million and included approximately $275 million of net interest income.
In Investment Management, we reported third quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, up 10% from the second quarter as incentive fees, management fees and transaction revenues all increased.
Assets under supervision increased $37 billion sequentially to a record $1.35 trillion. The increase was due to net market appreciation and net inflows. Long-term fee-based net inflows of $14 billion were primarily driven by fixed income products.
Now let me turn to expenses. Year-to-date compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization and prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, declined by 13%. This was roughly in line with net revenues. The 13% year-to-date decline results in a compensation to net revenues ratio of 41%. This is 100 basis points lower in the firm's accrual in the first half of this year.
Third quarter noncompensation expenses were $2.1 billion, down slightly compared to the second quarter.
Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics. Total staff was approximately 34,900, roughly flat with the second quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 26.9%. Our global core liquid assets ended the third quarter at $214 billion, and our balance sheet was $880 billion.
Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 14% using the Standardized Approach. It was 12.4% under the Basel III Advanced Approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.3%.
In the quarter, we repurchased 7.8 million shares for $1.3 billion.
In terms of capital, our ratios have significantly strengthened over the last several years. This reflects the transformation of our balance sheet and our cumulative efforts to derisk the firm. All of these actions, combined with more than $30 billion of earnings since 2011, position the firm to grow our capital ratios and simultaneously bring our basic share count to its lowest point ever.
Before I wrap up, I want to cover 3 topics: our client franchise, expense initiatives and new opportunities. With respect to our global client franchise, it's in great shape. We have a strong position in each of our 4 segments: Investment Banking, Institutional Client Services, Investing & Lending and Investment Management. While many of our clients are currently challenged by the low-growth environment, we are committed to partnering with them as they look to navigate these headwinds.
On expenses, last quarter, we discussed the $700 million savings initiative that we undertook in the first half of the year, and we continue to look at additional means of improving our efficiency without impacting our global client franchise.
Focusing on operating efficiency not only positions us for margin expansion and better environments, but it also provides additional benefits. It allows the firm to maintain its global footprint and to continue to invest in the future, which is an essential component of sustainable value creation. While there are currently economic headwinds in several countries globally, our focus on efficiency across all of our businesses and regions allows the firm not only to maintain but also to invest in our client franchise through the cycle. Additionally, our expense discipline allows us to invest in new opportunities.
Last week, we launched a new online personal loan platform, Marcus by Goldman Sachs. Marcus' goal is to enter the consumer credit market and provide a product that is simple, transparent, flexible and provides consumers with real value. Like any new effort, we are taking a slow and methodical approach with Marcus. We are leveraging all of the firm's preexisting strengths across risk management and technology, and we have broad and experienced team of consumer lending professionals to drive Marcus forward, led by Harit Talwar.
Before taking your questions, I'd like to leave you with one thought. The firm is as focused on navigating today's environment as we are on preparing for the future. You have to do the first really well to be in a position to do the latter.
Thanks again for dialing in, and I'm happy to answer your questions."

So I think the short answer is providing value to the consumer. So one of the reasons we have said so many times and this is going to be a very deliberate and methodical approach and a bit of crawl before we walk in this business is because we're well aware that this is a new effort for us. Now -- and some of this is not new for us, our technology skills, the risk management, but the interface through the technology with this new important client base, it's a different space for us. So we've hired, obviously, people with decades of experience. But I think the greatest mitigating factor is slow growth, monitoring it very closely. But also, when we put this together, we took input from consumers, and it really is, I don't know if it's the first-ever, but it really is a lending product that is driven by consumer input. And so that means providing them with flexibility, with real value, with simplicity. And that's why we've come out with something, and we got feedback, consumers don't necessarily like and they don't understand the fee structures. So we created a no-fee product, no small print. If you call our call centers, people pick up. Some of these things sound simple, but they're quite important in terms of what consumers want. And if you deliver what consumers want and you really control your processes, then obviously, you create value and you deliver what regulators want also."

The -- in terms of the stress testing, white paper and Governor Tarullo's comments, I'd say, at a high level, obviously, they put a ton of work into this with various constituencies. We -- our initial impressions were their framework seemed quite awful. And it seems somewhat consistent with the way we actually manage the firm. So we manage the firm, obviously, on a forward-looking basis in terms of how we stress test, but we obviously also manage the spot capital ratios. And under our spot capital ratios, as you can see, we have lots of capacity. And so we'll have to see, ultimately, the details in the NPR. But again, they did the right thing here by giving the bank the opportunity to make adjustments because, as you know, this won't be incorporated into the 2017 cycle. And so to the extent which firms need to adapt will be able to adapt after we see the NPR. But I think our starting point puts us in a great position, and again, the treatment of share repurchase, and we'll see what happens with balance sheet and other things.

So we welcome all that. With respect to our business, we've obviously been very vocal in our commitment to the commodity business, and some of that, I think, maybe that gets misunderstood. So I want to underscore for you a bit. What we're committed to is serving our clients and their needs, and you kind unpack that a bit and simplify by saying there's really 3 activities that are critical to our clients. It's critical for them to hedge, and that's consumers and producers who have commodity price exposure. Financing of those businesses is critical. And then obviously, market-making activities, which provide liquidity to the markets under a critical component of making those markets function. That's what we're most committed to. You've seen, over the years, we've been reducing on balance sheet, investing in commodities. And so we'll work with the industry and with regulators like we would in any NPR process.

But I was hoping you could speak to any mitigation potential that you can achieve on the advanced risk-weighted assets moving forward, particularly if the Collins floor does end up applying to some of the new proposed capital changes that Tarullo spoke to in his recent remarks."

You could certainly envision an environment that was significantly better from where we are today.

I'll walk you through the third quarter and year-to-date results, and I'm happy to answer any questions.
Net revenues were $8.2 billion; net earnings, $2.1 billion; earnings per diluted share, $4.88; and our annualized return on common equity was 11.2%.
For the year-to-date, net revenues were $22.4 billion; net earnings, $5.1 billion; earnings per diluted share, $11.24; and our annualized return on common equity was 8.7%.
Relative to the first quarter of this year, the second, and now the third quarter, have shown steady improvement. This improvement is reflected in third quarter revenues, which increased 19% year-over-year. We also had a modest sequential increase, which is particularly noteworthy given the third quarter is often seasonally slower.
A few factors contributed to the enhanced operating environments. The markets generally improved with equity prices steadily moving higher. The S&P 500 was up 3.3% in the third quarter. The MSCI World increased by 4.8%, and the VIX declined by 15%. Credit spreads also tightened during the quarter with U.S. investment-grade and high-yield cash spreads tighter by 12 basis points and 87 basis points, respectively. In addition, there weren't any major changes to the global economic outlook over the course of the quarter. For example, consensus estimates for global GDP growth remained roughly consistent.
Ultimately, a more favorable backdrop and improved client sentiment translated into year-over-year revenue growth in 3 of our 4 business segments.
Now let's discuss them. Investment Banking produced third quarter revenues of $1.5 billion, 14% lower than a strong second quarter. Although revenues declined sequentially, our Investment Banking backlog remained robust and was up versus last quarter.
Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the quarter, Advisory revenues were $658 million, down 17% compared to the second quarter as industry-wide completed activity declined. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A.
We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter, including: ARM Holdings' GBP 24.4 billion sale to SoftBank Group; AGL Resources' $12 billion merger with Southern Company; and Lockheed Martin's $5 billion spinoff and merger of its IS&GS business into Leidos.
We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the third quarter, including: WhiteWave Foods' $12.5 billion sale to Groupe Danone; Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's $8.8 billion spinoff and merger of noncore software assets with Micro Focus International; and Abbott Medical Optics' $4.3 billion sale to Johnson & Johnson.
Moving to Underwriting. Revenues were $879 million in the third quarter, down 11% sequentially due to a decline in both debt and equity underwriting. Equity underwriting revenues were $227 million, down 16% compared to the second quarter due to a continued weak backdrop for equity issuance. However, the end of the quarter was significantly more active in the beginning with more than half of the quarter's IPO volume occurring in September. Debt underwriting revenues of $652 million were down 10% quarter-over-quarter, following a robust second quarter. For the first 9 months of the year, debt underwriting produced record year-to-date results.
During the third quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Postal Savings Bank of China's $7.4 billion IPO; Great Plains Energy's $2.5 billion follow-on and convertible offerings to support its purchase of Westar; and Fortis' $2 billion investment-grade offering for the purchase of ITC.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses. Net revenues were $3.7 billion in the third quarter, up 2% compared to the second quarter. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $2 billion in the third quarter, up 2% sequentially. Credit increased and benefited from strong primary issuance and tighter spreads. Mortgages also increased and included better market-making conditions given tighter spreads. Rates was down slightly as client activity was driven by the continued discussion around potential Central Bank actions. Currencies was essentially unchanged compared to the second quarter with lower client activity, particularly post the Brexit vote. And commodities declined during the quarter as activity remained light.
In Equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.8 billion, up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Equities client execution net revenues of $678 million were up 16% sequentially, reflecting better market-making conditions. Commissions and fees were $719 million, down 3% quarter-over-quarter. Security services generated net revenues of $387 million, down 8% relative to the seasonally stronger second quarter.
Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the third quarter declined to $57 million, down $5 million sequentially.
Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities. Collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.4 billion in the third quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $920 million, reflecting company-specific events, sales and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $478 million and included approximately $275 million of net interest income.
In Investment Management, we reported third quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, up 10% from the second quarter as incentive fees, management fees and transaction revenues all increased.
Assets under supervision increased $37 billion sequentially to a record $1.35 trillion. The increase was due to net market appreciation and net inflows. Long-term fee-based net inflows of $14 billion were primarily driven by fixed income products.
Now let me turn to expenses. Year-to-date compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, declined by 13%. This was roughly in line with net revenues. The 13% year-to-date decline results in a compensation to net revenues ratio of 41%. This is 100 basis points lower than the firm's accrual in the first half of this year.
Third quarter noncompensation expenses were $2.1 billion, down slightly compared to the second quarter.
Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics. Total staff was approximately 34,900, roughly flat with the second quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 26.9%. Our global core liquid assets ended the third quarter at $214 billion, and our balance sheet was $880 billion.
Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 14% using the Standardized Approach. It was 12.4% under the Basel III Advanced Approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.3%.
In the quarter, we repurchased 7.8 million shares for $1.3 billion.
In terms of capital, our ratios have significantly strengthened over the last several years. This reflects the transformation of our balance sheet and our cumulative effort to derisk the firm. All of these actions, combined with more than $30 billion of earnings since 2011, position the firm to grow our capital ratios and simultaneously bring our basic share count to its lowest point ever.
Before I wrap up, I want to cover 3 topics: our client franchise, expense initiatives and new opportunities. With respect to our global client franchise, it's in great shape. We have a strong position in each of our 4 segments: Investment Banking, Institutional Client Services, Investing & Lending and Investment Management. While many of our clients are currently challenged by the low-growth environment, we are committed to partnering with them as they look to navigate these headwinds.
On expenses, last quarter, we discussed the $700 million savings initiative that we undertook in the first half of the year, and we continue to look at additional means of improving our efficiency without impacting our global client franchise.
Focusing on operating efficiency not only positions us for margin expansion in better environments, but it also provides additional benefits. It allows the firm to maintain its global footprint and to continue to invest in the future, which is an essential component of sustainable value creation. While there are currently economic headwinds in several countries globally, our focus on efficiency across all of our businesses and regions allows the firm not only to maintain but also to invest in our client franchise through the cycle. Additionally, our expense discipline allows us to invest in new opportunities.
Last week, we launched a new online personal loan platform, Marcus by Goldman Sachs. Marcus' goal is to enter the consumer credit market and provide a product that is simple, transparent, flexible and provides consumers with real value. Like any new effort, we are taking a slow and methodical approach with Marcus. We are leveraging all of the firm's preexisting strengths across risk management and technology, and we have brought in an experienced team of consumer lending professionals to drive Marcus forward, led by Harit Talwar.
Before taking your questions, I'd like to leave you with one thought. The firm is as focused on navigating today's environment as we are on preparing for the future. You have to do the first really well to be in a position to do the latter.
Thanks again for dialing in, and I'm happy to answer your questions."

In the first quarter of '15, the Swiss repegged, stuff went bonkers for a couple of weeks and you made tons of money, even more than the overall industry. This quarter, it didn't seem like there was too many aha moments. I mean, credit spreads tightened, and you had the aftermath of Brexit and stuff. But in your text, you point out low rates and slow economic growth as headwinds for FICC. You've talked about lower market volumes and volatility in Equities. I'm just curious, when you looked at the quarter we just had in FICC particularly, is it more like you had a nice pickup like first quarter in '15, and you're setting us up for keep calm, like things have returned back to normal? Or is this a possibly a little bit higher activity environment giving -- given the uncertainty?"

So I think the short answer is providing value to the consumer. So one of the reasons we have said so many times that this is going to be a very deliberate and methodical approach and a bit of crawl before we walk in this business is because we're well aware that this is a new effort for us. Now -- and some of this is not new for us, our technology skills, the risk management, but the interface through the technology with this new important client base, it's a different space for us. So we've hired, obviously, people with decades of experience. But I think the greatest mitigating factor is slow growth, monitoring it very closely. But also, when we put this together, we took input from consumers, and it really is, I don't know if it's the first-ever, but it really is a lending product that is driven by consumer input. And so that means providing them with flexibility, with real value, with simplicity. And that's why we've come out with something, then we got feedback: consumers don't necessarily like and they don't understand the fee structures. So we created a no-fee product, no small print. If you call our call centers, people pick up. Some of these things sound simple, but they're quite important in terms of what consumers want. And if you deliver what consumers want and you really control your processes, then obviously, you create value and you deliver what regulators want also."

But certainly, there's some flexibility in the profile for us to go up a little bit from these levels. But again, certainly not committing to that.

The -- in terms of the stress testing, white paper and Governor Tarullo's comments, I'd say, at a high level, obviously, they put a ton of work into this with various constituencies. We -- our initial impressions were their framework seemed quite thoughtful. And it seems somewhat consistent with the way we actually manage the firm. So we manage the firm, obviously, on a forward-looking basis in terms of how we stress test, but we obviously also manage to spot capital ratios. And under our spot capital ratios, as you can see, we have lots of capacity. And so we'll have to see, ultimately, the details in the NPR. But again, they did the right thing here by giving the bank the opportunity to make adjustments because, as you know, this won't be incorporated into the 2017 cycle. And so to the extent to which firms need to adapt, they will be able to adapt after we see the NPR. But I think our starting point puts us in a great position, and again, the treatment of share repurchase, and we'll see what happens with balance sheet and other things. But we'll take our normal approach in terms of capital management from here. But it seems like the right direction."

So we welcome all that. With respect to our business, we've obviously been very vocal in our commitment to the commodity business, and sometimes, I think, maybe that gets misunderstood. So I want to underscore for you a bit. What we're committed to is serving our clients and their needs, and you can unpack that a bit and simplify it by saying there's really 3 activities that are critical to our clients. It's critical for them to hedge, and that's consumers and producers who have commodity price exposure. Financing of those businesses is critical. And then obviously, market-making activities, which provide liquidity to the markets and are a critical component of making those markets function. That's what we're most committed to. You've seen, over the years, we've been reducing on balance sheet, investing in commodities. And so we'll work with the industry and with regulators like we would in any NPR process.

I would say when we look at it in terms of sort of the core businesses, for example, like in credit, as we monitor those market shares, certainly, with certain client segments like asset managers, it feels like we're picking up market share. Again, one of the difficult things about market share is you really need volume to grow. And even though obviously, our performance this year is significantly better than last year, it's the best quarter we've had in 5 quarters, you really need activity levels to pick up from here. Now just in terms of the second part of your question, the 41% at this point in time is our best estimate. We've told you forever that, as a conceptual matter, you should expect in periods where revenues -- to decline that compensation and benefits expense should lag that. And obviously, we've talked to you a ton about operating leverage. And so as revenues grow, you should also expect compensation and benefit expense to lag that growth because of the operating leverage. But at this stage, 41% is an output."

And you've -- under a CCAR lens, some have speculated it could even be ROE dilutive overall.

I'll walk you through the third quarter and year-to-date results, and I'm happy to answer any questions.Net revenues were $8.2 billion; net earnings, $2.1 billion; earnings per diluted share, $4.88; a",1470,"Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the third quarter and year-to-date results, and I'm happy to answer any questions.
Net revenues were $8.2 billion; net earnings, $2.1 billion; earnings per diluted share, $4.88; and our annualized return on common equity was 11.2%.
For the year-to-date, net revenues were $22.4 billion; net earnings, $5.1 billion; earnings per diluted share, $11.24; and our annualized return on common equity was 8.7%.
Relative to the first quarter of this year, the second, and now the third quarter, have shown steady improvement. This improvement is reflected in third quarter revenues, which increased 19% year-over-year. We also had a modest sequential increase, which is particularly noteworthy given the third quarter is often seasonally slower.
A few factors contributed to the enhanced operating environments. The markets generally improved with equity prices steadily moving higher. The S&P 500 was up 3.3% in the third quarter. The MSCI World increased by 4.8%, and the VIX declined by 15%. Credit spreads also tightened during the quarter with U.S. investment-grade and high-yield cash spreads tighter by 12 basis points and 87 basis points, respectively. In addition, there weren't any major changes to the global economic outlook over the course of the quarter. For example, consensus estimates for global GDP growth remained roughly consistent.
Ultimately, a more favorable backdrop and improved client sentiment translated into year-over-year revenue growth in 3 of our 4 business segments.
Now let's discuss them. Investment Banking produced third quarter revenues of $1.5 billion, 14% lower than a strong second quarter. Although revenues declined sequentially, our Investment Banking backlog remained robust and was up versus last quarter.
Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the quarter, Advisory revenues were $658 million, down 17% compared to the second quarter as industry-wide completed activity declined. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A.
We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter, including: ARM Holdings' GBP 24.4 billion sale to SoftBank Group; AGL Resources' $12 billion merger with Southern Company; and Lockheed Martin's $5 billion spinoff and merger of its IS&GS business into Leidos.
We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the third quarter, including: WhiteWave Foods' $12.5 billion sale to Groupe Danone; Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's $8.8 billion spinoff and merger of noncore software assets with Micro Focus International; and Abbott Medical Optics' $4.3 billion sale to Johnson & Johnson.
Moving to Underwriting. Revenues were $879 million in the third quarter, down 11% sequentially due to a decline in both debt and equity underwriting. Equity underwriting revenues were $227 million, down 16% compared to the second quarter due to a continued weak backdrop for equity issuance. However, the end of the quarter was significantly more active in the beginning with more than half of the quarter's IPO volume occurring in September. Debt underwriting revenues of $652 million were down 10% quarter-over-quarter, following a robust second quarter. For the first 9 months of the year, debt underwriting produced record year-to-date results.
During the third quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Postal Savings Bank of China's $7.4 billion IPO; Great Plains Energy's $2.5 billion follow-on and convertible offerings to support its purchase of Westar; and Fortis' $2 billion investment-grade offering for the purchase of ITC.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses. Net revenues were $3.7 billion in the third quarter, up 2% compared to the second quarter. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $2 billion in the third quarter, up 2% sequentially. Credit increased and benefited from strong primary issuance and tighter spreads. Mortgages also increased and included better market-making conditions given tighter spreads. Rates was down slightly as client activity was driven by the continued discussion around potential Central Bank actions. Currencies was essentially unchanged compared to the second quarter with lower client activity, particularly post the Brexit vote. And commodities declined during the quarter as activity remained light.
In Equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.8 billion, up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Equities client execution net revenues of $678 million were up 16% sequentially, reflecting better market-making conditions. Commissions and fees were $719 million, down 3% quarter-over-quarter. Security services generated net revenues of $387 million, down 8% relative to the seasonally stronger second quarter.
Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the third quarter declined to $57 million, down $5 million sequentially.
Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities. Collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.4 billion in the third quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $920 million, reflecting company-specific events, sales and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $478 million and included approximately $275 million of net interest income.
In Investment Management, we reported third quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, up 10% from the second quarter as incentive fees, management fees and transaction revenues all increased.
Assets under supervision increased $37 billion sequentially to a record $1.35 trillion. The increase was due to net market appreciation and net inflows. Long-term fee-based net inflows of $14 billion were primarily driven by fixed income products.
Now let me turn to expenses. Year-to-date compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, declined by 13%. This was roughly in line with net revenues. The 13% year-to-date decline results in a compensation to net revenues ratio of 41%. This is 100 basis points lower than the firm's accrual in the first half of this year.
Third quarter noncompensation expenses were $2.1 billion, down slightly compared to the second quarter.
Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics. Total staff was approximately 34,900, roughly flat with the second quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 26.9%. Our global core liquid assets ended the third quarter at $214 billion, and our balance sheet was $880 billion.
Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 14% using the Standardized Approach. It was 12.4% under the Basel III Advanced Approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.3%.
In the quarter, we repurchased 7.8 million shares for $1.3 billion.
In terms of capital, our ratios have significantly strengthened over the last several years. This reflects the transformation of our balance sheet and our cumulative effort to derisk the firm. All of these actions, combined with more than $30 billion of earnings since 2011, position the firm to grow our capital ratios and simultaneously bring our basic share count to its lowest point ever.
Before I wrap up, I want to cover 3 topics: our client franchise, expense initiatives and new opportunities. With respect to our global client franchise, it's in great shape. We have a strong position in each of our 4 segments: Investment Banking, Institutional Client Services, Investing & Lending and Investment Management. While many of our clients are currently challenged by the low-growth environment, we are committed to partnering with them as they look to navigate these headwinds.
On expenses, last quarter, we discussed the $700 million savings initiative that we undertook in the first half of the year, and we continue to look at additional means of improving our efficiency without impacting our global client franchise.
Focusing on operating efficiency not only positions us for margin expansion in better environments, but it also provides additional benefits. It allows the firm to maintain its global footprint and to continue to invest in the future, which is an essential component of sustainable value creation. While there are currently economic headwinds in several countries globally, our focus on efficiency across all of our businesses and regions allows the firm not only to maintain but also to invest in our client franchise through the cycle. Additionally, our expense discipline allows us to invest in new opportunities.
Last week, we launched a new online personal loan platform, Marcus by Goldman Sachs. Marcus' goal is to enter the consumer credit market and provide a product that is simple, transparent, flexible and provides consumers with real value. Like any new effort, we are taking a slow and methodical approach with Marcus. We are leveraging all of the firm's preexisting strengths across risk management and technology, and we have brought in an experienced team of consumer lending professionals to drive Marcus forward, led by Harit Talwar.
Before taking your questions, I'd like to leave you with one thought. The firm is as focused on navigating today's environment as we are on preparing for the future. You have to do the first really well to be in a position to do the latter.
Thanks again for dialing in, and I'm happy to answer your questions."

In the first quarter of '15, the Swiss repegged, stuff went bonkers for a couple of weeks and you made tons of money, even more than the overall industry. This quarter, it didn't seem like there was too many aha moments. I mean, credit spreads tightened, and you had the aftermath of Brexit and stuff. But in your text, you point out low rates and slow economic growth as headwinds for FICC. You've talked about lower market volumes and volatility in Equities. I'm just curious, when you looked at the quarter we just had in FICC particularly, is it more like you had a nice pickup like first quarter in '15, and you're setting us up for keep calm, like things have returned back to normal?

So I think the short answer is providing value to the consumer. So one of the reasons we have said so many times that this is going to be a very deliberate and methodical approach and a bit of crawl before we walk in this business is because we're well aware that this is a new effort for us. Now -- and some of this is not new for us, our technology skills, the risk management, but the interface through the technology with this new important client base, it's a different space for us. So we've hired, obviously, people with decades of experience. But I think the greatest mitigating factor is slow growth, monitoring it very closely. But also, when we put this together, we took input from consumers, and it really is, I don't know if it's the first-ever, but it really is a lending product that is driven by consumer input. And so that means providing them with flexibility, with real value, with simplicity. And that's why we've come out with something, then we got feedback: consumers don't necessarily like and they don't understand the fee structures. So we created a no-fee product, no small print. If you call our call centers, people pick up. Some of these things sound simple, but they're quite important in terms of what consumers want. And if you deliver what consumers want and you really control your processes, then obviously, you create value and you deliver what regulators want also."

The -- in terms of the stress testing, white paper and Governor Tarullo's comments, I'd say, at a high level, obviously, they put a ton of work into this with various constituencies. We -- our initial impressions were their framework seemed quite thoughtful. And it seems somewhat consistent with the way we actually manage the firm. So we manage the firm, obviously, on a forward-looking basis in terms of how we stress test, but we obviously also manage to spot capital ratios. And under our spot capital ratios, as you can see, we have lots of capacity. And so we'll have to see, ultimately, the details in the NPR. But again, they did the right thing here by giving the bank the opportunity to make adjustments because, as you know, this won't be incorporated into the 2017 cycle. And so to the extent to which firms need to adapt, they will be able to adapt after we see the NPR. But I think our starting point puts us in a great position, and again, the treatment of share repurchase, and we'll see what happens with balance sheet and other things. But we'll take our normal approach in terms of capital management from here. But it seems like the right direction."

In terms of why don't we just talked about the commodities NPR, so the market has been waiting for this for a while. As you know, we've been in the commodity business for decades, and we think it's really important that the Federal Reserve has taken the lead here in terms of an important area of focus for us and the industry, but especially as it relates to ultimately establishing uniform standards across the industry. So we welcome all that. With respect to our business, we've obviously been very vocal in our commitment to the commodity business, and sometimes, I think, maybe that gets misunderstood. So I want to underscore for you a bit. What we're committed to is serving our clients and their needs, and you can unpack that a bit and simplify it by saying there's really 3 activities that are critical to our clients. It's critical for them to hedge, and that's consumers and producers who have commodity price exposure. Financing of those businesses is critical. And then obviously, market-making activities, which provide liquidity to the markets and are a critical component of making those markets function. That's what we're most committed to. You've seen, over the years, we've been reducing on balance sheet, investing in commodities. And so we'll work with the industry and with regulators like we would in any NPR process. But we're most focused on ensuring that those services from a Goldman Sachs' perspective and across the industry can get provided to clients in a safe and cost-effective way, no different than we would approach any of the NPRs."

The best perspective I can share with you is the one I get from talking to our M&A bankers. And it hasn't shifted much over the course of the year. The same fundamental factors that are contributing to the last 2 years of M&A activity, generally low top line growth, a desire to drive efficiencies, access to the capital markets, all those factors feel in place. Now regionally, the U.S. feels more active than Europe, and Asia feels a bit more active than Europe. But I'm giving you really very localized commentary.

And you've been increasingly highlighting a number of those capabilities. So when we look at some of those initiatives like Marcus or Symphony, Marquee or consolidating the electronic trading book across businesses -- and maybe I missed something there. But where do you see the most immediate opportunities to actually move the needle? And I guess that's part 1. And part 2 is, as you think about future investments in the technology, do you think more of the incremental spend from here is going to be more offensive-positioning revenue producing rather than defensive?"

I would say that broadly speaking -- and this won't be completely inclusive, but I think you can define our technology strategy as focused on client engagement and those tools and services we can deliver to clients that provide differentiated value to those clients. And you see that doing us in our capital markets businesses and obviously, you see us -- with creating that with Marcus. Two, there are times when we feel like, given our core technology skills, we're in a position to develop technology which would be better enhanced outside of the firm ultimately, even though we've incubated it in the firm. And Symphony would be a great example of that. We feel like, as an information-sharing platform with better security, better compliance controls, we felt like that was something better utilized by a broad range of market participants. And lastly, our own technology internally is quite important for making us more efficient and adapting to regulatory change and managing our risk, and that's obviously been very core to what we do. So we look across all 3 of those different platforms, if you will, for lack of better language. I would say the most important thing, in addition to controlling the firm, is our client engagement, and Marcus reflects that trend as it relates to consumers."
