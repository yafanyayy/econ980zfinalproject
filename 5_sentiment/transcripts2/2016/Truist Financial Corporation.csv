19109,316201981,919749,"BB&T Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Truist Financial Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Alan. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for your interest in BB&T, and as always, thanks for joining our call. So I think the fourth quarter overall for us was a very solid quarter, especially given the challenging environment we have out there",2003,"Thanks, Alan. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for your interest in BB&T, and as always, thanks for joining our call. So I think the fourth quarter overall for us was a very solid quarter, especially given the challenging environment we have out there that really steady organic performance and really was a great year from a strategic point of view. 
Our core loan and deposit growth numbers did better than expected. GAAP growth numbers included the impact of the acquisition as you'll note. We grew revenues and held the net interest margins stable, which was a very comforting trend. Also we have a very strong level of capital and liquidity, and so overall, we continue to be a very strong company. 
If you focus on the quarter in terms of earnings, we made $502 million and diluted EPS of $0.64, which was flat with last quarter, and we did have $50 million in pretax merger-related and restructuring charges. So if you x that, we have what I call operating core earnings of $0.68 per share excluding other charges. 
If you look at GAAP ROA of 1.03, our return on tangible common was 13.37%. But if you adjust for the merger and restructuring charges ROA of 1.09% and return on tangible was 14.19%. 
Revenues totaled $2.6 billion, up $164 million versus fourth quarter. That's primarily due to Susquehanna, and revenue was up annualized 10.8% compared to the third. So we did have strong revenue growth. Now that did include acquisition, but that's part of our business real revenue increase. 
For the full year, we totaled $9.8 billion, including acquisitions, which was up 4.1%, and we did have record fee income for the year. And net interest margins, I indicated, was stable at 3.35%, which was an important consideration. 
Efficiency did improve to 58.8% as we achieved positive operating leverage. I point out to you that we are really focused on expense management. We're working through the Susquehanna, and we'll be working through the National Penn conversions, which really give us an excellent opportunity to become more efficient, which we're absolutely committed to do. 
Average loans and leases held for investment totaled $134.8 billion fourth quarter versus $130.5 billion in the third quarter. Excluding acquisitions, our average loans are a little better than we expected, growing approximately 2% annualized versus the third. 
Now if you take out Residential Mortgage, which if you recall, we are intentionally running done and continuing to do that, it's up 4.5%. So pretty good loan growth quarter. Organic growth was very strong in C&I, Direct Retail and Equipment Finance. 
From a strategic point of view, we're very happy that we did receive full approval from all the regulators for National Penn. We now expect to move that closing up to April 1, and we still plan to do the conversion about mid-July, and so the National Penn will still be back second half loaded because you don't really get the cost savings until the conversion. You could argue why we don't move the conversion up, but if you know we've done a lot of mergers for a long time, and it's best to take your time to do it right rather than do it in a hurry and do it wrong. So we'll get all by the end of the year. We'd take our time doing it. 
Susquehanna is going great. We did that conversing in mid-November. I will point out this is largest conversion ever a loan in deposit accounts. We have 144,000 loan accounts, 795 deposit accounts so it was big deal. It's going extraordinarily well. All the regions are running really, really smoothly, and an early look by Rick and his people at the combination of National Penn and Susquehanna looked really great. I mean, strength better than we anticipated when we announced the combinations. 
So if you follow along on the slides, if you look at Slide 5, I'll give you a little more detail with regard to our loan growth, which was 4.5% x acquisitions and x Residential Mortgage. While C&I loan growth was strong estimated core C&I loan growth was up $848 million or 7.8% annualized, that was largely led by corporate lending and production branching network. C&I lending was participations as it was in previous quarters so it's very competitive. Spreads are tight, but the spreads are flattening out. So that's a good sign. End-of-period balances increased $335 million, again led by large corporate. So right now, looking forward to next quarter, we expect C&I to continue to grow could be a little slower depending on strength in manufacturing. 
I want to particularly point out to you that our oil and gas portfolio is not large for our company. It's $1.4 billion outstanding, which is about 1% of our portfolio. It's a very conservative portfolio. 67% is upstream, 30% is midstream, and we'll have about 3% for services. At the end of the fourth quarter, we have no delinquency, no losses. We have no loans on nonaccruals. So I noticed that a lot written and talked about energy, but energy is not a negative story for us. It's a good, solid story, and we don't anticipate any major problems in that area. 
Obviously, [indiscernible] stream lows will have some challenges but because as size small, we just do not anticipate that to be a big issue for BB&T. In the dealer area, we had a very strong quarter, up $108 million, about 40% annualized. That's really being driven by markets that we're entering, and we expect it to continue to grow although probably not quite that pace. 
In CRE construction and development, we increased 1.6% annualized in the quarter, excluding acquisitions. End-of-period balance did decline a bit, but we expect. CRE income producing increased 2.5% annualized, excluding acquisitions. That was mostly broad-based office, hospitality, industrial. The market fundamentals in those spaces continues to improve although spreads continue to tighten, and so looking at next quarter, we expect core IPP to slow, and they will be about flat. Most of the calls of the competitive pricing, and we just thought not try to book loan just to book loans. If the prices are not acceptable, we just rather not have them. 
Average Direct Retail lending is a real good story for us increasing $237 million, almost 11% annualized due to our HELOC portfolio direct lending out of lending in branches. Our Wealth division doing great, producing about 30% of our retail volume. It's just a real good story. We have really good momentum heading into the first quarter, might be a little bit slow, probably seasonal, but the underlying strategic direction of the portfolio has strong momentum as we look forward. 
Let's look at sales finance, on the other hand, it did decline $406 million or 17.5%. That was very consistent with our strategies. We simply aren't willing to participate in the tighter spread market in that space. With increased capital that is required today just essentially did not make sense to book loans where there's not a reasonable risk-adjusted return on capital. So we've been very careful and judicious looking at the kind of assets we're willing to book, and right now, sales finance is just not a particularly profitable area. That doesn't mean we're getting of the business. We are restructuring the business, however. You heard us say it recently. 
We've now implemented a flat-rate compensation program for our dealers, and we're watching the spreads carefully. I would point out that we did pick up a portfolio called the leasing, auto leasing business from Susquehanna, which we are exiting because we don't use to do auto leasing, and so that'll be winding down. That'll be a little bit of a negative impact, but it won't affect our fundamental strategies. 
As with Residential Mortgage, everybody was down 5.9% linked quarter annualized. We are selling all of our performing production, and originations were 30% lower than third quarter because that was largely seasonal. So we expect to see applications continuing to be soft as we hit through the winter months. Gain on sales was down about 5%. Corresponding channel they had shifted to 55% so there was a lot of moving parts in the business today. The whole triad disclosure program is definitely slowing down production and booking of transactions, hard to know what underlying issues are in terms of consumer preferences in terms of millenials, et cetera, choosing to own homes or not. It's a little bit early to call all of that, but we do now right now though is that mortgage production is down, and part of that is substantially because of the mortgage disclosures that takes just a long, long time. 
I would point out a very positive note that overall the community bank loan production is really accelerating. The best it's been in years. Commercial production's up 16.7%, retail's up 44% compared to the last fourth quarter, and that momentum continue as we head into the first and second quarters. Other lending subsidiaries grew $227 million or 7.3%. That's a good number, seasonally weaker because of seasonality business starting next area was Grandbridge equipment finance. We expect for the first quarter again seasonally slower but good in terms of the long-term strategies in the portfolio. 
So to sum up, we expect average loans held for investment to be up modestly about 1% in the first quarter with continued pressure given seasonality in our seasonal portfolios. Just to comment with regard to the overall economy of impacts the loan production. There's been a lot written and said over the last few weeks about the issues in the stock market. We believe there's a lot of overreaction going on. You woke up January 2, all of a sudden, everybody's deciding the world's falling apart, and we reject that. We don't see fundamental structural changes between first part of December to first part of January. The world just doesn't happen that fast. Obviously, a lot of huge confluence of negative psychology going on, but we're trying to look past that. So what we focus on is the fact that yes, the world is down, and that is a fact in terms of the oil space, but oil is overall really standard to businesses to the airlines. Oil is the strong dollar is has other implications but in terms consumer purchases, it's just obviously, it's a lot cheaper. 
And so what we would say is that it's not a bullish environment. It's no different what we talked about last 2, 3 quarters, [indiscernible] growing 2, 2.25% kind of growth rate, which is not great, but it's not falling. So I would say that for all the sky's falling, we would respectfully disagree with that. 
So if you look at our Slide 6, just a comment on deposit continue to be good story for us. Our noninterest deposits increased $1.7 billion or 15% annualized but that does include acquisitions. If you take acquisitions, our total deposits were about flat by design with noninterest-bearing deposits grew 7.5%, which was very good. So doing a very good job in improving our mix and reducing our costs. x Susquehanna, our noninterest bearing deposits were 32.3% of deposits, and our cost remain low at 24 basis points. Very bright note that we introduced in the fourth quarter our new U digital mobile online platform. It is doing extraordinarily well. We now have over 650,000 users, and it is gaining momentum as we go forward. We believe it is the best integrated platform in the business today and certainly a big driver of our new account production today. So overall, we feel really great about our deposit performance. We feel really good about our digital strategy, and while there's plenty to do, we believe we'll stand out as a really positive performer in the whole digital space as we go forward. 
So now with that, I'll ask Daryl to give us more detail, and then I'll summarize after that."
19109,316201981,919749,"BB&T Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Truist Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, segment results. Turning to Slide 7. Our credit quality remains very strong. Loans 90 days or more past du",1157,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, segment results. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our credit quality remains very strong. Loans 90 days or more past due declined $69 million mostly driven by loans acquired from the FDIC and impaired loans. Loans 30 to 89 past due increased 13% mostly because we conformed Susquehanna's delinquencies to our more conservative methodology. 
We also had some seasonal growth, which is typical for the fourth quarter. NPAs declined 4.3% mostly because of the sale of nonperforming Residential Mortgage loans. This was offset by a more conservative approach for determining nonaccrual status for mortgage loans and HELOCs. Excluding the loan sale, NPAs were essentially flat compared to last quarter. 
Net charge-offs increased slightly to 38 basis points in the quarter led by higher charge-offs at regional. The increase at regional was due to seasonality, declining small card values and regional disclosure. Regional accounted for about half of the total charge-offs. Overall, we are very pleased with credit quality. Looking forward, we expect the NPAs to remain at a similar range in the first quarter next year. We expect charge-offs to be in the range of 35 to 45 basis points. 
Continuing on Slide 8. Our allowance coverage ratios remained strong at 2.83x for charge-offs and 2.53x for NPLs. The allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.07% compared to 1.08% last quarter. Remember, all of our acquired loans have a combined mark of about $750 million from all of our acquisitions. So the effects of allowance coverage is significantly higher. 
We recorded a provision of $129 million for the quarter compared to net charge-off of $130 million. As Kelly mentioned earlier, we have a very clean and conservative energy portfolio. That's about 1% of our loan portfolio or $1.4 billion. The allowance coverage for these loans is approximately 5% given the stress in the sector. 
Turning to Slide 9. Net interest margin was 3.35%, flat compared to third quarter and in line with our guidance. Core margin was 3.12%, down 3 basis points. Both GAAP and core margin were impacted by larger balances, as I said, for the majority of the quarter and lower loan yields. 
We expect GAAP and core margin to increase modestly in the first quarter due to higher rates on earning assets, driven by reason rate increase, lower fat balances and the ability to deposit rates. We became slightly less asset sensitive this quarter mostly due to investments and funding mix changes. As you can see, we will continue to benefit from additional rate hikes. 
Continuing on Slide 10. Fee income for the year was a new record. Our fee income ratio was 41.8% for the quarter. Looking at a few components of fee income. Insurance income increased $26 million or 29% annualized mostly due to seasonal factors. Investment banking and grocery experienced a decline of $14 million mostly due to higher capital market activity last quarter. Mortgage Banking income decreased $7 million mostly due to lower gain on sale of loans and lower salable production, offset by better commercial mortgage income. 
Other income increased $15 million due to $25 million higher income related to assets of certain post-employment benefits and $12 million in the client derivative income, offset by a $20 million decrease in partnership and other investment income. Noninterest income should increase modestly next quarter. This will be led by stronger insurance and investment banking revenues with lower mortgage and service charge income. 
Turning to Slide 11. Noninterest expenses totaled $1.6 billion, essentially flat from last quarter. Personnel expense increased $11 million, driven by higher salary expenses from Susquehanna. In addition, we had some offsetting expenses with higher post-employment benefit expense and lower medical and retirement costs. 
Average FTEs were up just a bit over 1,000 due to Susquehanna. Excluding acquisitions, FTEs remained flat. 
Occupancy and equipment expense increased $9 million mostly due to acquisitions. Merger-related and restructuring charges totaled $50 million. We do not expect a material amount of merger-related cost next quarter. 
Our effective tax rate was 31.7%, and we expect a similar rate next quarter. Noninterest expense should be flat on a GAAP basis next quarter as we lower merger-related charges be offset by seasonally higher FICA and employee benefit-related expenses. We are confident we will achieve the cost saves from our acquisitions. We also expect to improve efficiency throughout 2016 with fourth quarter efficiency ratio around 56% to 57%. 
Turning to Slide 12. Capital ratios remained very strong with common equity Tier 1 of 10.2%. Fully phased in common equity Tier 1 increased to 10%. Our LCR decreased to 130%, and our asset liquid buffer at the end of the quarter was very strong at 13.5%. 
Let's look at some segment results beginning on Slide 13. Community Bank's net income was up $9 million from last quarter and up $22 million from the fourth quarter of last year. This was driven by commercial lending, retail lending and deposits as well as higher funding spreads on deposits, partially offset by lower rates on the commercial loans. 
Net interest income increased $87 million with about half of that driven by Susquehanna. Finally, with all the regulatory approvals we received for the planned acquisition of National Penn, we expect to close on April 1 with the third quarter systems conversion. 
Turning to Slide 14. Residential Mortgage Banking net income totaled $49 million, down $10 million from last quarter driven by lower gains on mortgage loan production, partially offset by increasing net income. Gain on sale spreads dropped slightly to 103 [ph], and 58% of our production mix was purchased. 
Looking on Slide 15. Dealer Financial Services income totaled $42 million, down $2 million from last quarter. Our provision was [indiscernible] higher charge-offs in Dealer Finance and Regional Acceptance. 
Turning to Slide 16. Specialized Lending net income totaled $71 million, up $2 million from last quarter driven by higher commercial mortgage income and leasing income. 
Looking at Slide 17. Insurance Services net income totaled $36 million, up $15 million from last quarter mostly driven by a seasonal increase in commercial property and casualty insurance and higher live commissions due to seasonality and improved production. Year-to-date same-store sales achieved about a 1% growth as the markets for insurance pricing is softer. 
Turning to Slide 18. Financial services segment had $103 million in net income, up $21 million from last quarter. Corporate Banking generated significant loan growth of 30%. Wealth experienced 16% loan growth and 21% growth in transaction deposit. Noninterest income decreased $10 million linked quarter due to lower SBIC partnership income and investment advisory fees. 
In summary, we achieved broad-based loan growth and revenue growth due to Susquehanna, continued excellent credit quality and positive operating leverage. We look forward to executing on the opportunities for merger partners in the coming quarter. 
Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A."

From a core perspective, we're seeing really strong growth in Texas. I would support that Texas is not just all oil, big to be sure, but there's a lot of other things. We've been pleased with our loan growth in the Texas market. Florida, across the whole state, has rebounded, and we've seen really solid growth in the state of Florida. We've got opportunities to grow our ABL business. We're looking really closely at how we make that more effective, and pleased with growth in small commercial and small business with the strategies that we did employ. We'd be careful with CRE. You heard Kelly talk about that. We've got to be careful with pricing, you've got to be careful with risk. But the last 2 quarters, in the third and the fourth, Community Bank growth on a linked basis had been the best it's been in probably 5, 6 or 7 years. Production, as Kelly said, is up. Our activity levels are good. I would not say that means that we think that the economy's doing outstandingly well. We just are grinding it out, finding opportunities.

We've not had any real major branch reductions other than onetime several years ago, but we constantly look at our branches. We look at underperforming branches. We look at opportunities to consolidate branches. So we're all over that. Secondly, we've been on a pretty steady path of reducing headcount in our branches in response to less transaction in the branches. So we are already running pretty elbow lean in our branches today. We're also believing that the folks in the branches need to know more, do more so this universal concept something we're embracing and moving forward on, so that investor people, better people, better enable people can do more for our clients, and what we're finding is our associates like it because they feel better armed to take care of client needs, and it also creates savings for us. So this is an evolution and a process. I don't view it as a revolutionary process. We've got to continue to be on top of it. We are seeing clearly reduction of branch transactions is steady. It continues to be. It's not going over a cliff. Branches still are important. They're part of our branding. They're part of the convenience that we have to have. They're part of the omnichannel development. So it's about having new, but it's also about having good branches. It's about having great ATMs. It's about having great call center. It's about having great experience 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and that's what we're trying to put together at BB&T, a lot of focus on digital and the new platform is we think unique and different, and it's got lots of accolades. Kelly mentioned over 650,000 users. The last number that just came out yesterday was over 700,000 users, and the positive impact from our associates, feedback from our clients is all very, very good. Now to give you the cost of transactions, we have not really do that to say what if the transaction is doing there's no question, self-service would save money, no doubt about that, but overall, what we find we can get somebody to do U, we think they're going to do more branch, they're going to do more call center, they're going to do more across all of our platforms, and so today that gives us a better chance to have bigger share of wallet, better referral from them and ultimately drives the revenue while overall aspect around cost reduction ultimately leads to operating revenue branches.

And keep in mind there's a big issue out there yet to be determined around kind of cyclical buffer. Not many people talking about it, but that is the potential increase in capital, and so we're going to be conservative so that we don't end up having to go get capital at a time that is not market friendly. So given all of that, I would say that you'll see our performance in '16 kind of look like '15 whether we do specific buybacks or not is a function of whether we have acquisition opportunities that allows us to use that extra capital like we have done in the last couple of years and a function of what our price is.

I mean, obviously, just like everyone else, we're monitoring the oil and gas exposure daily, and we're doing our price stats and looking at the sensitivities and stressing accordingly. And we're going down right now to at $20 or below in our stress case. So my biggest concern is that while we believe even down pretty low, we've got very strong asset coverage and our PV9s look good. So I don't think even at low rates, we fundamentally have a lot of loss exposure. I'm more concerned about this time around, there's a lot of layered bond debt behind the senior secured lenders, and traditionally that was not the case. And so what could happen this time if they stay down long and low, it could cause a lot of nonaccrual risk. And if you try to work through all that layered debt, that could cause to have to work through and consider discounts for losses beyond the collateral coverage you normally see. So we're trying to think about all of that and take a conservative view of loss given even if we've got collateral on coverage for you right now, we're trying to make sure we stay ahead of that. I think our 5% reserve given the quality of our portfolio is very, very prudent, and it takes those kinds of things into consideration."

So we remain from a long-term point of view committed to our acquisition strategy. Recall that it is on an average basis 5% to 10% of our assets. We, in that scenario, you could see the probability increase of potential partners that might be interested. So it always comes down to 2 things, well, 3 things. It comes down to our cultural shift. We talk to people about our cultural fit, and then it comes down to their willingness to combine and then it's just the mathematics.

So that's why you've seen a kind of relative decline in CD financing over the last few years. You'll see some more of that as we think through, excuse me, National Penn although the price variation for them is not different as it has in some of our acquisitions in the past. We think CDs are necessary and important part of our ongoing funding structure. There's a portion of that portfolio that is kind of core bread-and-butter, fully committed clients that we always keep, and we're willing to pay little more to keep those because they're long-term stable users of our services. On the other hand, you always have the ones that are single service clients, and they're shopping 15 banks and go on to one that has highest space CD, and we don't tend to keep those. So I suspect those rates go up, you will see our CD portfolio increase some, but it won't be as dramatic as you may think because we are growing our DDA and all the funding sources at a very fast pace, and so are not as CD dependent as we've been in the past. So I don't -- it depends on the company but with our variety of funding sources, I don't think CD financing for us in the future will be what it was in the past."

So I think the fourth quarter overall for us was a very solid quarter. Particularly given the challenging environment we have out there, we had really steady organic performance and really was a great year from a strategic point of view. 
So our core loan and deposit growth number is a bit better than we expected. GAAP growth numbers included the impact of the acquisition, as you'll note. We grew revenues and held the net interest margin stable, which was a very comforting trend. Also, we have a very strong level of capital and liquidity. And so overall, we continue to be a very strong company. 
If you focus on the quarter in terms of earnings, we made $502 million with diluted EPS of $0.64, which was flat with last quarter, and we did have $50 million in pretax merger-related and restructuring charges. So if you ex that, we had what I'd call operating core earnings of $0.68 per share, excluding the merger charges. 
If you look at GAAP ROA of 1.03%, return on tangible common was 13.37%. But if you adjust for the merger and restructuring charges, ROA was 1.09% and return on tangible was 14.19%. 
Revenues totaled $2.6 billion, up $164 million versus the fourth quarter. That's primarily due to Susquehanna. And revenue was up annualized, 10.8%, compared to the third. So we did have strong revenue growth. Now that did include acquisitions, but that's part of our business, so that's real revenue increase. 
For the full year, we totaled $9.8 billion, including acquisitions, which is up 4.1%, and we did have record fee income for the year. Our net interest margin, as I indicated, was stable at 3.35%, which is an important consideration. Our efficiency did improve to 58.8% as we achieved positive operating leverage. I would point out to you that we are really focused on expense management. We're working through the Susquehanna and will be working through the National Penn conversions, which really gives us an excellent opportunity to become more efficient, which we're absolutely committed to do. 
Average loans and leases held for investment totaled $134.8 billion fourth quarter versus $130.5 billion in the third quarter. Excluding acquisitions, our average loans are a little better than we expected, growing approximately 2% annualized versus the third. Now if you take out residential mortgage, which, if you recall, we are intentionally running down and continue to do that, it's up 4.5%. So pretty good loan growth quarter. Organic growth was very strong in C&I, direct retail and equipment finance. 
From a strategic point of view, we're very happy that we did receive full approval from all the regulators for National Penn. We now expect to move that closing up to April 1, and we still plan to do the conversion about mid-July. And so the cost saves on National Penn will still be back -- second half-loaded because you don't really get the cost saves until the conversion. You could argue why we don't move the conversion up. But as you know, we've done a lot of mergers for a long time, and it's best to take your time and do it right rather than get in a hurry and do it wrong. So we'll get all -- get the site in by the end of the year, but we'll take our time doing it. 
Susquehanna is doing great. We did that conversion in mid-November. I will point out, this is the largest conversion ever based on loan and deposit accounts. So we had 144,000 loan accounts, 790,000 deposit accounts, so it was big deal. It's going extraordinarily well. All the regions are running really, really smoothly. And an early look by Rick and his people, the combination of National Penn and Susquehanna looks really great. I mean, it's frankly better than we anticipated when we announced the combination. 
So if you're following along on the slides, if you look at Slide 5, I'll give you a little more detail with regard to our loan growth, which, as I said, was 4.5% ex acquisitions and ex residential mortgage. C&I loan growth was strong. Estimated core C&I loan growth for us was up $848 million or 7.8% annualized. That was largely led by corporate lending and production in the branching network. Our C&I lending was mostly large participations as it was in previous quarters, so it's very competitive. Spreads are tight, but the spreads are flattening out. So that's a good sign. End-of-period balances increased $335 million, again, led by large corporate. So right now, looking forward for next quarter, we expect C&I to continue to grow. It could be a little slower depending on strength and manufacturing. 
I want to particularly point out to you that our oil and gas portfolio is not large for our company. It's $1.4 billion outstanding, which is about 1% of our portfolio. It's a very conservative portfolio. 67% is upstream, 30% is midstream, and we only have about 3 percentage for services. At the end of the fourth quarter, we have no delinquency, no losses. We have no energy loans on nonaccruals. So I noticed there are a lot written and talked about, about energy, but energy is just not a negative story for us. It's a good, solid story, and we don't anticipate any major problems in that area. 
Obviously, if all goes to extreme lows, we'll have some challenges. But because the absolute size has been so small, we just do not anticipate that to be a big issue for BB&T. In the dealer floor plan area, we had a very strong quarter, up $108 million, about 40% annualized. That's really being driven by new markets that we're entering, some new lands we're offering. And we expect it to continue to grow, although probably not at quite that pace. 
In CRE construction and development, we increased 1.6% annualized in the quarter, excluding acquisitions. End-of-period balances did decline a bit, so we expect C&D growth to be kind of seasonally solid until the spring. CRE income producing increased 2.5% annualized, excluding acquisitions. That was mostly broad-based office, hospitality, industrial. The market fundamentals in those spaces continues to improve, although spreads continue to tighten. And so looking at next quarter, we expect core IPP to slow and to really be about flat mostly because of the competitive pricing, and we're just not -- we just not try to book loan just to book loans. If the prices are not acceptable, we just rather not have them. 
Average direct retail lending is a really good story for us, increasing $237 million, almost 11% annualized, due to our HELOC portfolio, direct lending, auto lending in the branches. Our wealth division is doing great, producing about 30% of our retail volume. It's just a really good story. We have really good momentum heading into the first quarter. It might be a little bit slow, just probably seasonal, but the underlying strategic direction in the portfolio has strong momentum as we look forward. 
Let's look at sales finance. On the other hand, it did decline $406 million or 17.5%. That was very consistent with our strategies. We simply aren't willing to participate in the tighter-spread market that exists in that space. With the increased capital that is required today, it just simply does not make sense to book loans where there's not a reasonable risk-adjusted return on capital. So we've been very careful and judicious at looking at the kind of assets we're willing to book. And right now, sales finance is just not a particularly profitable area. That doesn't mean we're getting out of the business. We are restructuring the business, however. You heard us say it recently. We've now implemented a flat-rate compensation program for our dealers, and we're watching the spreads carefully. I would point out that we did pick up a portfolio called the Hann leasing -- auto leasing business from Susquehanna, which we are exiting because we don't choose to do auto leasing, and so that'll be winding down. That'll be a little bit of a negative impact, but it won't affect our fundamental strategies. 
Average residential mortgage, kind of like you've been hearing from everybody, was down 5.9% linked quarter annualized. We are selling all of our conforming production, and originations were 30% lower than the third quarter. Of course, that was largely seasonal. So we expect to see applications continuing to be soft as we hit through the winter months. Gain on sales was down about 5%. Our correspondent channel made -- shifted to 55%, so there's a lot of moving parts in the mortgage business today. The whole TRID disclosure program is definitely slowing down production and booking of transactions. It's hard to know what the underlying issues are in terms of consumer preferences in terms of millennials, et cetera, choosing to own homes or not. Of course, we think it's a little bit early to call all of that. What we do know right now, though, is that mortgage production is down, and part of that is substantially because of the mortgage disclosures that takes just a long, long time. 
I would point out on a very positive note that, overall, the Community Bank loan production is really accelerating. This is the best it's been in years. Our commercial production is up 16.7%. Retail is up 44% compared to the last fourth quarter, and that momentum will continue as we head into the first and second quarters. Our other lending subsidiaries grew $227 million or 7.3%. That's a good number. It's actually a little seasonally weaker, though, because of seasonality for this nature of business. The strongest ones in this area was Grandbridge, equipment finance and Regional Acceptance. So we can expect for the first quarter, this, again, to be seasonally slower, but good in terms of the long-term strategies in the portfolio. 
So to sum up, we expect average loans held for investment to be up modestly about 1% in the first quarter with continued pressure, given the seasonality in our seasonal portfolios. 
Just to comment with regard to the overall economy because that obviously impacts the loan production. There's been a lot written and said over the last few weeks about the issues in the stock market. We believe there's a lot of overreaction going on. It like you woke up January 2, all of a sudden, everybody decided the world's falling apart, and we reject that. We don't see any fundamental structural changes between the first part of December to first part of January. The world just doesn't happen that fast. Obviously, a lot of huge confluence of negative psychology going on, but we're trying to look past that. So what we focus on is the fact that, yes, the world is down, and that is the fact in terms of the oil space, but oil is overall really diminutive. It's diminutive to consumer loans, it's diminutive to businesses, it's diminutive to the airlines. Oil is diminutive. The strong dollar has other implications. But in terms of consumer purchases, it's diminutive because, obviously, imports are a lot cheaper. And so what we would say is that it's not a bullish environment. It's no different from what we talked about the last 2, 3 quarters. The economy is growing at 2%, 2.25% kind of growth rate, which is not great, but it's not falling. So I would say that for all of those pundits that are saying the sky is falling, we would respectfully disagree with that. 
So if you look at our Slide 6, just a comment or 2 on deposits. It continues to be a good story for us. Our noninterest deposits increased $1.7 billion or 15% annualized, but that does include acquisitions. If you take out acquisitions, our total deposits were about flat by design. But noninterest-bearing deposits grew 7.5%, which was very good. So we're doing a really good job in improving our mix and reducing our cost. Ex Susquehanna, our noninterest-bearing deposits were 32.3% of deposits, and our costs remain low at 24 basis points. 
I'd point out on a very bright note that we introduced in the fourth quarter our new U digital mobile online platform. It is doing extraordinarily well. We now have over 650,000 users, and it is gaining momentum as we go forward. We believe it is the best integrated platform in the business today, and it's certainly a big driver of our new account production today. So overall, we feel really great about our deposit performance. We feel really good about our digital strategy. And while there's plenty to do, we believe we'll stand out as a real positive performer in the whole digital space as we go forward. 
So now with that, I'll ask Daryl to give you some more detail, and then I'll summarize after that."
19109,316201981,919921,"BB&T Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Truist Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. Turning to Slide 7. Our credit quality remains very strong. Loans 90 days",1169,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our credit quality remains very strong. Loans 90 days or more past due declined $69 million, mostly driven by loans acquired from the FDIC and impaired loans. Loans 30 to 89 past due increased 13% mostly because we conformed Susquehanna's delinquencies to our more conservative methodology. 
We also had some seasonal growth, which is typical for the fourth quarter. NPAs declined 4.3% mostly because of the sale of nonperforming residential mortgage loans. This was offset by a more conservative approach for determining nonaccrual status for mortgage loans and HELOCs. Excluding the loan sale, NPAs were essentially flat compared to last quarter. 
Net charge-offs increased slightly to 38 basis points in the quarter led by higher charge-offs at Regional Acceptance. The increase at regional was due to seasonality, declining small car values and the regional Texas exposure. Regional accounted for about half of the total charge-offs. Overall, we are very pleased with credit quality. Looking forward, we expect NPAs to remain in a similar range in the first quarter next year. We expect charge-offs to be in the range of 35 to 45 basis points. 
Continuing on Slide 8. Our allowance coverage ratios remained strong at 2.83x for charge-offs and 2.53x for NPLs. The allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.07% compared to 1.08% last quarter. Remember, all of our acquired loans have a combined mark of about $750 million from all of our acquisitions, so the effective allowance coverage is significantly higher. 
We recorded a provision of $129 million for the quarter compared to net charge-offs of $130 million. As Kelly mentioned earlier, we have a very clean and conservative energy portfolio. That's about 1% of our loan portfolio or $1.4 billion. The allowance coverage for these loans is approximately 5%, given the stress in the sector. 
Turning to Slide 9. Net interest margin was 3.35%, flat compared to third quarter and in line with our guidance. Core margin was 3.12%, down 3 basis points. Both GAAP and core margin were impacted by larger balances at the Fed for a majority of the quarter and lower loan yields. 
We expect GAAP and core margin to increase modestly in the first quarter due to higher rates on earning assets, driven by a recent rate increase, lower Fed balances and the ability to lag deposit rates. We became slightly less asset-sensitive this quarter mostly due to investment and funding mix changes. As you can see, we will continue to benefit from additional rate hikes. 
Continuing on Slide 10. Fee income for the year was a new record. Our fee income ratio was 41.8% for the quarter. Looking at a few components of fee income. Insurance income increased $26 million or 29% annualized mostly due to seasonal factors. Investment banking and brokerage experienced a decline of $14 million mostly due to higher capital markets activity last quarter. Mortgage banking income decreased $7 million mostly due to lower gain on sale of loans and lower salable production offset by better commercial mortgage income. 
Other income increased $15 million due to $25 million higher income related to assets of certain post-employment benefits and $12 million in the client derivative income offset by a $20 million decrease in partnership and other investment income. Noninterest income should increase modestly next quarter. This will be led by stronger insurance and investment banking revenues with lower mortgage and service charge income. 
Turning to Slide 11. Noninterest expenses totaled $1.6 billion, essentially flat from last quarter. Personnel expense increased $11 million, driven by higher salary expenses from Susquehanna. In addition, we had some offsetting expenses with higher post-employment benefit expense and lower medical and retirement costs. 
Average FTEs were up just a bit over 1,000 due to Susquehanna. Excluding acquisitions, FTEs remained flat. 
Occupancy and equipment expense increased $9 million mostly due to acquisitions. Merger-related and restructuring charges totaled $50 million. We do not expect a material amount of merger-related cost next quarter. 
Our effective tax rate was 31.7%, and we expect a similar rate next quarter. Noninterest expense should be flat on a GAAP basis next quarter as the lower merger-related charges will be offset by seasonally higher FICA and employee benefit-related expenses. We are confident we will achieve the cost saves from our acquisitions. We also expect to improve efficiency throughout 2016 with fourth quarter efficiency ratio around 56% to 57%. 
Turning to Slide 12. Capital ratios remained very strong, with common equity Tier 1 of 10.2%. Fully phased in common equity Tier 1 increased to 10%. Our LCR decreased to 130%, and our asset liquid buffer at the end of the quarter was very strong at 13.5%. 
Let's look at some segment results, beginning on Slide 13. Community Bank's net income was up $9 million from last quarter and up $22 million from the fourth quarter of last year. This was driven by commercial lending, retail lending and deposits as well as higher funding spreads on deposits, partially offset by lower rates on new commercial loans. Net interest income increased $87 million, with about half of that driven by Susquehanna. 
Finally, with all the regulatory approvals we received for the planned acquisition of National Penn, we expect to close on April 1 with the third quarter systems conversion. 
Turning to Slide 14. Residential Mortgage Banking net income totaled $49 million, down $10 million from last quarter, driven by a lower gain on mortgage loan production, partially offset by an increase in net servicing income. Gain on sale spreads dropped slightly to 103 [ph], and 58% of our production mix was purchased. 
Looking at Slide 15. Dealer Financial Services income totaled $42 million, down $2 million from last quarter. The provision was up due to higher charge-offs in Dealer Finance and Regional Acceptance. 
Turning to Slide 16. Specialized Lending net income totaled $71 million, up $2 million from last quarter, driven by higher commercial mortgage income and leasing income. 
Looking at Slide 17. Insurance Services net income totaled $36 million, up $15 million from last quarter, mostly driven by a seasonal increase in commercial property and casualty insurance and higher live commissions due to seasonality and improved production. Year-to-date same-store sales achieved about a 1% growth as the market for insurance pricing is softer. 
Turning to Slide 18. Financial Services segment had $103 million in net income, up $21 million from last quarter. Corporate Banking generated significant loan growth of 30%. Wealth experienced 16% loan growth and 21% growth in transaction deposits. Noninterest income decreased $10 million linked quarter due to lower SBIC partnership income and investment advisory fees. 
In summary, we achieved broad-based loan growth and revenue growth due to Susquehanna, continued excellent credit quality and positive operating leverage. We look forward to executing on the opportunities for merger partners in the coming quarters. 
Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A."

Florida is doing really, really well now. Texas is having a little bit of a dampening effect because of energy, but energy is only about 10% of the overall empire. That's what I tell people.

From a core perspective, we're seeing really strong growth in Texas. I would support that Texas is not just all oil, big, to be sure, but there's a lot of other things. We've been pleased with our loan growth in the Texas market. Florida, across the whole state, has rebounded, and we've seen really solid growth in the State of Florida. We've got opportunities to grow our ABL business. We're looking really closely at how we make that more effective. We've been pleased with growth in small commercial and small business with the strategies that we did employ. We're going to be careful with CRE. You heard Kelly talk about that. We got to be careful with pricing. We got to be careful with risk. But the last 2 quarters, in the third and the fourth, Community Bank growth on a linked basis has been the best it's been in probably 5, 6 or 7 years. Production, as Kelly said, is up. Our activity levels are good. I would not say that means that we think the economy is doing outstandingly well. We just are grinding it out, finding opportunities. Our guys are working really, really hard, and I feel good about where we are. And as we go into '16, I feel as good about making our loan growth goals in the Community Bank in terms of where we've been over the last several years than any of those years.

We're going to look at a stressed cash flow coverage, and we're going to look at existing market rents. And we're not going to look at those pro forma escalations, and we're going to look at stress exits. So a lot of lenders are lending against that really low cap rate. So it looks like you've got a lot of equity in the deal, but it's really probably overfinanced. And so our loans would typically have less proceeds, given our approach."

And at the same time, though, when you talk to Xers and Yers and millennials, they will still tell you that one of the top 2 preference items in terms of selecting a bank is the convenience of a branch. Fact is, people still want to be able to go into a branch and see somebody to have a complex product if they have a problem, and there's a little bit of dispute psychology that were eyed by the branch and say, ""Well, that's what I mean, is it makes me feel good."" So you're not going to see a dramatic change in a number of branches, but you will see an increasing focus on the size of the branches, the structure of the staffing in the branches, and all of that will help to relatively reduce our cost as we shift more into the digital platform.

We've been on a very methodical long-term pruning of our branch system. We've not had any real major branch reductions other than onetime several years ago, but we constantly look at our branches. We look at underperforming branches. We look at opportunities to consolidate branches. So we're all over that. Secondly, we've been on a pretty steady path of reducing headcount in our branches in response to less transactions in the branch. So we are already running pretty elbow lean in our branches today. We're also believing that the folks in the branches need to know more, do more. So this would need a universal concept something we're embracing and moving forward on, so that lesser people, better people, better and able people can do more for our clients, and what we're finding is our associates like it because they feel better armed to take care of client needs, and it also creates savings for us. So this is an evolution and a process. I don't view it as a revolutionary process. We've got to continue to be on top of it. We are seeing clearly reduction of branch transactions steady. It continues to be. It's not going over a cliff. Branches still are important. They're part of our branding. They're part of the convenience that we have to have. They're part of the omnichannel development. So it's about having new, but it's also about having good branches. It's about having great ATMs. It's about having great call center. It's about having a great experience 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and that's what we're trying to put together at BB&T, a lot of focus on digital and the new platform is we think unique and different, and it's got lots of accolades. Kelly mentioned over 650,000 used. The last number that just came out yesterday was over 700,000 users, and the positive impact from our associates, feedback from our clients is all very, very good. Now to give you the cost of transactions, we have not really done that to say what if a transaction [indiscernible] there's no question, self-service would save money, no doubt about that, but overall, what we find is we can get somebody to do U, we think they're going to do more at the branch, they're going to do more call center, they're going to do more across all of our platforms. And so at the end of the day, that gives us a better chance to have a bigger share of wallet, better referral from them and ultimately drives the revenue, while overall aspects around cost reduction ultimately leads to positive operating revenue in the branches. That's what we're trying to achieve."

And keep in mind there's a big issue out there yet to be determined there, it's around kind of cyclical buffer. Not many people are talking about it, but that is the potential increase in capital, and so we're going to be conservative so that we don't end up having to go get capital at a time that is not market friendly. So given all of that, I would say that you'll see our performance in '16 kind of look like '15 whether we do specific buybacks or not is always will be a function of whether or not we have acquisition opportunities that allows us to use that extra capital like we have done in the last couple of years and a function of what our price is.

So my biggest concern is that while we believe even down pretty low, we've got very strong asset coverage and our PV9s [ph] look good. So I don't think even at low rates, we fundamentally have a lot of lost exposure. I'm more concerned about this time around there's a lot of layered bond debt behind the senior secured lenders, and traditionally, that was not the case. And so what could happen this time if it stay down long and low, it could cause a lot of nonaccrual risk. And if you try to work through all that layered debt, and that could cause to have to work through and consider discounts for losses beyond the collateral coverage you normally see.

We're trying to make sure we stay ahead of that. I think our 5% reserve given the quality of our portfolio is very, very prudent, and takes those kinds of things into consideration."

I think the longer the challenging environment persists, particularly in some spaces, maybe, like in the energy space, it's certainly putting this proportion amount of pressure on certain companies and to the extent that it lasts a while, it would certainly it could cause them to reevaluate their strategic thinking going forward. So we remain from a long-term point of view committed to our acquisition strategy. I'd recall that it is to grow on the average basis 5% to 10% of our assets. In that scenario, you could see the probability increase of potential partners that might be interested. So it always comes down to 2 things, well, 3 things. It comes down to a cultural shift, but we talk to people about our cultural fit, and then it comes down to their willingness to combine and then it's just the mathematics.

And so as we layer in these acquisitions, we're constantly in the process of rationalizing those deposit structures because a good portion of those CD portfolios that we inherent each time are really, really price-sensitive portfolios. And as we bring the pricing more in line with our normal pricing, a fair amount of those CD portfolios tend to exit. So that's why you've seen a kind of relative decline in CD financing over the last few years. You'll see some more of that as we think through, excuse me, just [ph] National Penn, although the price variation for them is not as different as it has been in some of our acquisitions in the past. We think CDs are necessary and important part of our ongoing funding structure. There's a portion of that portfolio that is kind of core bread-and-butter, fully committed clients that we always keep, and we're willing to pay little more to keep those because they're long-term stable users of our services. On the other hand, you always have the ones that are single-service clients, and they're shopping 15 banks and go on to the one that has highest space for CD, and we don't tend to keep those. So I suspect those rates go up, you will see our CD portfolio increase some, but it won't be as dramatic as you may think because we are growing our DDA and all the funding sources at a very fast pace, and so that we intentionally are not as CD dependent as we've been in the past. So I don't -- it depends on the company, but with our variety of funding sources, I don't think CD financing for us in the future will be what it was in the past."

So I think this fourth quarter overall for us was a very solid quarter. Particularly given the challenging environment we have out there. We had really steady organic performance, and really, it was a great year from a strategic point of view. 
So our core loan and deposit growth number is a bit better than we expected. GAAP growth numbers included the impact of the acquisitions, as you'll note. We grew revenues and held the net interest margin stable, which was a very comforting trend. Also, we have a very strong level of capital and liquidity. And so overall, we continue to be a very strong company. 
If you focus on the quarter in terms of earnings, we made $502 million with diluted EPS of $0.64, which was flat with last quarter, and we did have $50 million in pretax merger-related and restructuring charges. So if you ex that, we had what I'd call operating or core earnings of $0.68 per share excluding the merger charges. 
If you look at GAAP ROA of 1.03%, return on tangible common was 13.37%. But if you adjust for the merger and restructuring charges, ROA was 1.09% and return on tangible was 14.19%. 
Revenues totaled $2.6 billion, up $164 million versus the fourth quarter. That's primarily due to Susquehanna. And revenue was up annualized, 10.8% compared to the third. So we did have strong revenue growth. Now that did include acquisitions, but that's part of our business, so that's real revenue increase. 
For the full year, we totaled $9.8 billion, including acquisitions, was up 4.1%, and we did have record fee income for the year. Our net interest margin, as I indicated, was stable at 3.35%, which is an important consideration. Our efficiency did improve to 58.8% as we achieved positive operating leverage. I would point out to you that we are really focused on expense management. We're working through the Susquehanna and will be working through the National Penn conversions, which really gives us an excellent opportunity to become more efficient, which we're absolutely committed to do. 
Average loans and leases held for investment totaled $134.8 billion fourth quarter versus $130.5 billion in the third quarter. Excluding acquisitions, our average loans are a little better than we expected, growing approximately 2% annualized versus the third. Now if you take out residential mortgage, which, if you recall, we are intentionally running down and continue to do that, it's up 4.5%. So pretty good loan growth quarter. Organic growth was very strong in C&I, direct retail and equipment finance. 
From a strategic point of view, we're very happy that we did receive full approval from all the regulators for National Penn. We now expect to move that closing up to April 1, and we still plan to do the conversion about mid-July. And so the cost saves on National Penn will still be back -- second half loaded because you don't really get the cost saves until the conversion. You could argue why we don't move the conversion up. But as you know, we've done a lot of mergers for a long time, and it's best to take your time and do it right rather than get in a hurry and do it wrong. So we'll get all -- get the saving by the end of the year, but we'll take our time doing it. 
Susquehanna is doing great. We did that conversion in mid-November. I will point out, this is the largest conversion ever based on loan and deposit accounts. So we had 144,000 loan accounts, 790,000 deposit accounts, so it was a big deal. It's going extraordinarily well. All the regions are running really, really smoothly. And an early look by Ricky and his people add the combination of National Penn and Susquehanna looks really great. I mean, it's frankly better than we anticipated when we announced the combination. 
So if you're following along on the slides, if you look at Slide 5, I'll give you a little more detail with regard to our loan growth, which, as I said, was 4.5% ex acquisitions and ex residential mortgage. 
C&I loan growth was strong. Estimated core C&I loan growth for us was up $848 million or 7.8% annualized. That was largely led by corporate lending and production in the branching network. Our C&I lending was mostly large participations as it was in previous quarters, so it's very competitive. Spreads are tight, but the spreads are flattening out. So that's a good sign. End-of-period balances increased $335 million, again, led by large corporate. So right now, looking forward for next quarter, we expect C&I to continue to grow. Could be a little slower depending on strength in manufacturing. 
I want to particularly point out to you that our oil and gas portfolio is not large for our company. It's $1.4 billion outstanding, which is about 1% of our portfolio. It's a very conservative portfolio. 67% is upstream, 30% is midstream, and we only have about 3% in support services. At the end of the fourth quarter, we have no delinquency, no losses. We have no energy loans on nonaccruals. So I noticed there are a lot written and talked about, about energy, but energy is just not a negative story for us. It's a good, solid story, and we don't anticipate any major problems in that area. 
Obviously, if oil goes to extreme lows, we'll have some challenges. But because of the absolute size has been so small, we just do not anticipate that to be a big issue for BB&T. In the dealer floor plan area, we had a very strong quarter, up $108 million, about 40% annualized. That's really being driven by new markets that we're entering, some new lands we're offering. And we expect it to continue to grow, although probably not at quite that pace. 
In CRE - Construction and Development, we increased 1.6% annualized in the quarter, excluding acquisitions. End-of-period balances did decline a bit, so we expect C&D growth to be kind of seasonally solid until the spring. CRE income producing increased 2.5% annualized, excluding acquisitions. That was mostly broad-based office, hospitality, industrial. The market fundamentals in those spaces continues to improve, although spreads continue to tighten. And so looking at next quarter, we expect core IPP to slow and to really be about flat mostly because of the competitive pricing, and we're just not -- we just not try to book loans just to book loans. If the prices are not acceptable, we'd just rather not have them. 
Average direct retail lending is a really good story for us, increasing $237 million, almost 11% annualized due to our HELOC portfolio, direct lending, auto lending in the branches. Our wealth division is doing great, producing about 30% of our retail volume. It's just a really good story. We have really good momentum heading into first quarter. Might be a little bit slow just because it's seasonal, but the underlying strategic direction in the portfolio has strong momentum as we look forward. 
Let's look at sales finance. On the other hand, it did decline $406 million or 17.5%. That was very consistent with our strategies. We simply aren't willing to participate in the tighter-spread market that exists in that space. With increased capital that is required today, it just simply does not make sense to book loans where there's not a reasonable risk-adjusted return on capital. So we've been very careful and judicious at looking at the kind of assets we're willing to book. And right now, sales finance is just not a particularly profitable area. That doesn't mean we're getting out of the business. We are restructuring the business, however. You heard us say it recently. We've now implemented a flat-rate compensation program for our dealers, and we're watching the spreads carefully. I would point out that we did pick up a portfolio called the Hann leasing -- auto leasing business from Susquehanna, which we are exiting because we don't choose to do auto leasing, and so that'll be winding down. That'll be a little bit of a negative impact, but it won't affect our fundamental strategies. 
Average residential mortgage, about like you've been hearing from everybody, was down 5.9% linked quarter annualized. We are selling all of our conforming production, and originations were 30% lower than the third quarter. Of course, that was largely seasonal. So we expect to see applications continuing to be soft as we head through the winter months. Gain on sales was down about 5%. Our correspondent channel made -- shifted to 55%, so there's a lot of moving parts in the mortgage business today. The whole TRID disclosure program is definitely slowing down production and booking of transactions. It's hard to know what underlying issues are in terms of consumer preferences in terms of millennials, et cetera, choosing to own homes or not. Of course, we [ph] think it's a little bit early to call all of that. What we do know right now, though, is that mortgage production is down, and part of that is substantially because of the mortgage disclosures that takes just a long, long time. 
I would point out on a very positive note that, overall, the Community Bank loan production is really accelerating. It's the best it's been in years. Our commercial production is up 16.7%. Retail is up 44% compared to the last fourth quarter, and that momentum will continue as we head into the first and second quarters. Our other lending subsidiaries grew $227 million or 7.3%. That's a good number. It's actually a little seasonally weaker, though, because of seasonality for these majors [ph] business. The strongest ones in this area was Grandbridge, equipment finance and Regional Acceptance. So we can expect for the first quarter, this, again, to be seasonally slower but good in terms of the long-term strategies in those portfolios. 
So to sum up, we expect average loans held for investment to be up modestly about 1% in the first quarter with continued pressure given seasonality in seasonal portfolios. 
Just to comment with regard to the overall economy because that obviously impacts the loan production. There's been a lot written and said over the last few weeks about the issues in the stock market. We believe there's a lot of overreaction going on. It's like you woke up January 2, all of a sudden, everybody decided the world's falling apart, and we reject that. We don't see any fundamental structural changes between the first part of December to first part of January. The world just doesn't happen that fast. Obviously, a lot of huge confluence of negative psychology going on, but we're trying to look past that. So what we focus on is the fact that, yes, oil is down, and that is a fact in terms of the oil space, but oil is overall really stimulative. It's stimulative to consumer loans, it's stimulative to businesses, it's stimulative to airlines. Oil is stimulative. The strong dollar has other implications. But in terms of consumer purchases, it's stimulative because, obviously, imports are a lot cheaper. And so what we would say is that it's not a bullish environment. It's no different from what we talked about last 2, 3 quarters. The economy is growing at 2%, 2 1/4% kind of growth rate, which is not great, but it's not falling. So I would say that for all of those pundits that are saying the sky is falling, we would respectfully disagree with that. 
So if you look at our Slide 6, just a comment or 2 on deposits. It continues to be a good story for us. Our noninterest deposits increased $1.7 billion or 15% annualized, but that does include acquisitions. If you take out acquisitions, our total deposits were about flat by design. But noninterest-bearing deposits grew 7.5%, which was very good. So we're doing a really good job in improving our mix and reducing our cost. Ex Susquehanna, our noninterest-bearing deposits were 32.3% of deposits, and our costs remain low at 24 basis points. 
I'd point out on a very bright note that we introduced in the fourth quarter our new U digital mobile online platform. It is doing extraordinarily well. We now have over 650,000 users, and it is gaining momentum as we go forward. We believe it is the best integrated platform in the business today, and it's certainly a big driver of our new account production today. So overall, we feel really great about our deposit performance. We feel really good about our digital strategy. And while there's plenty to do, we believe we'll stand out as a real positive performer in the whole digital space as we go forward. 
So now with that, I'll ask Daryl to give you some more detail, and then I'll summarize after that."
19109,316201981,919990,"BB&T Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Truist Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. Turning to Slide 7. Our credit quality remains very strong. Loans 90 days",1166,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our credit quality remains very strong. Loans 90 days or more past due declined $69 million, mostly driven by loans acquired from the FDIC and impaired loans. Loans 30 to 89 past due increased 13% mostly because we conformed Susquehanna's delinquencies to our more conservative methodology. 
We also had some seasonal growth, which is typical for the fourth quarter. NPAs declined 4.3% mostly because of the sale of nonperforming residential mortgage loans. This was offset by a more conservative approach for determining nonaccrual status for mortgage loans and HELOCs. Excluding the loan sale, NPAs were essentially flat compared to last quarter. 
Net charge-offs increased slightly to 38 basis points in the quarter led by higher charge-offs at Regional Acceptance. The increase at Regional was due to seasonality, declining small car values and Regional's Texas exposure. Regional accounted for about half of the total charge-offs. Overall, we are very pleased with credit quality. Looking forward, we expect NPAs to remain in a similar range in the first quarter next year. We expect charge-offs to be in the range of 35 to 45 basis points. 
Continuing on Slide 8. Our allowance coverage ratios remained strong at 2.83x for charge-offs and 2.53x for NPLs. The allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.07% compared to 1.08% last quarter. Remember, all of our acquired loans have a combined mark of about $750 million from all of our acquisitions, so the effective allowance coverage is significantly higher. 
We recorded a provision of $129 million for the quarter compared to net charge-offs of $130 million. As Kelly mentioned earlier, we have a very clean and conservative energy portfolio. That's about 1% of our loan portfolio or $1.4 billion. The allowance coverage for these loans is approximately 5%, given the stress in the sector. 
Turning to Slide 9. Net interest margin was 3.35%, flat compared to third quarter and in line with our guidance. Core margin was 3.12%, down 3 basis points. Both GAAP and core margin were impacted by larger balances at the Fed for a majority of the quarter and lower loan yields. 
We expect GAAP and core margin to increase modestly in the first quarter due to higher rates on earning assets, driven by recent rate increase, lower Fed balances and the ability to lag deposit rates. We became slightly less asset sensitive this quarter mostly due to investment and funding mix changes. As you can see, we will continue to benefit from additional rate hikes. 
Continuing on Slide 10. Fee income for the year was a new record. Our fee income ratio was 41.8% for the quarter. Looking at a few components of fee income. Insurance income increased $26 million for 29% annualized mostly due to seasonal factors. Investment banking and brokerage experienced a decline of $14 million mostly due to higher capital market activity last quarter. Mortgage banking income decreased $7 million mostly due to lower gain on sale of loans and lower salable production offset by better commercial mortgage income. 
Other income increased $15 million due to $25 million higher income related to assets of certain post-employment benefits and $12 million in the client derivative income offset by a $20 million decrease in partnership with other investment income. Noninterest income should increase modestly next quarter. This will be led by stronger insurance and investment banking revenues with lower mortgage and service charge income. 
Turning to Slide 11. Noninterest expenses totaled $1.6 billion, essentially flat from last quarter. Personnel expense increased $11 million driven by higher salary expenses from Susquehanna. In addition, we had some offsetting expenses with higher post-employment benefit expense and lower medical and retirement costs. 
Average FTEs were up just a bit over 1,000 due to Susquehanna. Excluding acquisitions, FTEs remained flat. 
Occupancy and equipment expense increased $9 million mostly due to acquisitions. Merger-related and restructuring charges totaled $50 million. We do not expect a material amount of merger-related costs next quarter. 
Our effective tax rate was 31.7%, and we expect a similar rate next quarter. Noninterest expense should be flat on a GAAP basis next quarter as we lower merger-related charges will be offset by seasonally higher FICA and employee benefit-related expenses. We are confident we will achieve the cost saves from our acquisitions. We also expect to improve efficiency throughout 2016 with fourth quarter efficiency ratio around 56% to 57%. 
Turning to Slide 12. Capital ratios remained very strong with common equity Tier 1 of 10.2%. Fully phased in common equity Tier 1 increased to 10%. Our LCR decreased to 130%, and our asset liquid buffer at the end of the quarter was very strong at 13.5%. 
Let's look at some segment results, beginning on Slide 13. Community Bank's net income was up $9 million from last quarter and up $22 million from the fourth quarter of last year. This was driven by commercial lending, retail lending and deposits as well as higher funding spreads on deposits, partially offset by lower rates on new commercial loans. Net interest income increased $87 million with about half of that driven by Susquehanna. 
Finally, with all the regulatory approvals we received for the planned acquisition of National Penn, we expect to close on April 1 with a third quarter systems conversion. 
Turning to Slide 14. Residential Mortgage Banking net income totaled $49 million, down $10 million from last quarter, driven by lower gain on mortgage loan production, partially offset by increasing net servicing income. Gain on sale spreads dropped slightly to 1 03 [ph], and 58% of our production mix was purchase. 
Looking at Slide 15. Dealer Financial Services income totaled $42 million, down $2 million from last quarter, but provision was up due to higher charge-offs in Dealer Finance and Regional Acceptance. 
Turning to Slide 16. Specialized Lending net income totaled $71 million, up $2 million from last quarter, driven by higher commercial mortgage income and leasing income. 
Looking at Slide 17. Insurance Services net income totaled $36 million, up $15 million from last quarter, mostly driven by a seasonal increase in commercial property and casualty insurance and higher life commissions due to seasonality and improved production. Year-to-date same-store sales achieved about a 1% growth as the market for insurance pricing is softer. 
Turning to Slide 18. Financial Services segment had $103 million in net income, up $21 million from last quarter. Corporate Banking generated significant loan growth of 30%. Wealth experienced 16% loan growth and 21% growth in transaction deposits. Noninterest income decreased $10 million linked quarter due to lower SBIC partnership income and investment advisory fees. 
In summary, we achieved broad-based loan growth and revenue growth due to Susquehanna, continued excellent credit quality and positive operating leverage. We look forward to executing on the opportunities for merger partners in the coming quarters. 
Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A."

We've been pleased with our loan growth in the Texas market. Florida, across the whole state, has rebounded, and we've seen really solid growth in the state of Florida. We've got opportunities to grow our ABL business. We're looking really closely at how we make that more effective. We've been pleased with growth in small commercial and small business with the strategies that we've been employing. We'll be careful with CRE. You heard Kelly talk about that. We got to be careful with pricing. We got to be careful with risk. But the last 2 quarters, in the third and the fourth, Community Bank growth on a linked basis has been the best it's been in probably 5, 6 or 7 years. Production, as Kelly said, is up. Our activity levels are good. I would not say that means that we think the economy is doing outstandingly well. We just are grinding it out, finding opportunities. Our guys are working really, really hard, and I feel good about where we are.

We're going to look at a stressed cash flow coverage, and we're going to look at existing market rents. And we're not going to look at those pro forma escalations, and we're going to look at stress exits. So a lot of lenders are lending against that really low cap rate. So it looks like you've got a lot of equity in the deal, but it's really probably overfinanced. And so our loans would typically have less proceeds given our approach."

And at the same time, though, when you talk to Xers and Yers and millennials, they will still tell you that 1 of the top 2 preference items in terms of selecting a bank is the convenience of a branch. Fact is, people still want to be able to go into branch and see somebody if they have a complex product or have a problem, and there's a little bit of just pure psychology that we're eyed by the branch and say, ""Well, that's what I mean, is it makes me feel good."" So you're not going to see a dramatic change in the number of branches, but you will see an increasing focus on the size of the branches, the structures of staffing in the branches, and all of that will help to relatively reduce our cost as we shift more into the digital platform.

We've been on a very methodical long-term pruning of our branch system. We've not had any real major branch reductions other than onetime several years ago, but we constantly look at our branches. We look at underperforming branches. We look at opportunities to consolidate branches. So we're all over that. Secondly, we've been on a pretty steady path of reducing headcount in our branches in response to less transactions in the branches. So we're already running pretty doggone lean in our branches today. We're also believing that the folks in the branches need to know more, do more. So this sort of universal concept's something we're embracing and moving forward on so that lesser people, better people -- better enabled people can do more for our clients, and what we're finding is our associates like it because they feel better armed to take care of client needs, and it also creates savings for us. So this is an evolutionary process. I don't view it as a revolutionary process. We've got to continue to be on top of it. We are seeing clearly reduction of branch transactions is steady. It continues to be. It has not gone over a cliff. Branches still are important. They're part of our branding. They're part of the convenience that we have to have. They're part of the omnichannel development. So it's about having U, but it's also about having good branches. It's about having great ATMs. It's about having great call center. It's about having a great experience 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and that's what we're trying to put together at BB&T, a lot of focus on digital. And the U platform is we think unique and different, and it's got lots of accolades. Kelly mentioned over 650,000 users. The last number that just came out yesterday was over 700,000 users, and the positive impact from our associates, the feedback from our clients is all very, very good. Now to get to the cost of transactions, we have not really done that to say what if a transaction is done on U what does it save. There's no question, self-service would save money, no doubt about that, but overall, what we find is if we can get somebody to do U, we think they're going to do more at the branch, we think they'll do more at the call center, they're going to do more across all of our platforms. And so at the end of the day, that gives us a better chance to have a bigger share of wallet, better referrals from them and ultimately drive the revenue while overall aspects around cost reduction ultimately leads to positive operating revenues in the branches. That's what we're trying to achieve."

You would expect to see us hold our total capital request for deployment to the low side of what a lot of people do because we are committed to keeping a relatively strong capital position. And keep in mind there's a big issue out there yet to be determined there is around a countercyclical buffer. Not many people are talking about it, but that is the potential increase in capital, and so we're going to be conservative so that we don't end up having to go get capital at a time that is not market friendly. So given all of that, I would say that you'll see our performance in '16 kind of look like '15 whether. We do specific buybacks or not, as always, will be a function of whether or not we have acquisition opportunities that allows us to use up that extra capital like we have done in the last couple of years and a function of what our price is.

So I don't think, even at low rates, we fundamentally have a lot of lost exposure. I'm more concerned about this time around there's a lot of layered bond debt behind the senior secured lenders, and traditionally, that was not the case. And so what could happen this time if it stayed down long and low, it could cause a lot of nonaccrual risk as you try to work through all that layered debt, and that could cause you to have to work through and consider discounts for losses beyond the collateral coverage you normally see. So we're trying to think about all of that and take a conservative view of loss given to fall.

So we remain, from a long-term point of view, committed to our acquisition strategy. Recall that it is, to grow on the average basis, 5% to 10% of our assets. In that scenario, you could see the probability increase of potential partners that might be interested. So it always comes down to 2 things, well, 3 things. It comes down to a cultural shift, but we only talk to people that are a cultural fit, and then it comes down to their willingness to combine, and then it's just mathematics.

And so as we layer in these acquisitions, we're constantly in a process of rationalizing those deposit structures because a good portion of those CD portfolios that we inherent each time are really, really price-sensitive portfolios. And as we bring the pricing more in line with our normal pricing, a fair amount of those CD portfolios tend to exit. So that's why you've seen a kind of relative decline in CD financing over the last few years. You'll see some more of that as we think through Susquehanna and National Penn, although the price variation for them is not as different as it has been in some of our acquisitions in the past. We think CDs are a necessary and important part of our ongoing funding structure. There's a portion of that portfolio that is kind of core bread-and-butter, fully committed clients that we always keep, and we're willing to pay a little more to keep those because they're long-term stable users of our services. On the other hand, you always have the ones that are single-service clients, and they're shopping 15 banks and go in to the one that has the highest basis point CD, and we don't tend to keep those. So I suspect as rates go up, you will see our CD portfolio increase some, but it won't be as dramatic as you may think because we are growing our DDA and other funding sources at a very fast pace, and so that we intentionally are not as CD dependent as we've been in the past. So I don't -- it depends on the company, but with our variety of funding sources, I don't think CD financing for us in the future will be what it was in the past."

Overall, we had what I call a solid quarter with nice increase in net income and record net interest income. Net income was $527 million, up 8% versus first quarter and 20% annualized versus the fourth, so a solid performance. Diluted EPS was $0.67 which is flat to the first quarter of '15, but was up an annualized 18.9% versus the fourth quarter. 
GAAP ROA was 1.09%. GAAP ROTCE was 13.87%. And if you adjust for mergers or charges only, adjusted ROA was 1.12% and adjusted return on tangible common was 14.2%, so solid returns there. 
In terms of revenues, we had strong revenue growth despite really some challenges in the mortgage banking income and service charges on deposits. So revenues totaled $2.6 billion, which was up 10.2% versus the first quarter and 4.2% annualized versus the fourth. 
We had record net interest income, as I indicated, of $1.6 billion, up 16.4% versus the first and 6.8% annualized versus the fourth. I'm really happy about the fact net interest margin grew 3-point -- to 3.43%, up 8 percent -- up 8 basis points [indiscernible]. Daryl will give more color on that. 
nice, small but nice, improvement in efficiency to 58 3% from 58.8%. Noninterest expenses are very well managed, decreased $52 million or 13.1% annualized, and we did have positive operating leverage. 
Our average loans were down slightly versus fourth quarter, but keep in mind, we continue to adjust our mix by letting our lower spread mortgage balances and sales finance portfolios decline. We are improving our profitability in those areas, so that strategy's working, but it's not just producing loan volume increases. Keep in mind, we also have runoff in our Susquehanna portfolio, and we have a seasonal slower growth in a number of our specialized businesses. So average loans and leases for the quarter were $134.4 billion. if you exclude lower mortgage runoff and sales finance loans, loans held for investment grew 2.2%, which is kind of the number we look at. That was led by a good performance in income-producing properties, direct retail, other lending subsidiaries on our dealer floor plan.
In terms of our strategic highlights, I would point out we did convert Susquehanna in November. We've seen reductions in FTEs, other cost savings. Overall, it is going very well. 
We did complete our acquisition of National Penn on April 1. That -- we'll be converting that most likely in mid-July. That's going very well. Scott , the CEO of National Penn is now the Group President for our northern regions. He's off to a fast start. I feel really good about his leadership and the teams that we have in that area. 
We did complete our acquisition of Swett & Crawford on April 1. This is an outstanding Company, 100-year-old company with a great brand. That's $200 million in revenue. Keep in mind, and this is a little complex, but last year very importantly from a strategic point of view, we sold American [indiscernible] because it was outside of our risk appetite. And now we've effectively completed that process by replacing it with Swett & Crawford. So we've got the revenue back in virtually no-risk basis. So that completes that transition, and we're feeling really good about it. The key now of course in insurance services including Swett & Crawford is to get cost savings and overall improvement in margins.
Before I further address the points here, I just want to make a few important key strategic points. 
So with regard to M&A, as I said, things are going well. After we announced National Penn, we said we would take a pause. All of the deals that we have, we're really excited about. Texas for example where we acquired those branches from Citigroup, Ricky and I were down a couple of weeks ago in Dallas and Houston. And we could not be more pleased in terms of how we've been received and how well things are going. And frankly, overall Texas market is very, very vibrant, notwithstanding questions around energy. It's considered to be an outstanding market with about 29 million people, [indiscernible] 1,000 people a day is. So it's a fantastic market. We're pretty excited about what's going on in northern Kentucky and [indiscernible]. Susquehanna is off to good start. National Penn is just getting started, but it has enormous opportunities on synergies with Susquehanna and the overall revenue opportunities in Pennsylvania. 
So we feel overall really good about our merger strategy, but now is the time for us to focus on the enormous opportunity that we have to improve performance in the areas of investments we have made for the last several years. So I want to be clear, our focus is not on strategic deals, but on improving our profitability through basically 2 areas which we want you to expect: expense management and revenue enhancement. expense management area, we will be focusing on the cost synergies in the community bank, Primarily the Pennsylvania area, we've done a lot of aggressive Community Bank over the last few years, but still small [ph] particularly in Pennsylvania. We have a really good opportunity to rationalize huge investment we've made in the back room in terms of processes and procedures. We spent a fortune in the last several years building all that up. Now is the time to rationalize that. In terms of digital transformation, while we will be increasing our investment in digital transformation, it's also an opportunity to overall become more efficient as you link the front room and the back room. And that's what our recent executive management changes is designed to do. So we think that will be a combination revenue enhancements, expense reduction. Then of course, huge opportunities for insurance integration, particularly in Swett & Crawford.
On the revenue side, we'll continue to get huge revenue enhancements from our Community Bank. The rate of momentum improvement there, particularly our new markets, is exponential. We feel very excited about that. We will continue really, really strong performance in wealth, corporate banking, insurance and others. 
So given our intense focus on realizing new benefits from our previous strategic investments, I'll start [ph] with purchases or buybacks move up in priority as we think about CCAR 16 versus strategic initiatives. I'd be happy to answer questions later with regard to that, but we wanted to assure you know where we are strategically. 
If you turn to Page 4, I'll just mention a couple of items that are unusual this quarter. We did have merger, it was about $23 million or $0.02 negative effect on EPS. We did take securities gains of about $45 million, which is a part of our strategy in terms of matching of security gains and credit issues. So that was a $0.04 positive. And then the energy-related provision in excess of charge-offs was $28 million or $0.02.
Now with regard to energy credits, the provision exceeded charge-offs by $30 million or $0.03 as I indicated. also give a lot of data on this. But I just want to point out that the charge we took does reflect the new regulatory guidelines and the recent results. So while it's possible that we do have some energy negative, we do not expect that. We think we built a significant allowance, and we think we should expect our provision to be lower in the second quarter. So we feel frankly really good. It's a relatively small part of our old portfolio, about 1.3%, but I know that's a big interest area. And Clarke will be glad to give detail on that later, but we feel really good about that.
If you look at the loan area, we feel really good about loan growth relative to the economy. Just a couple of comments about the economy, it is what I would call good, but not great. It's okay. It's rocking along like it's been rocking along, 2% to 2.5%. It vary a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but we -- the United States economy sustained 2% to 2.5% kind of growth pattern. It will stay that way, in my humble opinion, for a good while. 
We see no practical possibilities of recession, notwithstanding the fact that there's been a lot of conversation about that. and the reason is we think there is a very, very strong, solid, pent-up need for continuing investment. When I talk to businesspeople, they are in investing in a way that I call passive investment. That is to say, they're not excited enough about the future to go out and make major expansions and so forth. But they're driving trucks that have 250,000 miles on it. They've got 10-year-old equipment. And so stuff just wears out. so that's why you have to keep investing. 
So that creates kind of a floor on the economy, in my view. It is an upside if we were to get better positive leadership out of D.C. and make some changes in regulation, et cetera. But assuming that's not taking place occasionally, we think there's a solid 2% to 2.5%. 
I would point out that I saw some numbers recently that suggested that most of our markets in the mid-Atlantic Southeast will be growing 1 point to 1.5 points faster than the national average. So being in the mid-Atlantic and Southeast is still good place to be. 
So we are focused on, as I said, profitability in our portfolio. We believe profitable loan growth is more important than absolute loan growth. 
just a little bit more detail with regard to the loan area. C&I loans were down slightly, mostly due to decline in commercial loans in the branch network and mortgage warehouse. On the other hand, end of period loans were better, with C&I up 2.5% annualized. Good news is C&I spreads are stable compared to last quarter. Growth is affected by our strategies position growth and multifamily reach. So we continue to be pretty conservative. kind of expect the C&I to grow at a faster pace in the second quarter probably in the mid-single digits. Daryl will also give you more a lot of color on energy, as I pointed out, but I'd emphasize that we built our reserves and we are confident that our exposures are managed.
CRE growth was essentially flat, with a decline in consortium and a growth in income-producing. So on income-producing, they increased 7% annualized, feel really good about that, fastest growth coming from office and hospitality, and some small decline in retail. And the good news there is market fundamentals generally continued to improve, although spreads are still tight. We expect CRE construction and development to continue to decline somewhat in the second quarter and IPP to grow at a similar pace with the first quarter. 
Dealer floor plan had a very good quarter, up $76 million or 26% annualized. That's been driven by expansion in our new markets and some new lines that we've introduced. That's going very well. So floor plan is expected to continue to grow double digits for this year. 
Average direct retail lending is [indiscernible] for us, increasing $211 million [ph] or almost 8% annualized. A lot of that is HELOC and direct auto from the branches. Ricky and his team had really made a sea change in terms of our credit consumer production of the branches. 
On other hand, wealth division continues to make significant contribution in retail lending, good production as they work closely together. So we expect retail lending to continue to grow in a similar pace. 
Average sales finance, primarily large prime auto, declined $484 million or 18%. That's a continuation of our execution of our flat-rate compensation program. That is going well. It doe s produce less volume, but it produces good [ph] margins. so we feel really good about that. The lines across in terms of the old portfolio running off new portfolio have stabilized. We do have a continued runoff portfolio for a bit longer. And so overall, we think once we get through next quarter, so that will follow, be kind of flattish and then start to grow. 
Residential mortgage loans are down $470 million or 16% linked quarter annualized. So keep in mind, we continue to sell essentially all of our conforming production. And we think again, that's in terms of overall quality management of the balance sheet.  Originations in the quarter were $3.6 billion, about 2% more than the fourth. That was reflected in some seasonal product and application volume. I was glad to see it increase 39% compared to the fourth and totaled $2 billion [ph]. So we're definitely seeing a resurgence in new home purchases. Young people are back buying homes again, and that's a really good thing. Our margins on gain on sale improved about 9%, best level since first quarter of '15.  So looking forward, we believe this portfolio decline will slow and be about flat for the year. 
Other lending subsidiaries continue to do well. They grew $158 million or 5%, but keep in mind, that's a weak quarter and back stronger in the second. they had really good performance in Grandbridge and equipment financing. we would expect a seasonally stronger other lending segment to accelerate in the second quarter because of seasonality. 
So overall, the average loans were -- are expected to be up 1% to 3% on a core basis next quarter. Obviously, with the impact the National Penn, growth will be closer to 20%. And I will point out that is real growth, that's real assets, but we would like to distinguish between organic and core growth. average loans in the second quarter are expected to be about $141 billion.
So if you look at Slide 6, overall deposit program going very well. Deposit mix continues to improve. We continue to do a good job of managing cost of interest-bearing deposits with costs going down -- up only 1 basis points even though we had the rate increase at the end of the year. So average total deposits increased $1.4 billion or 3.7% annualized. And that's a really good growth rate, given our intense focus on managing our costs. 
So let me turn it to Daryl now for a bit more color on some of the numbers."
19109,326126146,960900,"BB&T Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Truist Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today I'm going to talk about credit quality, interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, capital segment results. Turning to Slide 7. Overall credit quality outside the energy portfolio remains stable",1380,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today I'm going to talk about credit quality, interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, capital segment results. 
Turning to Slide 7. Overall credit quality outside the energy portfolio remains stable. Net charge-offs totaled $154 million or 46 basis points. Excluding energy-related losses of $30 million, net charge-offs improved from the prior quarter to 37 basis points. 
Loans 90 days or more past due declined $26 million, mostly driven by loans acquired from the FDIC, impaired loans and a decrease in residential mortgage. Loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased $205 million or 20%, mostly due to seasonality in regional acceptance as well as decreases in residential mortgage, finance, C&I and CRE. 
NPAs increased 27% to 42 basis points, driven by $206 million in energy-related credits moved to nonaccrual. If you exclude energy, NPAs totaled 33 basis points, a modest improvement compared to fourth quarter levels. We're about halfway through our spring redetermination period. 
We expect NPAs to remain in a similar range in the second quarter, assuming no unexpected impact from that process. We expect net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 basis points to 45 basis points. 
Continuing on Slide 8. Our energy portfolio consists of 100 clients with $1.6 billion in outstanding, consisting of 65% upstream, 27% midstream and 8% in support services. And the coal portfolio totals $250 million outstanding. 
We take a very conservative approach to energy lending. We do not lend to offshore producers, mezzanine and second lien facilities or take equity positions. 
During the quarter, we fully implemented a regulatory guidance. The allocated reserves totaled 8.5%, and 44% of the energy portfolio was criticized and classified. It's important to know today, all borrowers are paying consistent with their agreements. As a result, we believe our energy portfolio is manageable.
Turning to Slide 9. Our allowance coverage ratios remained strong at 2.4x fora net charge-offs and 1.89x for NPLs. The allowance-to-loans ratio improved to 1.10% compared to 1.07% last quarter. Excluding the acquired portfolios, the allowance-to-loan ratio is 1.17%, so our effective allowance coverage is higher. Remember, our acquired loans have a combined mark of about $636 million. 
recorded a provision of $184 million for the quarter compared to net charge-offs of $154 million. This includes $3 million in net charge-offs related to the energy portfolio and an additional provision of $30 million to build the allowance to 8.5%.  
Looking forward, our provision is expected to match net charge-offs plus loan growth. We believe that the provision will be much lower than this quarter's numbers, assuming no large deterioration in credit quality.
Turning to Slide 10. Compared to last quarter, net interest margin was 3.43%, up 8 basis points. And core margin was 3.18%, up 6 basis points. The margin increase resulted from a seasonal interest income on assets related to postemployment benefits, duration adjustments on acquired securities, tighter repricing of variable-rate assets combined with stable deposit rates. 
Looking at the second quarter, assuming no Fed rate increases, we expect GAAP margin to decline a few basis points, driven by the runoff of TCI loans and the loss of a positive seasonal impact of interest income on benefit plans, offset by National Penn. We expect core margins to remain relatively stable. Asset sensitivity remains relatively unchanged. We continue to forecast only one interest rate hike this year happening in November.
Continue on Slide 11. Noninterest income totaled $1 billion, relatively flat compared to last quarter. The fee-income ratio was 40.6%. Looking at a few of those components, insurance income increased $39 million or 41% annualized, mostly due to seasonal factors, higher employee benefits and property/casualty commissions offset by lower life insurance commissions. Remember, our first quarter of last year included earnings of American Coastal, a business we sold last May. Excluding acquisitions, insurance income grew 1.9% versus last year. 
Mortgage banking income totaled $91 million, down $13 million mostly due to lower commercial mortgage production. Other income decreased $58 million due to a $43 million decrease in income related to assets of certain postemployment benefits and $14 million decline in client derivative income. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter, including both acquisitions, our total noninterest income is expected to increase 9% to 11% versus second quarter GAAP of $1.016 billion.
Turning to Slide 12, noninterest expenses totaled $1.5 billion, down 13% versus last quarter. Personnel expense increased $22 million, driven by a $34 million increase in Social Security and unemployment factors as well as equity-based compensation for retirement of eligible associates and a $10 million increase in higher pension expense, offset by $30 million decrease in postemployment benefits expense. 
Average FTEs declined 311. Merger-related and restructuring charges declined $27 million, mostly due to Susquehanna conversion costs. In addition, other expense decreased $34 million mostly due to lower operating charge-offs and charitable contributions. 
Our effective tax rate was 30%, and we expect second quarter effective tax rate to be about 31%. 
We expect expenses to total $1.75 billion next quarter. This include the initial expense base for National Penn and Swett & Crawford, plus $40 million to $50 million in merger-related costs. We expect cost savings to accelerate after the third quarter systems conversion of National Penn and the first quarter of 2017 conversion of Swett & Crawford. But in the second quarter, we may have a slight uptick in the efficiency ratio due to the timing of our acquisitions and delayed timing of related cost savings and synergies. We remain confident we will achieve cost savings related to both acquisitions. We expect efficiency to improve later in the year.
Turning to Slide 13. Capital ratios remained very health and fully phased-in common equity Tier 1 at 10.2%. Our LCR increased to 135%. And our liquid asset buffer at the end of the quarter was very strong at 14.5%.  We successfully issued $465 million of preferred stock at 5.625%, which strengthens our regulatory capital at a cost-effective way.  Our tangible book increased 2.7% this quarter. 
Finally, a comment on CCAR 2016. As Kelly mentioned, we expect to place greater priority in stock repurchases versus strategic initiatives. 
Now let's look at some segment results, beginning on Slide 14.
Community Bank's net income totaled $310 million, an increase of $38 million from last quarter and up $101 million from the first quarter of last year. Net interest income increased $64 million from the fourth quarter, with about 2/3 of the increase driven by Susquehanna.
Turning to Slide 15. Residential Mortgage net income totaled $39 million, down $10 million from last quarter, driven by seasonally lower production and lower servicing fee income. production mix was 55% purchased and 45% refi. 
Looking to Slide 16. The other Financial Services totaled $42 million, essentially flat as declines in segment net interest income was offset by lower loan processing expense. Regional Acceptance continues to generate stable loan growth with prudent underwriting discipline. This portfolio totals $3.3 billion, and losses have normalized to the 8% range. Net charge-offs for the prime portfolio remain excellent at 16 basis points.
Turning to Slide 17, specialized Lending net income totaled $56 million, down $7 million from last quarter, driven by lower commercial mortgage and leasing income and higher provision.
Turning to Slide 18. Insurance Services net income totaled $53 million, up $17 million from last quarter, mostly driven by a seasonal increase in employee benefits and higher property and casualty commissions, partially offset by seasonally lower life insurance commissions. We expect Swett & Crawford to add revenues of approximately $160 million for the remainder of this year, coupled with $140 million in expenses. In 2017, we will realize synergies from the deal that will drive improved operating margins going forward.
Turning to Slide 19. Financial Services segment had $26 million in net income, down $77 million from last quarter, largely driven by a provision increase of $92 million related to energy portfolio. Corporate Banking generated 15% loan growth, and wealth had 6% loan growth along with 29% transaction deposit growth.
In summary, for the quarter, we achieved improved efficiency, net interest margin expansion, positive operating leverage. we feel that we are set up to have a very strong second half of 2016. 
Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A."

So the rest of the cost saves will probably bleed into our run rate over the next couple of quarters or as Canadian banking area. That's where we stand there. As far as the 2 deals that just closed April 1, there's really no cost saves in those transactions. We expect National Penn have a systems conversion third quarter. So you might see a little bit in the third quarter, but more of that in the fourth quarter and first quarter. And Swett & Crawford, maybe a little bit of revenue synergies this year, but their systems conversion is the first part of '17. And their cost saves and efficiencies will come in from probably the first half of '17."

Ideally, to be honest, we wouldn't have done as many deals in the short period of time as we did.

And it's just my very strong intuitive judgment, collective team judgment, that it's time to focus on taking advantage of that we have. So sometimes, people think about M&A and all this as a kind of a linear sloping line. it's not. It's more like a stair step. You ramp up in terms of acquisitions. And that you take a period of time and you rationalize. And then you ramp up again. So we're in a latter part of the stair step where we're going to be focusing on rationalizing what we've invested. we think that's shareholder-friendly because if you just continually grow all of the time, you don't get any real payback until you stop growing and doing for a while, and that's not fair to the shareholders. So this is more about taking advantage of what we did in the last 1.5 years. We'll get that done, we'll be interested in M&A again. But for right now, we're focused on getting the advantages of what we've already done."

Overall, we had what I call a solid quarter with nice increase in net income and record net interest income. Net income was $527 million, up 8% versus the first quarter and 20% annualized versus the fourth, so a solid performance. Diluted EPS was $0.67, which was flat to the first quarter '15, but was up an annualized 18.9% versus the fourth quarter. 
GAAP ROA was 1.09%. GAAP ROTCE was 13.87%. And if you adjust for mergers charges only, adjusted ROA was 1.12% and adjusted return on tangible common was 14.2%. So solid returns there. 
In terms of revenues, we had strong revenue growth despite really some challenges in our mortgage banking income and service charges on deposits. So revenues totaled $2.6 billion, which was up 10.2% versus the first quarter and 4.2% annualized versus the fourth. 
We did have record net interest income, as I indicated, of $1.6 billion, up 16.4% versus the first and 6.8% annualized versus the fourth. Really happy about the fact net interest margin grew 3-point -- to 3.43%, up 8% or 8 basis points. And Daryl will you give more color on that. 
Had a nice -- small but nice, improvement in efficiency to 58.3% from 58.8%. Noninterest expenses were very well managed, decreased $52 million or 13.1% annualized, and we did have positive operating leverage. 
Our average loans were down slightly versus fourth quarter, but keep in mind, we continued to adjust our mix by letting our lower spread mortgage balances and sales finance portfolios decline. We are improving our profitability in those areas, so that strategy is working, but it's not just producing loan volume increases. Keep in mind, we also have runoff in our Susquehanna Hann portfolio, and we have a seasonal slower growth in a number of our specialized businesses. So average loans and leases for the quarter were $134.4 billion. And if you exclude our mortgage runoff and sales finance loans, our loans held for investment grew 2.2%, which is kind of the number that we look at. And that was led by a good performance in income-producing properties, direct retail, other lending subsidiaries on our dealer floor plan.
In terms of our strategic highlights, I would point out, we did convert Susquehanna in November. We've seen reductions in FTEs, other cost savings. Overall, it is going very well. 
We did complete our acquisition of National Penn on April 1. That -- we'll be converting that most likely in mid-July. That's going very well. Scott Fainor, the CEO of National Penn, is now the -- our Group President for our northern regions. He's off to a fast start. I feel really good about his leadership and the teams that we have in that area. 
We did complete our acquisition of Swett & Crawford on April 1. This is an outstanding company, 100-year-old company with a great brand. That's $200 million in revenue. Keep in mind, and this is a little complex, but last year very importantly from a strategic point of view, we sold American Coastal because it was outside our risk appetite. And now we've effectively completed that process by replacing it with Swett & Crawford. So we got the revenue back in a virtually no-risk basis. So that completes that transition, and we feel really good about it. The key now, of course, in insurance business, in particular, for Swett & Crawford, is to get cost savings and overall improvement in margins.
And now before I go through the rest of the points, I just want to make a few important key strategic points. 
So with regard to M&A, as I said, things are going well. After we announced National Penn, we said that we would take a pause. All of the deals that we have, we're really excited about. Texas, for example, where we acquired those branches from Citigroup, Ricky and I were down there a couple of weeks ago in Dallas and Houston. And we could not be more pleased in terms of how we're being received and how well things are going. And frankly, the overall Texas market is still very, very vibrant, notwithstanding the questions around energy. It's really an outstanding market of about 29 million people. It's growing 1,000 people a day. So it's a fantastic market. Really excited about what's going on in northern Kentucky and Cincinnati. Susquehanna, as I said, is off to a good start. National Penn is just getting started, but it has enormous opportunities of synergies with Susquehanna and in the overall revenue opportunities in Pennsylvania. 
So we feel overall really good about our merger strategy, but now is the time for us to focus on the enormous opportunities that we have to improve performance in the areas of investments that we have made for the last several years. So I want to be clear, our focus is not on strategic deals, but on improving our profitability through basically 2 areas, which is what you would expect, the expense management and revenue enhancement. In the expense management area, we will be focusing on the cost synergies in the Community Bank. Primarily, in the Pennsylvania area, we've done a lot in the rest of the Community Bank over the last few years, but there's still small opportunity, particularly in Pennsylvania. 
We have a really good opportunity to rationalize the huge investments we've made in the back room in terms of processes and procedures. We spent a fortune in the last several years building all that up. Now is the time to rationalize that. In terms of digital transformation, while we will be increasing our investment in digital transformation, there's also an opportunity to overall become more efficient as you link the front room and the back room. And that's what our recent executive management changes is designed to do. So we think that will be a combination revenue enhancement, expense reduction. And then, of course, there's huge opportunities for insurance integration, particularly in Swett & Crawford.
On the revenue side, we'll continue to get huge revenue enhancements from our Community Bank. The rate of momentum improvement there, particularly on our new markets, is exponential, so we feel very excited about that. We will continue really, really a strong performance in wealth, Corporate Banking, insurance and others. 
So given our intense focus on realizing new benefits from our previous strategic investments, our stock repurchases or buybacks move up in priority as we think about CCAR '16 versus strategic initiatives. I'd be happy to answer questions later with regard to that, but we wanted to make sure you are clear about where we are strategically. 
If you turn to Page 4, I'll just mention a couple of items that are unusual this quarter. We did have merger that was about $23 million or $0.02 negative effect on EPS. We did take security gains of about $45 million, which is a part of our strategy in terms of matching all security gains and credit issues. So that was a $0.04 positive. And then the energy-related provision in excess of charge-offs was $28 million or $0.02.
Now with regard to energy credits, the provision exceeded charge-offs by $30 million or $0.03, as I indicated. Daryl will give you a lot of detail on this, but I just want to point out that the charge that we took does reflect the new regulatory guidance and the recent SNC exam result. 
So while it's fairly possible that we do have some more energy negative, we do not expect that. We think we built a significant allowance, and we think we should expect our provision to be lower in the second quarter. So we feel, frankly, really good. It's a relatively small part of our whole portfolio, about 1.2%, but I know that's a big interest area. And Clarke will be glad to give more detail on that later, but we feel really good about that.
If you look at the loan area, we feel really good about loan growth relative to the economy. Just a couple of comments about the economy, it is what I would call good, but not great. It's okay. It's rocking along about like it's been rocking along, 2% to 2.5%. It will vary a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but we -- the United States economy is on a sustained 2% to 2.5% kind of growth pattern. It will stay that way, in my humble opinion, for a good while. 
We see no practical possibilities of recession, notwithstanding the fact there's been a lot of conversation about that. And the reason is because we think there is a very, very strong, solid pent-up need for continuing investment. When I talk to businesspeople, they are in investing in a way that I call a passive investment. That is to say, they're not excited enough about the future to go out and make major expansions and so forth, but they're driving trucks that have 250,000 miles on it. They got 10-year-old equipment, and so stuff just wears out. So that's why you have to keep investing. 
So that creates kind of a floor on the economy, in my view. There's an upside if we were to get better positive leadership out of D.C. and make some changes in taxes and regulation, et cetera. But assuming that's not going to take the place or case, we think there's a solid 2% to 2.5%. I would point out that I saw some numbers recently that suggested that most of our markets in the Mid-Atlantic Southeast will be growing 1 point to 1.5 points faster than the national average. So being in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast is still a good place to be. 
So we are so focused on, as I said, profitability in our portfolio. We believe profitable loan growth is more important than absolute loan growth. 
So just a little bit more detail with regard to the loan area. C&I loans were down slightly, mostly due to decline in commercial loans in the branch network and mortgage warehouse. On the other hand, end-of-period loans were better, with C&I up 2.5% annualized. Good news is C&I spreads are stable compared to last quarter. Growth is affected, but our strategies on specific growth in multifamily and REITs, so we continue to be pretty conservative. We're kind of expecting C&I to grow at a faster pace in the second quarter, probably in the mid-single digits. Daryl is going to give you a lot more color on energy, as I pointed out, but I'll just emphasize again that we have built our reserves and we're very confident that our exposures are manageable.
CRE growth was essentially flat with a decline in consortium and our growth in income-producing. So in income-producing, net increased 7% annualized. Feel really good about that, fastest growth coming from office, hospitality, and some small decline in retail. The good news is market fundamentals generally continued to improve, although spreads are still tight. We expect CRE construction and development to continue to decline somewhat in the second quarter, and IPP to grow in similar pace within the first quarter. 
Dealer floor plan had a very strong quarter, up $76 million or 26% annualized. That's been driven by expansion in our new markets and some new lines that we've introduced, so that's going very well. So floor plan is expected to continue to grow in the double digits for this year. 
Average direct retail lending is a bright spot for us, increasing $211 million or almost 8% annualized. A lot of that is HELOC and direct auto from the branches. Ricky and his team had really made a sea change in terms of our credit consumer production out of the branches. 
On the other hand, our wealth division continues to make a significant contribution in retail lending, really good production as they work closely together. So we expect the retail lending to continue to grow at a similar pace. 
Our average sales finance, primarily large prime auto, $484 million or 18%. That's a continuation of our execution of our flat-rate compensation program. That is going well. It does produce less volume, but it produces better margins. And so we feel really good about that. The lines will cross in terms of the old portfolio running off new portfolio soon, so that will stabilize. We do have a contingent runoff of the Hann portfolio for a bit longer. And so overall, we think once we get through the next quarter, so that portfolio will be kind of flattish and then it will start to grow. 
Average residential mortgage loans are down $470 million or 16% linked quarter annualized. So keep in mind, we continue to sell essentially all of our conforming production. And we think, again, that's in terms of overall quality management of the balance sheet. Originations in the quarter were $3.6 billion, about 2% more than the fourth. That was reflected in some seasonal improvement. And application volume, I was glad to see, increased 39% compared to the fourth, in total $6.9 billion. So we definitely see a bit of resurgence in new home purchases. Young people are back buying homes again, and that's a really good thing. Our margins on gain of sale improved about 9%, best level since the first quarter of '15. So looking forward, we believe this portfolio decline will slow and be at about flat for the year. 
Our other lending subsidiaries continue to do well. They grew $158 million or 5%, but keep in mind, that's a weak quarter for them. They'll be back stronger in the second. They did really good performance in Grandbridge and equipment financing. So we would expect a seasonally stronger other lending segment to accelerate in the second quarter because of seasonality. 
So overall, the average loans were -- are expected to be up 1% to 3% on a core basis next quarter. Obviously, with the impact of National Penn, growth will be closer to 20%. And I will point out that is real growth. Those are real assets, but we'd like to distinguish between organic and core growth. So average loans in the second quarter are expected to be about $141 billion.
So if you look at Slide 6, overall deposit program is going very well. Our deposit mix continues to improve. We continue to do a really good job managing our cost of interest-bearing deposits with costs going down -- up only 1 basis points even though we had the rate increase at the end of the year. So average total deposits increased $1.4 billion or 3.7% annualized. And that's a really good growth rate given our intense focus on managing our costs. 
So let me turn it to Daryl now for -- give a bit more color on some of the numbers."
19109,326126146,961257,"BB&T Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Truist Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margins, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. Turning to Slide 7. Overall credit quality outside the energy portfolio",1394,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margins, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. 
Turning to Slide 7. Overall credit quality outside the energy portfolio remains stable. Net charge-offs totaled $154 million or 46 basis points. Excluding energy-related losses at $30 million, net charge-offs improved from the prior quarter to 37 basis points. 
Loans 90 days or more past due declined $26 million, mostly driven by loans acquired from the FDIC, impaired loans and a decrease in residential mortgage. Loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased $205 million or 20%, mostly due to seasonality in Regional Acceptance as well as decreases in residential mortgage, sales finance, C&I and CRE. 
NPAs increased 27% to 42 basis points, driven by $206 million in energy-related credits moved to nonaccrual. If you exclude energy, NPAs totaled 33 basis points, a modest improvement compared to fourth quarter levels. We are about halfway through our spring redeterminations. We expect NPAs to remain in a similar range in the second quarter, assuming no unexpected impact from that process. We expect net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 basis points to 45 basis points. 
Continuing on Slide 8. Our energy portfolio consists of 100 clients with $1.6 billion in outstanding, consisting of 65% upstream, 27% midstream and 8% in support services. And the coal portfolio totals $215 million in outstandings. 
We take a very conservative approach to energy lending. We do not lend to offshore producers, mezzanine and second-lien facilities or take equity positions. During the quarter, we fully implemented the regulatory guidance from the SNC exam. The allocated reserves totaled 8.5%, and 44% of the energy portfolio was criticized and classified. It's important to note today, all borrowers are paying consistent with their agreements. As a result, we believe our energy portfolio is manageable.
Turning to Slide 9. Our allowance coverage ratios remain strong at 2.4x for net charge-offs and 1.89x for NPLs. The allowance-to-loans ratio improved to 1.10% compared to 1.07% last quarter. Excluding the acquired portfolios, the allowance-to-loan ratio is 1.17%, so our effective allowance coverage is higher. Remember, our acquired loans have a combined mark of about $636 million. 
We recorded a provision of $184 million for the quarter compared to net charge-offs of $154 million. This includes $30 million in net charge-offs related to the energy portfolio and an additional provision of $30 million to build the allowance to 8.5%. Looking forward, our provision is expected to match net charge-offs plus loan growth. We believe that the provision will be much lower than this quarter's numbers, assuming no large deterioration in credit quality.
Turning to Slide 10. Compared to last quarter, net interest margin was 3.43%, up 8 basis points, and core margin was 3.18%, up 6 basis points. The margin increase resulted from a seasonal interest income on assets related to postemployment benefits, duration adjustments on acquired securities, and higher repricing of variable rate assets combined with stable deposit rates. 
Looking at the second quarter, assuming no Fed rate increases, we expect GAAP margin to decline a few basis points driven by the runoff of PCI loans and the loss of a positive seasonal impact of interest income on benefit plans, offset by National Penn. We expect core margin to remain relatively stable. Asset sensitivity remains relatively unchanged. We continue to forecast only one interest rate hike this year happening in November.
Continuing on Slide 11. Noninterest income totaled $1 billion, relatively flat compared to last quarter. The fee income ratio was 40.6%. Looking at a few of those components, insurance income increased $39 million or 41% annualized, mostly due to seasonal factors, higher employee benefit and property/casualty commissions, offset by lower life insurance commissions. Remember, our first quarter of last year included earnings of American Coastal, a business we sold last May. Excluding acquisitions, insurance income grew 1.9% versus last year. 
Mortgage banking income totaled $91 million, down $13 million mostly due to lower commercial mortgage production. Other income decreased $58 million due to a $43 million decrease in income related to assets of certain postemployment benefits and $14 million decline in client derivative income. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter, including both acquisitions, our total noninterest income is expected to increase 9% to 11% versus second quarter GAAP of $1.016 billion.
Turning to Slide 12, noninterest expenses totaled $1.5 billion, down 13% versus last quarter. Personnel expense increased $22 million, driven by a $34 million increase in Social Security and unemployment factors as well as equity-based compensation for retirement-eligible associates and a $10 million increase in higher pension expense, offset by $30 million decrease in post-employment benefits expense. 
Average FTEs declined 311. Merger-related and restructuring charges declined $27 million, mostly due to Susquehanna conversion costs. In addition, other expense decreased $34 million mostly due to lower operating charge-offs and charitable contributions. Our effective tax rate was 30%, and we expect second quarter effective tax rate to be about 31%. 
We expect expenses to total $1.75 billion next quarter. This will include the initial expense base for National Penn and Swett & Crawford, plus $40 million to $50 million in merger-related costs. We expect cost savings to accelerate after the third quarter systems conversion of National Penn and the first quarter 2017 conversion of Swett & Crawford. But in the second quarter, we may have a slight uptick in the efficiency ratio due to the timing of our acquisitions and the delayed timing of related cost savings and synergies. We remain confident we will achieve cost savings related to both acquisitions. We expect efficiency to improve later in the year.
Turning to Slide 13. Capital ratios remain very health and fully phased-in. Common equity Tier 1 at 10.2%. Our LCR increased to 135%. And our liquid asset buffer at the end of the quarter was very strong at 14.5%.  We successfully issued $465 million in preferred stock at 5.625%, which strengthens our regulatory capital in a cost-effective way. Our tangible book increased 2.7% this quarter. 
Finally, a comment on CCAR 2016. As Kelly mentioned, we expect to place greater priority on stock repurchases versus strategic initiatives. 
Now let's look at some segment results, beginning on Slide 14.
Community Bank's net income totaled $310 million, an increase of $38 million from last quarter and up $101 million from the first quarter of last year. Net interest income increased $64 million from the fourth quarter, with about 2/3 of the increase driven by Susquehanna.
Turning to Slide 15. Residential mortgage net income totaled $39 million, down $10 million from last quarter, driven by seasonally lower production and lower servicing fee income. production mix was 55% purchased and 45% refi. 
Looking to Slide 16. Dealer Financial Services income totaled $42 million, essentially flat as declines in segment net interest income were substantially offset by lower loan processing expense. Regional Acceptance continues to generate stable loan growth with prudent underwriting discipline. This portfolio totals $3.3 billion, and losses have normalized to the 8% range. Net charge-offs for the prime portfolio remained excellent at 16 basis points.
Turning to Slide 17, Specialized Lending net income totaled $56 million, down $7 million from last quarter, driven by lower commercial mortgage and leasing income and higher provision.
Turning to Slide 18. Insurance Services net income totaled $53 million, up $17 million from last quarter, mostly driven by a seasonal increase in employee benefits and higher property and casualty commissions, partially offset by seasonally lower life insurance commissions. We expect Swett & Crawford to add revenues of approximately $160 million for the remainder of this year, coupled with $140 million in expenses. In 2017, we will realize synergies from the deal that will drive improved operating margins going forward.
Turning to Slide 19. Financial Services segment had $26 million in net income, down $77 million from last quarter, largely driven by a provision increase of $92 million related to the energy portfolio. Corporate Banking generated 15% loan growth, and wealth had 6% loan growth along with 29% transaction deposit growth.
In summary, for the quarter, we achieved improved efficiency, net interest margin expansion, positive operating leverage. And we feel that we are set up to have a very strong second half of 2016. 
Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A."

From Susquehanna's perspectives, we are probably 85% to 90% through the cost saves from that. So the rest of the cost saves will probably bleed in into our run rate over the next couple of quarters or out of the Community Bank area. But that's where we stand there. As far as the 2 deals that we just closed April 1, there's really no cost saves in those transactions. We expect National Penn had systems conversion third quarter. So you might see a little bit third quarter, but more of that in fourth quarter and first quarter. And Swett & Crawford, maybe a little bit on revenue synergies this year, but their systems conversion is the first part of '17, and their cost saves and efficiencies will come in probably in the first half of '17."

And then the regulatory guidance is very explicit around, you have to make sure that you have sufficient cash flow coverage and asset coverage for the total debt, including the secondary debt. And obviously with the plunge in prices that nobody could have predicted, it puts enormous pressure on those ratios. So that's really the big sea change.

So we're in a -- its latter part of the stair step where we're going to be focusing on rationalizing what we've already invested in.

Our prime portfolio today is about 16 basis points, not 19 and is relatively stable quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year. So what we -- while it's very manageable, Regional Acceptance had experienced some higher loss severities, lower -- they primarily finance economy cars. If you look at Manheim over the last year or 18 months, that class of vehicles has been hit a little harder. We've adjusted for that over the last year or so. And we are actually forecasting, notwithstanding the view of car prices over the next -- remainder of the year, we expect the losses to be down more in the 7% range or so by the end of the year at Regional."

Overall, we had what I call a solid quarter with nice increase in net income and record net interest income. Net income was $527 million, up 8% versus the first quarter and 20% annualized versus the fourth; so a solid performance. Diluted EPS was $0.67, which was flat to the first quarter '15, but was up an annualized 18.9% versus the fourth quarter. 
GAAP ROA was 1.09%. GAAP ROTCE was 13.87%. And if you adjust for mergers charges only, adjusted ROA was 1.12% and adjusted return on tangible common was 14.2%; so solid returns there. 
In terms of revenues, we had strong revenue growth despite really some challenges in mortgage banking income and service charges on deposits. So revenues totaled $2.6 billion, which was up 10.2% versus the first quarter and 4.2% annualized versus the fourth. 
We did have record net interest income, as I indicated, of $1.6 billion, up 16.4% versus the first and 6.8% annualized versus the fourth. Really happy about the fact net interest margin grew 3-point -- to 3.43%, up 8% or 8 basis points. And Daryl will you give more color on that. 
Had a nice -- small but nice, improvement in efficiency to 58.3% from 58.8%. non-interest expenses were very well managed; decreased $52 million or 13.1% annualized. And we did have positive operating leverage. 
Our average loans were down slightly versus fourth quarter. But keep in mind, we continued to adjust our mix by letting our lower spread mortgage balances and sales finance portfolios decline. We are improving our profitability in those areas, so that strategy is working, but it's not just producing loan volume increases. Keep in mind, we also have runoff in our Susquehanna Hann portfolio, and we have a seasonal slower growth in a number of our specialized businesses. So average loans and leases for the quarter were $134.4 billion. And if you exclude mortgage runoff and sales finance runoff, loans held for investment grew 2.2%, which is kind of the number that we look at. And that was led by good performance in income-producing properties, direct retail, other lending subsidiaries and our dealer floor plan.
In terms of our strategic highlights, I would point out, we did convert Susquehanna in November. We've seen reductions in FTEs, other cost savings. Overall, it is going very well. 
We did complete our acquisition of National Penn on April 1. That -- we'll be converting that most likely in mid-July. That's going very well. Scott Fainor, the CEO of National Penn, is now the -- our Group President for our northern regions. He's off to a fast start. I feel really good about his leadership and the teams that we have in that area. 
We did complete our acquisition of Swett & Crawford on April 1. This is an outstanding company, 100-year-old company with a great brand. That's $200 million in revenue. Keep in mind, and this is a little complex, but last year very importantly from a strategic point of view, we sold American Coastal because it was outside our risk appetite. And now we've effectively completed that process by replacing it with Swett & Crawford. So we got the revenue back and in a virtually no-risk basis. So that completes that transition, and we feel really good about it. The key now, of course, in insurance business, in particular, for Swett & Crawford, is to get cost savings and overall improvement in margins.
And now before I go through the rest of the points, I just want to make a few important key strategic points. 
So with regard to M&A, as I said, things are going well. After we announced National Penn, we said that we would take a pause. All of the deals that we have, we're really excited about. Texas, for example, where we acquired those branches from Citigroup; Ricky and I were down there a couple of weeks ago in Dallas and Houston, and we could not be more pleased in terms of how we're being received and how well things are going. And frankly, the overall Texas market is still very, very vibrant, notwithstanding the questions around energy. It's continuing really an outstanding market of about 29 million people. It's growing 1,000 people a day. So it's a fantastic market. Really excited about what's going on in northern Kentucky and Cincinnati. Susquehanna, as I said, is off to a good start. National Penn is just getting started, but it has enormous opportunities of synergies with Susquehanna and in the overall revenue opportunities in Pennsylvania. 
So we feel overall really good about our merger strategy, but now is the time for us to focus on the enormous opportunities that we have to improve performance in the areas of investments that we have made for the last several years. So I want to be clear, our focus is not on strategic deals, but on improving our profitability through basically 2 areas, which is what you would expect, the expense management and revenue enhancement. In the expense management area, we will be focusing on the cost synergies in the Community Bank. Primarily, in the Pennsylvania area, we've done a lot in the rest of the Community Bank over the last few years, but there's still some opportunity, particularly in Pennsylvania. 
We have a really good opportunity to rationalize the huge investments we've made in the back room in terms of processes and procedures. We've spent a fortune in the last several years building all that up. Now is the time to rationalize that. In terms of digital transformation, while we will be increasing our investment in digital transformation, there's also an opportunity to overall become more efficient as you link the front room and the back room. And that's what our recent executive management changes is designed to do. So we think that will be a combination revenue enhancement, expense reduction. And then, of course, there's huge opportunities for insurance integration, particularly in Swett & Crawford.
On the revenue side, we'll continue to get huge revenue enhancements from our Community Bank. The rate of momentum improvement there, particularly on our new markets, is exponential, so we feel very excited about that. We will continue really, really a strong performance in wealth, Corporate Banking, insurance and others. 
So given our intense focus on realizing new benefits from our previous strategic investments, our stock repurchases or buybacks move up in priority as we think about CCAR '16 versus strategic initiatives. I'd be happy to answer questions later with regard to that, but we wanted to be sure you are clear about where we are strategically. 
If you turn to Page 4, I'll just mention a couple of items that are unusual this quarter. We did have mergers [ph]; that was about $23 million or $0.02 negative effect on EPS. We did take security gains of about $45 million; which is a part of our strategy in terms of matching all security gains and credit issues; so that was a $0.04 positive. And then the energy-related provision in excess of charge-offs was $28 million or $0.02.
Now with regard to energy credits, the provision exceeded charge-offs by $30 million or $0.03, as I indicated. Daryl will give you a lot of detail on this, but I just want to point out that the charge that we took does reflect the new regulatory guidance and the recent SNC exam results.
So while it's fairly possible that we do have some more energy negative, we do not expect that. We think we built a significant allowance, and we think we should expect our provision to be lower in the second quarter. So we feel, frankly, really good. It's a relatively small part of our whole portfolio, about 1.2%, but I know that's a big interest area. And Clarke will be glad to give more detail on that later, but we feel really good about that.
If you look at the loan area, we feel really good about loan growth relative to the economy. Just a couple of comments about the economy, it is what I would call good, but not great. It's okay. It's rocking along about like it's been rocking along, 2% to 2.5%. It will vary a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but we -- the United States economy is on a sustained 2% to 2.5% kind of growth pattern. It will stay that way, in my humble opinion, for a good while. 
We see no practical possibilities of recession, notwithstanding the fact there's been a lot of conversation about that. And the reason is because we think there is a very, very strong, solid pent-up need for continuing investment. When I talk to businesspeople, they are in investing in a way that I call passive investment. That is to say, they're not excited enough about the future to go out and make major expansions and so forth, but they're driving trucks that have 250,000 miles on it. They got 10-year-old equipment, and so stuff just wears out. So that's why you have to keep investing. 
So that creates kind of a floor on the economy, in my view. There's an upside if we were to get better positive leadership out of D.C. and make some changes in taxes and regulation, et cetera. But assuming that's not going to take the place -- case, we think there's a solid 2% to 2.5%. I would point out that I saw some numbers recently that suggested that most of our markets in the Mid-Atlantic Southeast will be growing 1 point, 1.5 points faster than the national average. So being in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast is still a good place to be. 
So we are focusing on, as I said, profitability in our portfolio. We believe profitable loan growth is more important than absolute loan growth. 
So just a little bit more detail with regard to the loan area. C&I loans were down slightly, mostly due to decline in commercial loans in the branch network and mortgage warehouse. On the other hand, end-of-period loans were better, with C&I up 2.5% annualized. Good news is C&I spreads are stable compared to last quarter. Growth is affected by our strategies of restricted growth in multifamily and REITs, so we continue to be pretty conservative. We're kind of expecting C&I to grow at a faster pace in the second quarter, probably in the mid-single digits. Daryl is going to give you a lot more color on energy, as I pointed out, but I'll just emphasize again that we have built our reserves and we're very confident that our exposures are manageable.
CRE growth was essentially flat with a decline in consortium and our growth in income-producing. So in income-producing: It increased 7% annualized; feel really good about that; fastest growth coming from office, hospitality, and some small decline in retail. The good news there: Market fundamentals generally continued to improve, although spreads are still tight. We expect CRE construction and development to continue to decline somewhat in the second quarter, and IPP to grow at a similar pace as in the first quarter. 
Dealer floor plan had a very strong quarter, up $76 million or 26% annualized. That's been driven by expansion in our new markets and some new lines that we've introduced, so that's going very well. So floor plan is expected to continue to grow in the double digits for this year. 
Average direct retail lending is a bright spot for us, increasing $211 million or almost 8% annualized. A lot of that is HELOC and direct auto from the branches. Ricky and his team have really made a sea change in terms of our credit consumer production out of the branches. 
On the other hand, our wealth division continues to make a significant contribution in retail lending, really good production as they work closely together. So we expect the retail lending to continue to grow at a similar pace. 
Our average sales finance, primarily large prime auto declined $484 million or 18%. That's a continuation of our execution of our flat-rate compensation program. That is going well. It does produce less volume, but it produces better margins. And so we feel really good about that. The lines will cross in terms of the old portfolio running off new portfolio soon, so that will stabilize. We do have a contingent runoff of the Hann portfolio for a bit longer. And so overall, we think once we get through the next quarter or so that portfolio will be kind of flattish and then it will start to grow. 
Average residential mortgage loans are down $470 million or 16% linked quarter annualized. So keep in mind, we continue to sell essentially all of our conforming production. And we think, again, that's in terms of overall quality management of the balance sheet. Originations in the quarter were $3.6 billion, about 2% more than the fourth. That was reflected in some seasonal improvement. And application volume, I was glad to see, increased 39% compared to the fourth, in total $6.9 billion. So we're definitely seeing a bit of resurgence in new home purchases. Young people are back buying homes again, and that's a really good thing. Our margins on gain of sale improved about 9%, best level since the first quarter of '15. So looking forward, we believe this portfolio decline will slow and be at about flat for the year. 
Our other lending subsidiaries continue to do well. They grew $158 million or 5%, but keep in mind, that's a weak quarter for them. They'll be back stronger in the second. They did really good performance in Grandbridge and equipment financing. So we would expect a seasonally stronger other lending segment to accelerate in the second quarter because of seasonality. 
So overall, the average loans were -- are expected to be up 1% to 3% on a core basis next quarter. Obviously, with the impact of National Penn, growth will be closer to 20%. And I will point out that is real growth. Those are real assets, but we like to distinguish between organic and core growth. So average loans in the second quarter are expected to be about $141 billion.
So if you look at Slide 6, overall deposit program is going very well. Our deposit mix continues to improve. We continue to do a really good job managing our cost of interest-bearing deposits with costs going on -- up only 1 basis point even though we had the rate increase at the end of the year. So average total deposits increased $1.4 billion or 3.7% annualized. And that's a really good growth rate given our intense focus on managing our costs. 
So let me turn it to Daryl now for -- give a bit more color on some of the numbers."

Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margins, fee income, non-interest expense, capital and our segment results. Turning to Slide 7. Overall credit quality outside the energy portfolio",1394,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margins, fee income, non-interest expense, capital and our segment results. 
Turning to Slide 7. Overall credit quality outside the energy portfolio remains stable. Net charge-offs totaled $154 million or 46 basis points. Excluding energy-related losses of $30 million, net charge-offs improved from the prior quarter to 37 basis points. 
Loans 90 days or more past due declined $26 million, mostly driven by loans acquired from the FDIC, impaired loans and a decrease in residential mortgage. Loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased $205 million or 20%, mostly due to seasonality in Regional Acceptance as well as decreases in residential mortgage, sales finance, C&I and CRE. 
NPAs increased 27% to 42 basis points, driven by $206 million in energy-related credits moved to nonaccrual. If you exclude energy, NPAs totaled 33 basis points, a modest improvement compared to fourth quarter levels. We are about halfway through our spring redeterminations. We expect NPAs to remain in a similar range in the second quarter, assuming no unexpected impact from that process. We expect net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 basis points to 45 basis points. 
Continuing on Slide 8. Our energy portfolio consists of 100 clients with $1.6 billion in outstandings, consisting of 65% upstream, 27% midstream and 8% in support services. And the coal portfolio totals $215 million in outstandings. 
We take a very conservative approach to energy lending. We do not lend to offshore producers, mezzanine and second-lien facilities or take equity positions. During the quarter, we fully implemented the regulatory guidance from the SNC exam. The allocated reserves totaled 8.5%, and 44% of the energy portfolio was criticized and classified. It's important to note today, all borrowers are paying consistent with their agreements. As a result, we believe our energy portfolio is manageable.
Turning to Slide 9. Our allowance coverage ratios remain strong at 2.4x for net charge-offs and 1.89x for NPLs. The allowance-to-loans ratio improved to 1.10% compared to 1.07% last quarter. Excluding the acquired portfolios, the allowance-to-loan ratio is 1.17%, so our effective allowance coverage is higher. Remember, our acquired loans have a combined mark of about $636 million. 
We recorded a provision of $184 million for the quarter compared to net charge-offs of $154 million. This includes $30 million in net charge-offs related to the energy portfolio and an additional provision of $30 million to build the allowance to 8.5%. Looking forward, our provision is expected to match net charge-offs plus loan growth. We believe that the provision will be much lower than this quarter's numbers, assuming no large deterioration in credit quality.
Turning to Slide 10. Compared to last quarter, net interest margin was 3.43%, up 8 basis points, and core margin was 3.18%, up 6 basis points. The margin increase resulted from a seasonal interest income on assets related to post-employment benefits, duration adjustments on acquired securities, and higher repricing of variable rate assets combined with stable deposit rates. 
Looking at the second quarter, assuming no Fed rate increases, we expect GAAP margin to decline a few basis points driven by the runoff of PCI loans and the loss of a positive seasonal impact of interest income on benefit plans, offset by National Penn. We expect core margin to remain relatively stable. Asset sensitivity remained relatively unchanged. We continue to forecast only one interest rate hike this year happening in November.
Continuing on Slide 11. Non-interest income totaled $1 billion, relatively flat compared to last quarter. The fee income ratio was 40.6%. Looking at a few of those components, insurance income increased $39 million or 41% annualized, mostly due to seasonal factors, higher employee benefit and property/casualty commissions, offset by lower life insurance commissions. Remember, our first quarter of last year included earnings of American Coastal, a business we sold last May. Excluding acquisitions, insurance income grew 1.9% versus last year. 
Mortgage banking income totaled $91 million, down $13 million mostly due to lower commercial mortgage production. Other income decreased $58 million due to a $43 million decrease in income related to assets of certain post-employment benefits and $14 million decline in client derivative income. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter, including both acquisitions, our total non-interest income is expected to increase 9% to 11% versus second quarter GAAP of $1.016 billion.
Turning to Slide 12, non-interest expenses totaled $1.5 billion, down 13% versus last quarter. Personnel expense increased $22 million, driven by a $34 million increase in Social Security and unemployment factors as well as equity-based compensation for retirement-eligible associates and a $10 million increase in higher pension expense, offset by $30 million decrease in post-employment benefits expense. 
Average FTEs declined 311. Merger-related and restructuring charges declined $27 million, mostly due to Susquehanna conversion costs. In addition, other expense decreased $34 million mostly due to lower operating charge-offs and charitable contributions. Our effective tax rate was 30%, and we expect second quarter effective tax rate to be about 31%. 
We expect expenses to total $1.75 billion next quarter. This will include the initial expense base for National Penn and Swett & Crawford, plus $40 million to $50 million in merger-related costs. We expect cost savings to accelerate after the third quarter systems conversion of National Penn and the first quarter 2017 conversion of Swett & Crawford. But in the second quarter, we may have a slight uptick in the efficiency ratio due to the timing of our acquisitions and the delayed timing of related cost savings and synergies. We remain confident we will achieve cost savings related to both acquisitions. We expect efficiency to improve later in the year.
Turning to Slide 13. Capital ratios remain very healthy and fully phased-in; common equity Tier 1 at 10.2%, our LCR increased to 135%, and our liquid asset buffer at the end of the quarter was very strong at 14.5%.  We successfully issued $465 million in preferred stock at 5.625%, which strengthens our regulatory capital in a cost-effective way. Our tangible book increased 2.7% this quarter. 
Finally, a comment on CCAR 2016. As Kelly mentioned, we expect to place greater priority on stock repurchases versus strategic initiatives. 
Now let's look at some segment results, beginning on Slide 14.
Community Bank's net income totaled $310 million, an increase of $38 million from last quarter and up $101 million from the first quarter of last year. Net interest income increased $64 million from the fourth quarter, with about 2/3 of the increase driven by Susquehanna.
Turning to Slide 15. Residential mortgage net income totaled $39 million, down $10 million from last quarter, driven by seasonally lower production and lower servicing fee income. Production mix was 55% purchased and 45% refi. 
Looking to Slide 16. Dealer Financial Services income totaled $42 million, essentially flat as declines in segment net interest income were substantially offset by lower loan processing expense. Regional Acceptance continues to generate stable loan growth with prudent underwriting discipline. This portfolio totals $3.3 billion, and losses have normalized to the 8% range. Net charge-offs for the prime portfolio remained excellent at 16 basis points.
Turning to Slide 17, Specialized Lending net income totaled $56 million, down $7 million from last quarter, driven by lower commercial mortgage and leasing income and higher provision.
Turning to Slide 18. Insurance Services net income totaled $53 million, up $17 million from last quarter, mostly driven by a seasonal increase in employee benefits and higher property and casualty commissions, partially offset by seasonally lower life insurance commissions. We expect Swett & Crawford to add revenues of approximately $160 million for the remainder of this year, coupled with $140 million in expenses. In 2017, we will realize synergies from the deal that will drive improved operating margins going forward.
Turning to Slide 19. Financial Services segment had $26 million in net income, down $77 million from last quarter, largely driven by a provision increase of $92 million related to the energy portfolio. Corporate Banking generated 15% loan growth, and wealth had 6% loan growth along with 29% transaction deposit growth.
In summary, for the quarter, we achieved improved efficiency, net interest margin expansion, positive operating leverage. And we feel that we are set up to have a very strong second half of 2016. 
Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A."

So the rest of the cost saves will probably bleed in into our run rate over the next couple of quarters or as a Community Bank area. But that's where we stand there. As far as the 2 deals that we just closed April 1, there's really no cost saves in those transactions. We expect National Penn had systems conversion third quarter. So you might see a little bit third quarter, but more of that in fourth quarter and first quarter. And Swett & Crawford, maybe a little bit on revenue synergies this year, but their systems conversion is the first part of '17, and their cost saves and efficiencies will come in probably in the first half of '17."

What's happened with this boom in the shale production with this cycle is you have a lot more secondary bond financing behind the bank group. And then the regulatory guidance is very explicit around -- you have to make sure that you have sufficient cash flow coverage and asset coverage for the total debt, including the secondary debt. And obviously with the plunge in prices that nobody could have predicted, it puts enormous pressure on those ratios. So that's really the big sea change.

So if your interest rates go down, then your net interest -- non-interest rate then goes up as a percentage. But on a normalized basis, I'm pretty comfortable with our non-interest income anywhere in the 40% or 42%, 43% kind of level. Right now -- so you've got -- recently you had the net interest income being down, which would drive ratio up. On the other hand, insurance is not at the level that it would be relatively because of the pace of business, and so that would affect it. And the temporary impact has been the removal of American Coastal last year, which of course will come right back now when we add Swett & Crawford. So it's not a change Gerard, from a long-term point of view at all, it will be right back where we want it to be at 42%, 43%.

Ideally, to be honest, we wouldn't have done as many deals in a short period of time as we did. It's just, they were available, and you can't -- I wish you could, but you can't ideally lay out your M&A plans on a linear basis and project them whenever you want to have them. They come when they come, and you take advantage of them when they're there. So we got -- we took a bit more in the last 1.5 years at one time than I personally would like to have. And so -- and you combine that with all of the other activities we have going on which is huge investments in the back room in terms of systems and processes and so forth. And it's just my very strong intuitive judgment, our collective team's judgment that it's just time to focus on taking advantage of what we have. So sometimes, people think about M&A and all this as a kind of a linear upward sloping line, it's not. It's more like a stair step. You ramp up in terms of acquisitions, then you take a period of time and you rationalize them and then you ramp up again. So we're in a -- its latter part of the stair step where we're going to be focusing on rationalizing what we've already invested in. We think that's shareholder-friendly because if you just continually roll that all the time, you never get any real payback until you stop growing -- doing M&A for a little while, and that's not fair to the shareholders. So this is more about taking advantage of what we did in the last 1.5 years. When we get that done, we'll be interested in M&A again.

Net income was $527 million, up 8% versu",2490,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everybody, and thank you very much for taking time to join our call. 
Overall, we had what I call a solid quarter with nice increase in net income and record net interest income. Net income was $527 million, up 8% versus the first quarter and 20% annualized versus the fourth; so a solid performance. Diluted EPS was $0.67, which was flat to the first quarter '15, but was up an annualized 18.9% versus the fourth quarter. 
GAAP ROA was 1.09%. GAAP ROTCE was 13.87%. And if you adjust for mergers charges only, adjusted ROA was 1.12% and adjusted return on tangible common was 14.2%; so solid returns there. 
In terms of revenues, we had strong revenue growth despite really some challenges in mortgage banking income and service charges on deposits. So revenues totaled $2.6 billion, which was up 10.2% versus the first quarter and 4.2% annualized versus the fourth. 
We did have record net interest income, as I indicated, of $1.6 billion, up 16.4% versus the first and 6.8% annualized versus the fourth. Really happy about the fact net interest margin grew 3-point -- to 3.43%, up 8% or 8 basis points. And Daryl will you give more color on that. 
Had a nice -- small but nice, improvement in efficiency to 58.3% from 58.8%. Noninterest expenses were very well managed; decreased $52 million or 13.1% annualized. And we did have positive operating leverage. 
Our average loans were down slightly versus fourth quarter. But keep in mind, we continued to adjust our mix by letting our lower spread mortgage balances and sales finance portfolios decline. We are improving our profitability in those areas, so that strategy is working, but it's not just producing loan volume increases. Keep in mind, we also have runoff in our Susquehanna Hann portfolio, and we have a seasonal slower growth in a number of our specialized businesses. So average loans and leases for the quarter were $134.4 billion. And if you exclude mortgage runoff and sales finance runoff, loans held for investment grew 2.2%, which is kind of the number that we look at. And that was led by good performance in income-producing properties, direct retail, other lending subsidiaries and our dealer floor plan.
In terms of our strategic highlights, I would point out, we did convert Susquehanna in November. We've seen reductions in FTEs, other cost savings. Overall, it is going very well. 
We did complete our acquisition of National Penn on April 1. That -- we'll be converting that most likely in mid-July. That's going very well. Scott Fainor, the CEO of National Penn, is now the -- our Group President for our northern regions. He's off to a fast start. I feel really good about his leadership and the teams that we have in that area. 
We did complete our acquisition of Swett & Crawford on April 1. This is an outstanding company, 100-year-old company with a great brand. That's $200 million in revenue. Keep in mind, and this is a little complex, but last year very importantly from a strategic point of view, we sold American Coastal because it was outside our risk appetite. And now we've effectively completed that process by replacing it with Swett & Crawford. So we got the revenue back and in a virtually no-risk basis. So that completes that transition, and we feel really good about it. The key now, of course, in insurance business, in particular, for Swett & Crawford, is to get cost savings and overall improvement in margins.
And now before I go through the rest of the points, I just want to make a few important key strategic points. 
So with regard to M&A, as I said, things are going well. After we announced National Penn, we said that we would take a pause. All of the deals that we have, we're really excited about. Texas, for example, where we acquired those branches from Citigroup; Ricky and I were down there a couple of weeks ago in Dallas and Houston, and we could not be more pleased in terms of how we're being received and how well things are going. And frankly, the overall Texas market is still very, very vibrant, notwithstanding the questions around energy. It's continuing really an outstanding market of about 29 million people. It's growing 1,000 people a day. So it's a fantastic market. Really excited about what's going on in northern Kentucky and Cincinnati. Susquehanna, as I said, is off to a good start. National Penn is just getting started, but it has enormous opportunities of synergies with Susquehanna and in the overall revenue opportunities in Pennsylvania. 
So we feel overall really good about our merger strategy, but now is the time for us to focus on the enormous opportunities that we have to improve performance in the areas of investments that we have made for the last several years. So I want to be clear, our focus is not on strategic deals, but on improving our profitability through basically 2 areas, which is what you would expect, the expense management and revenue enhancement. In the expense management area, we will be focusing on the cost synergies in the Community Bank. Primarily, in the Pennsylvania area, we've done a lot in the rest of the Community Bank over the last few years, but there's still some opportunity, particularly in Pennsylvania. 
We have a really good opportunity to rationalize the huge investments we've made in the back room in terms of processes and procedures. We've spent a fortune in the last several years building all that up. Now is the time to rationalize that. In terms of digital transformation, while we will be increasing our investment in digital transformation, there's also an opportunity to overall become more efficient as you link the front room and the back room. And that's what our recent executive management changes is designed to do. So we think that will be a combination revenue enhancement, expense reduction. And then, of course, there's huge opportunities for insurance integration, particularly in Swett & Crawford.
On the revenue side, we'll continue to get huge revenue enhancements from our Community Bank. The rate of momentum improvement there, particularly on our new markets, is exponential, so we feel very excited about that. We will continue really, really a strong performance in wealth, Corporate Banking, insurance and others. 
So given our intense focus on realizing new benefits from our previous strategic investments, our stock repurchases or buybacks move up in priority as we think about CCAR '16 versus strategic initiatives. I'd be happy to answer questions later with regard to that, but we wanted to be sure you are clear about where we are strategically. 
If you turn to Page 4, I'll just mention a couple of items that are unusual this quarter. We did have mergers [ph]; that was about $23 million or $0.02 negative effect on EPS. We did take security gains of about $45 million; which is a part of our strategy in terms of matching all security gains and credit issues; so that was a $0.04 positive. And then the energy-related provision in excess of charge-offs was $28 million or $0.02.
Now with regard to energy credits, the provision exceeded charge-offs by $30 million or $0.03, as I indicated. Daryl will give you a lot of detail on this, but I just want to point out that the charge that we took does reflect the new regulatory guidance and the recent SNC exam results.
So while it's fairly possible that we do have some more energy negative, we do not expect that. We think we built a significant allowance, and we think we should expect our provision to be lower in the second quarter. So we feel, frankly, really good. It's a relatively small part of our whole portfolio, about 1.2%, but I know that's a big interest area. And Clarke will be glad to give more detail on that later, but we feel really good about that.
If you look at the loan area, we feel really good about loan growth relative to the economy. Just a couple of comments about the economy, it is what I would call good, but not great. It's okay. It's rocking along about like it's been rocking along, 2% to 2.5%. It will vary a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but we -- the United States economy is on a sustained 2% to 2.5% kind of growth pattern. It will stay that way, in my humble opinion, for a good while. 
We see no practical possibilities of recession, notwithstanding the fact there's been a lot of conversation about that. And the reason is because we think there is a very, very strong, solid pent-up need for continuing investment. When I talk to businesspeople, they are in investing in a way that I call passive investment. That is to say, they're not excited enough about the future to go out and make major expansions and so forth, but they're driving trucks that have 250,000 miles on it. They got 10-year-old equipment, and so stuff just wears out. So that's why you have to keep investing. 
So that creates kind of a floor on the economy, in my view. There's an upside if we were to get better positive leadership out of D.C. and make some changes in taxes and regulation, et cetera. But assuming that's not going to take the place -- case, we think there's a solid 2% to 2.5%. I would point out that I saw some numbers recently that suggested that most of our markets in the Mid-Atlantic Southeast will be growing 1 point, 1.5 points faster than the national average. So being in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast is still a good place to be. 
So we are focusing on, as I said, profitability in our portfolio. We believe profitable loan growth is more important than absolute loan growth. 
So just a little bit more detail with regard to the loan area. C&I loans were down slightly, mostly due to decline in commercial loans in the branch network and mortgage warehouse. On the other hand, end-of-period loans were better, with C&I up 2.5% annualized. Good news is C&I spreads are stable compared to last quarter. Growth is affected by our strategies of restricted growth in multifamily and REITs, so we continue to be pretty conservative. We're kind of expecting C&I to grow at a faster pace in the second quarter, probably in the mid-single digits. Daryl is going to give you a lot more color on energy, as I pointed out, but I'll just emphasize again that we have built our reserves and we're very confident that our exposures are manageable.
CRE growth was essentially flat with a decline in consortium and our growth in income-producing. So in income-producing: It increased 7% annualized; feel really good about that; fastest growth coming from office, hospitality, and some small decline in retail. The good news there: Market fundamentals generally continued to improve, although spreads are still tight. We expect CRE construction and development to continue to decline somewhat in the second quarter, and IPP to grow at a similar pace as in the first quarter. 
Dealer floor plan had a very strong quarter, up $76 million or 26% annualized. That's been driven by expansion in our new markets and some new lines that we've introduced, so that's going very well. So floor plan is expected to continue to grow in the double digits for this year. 
Average direct retail lending is a bright spot for us, increasing $211 million or almost 8% annualized. A lot of that is HELOC and direct auto from the branches. Ricky and his team have really made a sea change in terms of our credit consumer production out of the branches. 
On the other hand, our wealth division continues to make a significant contribution in retail lending, really good production as they work closely together. So we expect the retail lending to continue to grow at a similar pace. 
Our average sales finance, primarily large prime auto declined $484 million or 18%. That's a continuation of our execution of our flat-rate compensation program. That is going well. It does produce less volume, but it produces better margins. And so we feel really good about that. The lines will cross in terms of the old portfolio running off new portfolio soon, so that will stabilize. We do have a contingent runoff of the Hann portfolio for a bit longer. And so overall, we think once we get through the next quarter or so that portfolio will be kind of flattish and then it will start to grow. 
Average residential mortgage loans are down $470 million or 16% linked quarter annualized. So keep in mind, we continue to sell essentially all of our conforming production. And we think, again, that's in terms of overall quality management of the balance sheet. Originations in the quarter were $3.6 billion, about 2% more than the fourth. That was reflected in some seasonal improvement. And application volume, I was glad to see, increased 39% compared to the fourth, in total $6.9 billion. So we're definitely seeing a bit of resurgence in new home purchases. Young people are back buying homes again, and that's a really good thing. Our margins on gain of sale improved about 9%, best level since the first quarter of '15. So looking forward, we believe this portfolio decline will slow and be at about flat for the year. 
Our other lending subsidiaries continue to do well. They grew $158 million or 5%, but keep in mind, that's a weak quarter for them. They'll be back stronger in the second. They did really good performance in Grandbridge and equipment financing. So we would expect a seasonally stronger other lending segment to accelerate in the second quarter because of seasonality. 
So overall, the average loans were -- are expected to be up 1% to 3% on a core basis next quarter. Obviously, with the impact of National Penn, growth will be closer to 20%. And I will point out that is real growth. Those are real assets, but we like to distinguish between organic and core growth. So average loans in the second quarter are expected to be about $141 billion.
So if you look at Slide 6, overall deposit program is going very well. Our deposit mix continues to improve. We continue to do a really good job managing our cost of interest-bearing deposits with costs going on -- up only 1 basis point even though we had the rate increase at the end of the year. So average total deposits increased $1.4 billion or 3.7% annualized. And that's a really good growth rate given our intense focus on managing our costs. 
So let me turn it to Daryl now for -- give a bit more color on some of the numbers."

Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margins, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. Turning to Slide 7. Overall credit quality outside the energy portfolio",1394,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margins, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. 
Turning to Slide 7. Overall credit quality outside the energy portfolio remains stable. Net charge-offs totaled $154 million or 46 basis points. Excluding energy-related losses of $30 million, net charge-offs improved from the prior quarter to 37 basis points. 
Loans 90 days or more past due declined $26 million, mostly driven by loans acquired from the FDIC, impaired loans and a decrease in residential mortgage. Loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased $205 million or 20%, mostly due to seasonality in Regional Acceptance as well as decreases in residential mortgage, sales finance, C&I and CRE. 
NPAs increased 27% to 42 basis points, driven by $206 million in energy-related credits moved to nonaccrual. If you exclude energy, NPAs totaled 33 basis points, a modest improvement compared to fourth quarter levels. We are about halfway through our spring redeterminations. We expect NPAs to remain in a similar range in the second quarter, assuming no unexpected impact from that process. We expect net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 basis points to 45 basis points. 
Continuing on Slide 8. Our energy portfolio consists of 100 clients with $1.6 billion in outstandings, consisting of 65% upstream, 27% midstream and 8% in support services. And the coal portfolio totals $215 million in outstandings. 
We take a very conservative approach to energy lending. We do not lend to offshore producers, mezzanine and second-lien facilities or take equity positions. During the quarter, we fully implemented the regulatory guidance from the SNC exam. The allocated reserves totaled 8.5%, and 44% of the energy portfolio was criticized and classified. It's important to note today, all borrowers are paying consistent with their agreements. As a result, we believe our energy portfolio is manageable.
Turning to Slide 9. Our allowance coverage ratios remain strong at 2.4x for net charge-offs and 1.89x for NPLs. The allowance-to-loans ratio improved to 1.10% compared to 1.07% last quarter. Excluding the acquired portfolios, the allowance-to-loan ratio is 1.17%, so our effective allowance coverage is higher. Remember, our acquired loans have a combined mark of about $636 million. 
We recorded a provision of $184 million for the quarter compared to net charge-offs of $154 million. This includes $30 million in net charge-offs related to the energy portfolio and an additional provision of $30 million to build the allowance to 8.5%. Looking forward, our provision is expected to match net charge-offs plus loan growth. We believe that the provision will be much lower than this quarter's numbers, assuming no large deterioration in credit quality.
Turning to Slide 10. Compared to last quarter, net interest margin was 3.43%, up 8 basis points, and core margin was 3.18%, up 6 basis points. The margin increase resulted from a seasonal interest income on assets related to post-employment benefits, duration adjustments on acquired securities, and higher repricing of variable rate assets combined with stable deposit rates. 
Looking at the second quarter, assuming no Fed rate increases, we expect GAAP margin to decline a few basis points driven by the runoff of PCI loans and the loss of a positive seasonal impact of interest income on benefit plans, offset by National Penn. We expect core margin to remain relatively stable. Asset sensitivity remained relatively unchanged. We continue to forecast only one interest rate hike this year happening in November.
Continuing on Slide 11. Noninterest income totaled $1 billion, relatively flat compared to last quarter. The fee income ratio was 40.6%. Looking at a few of those components, insurance income increased $39 million or 41% annualized, mostly due to seasonal factors, higher employee benefit and property/casualty commissions, offset by lower life insurance commissions. Remember, our first quarter of last year included earnings of American Coastal, a business we sold last May. Excluding acquisitions, insurance income grew 1.9% versus last year. 
Mortgage banking income totaled $91 million, down $13 million mostly due to lower commercial mortgage production. Other income decreased $58 million due to a $43 million decrease in income related to assets of certain post-employment benefits and $14 million decline in client derivative income. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter, including both acquisitions, our total noninterest income is expected to increase 9% to 11% versus second quarter GAAP of $1.016 billion.
Turning to Slide 12, noninterest expenses totaled $1.5 billion, down 13% versus last quarter. Personnel expense increased $22 million, driven by a $34 million increase in Social Security and unemployment factors as well as equity-based compensation for retirement-eligible associates and a $10 million increase in higher pension expense, offset by $30 million decrease in post-employment benefits expense. 
Average FTEs declined 311. Merger-related and restructuring charges declined $27 million, mostly due to Susquehanna conversion costs. In addition, other expense decreased $34 million mostly due to lower operating charge-offs and charitable contributions. Our effective tax rate was 30%, and we expect second quarter effective tax rate to be about 31%. 
We expect expenses to total $1.75 billion next quarter. This will include the initial expense base for National Penn and Swett & Crawford, plus $40 million to $50 million in merger-related costs. We expect cost savings to accelerate after the third quarter systems conversion of National Penn and the first quarter 2017 conversion of Swett & Crawford. But in the second quarter, we may have a slight uptick in the efficiency ratio due to the timing of our acquisitions and the delayed timing of related cost savings and synergies. We remain confident we will achieve cost savings related to both acquisitions. We expect efficiency to improve later in the year.
Turning to Slide 13. Capital ratios remain very healthy and fully phased-in; common equity Tier 1 at 10.2%, our LCR increased to 135%, and our liquid asset buffer at the end of the quarter was very strong at 14.5%.  We successfully issued $465 million in preferred stock at 5.625%, which strengthens our regulatory capital in a cost-effective way. Our tangible book increased 2.7% this quarter. 
Finally, a comment on CCAR 2016. As Kelly mentioned, we expect to place greater priority on stock repurchases versus strategic initiatives. 
Now let's look at some segment results, beginning on Slide 14.
Community Bank's net income totaled $310 million, an increase of $38 million from last quarter and up $101 million from the first quarter of last year. Net interest income increased $64 million from the fourth quarter, with about 2/3 of the increase driven by Susquehanna.
Turning to Slide 15. Residential mortgage net income totaled $39 million, down $10 million from last quarter, driven by seasonally lower production and lower servicing fee income. Production mix was 55% purchased and 45% refi. 
Looking to Slide 16. Dealer Financial Services income totaled $42 million, essentially flat as declines in segment net interest income were substantially offset by lower loan processing expense. Regional Acceptance continues to generate stable loan growth with prudent underwriting discipline. This portfolio totals $3.3 billion, and losses have normalized to the 8% range. Net charge-offs for the prime portfolio remained excellent at 16 basis points.
Turning to Slide 17, Specialized Lending net income totaled $56 million, down $7 million from last quarter, driven by lower commercial mortgage and leasing income and higher provision.
Turning to Slide 18. Insurance Services net income totaled $53 million, up $17 million from last quarter, mostly driven by a seasonal increase in employee benefits and higher property and casualty commissions, partially offset by seasonally lower life insurance commissions. We expect Swett & Crawford to add revenues of approximately $160 million for the remainder of this year, coupled with $140 million in expenses. In 2017, we will realize synergies from the deal that will drive improved operating margins going forward.
Turning to Slide 19. Financial Services segment had $26 million in net income, down $77 million from last quarter, largely driven by a provision increase of $92 million related to the energy portfolio. Corporate Banking generated 15% loan growth, and wealth had 6% loan growth along with 29% transaction deposit growth.
In summary, for the quarter, we achieved improved efficiency, net interest margin expansion, positive operating leverage. And we feel that we are set up to have a very strong second half of 2016. 
Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A."

So the rest of the cost saves will probably bleed in into our run rate over the next couple of quarters or as a Community Bank area. But that's where we stand there. As far as the 2 deals that we just closed April 1, there's really no cost saves in those transactions. We expect National Penn had systems conversion third quarter. So you might see a little bit third quarter, but more of that in fourth quarter and first quarter. And Swett & Crawford, maybe a little bit on revenue synergies this year, but their systems conversion is the first part of '17, and their cost saves and efficiencies will come in probably in the first half of '17."

And then the regulatory guidance is very explicit around -- you have to make sure that you have sufficient cash flow coverage and asset coverage for the total debt, including the secondary debt. And obviously with the plunge in prices that nobody could have predicted, it puts enormous pressure on those ratios. So that's really the big sea change.

Ideally, to be honest, we wouldn't have done as many deals in a short period of time as we did. It's just, they were available, and you can't -- I wish you could, but you can't ideally lay out your M&A plans on a linear basis and project them whenever you want to have them. They come when they come, and you take advantage of them when they're there. So we got -- we took a bit more in the last 1.5 years at one time than I personally would like to have. And so -- and you combine that with all of the other activities we have going on which is huge investments in the back room in terms of systems and processes and so forth. And it's just my very strong intuitive judgment, our collective team's judgment that it's just time to focus on taking advantage of what we have. So sometimes, people think about M&A and all this as a kind of a linear upward sloping line, it's not. It's more like a stair step. You ramp up in terms of acquisitions, then you take a period of time and you rationalize them and then you ramp up again. So we're in a -- its latter part of the stair step where we're going to be focusing on rationalizing what we've already invested in. We think that's shareholder-friendly because if you just continually roll that all the time, you never get any real payback until you stop growing -- doing M&A for a little while, and that's not fair to the shareholders. So this is more about taking advantage of what we did in the last 1.5 years. When we get that done, we'll be interested in M&A again. But for right now, we're focused on getting the advantages of what we've already done."

Net income totaled $541 millio",1596,"Thanks, Alan and good morning, everybody and thanks for your interest in BB&T. We always appreciate you joining our call. 
So we had a very strong quarter from an organic performance perspective and a strategic perspective. Net income totaled $541 million, up 19.2% versus the second quarter of '15 and 10.7% versus first quarter '16. If you look at diluted EPS, it totaled $0.66, up from $0.62 on a like quarter but down $0.01 from the first quarter but that was due high merger-related and restructuring charges in this quarter as you would expect. Adjusted diluted EPS totaled $0.71, excluding merger-related and restructuring charges and the benefits from the special tax advanced asset, which I'll talk -- I'll cover in a minute. 
GAAP ROA was a strong 1.06% and return on tangible common was a 14.33%. And if you make the adjustments, we alluded to, our ROA adjusted would be 1.16% and adjusted return on tangible would be 15.76%, which is very good. 
For the record, FTE revenues totaled $2.8 billion, up 17.7% versus the second quarter of '15, 31% versus first quarter. Obviously, that was driven by 2 acquisitions in this quarter. We had record net interest income of $1.7 billion, which was up 22.9% versus the second -- 22.8% versus the first of '16. Margin did decline 2 basis points in line with what we projected and Daryl will give you a little color on that in a little bit. 
Efficiency was 59.3% compared to 59.2% in the second of '15 and 58.3% in the first of '16. It was up a bit but we had guided because we knew that timing of the acquisitions were related to the conversions cost savings would impact. 
Noninterest expense has increased $250 million versus the first quarter of '16, but that was led by the impact of National Penn, Swett & Crawford and the merger-related and restructuring charges. If ex out these items, we hit the number that we ha d projected and again, Daryl will give you more color on that when we go forward. 
Average loans and leases held investment totaled $141 billion in the second quarter, was an increase of 20.2% versus the first quarter. And if you exclude the impact of National Penn, growth was still a solid 2.6%. 
We do continue to have runoff in our residential mortgage portfolio by design and our prime other portfolio because of our design and structural change due to very strategic region position relative to the cost and the spreads in each one of these segments. If you exclude residential mortgage loans and National Penn, average loans held for investment grew a very respectable 4.7%, which, frankly, in an economy growing 2% to 2.5% is about right what we would expect to have happened. 
Loan quality is great. Net charge-offs were 0.28%, lowest levels since 2006. 
We did not an objection to our FRB CCAR plans. So as you see, we post a 7.1% increase in the quarterly dividend, $640 million in share repurchases. So if you recall over the years, we've said very clearly that our priorities would grow out [ph] our capital this position is number one, organic growth; number two, dividends; number three, M&A; and number four, buybacks. So we've also said when things change and the priorities change. So today, organic growth is somewhat slower. We are increasing our dividend at a a very nice rate. M&A is off the table for now, so buyback rise up to the higher level of importance and that's exactly what we have said. It's exactly what we plan to do. 
We did complete the conversion of National Penn just last week and it's going absolutely, absolutely great. We could not be more pleased about that. 
Yes, we're very, very excited about all of our acquisitions over the last 18 months, and we're really, really focused on an execution on the profit improvement that will come from them but we continue to not to be [indiscernible] M&A for a while as we said, we've got plenty to do and frankly, we owe it to our shareholders to execute on what we've already done. And that's what we are doing. 
If you're following on the slides, look at the Slide 4 in your deck, this is what I've related to before. So our margin-related restructuring charges were higher than we had expected, it's $92 million pretax and $58 million after-tax, which was $0.07 on a diluted EPS basis. Now that $92 million was made of $63 million on merger charges from Nat Penn, Susquehanna, Swett & Crawford. $29 million was in restructuring charges, which is including severance, [indiscernible] facility restructuring and other real estate write-downs. All of these will improve our run rate going forward. And so while that $92 million, is higher, the truth is we just [indiscernible] opportunities than we had expected to accelerate write-downs and therefore, make it easy to do asset dispositions and also reduce FTEs where we have to take some severance [indiscernible] going forward. So it's a good news story, it's a little higher, but it was powerful, very, very good reason. 
I do want to reinforce that we are intensely focused on expenses. We've been focusing for a number of years as you've heard me describe about reconceptualization of our business. That continues, but I would say to you, it continues at a much more intense rate. The economy is relatively slow. We project a relatively low flat yield curve for a period of time. And as a result, we are accelerating our focus on expense reductions. We still do it from a kind of top-down, bottom-up perspective focusing on allowing our people to help figure out the best way to restructure their businesses versus us trying to [indiscernible] and make the decision. We think that's just a better way. Our people are excited about the [indiscernible] and I think that we'll get really, really good results from that. 
If you're following along on Slide 5, just a couple of comments on the loan area. It was a really good quarter with regard to loans. Our average loans again, excluding Nat Penn, increased 2.6% primarily due to strong growth in C&I and CRE IPP. Now C&I on a linked-quarter basis was 9.4%, which was very, very strong and CRE IPP was 4.3%. So we feel very, very good about that. 
So if you exclude the residential mortgage rundown, which is by strategic design and Nat Penn, we had an annualized growth rate of 4.7%, which I frankly feel very, very good about. 
We did have our typical very strong seasonal performance in a number of our consumer-related businesses like Sheffield, which was up 33%; dealer floor plan was up 21%; premium finance, up 12%; and Regional Acceptance, up 11.2%. So those, remember, are our very good diversifying businesses and are performing very, very well; very, very good quality; and very, very good profitability. 
So looking forward, we expect about the same kind of loan growth in the third quarter as we had in the second, about 1 to 3. And there's just some dramatic change in the economy that what we would expect. 
Speaking of economy, we think the economy is okay, still growing about 2% to 2.5%. But it's interesting 6 months as we came out of the first of the year when everybody thought the world was coming on an end with changes in China and so forth. And then it settled down, net mortgage [indiscernible] got really, really excited about Brexit. We think the Brexit change is serious, but it's been over exaggerated in terms of its impact on the world and certainly on us. Our exports to the entire European Union is relatively small and it's just not going to have a material impact on us and probably not going to have a material impact on the world once the dust settles. 
And also as the political uncertainty wanes, we think businesses will have more confidence like confidence has been withholding back investment for several years, the way things seems to be developing on the political front. It looks like, I think, the business community will feel pretty good and certainly they'll feel more confident going forward. And they do need to invest but [indiscernible] a lot of active investments for the last several years and I think you're likely to see that as we head into '17. Nonetheless, we are planning on a continuation of the same, slow economy, 2% to 2.5%, low rates. If we get higher rates and more confidence, more investments, that's just good but that that's not what we are planning on in terms of running our businesses. 
If you look quickly at Slide 6, we continue to improve our mix and lower our overall deposit costs. Our total deposits had $160 billion, that was an increase of $10 billion, obviously, merger-related. If you exclude acquisitions, total deposits increased $3.9 billion, still a very strong 10.5%. And what I'm particularly pleased about is our mix improvement where our noninterest-bearing deposits, ex acquisitions, increased $1.4 billion or 12.1%, which is really, really strong. And we reduced our total cost to funds on deposits by another 2 basis points, which is really, really good down to 0.23%. So our deposit machine is working great. Our loan machine is working solid. And as Daryl will report to you, our overall fee income businesses and our expense management is really hitting on all cylinders. 
So let me turn now to Daryl for some more commentary."

Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. Turning to Slide 7. Overall, we had a really strong quarter with regard t",1424,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. 
Turning to Slide 7. Overall, we had a really strong quarter with regard to credit quality. Net charge-offs totaled $97 million or 28 basis points, a decrease from 46 basis points last quarter. this is our lowest charge-off rates since 2006. We restated loans for 90 days or more past due because of our Gennie Mae buyback program. Given this change, loans 90 days past due were essentially flat from last quarter. Loans 30 to 89 days past due increased $89 million or 10.8%, mostly due to seasonality in our consumer-related portfolios. 
NPAs decreased 1.9% to 40 basis points with the majority of the loan portfolio showing improvement. If you look at the graph, excluding energy, NPAs have improved steadily in recent quarters. In the third quarter, we expect NPAs to remain at a similar range and net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 to 45 basis points, assuming no unexpected deterioration in the economy. 
Continuing on Slide 8. We had a stable and quiet quarter in our oil and gas portfolio, with lower nonaccruals and substantially lower charge-offs compared with last quarter. The balances decreased 6% and we will continue to have a good mix with less than 10% in oil field services. 
Our reserve coverage for oil and gas has risen to 9.3% and the coverage for coal, a very modest portfolio, has risen to 9.7%. Following the spring redeterminations, we reduced our average commitments. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our allowance coverage ratios remained strong at 3.88x for net charge-offs and 1.9x for NPLs. The allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.06% compared to 1.11% last quarter. Excluding the acquired portfolios, the allowance-to-loan ratio is 1.16%, so our effective allowance coverage is strong. 
Remember, our acquired loans have a combined mark of about $750 million. We recorded a provision of $111 million compared to net charge-offs of $97 million. Looking forward, our provision is expected to match charge-offs, plus loan growth. 
Turning to Slide 10. Compared to last quarter, net interest margin was 3.41%, down 2 basis points. Core margin was 3.16%, also down 2 basis points. Net interest margin decreased resulting from lower interest rate environment and higher security balances as a result of National Penn. 
Looking into the third quarter, we expect GAAP margin to decline a few basis points driven by lower rate, including a flatter yield curve and a reduction in benefits from purchase accounting. We expect core margin to remain relatively stable as lower rates will be offset by asset mix and funding costs and mix changes. We do not anticipate average earning assets to remain relatively stable next quarter. 
Asset sensitivity increased primarily due to changes in pre funds as well as investments in deposit mix changes. 
Continuing on Slide 11. Noninterest income totaled $1.1 billion, up $114 million compared to last quarter. The fee income ratio improved to 42.8%. 
Looking at a few of the changes in noninterest income. Insurance income increased $46 million driven by several factors. First, the acquisition of Swett & Crawford, which added $57 million in the second quarter. We also had $34 million seasonal increase in property/casualty commissions and a $13 million increase in other insurance revenues. This was offset by a seasonal decline in employee benefit commissions of $36 million and a decrease of $23 million, which is mostly due to lower bonus commissions. Excluding acquisitions, insurance income grew about 1% versus the same quarter last year. 
Mortgage banking income totaled $111 million, up $20 million, mostly due to higher gains on sale an increase in salable residential loan volume and seasonally higher commercial mortgage income. The other income increased $65 million due to a $65 million increase in income related to certain cost employment benefits. Looking ahead to the third quarter, total fee income is expected to be relatively flat due to a seasonal decrease in insurance revenues. 
Turning to Slide 12. Noninterest expenses totaled $1.8 billion, up $252 million versus last quarter. Personnel expense increased $124 million, driven by several factors. First, we had a $44 million increase in salary expense mostly due to the addition of approximately 1,900 FTEs from recent acquisitions. We also had a $40 million increase in postemployment benefits expense and a $36 million increase in incentives. This was due to the acquisition of  Swett & Crawford and higher overall volume. Excluding acquisitions, FTEs were lower by 276. 
Merger-related and restructuring charges increased $69 million. We also had $29 million in restructuring charges related to severance and real estate write-downs. In addition, other expense increased $33 million, mostly due to operating charge-offs, charitable contributions and travel expense. Our effective tax rate was 30%, slightly below expectations due to the tax benefits this quarter. We expect the third quarter effective tax rate to be about 31%. 
Going forward, our expenses will be -- will include an $11 million quarterly increase with the FDIC insurance premiums. Even with this increase, we expect expenses to decline 1% to 2%, mostly due to cost saves from recent acquisitions, excluding merger-related and restructuring charges. We are still targeting to generate positive operating leverage in the second half of 2016. 
Turning to Slide 13. Capital ratios remain very healthy with a fully phased-in common equity Tier 1 of 9.8%. Our LCR was 135% and our liquid asset buffer at the end of the quarter was very strong at 13.7%. 
Finally, we were pleased to receive an objection to our capital plan. As a result, we will seek board approval to increase our quarterly dividend $0.30 per quarter and initiate a share repurchase program in the third quarter, repurchasing up to $160 million of our shares.
Now let's look at segments beginning on Slide 14.  Before I walk through the Community Banking segment, I would note that National Penn is not included. Now that the conversion is complete, those results will become part of a segment recording next quarter. 
Net income totaled $294 million, a decrease of $7 million from last quarter and up $63 million from second quarter of last year. Net interest income increased $5 million from the first quarter and $188 million for the second quarter of 2015. A little more than half of the increase was driven by Susquehanna. 
Turning to Slide 15. Residential mortgage banking net income totaled $44 million, up $5 million from last quarter, driven by higher gains on residential mortgage loan production and sales. Production mix was 57% purchased and 43% refi, similar to last quarter. 
Looking to Slide 16. Dealer Financial Services totaled $51 million, up $9 million, mostly due to lower charge-offs and regional acceptance. Our subprime auto portfolio totals $3.4 billion and losses totaled 6% in the quarter, a significant improvement. Net charge-offs for the prime portfolio remained excellent at 15 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 17. Specialized Lending net income totaled $61 million, up $5 million from last quarter. This was driven mostly by loan and production growth in both Sheffield and equipment finance, as well as good strong production in Grandbridge, our commercial mortgage business. 
Looking at Slide 18. Insurance Services net income totaled $44 million, down $9 million from last quarter. Noninterest income totaled $465 million, up $44 million, mostly driven by the addition of Swett & Crawford and higher fee and commissions, partially offset by seasonally lower employment benefit commissions. Noninterest expense increased $58 million, mostly due to Swett & Crawford. Going forward, we will continue to focus on achieving both cost savings and revenue synergies from Swett & Crawford acquisition. 
Turning to Slide 19. Financial Services segment had $87 million in net income, up $60 million from last quarter. This was a largely driven by a provision decrease of $84 million related to charge-offs and increased reserves in the energy portfolio last quarter. 
Corporate Banking generated 24% loan growth and wealth had 14% loan and 16% transaction deposit growth. 
In summary, for the quarter, we achieved excellent credit quality, a relatively stable net interest margin, a successful restructuring of some of our corporate real estate and as Kelly mentioned earlier, successful conversion of National Penn. We are working hard to achieve synergies and efficiencies from our merger partners. With a steady outlook for loan growth and tight controls on our core expenses, we are set up to have a strong second half of 2016. 
Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing thoughts and Q&A."

We're now heading into the period of time over the next year or so as that will crest and then we'll begin to get the benefits on a relative basis. 2 counts of benefits. One, will be, you'll see relatively less expenses forward versus what we just invested in the previous periods.

Pre-crises, we and the other good banks were operating at about 15%. You've got to start from kind of the top. The way I think about is there's about 2% kind of run off at the top called the higher capital. And then you've got about 1% to 1.5%, which is just the environment and economy, margins, et cetera. And then, the difference really is in the regulatory costs and some type of logical costs. So from the capital point of view, we're going to continue to try to manage our capital efficiently, but it's going to stay high compared to past periods. So that 2%, at least, in the short run, is kind of nonretrievable. But that gives you the [indiscernible] 13. So the 1% to 1.5% in terms of economy, obviously, can come back and come back quickly depending on the growth rates in the economy and the margins. We're not counting on that, but I personally think the flat rate scenario that everybody's projecting is overstated. The underlying strength of our economy is not good, but it's good. I said, I believe, clearly, knows they need to raise rates and I think they will the minutes they see a window, which can still easily happen at least one rate increase towards the fall. And then the whole thing about regulatory and technological cost is about becoming efficient, scale is a part of that and then, [indiscernible] settle in that we have to put into place. And then finally, Gerard, I would say, this is a brave New World. You can't run a bank today that way you did 5, 10, 15 years ago. Everything has to be reconceptualized. We have a very intense focus right now on looking at our businesses and here's kind of how our best people to approach it. I'm saying go back 20 years ago when things were pretty good and take a look at and what our structure was then and examine anything today that we're doing that we weren't doing 20 years ago. If it's something that we are doing that we are absolutely required to do by our regulation, then obviously, we have no choice. If it's something that has the [indiscernible] or creep into the structure, which can happen when times are fairly good, then it is suspect. And so we're going to examine every one of those in terms of the economic productivity and I suspect that we will find material changes. So we will be restructuring the business. We already have a number of things underway, I'm not quite ready to announce it this morning, but we have a number of things that we're working on, not going to be any big, grand announcements, not going to be any big announced cost-saving plan, that's not our style. But you could count on the fact that we are laser-focused on running our businesses as efficiently and getting those returns up. I frankly think in the bottom line, Gerard, that this material change in that is over the next couple of years, I certainly think we'll be in the 10% range over the next couple of years [indiscernible] in cost of capital, I don't have any concerns about that. From 10 to 12 and 13 is more difficult, as I described, and somewhat circumstantial based on what's going on in the world but we will be in that top tier of the performing banks based on the then existing circumstances."

But remember that it is a ratio and so we have a lot of visibility in terms of the numerator. But if we don't have as much visibility in terms of the denominator, that is revenues. Obviously, if we did nothing today with our expenses and the economy got better margins, got better efficiency ratios, it goes down. I mean, you wouldn't give us any credit for that but that's what would happen. Conversely, if you have a period where revenues go down, maybe you're doing a great job on expenses, then efficiency ratios go up, you're going to blame us for that. So I think that efficiency ratio is taken out of context. Having said that, we think we are generally on a downward trajectory with regard to the efficiency ratio. We're just not will be able to give you exactly what is quarter-by-quarter. We think for the rest of this year and into next year, it will be down. An immediate term, I'll call that 2- to 3-year once we get into the 56% to 57% range, assuming reasonableness with regard to revenues, which I think will happen. And that will be very good. That will be a top-performing level of efficiency. We're not trying to drive expenses, so low that we put revenues at risk. And so I'm very, very confident about our ability to execute on a very efficient organization. And I think that will show up as a very slow but methodical decline in the efficiency ratio."

Good morning, everybody, and thanks for your interest in BB&T. We always appreciate you joining our call. So we had a very strong quarter from an organic performance perspective and a strategic perspective. Net income totaled $541 million,",1606,"Thanks, Alan. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for your interest in BB&T. We always appreciate you joining our call. 
So we had a very strong quarter from an organic performance perspective and a strategic perspective. Net income totaled $541 million, up 19.2% versus the second quarter '15 and 10.7% versus first quarter '16. If you look at diluted EPS, it totaled $0.66, up from $0.62 on a like quarter but down $0.01 from the first quarter. But that was due high merger-related and restructuring charges in this quarter, as you would expect. Adjusted diluted EPS totaled $0.71, excluding merger-related and restructuring charges and the benefits from the special tax-advantaged asset, which I'll talk -- cover in a minute. 
GAAP ROA was a strong 1.06% and return on tangible common was 14.33%. Now if you make the adjustments we alluded to, our ROA adjusted would be 1.16% and adjusted return on tangible would be 15.76%, which is very good. 
For the record, FTE revenues totaled $2.8 billion, up 17.7% versus second quarter '15, 31% versus first quarter. Obviously, that was driven by 2 acquisitions in this quarter. We had a record net interest income of $1.7 billion, which was up 22.9% versus the second -- 22.8% versus the first of '16. Margin did decline 2 basis points in line with what we projected, and Daryl will give you a little color on that in a little bit. 
Efficiency was 59.3% compared to 59.2% in the second of '15 and 58.3% in the first of '16. It was up a bit but we had guided you to that because we knew the timing of the acquisitions-related conversions and cost savings would impact. 
Noninterest expense has increased $250 million versus the first quarter of '16, but that was led by the impact of National Penn, Swett & Crawford and the merger-related and restructuring charges. If ex out these items, we'd hit the number we had projected. And again, Daryl will give you more color on that when we go forward. 
Average loans and leases held for investment totaled $141 billion in the second quarter. It was an increase of 20.2% versus the first quarter. And if you exclude the impact of National Penn, growth was still a solid 2.6%. 
We do continue to have runoff in our residential mortgage portfolio by design, and our prime auto portfolio because of our design and structural change due to very strategic position relative to the cost and the spreads in each one of these segments. If you exclude residential mortgage loans and National Penn, average loans held for investment grew a very respectable 4.7%, which frankly, in an economy growing 2% to 2.5% is about right, what we would expect to have happened. Loan quality is great. Net charge-offs were 0.28%, lowest level since 2006. 
We did not get an objection to our FRB CCAR plan. So as you've seen, we propose a 7.1% increase in the quarterly dividend, $640 million in share repurchases. So if you recall over the years, we've said very clearly that our priorities with regard to capital disposition is: number one, organic growth; number two, dividend; number three, M&A; and number four, buyback. So we've also said when things changed, then the priorities change. So today, organic growth is somewhat slower. We are increasing our dividend at a very nice rate. M&A is off the table for now, so buyback rise up to the higher level of importance. And that's exactly what we had said, exactly what we plan to do. 
We did complete the conversion of National Penn just last week, and it's going absolutely, absolutely great. We could not be more pleased about that. 
We're very, very excited about all of our acquisitions over the last 18 months, and we're really, really focused on execution on the profit improvement that will come from them. But we continue to not to be interested in M&A for a while as we've said. We've got plenty to do and frankly, we owe it to our shareholders to execute on what we've already done. And that's what we are doing. 
If you're following on the slides, look at the Slide 4 in your deck. This is what I've related to you before. So our margin-related restructuring charges were higher than we had expected. It's $92 million pretax and $58 million after tax, which was $0.07 on a diluted EPS basis. Now that $92 million was made up of $63 million on merger charges from Nat Penn, Susquehanna and Swett & Crawford. $29 million was in restructuring charges, which is including severance, branch and facility restructuring and other real estate write-downs. All of these will improve our run rate going forward. And so while that $92 million is higher, the truth is we just simply found more opportunities than we had expected to accelerate write-downs and, therefore, make it easy to do asset dispositions and also reduce FTEs where we had to take some severance, but they help us going forward. So it's a good news story. It's a little higher, but it was powerful, very, very good reason. 
I do want to reinforce that we are intensely focused on expenses. We've been focusing for a number of years, as you've heard me describe, about reconceptualization of our business. That continues, but I would say to you, it continues at a much more intense rate. The economy is relatively slow. We project a relatively low, flat yield curve for a period of time. And as a result, we are accelerating our focus on expense reductions. We still do it from a kind of top-down, bottom-up perspective, focusing on allowing our people to help figure out the best way to restructure their businesses versus us trying to sit in our offices and make the decision. We think that's just a better way. Our people are excited about the endeavor and, I think that we'll get really, really good results from that. 
You following along on Slide 5. Just a couple of comments on the -- in loan area. It was a really good quarter with regard to loans. Our average loans, again, excluding Nat Penn, increased 2.6% primarily due to strong growth in C&I and CRE IPP. Our C&I on a linked-quarter basis was 9.4%, which was very, very strong, and CRE IPP was 4.3%. So we feel very, very good about that. So if you exclude the residential mortgage rundown, which is by strategic design and Nat Penn, we had an annualized growth rate of 4.7%, which I frankly feel very, very good about. 
We did have our typical very strong seasonal performance in a number of our consumer-related businesses, like Sheffield, which was up 33%; dealer floor plan was up 21%; premium finance, up 12%; and Regional Acceptance, up 11.2%. So those, remember, are our very good diversifying businesses and they're performing very, very well; very, very good quality; and very, very good profitability. 
So looking forward, we expect about the same kind of loan growth in the third quarter as we had in the second, about 1% to 3%. Unless there's some dramatic change in the economy, that's what we would expect. 
Speaking of the economy, we think the economy is okay, still growing about 2% to 2.5%. Been an interesting 6 months as we came out of the first of the year, when everybody thought the world was coming to an end with changes in China and so forth. And then it settled down. Now more recently, everybody's gotten really, really excited about Brexit. We think the Brexit change is serious, but has been almost exaggerated in terms of its impact on the world and certainly on us. Our exports to the entire European Union is relatively small and it's just not going to have a material impact on us and probably not going to have a material impact on the world once the dust settles. 
And also, as the political uncertainty wanes, we think businesses will have more confidence. Lack of confidence has been what's withholding back investment for several years. The way things seem to be developing on the political front, it looks like, I think, the business community will feel pretty good and certainly, they'll feel more confident going forward. And they do need to invest but there has not lot of them -- a lot of active investment for the last several years, and I think you're likely to see that as we head into '17. Nonetheless, we are planning on a continuation of the same: slow economy, 2% to 2.5%, low rates. If we get higher rates and more confidence, more investment, that's just good but that's not what we're planning on in terms of running our businesses. 
If you look quickly at Slide 6, we continue to improve our mix and lower our overall deposit cost. Our total deposits averaged $160 billion. That was an increase of $10 billion, obviously, merger related. If you exclude acquisitions, total deposits increased $3.9 billion, still a very strong 10.5%. And what I'm particularly pleased about is our mix improvement, where our noninterest-bearing deposits, ex acquisitions, increased $1.4 billion or 12.1%, which is really, really strong. And we reduced our total cost to funds on deposits by another 2 basis points, which is really, really good, down to 0.23%. So our deposit machine is working great. Our loan machine is working solid. And as Daryl will report to you, our overall fee income businesses and our expense management is really hitting on all cylinders. 
So let me turn now to Daryl for some more commentary."
19109,343558476,1009577,"BB&T Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Truist Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone.

Overall, we had a really strong quarter with regard t",1424,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. 
Turning to Slide 7. Overall, we had a really strong quarter with regard to credit quality. Net charge-offs totaled $97 million or 28 basis points, a decrease from 46 basis points last quarter. This is our lowest charge-off rate since 2006. We restated loans for 90 days or more past due because of our Ginnie Mae buyback program. Given this change, loans 90 days past due were essentially flat from last quarter. Loans 30 to 89 days past due increased $89 million or 10.8%, mostly due to seasonality in our consumer-related portfolios. 
NPAs decreased 1.9% to 40 basis points with the majority of the loan portfolio showing improvement. If you look at the graph, excluding energy, NPAs have improved steadily in recent quarters. In the third quarter, we expect NPAs to remain in a similar range and net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 to 45 basis points, assuming no unexpected deterioration in the economy. 
Continuing on Slide 8. We had a stable and quiet quarter in our oil and gas portfolio, with lower nonaccruals and substantially lower charge-offs compared with last quarter. The balances decreased 6%, and we will continue to have a good mix with less than 10% in oil field services. 
Our reserve coverage for oil and gas has risen to 9.3% and the coverage for coal, a very modest portfolio, has risen to 9.7%. Following the spring redeterminations, we reduced our average commitment. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our allowance coverage ratios remain strong at 3.88x for net charge-offs and 1.9x for NPLs. The allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.06% compared to 1.1% last quarter. Excluding the acquired portfolio, the allowance-to-loan ratio is 1.16%, so our effective allowance coverage is strong. 
Remember, our acquired loans have a combined mark of about $750 million. We recorded a provision of $111 million compared to net charge-offs of $97 million. Looking forward, our provision is expected to match charge-offs plus loan growth. 
Turning to Slide 10. Compared to last quarter, net interest margin was 3.41%, down 2 basis points. Core margin was 3.16%, also down 2 basis points. Net interest margin decrease resulted from lower interest rate environment and higher security balances as a result of National Penn. 
Looking into the third quarter, we expect GAAP margin to decline a few basis points, driven by lower rate, including a flatter yield curve and a reduction in benefits from purchase accounting. We expect core margin to remain relatively stable as lower rates will be offset by asset mix and funding costs and mix changes. We do not anticipate average earning assets to remain relatively stable next quarter. Asset sensitivity increased primarily due to changes in free funds as well as investment and deposit mix changes. 
Continuing on Slide 11. Noninterest income totaled $1.1 billion, up $114 million compared to last quarter. The fee income ratio improved to 42.8%. 
Looking at a few of the changes in noninterest income. Insurance income increased $46 million, driven by several factors: First, the acquisition of Swett & Crawford, which added $57 million in the second quarter. We also had $34 million seasonal increase in property/casualty commissions and a $13 million increase in other insurance revenues. This was offset by a seasonal decline in employee benefit commissions of $36 million and a decrease of $23 million, which is mostly due to lower bonus commissions. Excluding acquisitions, insurance income grew about 1% versus the same quarter last year. 
Mortgage banking income totaled $111 million, up $20 million, mostly due to higher gains on sale, an increase in salable residential loan volume and seasonally higher commercial mortgage income. The other income increased $65 million due to a $65 million increase in income related to certain post employment benefits. Looking ahead to the third quarter, total fee income is expected to be relatively flat due to a seasonal decrease in insurance revenues. 
Turning to Slide 12. Noninterest expenses totaled $1.8 billion, up $252 million versus last quarter. Personnel expense increased $124 million, driven by several factors: First, we had a $44 million increase in salary expense mostly due to the addition of approximately 1,900 FTEs from recent acquisitions. We also had a $40 million increase in post-employment benefit expense and a $36 million increase in incentives. This was due to the acquisition of Swett & Crawford and higher overall volume. Excluding acquisitions, FTEs were lower by 276. 
Merger-related and restructuring charges increased $69 million. We also had $29 million in restructuring charges related to severance and real estate write-downs. In addition, other expense increased $33 million, mostly due to operating charge-offs, charitable contributions and travel expense. Our effective tax rate was 30%, slightly below expectations due to the tax benefit this quarter. We expect the third quarter effective tax rate to be about 31%. 
Going forward, our expenses will be -- will include an $11 million quarterly increase with the FDIC insurance premiums. Even with this increase, we expect expenses to decline 1% to 2%, mostly due to cost saves from recent acquisitions, excluding merger-related and restructuring charges. We are still targeting to generate positive operating leverage in the second half of 2016. 
Turning to Slide 13. Capital ratios remain very healthy with a fully phased-in common equity Tier 1 of 9.8%. Our LCR was 135%, and our liquid asset buffer at the end of the quarter was very strong at 13.7%. 
Finally, we were pleased to receive a non-objection to our capital plan. As a result, we will seek board approval to increase our quarterly dividend $0.30 per quarter and initiate a share repurchase program in the third quarter, repurchasing up to $160 million of our shares.
Now let's look at segments, beginning on Slide 14. Before I walk through the Community Banking segment, I would note that National Penn is not included. Now that the conversion is complete, those results will become part of our segment reporting next quarter. 
Net income totaled $294 million, a decrease of $7 million from last quarter and up $63 million from second quarter of last year. Net interest income increased $5 million for the first quarter and $188 million for the second quarter of 2015. A little more than half of the increase was driven by Susquehanna. 
Turning to Slide 15. Residential Mortgage Banking net income totaled $44 million, up $5 million from last quarter, driven by higher gains on residential mortgage loan production and sales. Production mix was 57% purchased and 43% refi, similar to last quarter. 
Looking to Slide 16. Dealer Financial Services totaled $51 million, up $9 million, mostly due to lower charge-offs and regional acceptance. Our subprime auto portfolio totals $3.4 billion, and losses totaled 6% in the quarter, a significant improvement. Net charge-offs for the prime portfolio remain excellent at 15 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 17. Specialized Lending net income totaled $61 million, up $5 million from last quarter. This was driven mostly by loan and production growth in both Sheffield and equipment finance as well as good, strong production in Grandbridge, our commercial mortgage business. 
Looking at Slide 18. Insurance services net income totaled $44 million, down $9 million from last quarter. Noninterest income totaled $465 million, up $44 million, mostly driven by the addition of Swett & Crawford and higher P&C and life commissions, partially offset by seasonally lower employment benefit commissions. Noninterest expense increased $58 million, mostly due to Swett & Crawford. Going forward, we will continue to focus on achieving both cost savings and revenue synergies from Swett & Crawford acquisition. 
Turning to Slide 19. Financial Services segment had $87 million in net income, up $60 million from last quarter. This was largely driven by a provision decrease of $84 million related to charge-offs and increased reserves in the energy portfolio last quarter. Corporate Banking generated 24% loan growth, and wealth had 14% loan and 16% transaction deposit growth. 
In summary, for the quarter, we achieved excellent credit quality, a relatively stable net interest margin, the successful restructuring of some of our corporate real estate and, as Kelly mentioned earlier, successful conversion of National Penn. We are working hard to achieve synergies and efficiencies from our merger partners. With a steady outlook for loan growth and tight controls on our core expenses, we are set up to have a strong second half of 2016.  
Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing thoughts and Q&A."

So in summary, it was a solid quarter from an organic and a strategic perspective. Very pleased with earnings up 19%; record revenue, up 18%.

We're executing on the cost saves from that end, continuing with Susquehanna. M&A, as we've said, is off the track but we're -- I mean, off the table, so we're focusing on expense management. We're very pleased with our shareholder-friendly capital plan with the 7% increase in dividends and proposed buybacks. 
And so in this type of environment, we think that the most important thing to focus on is to execute with precision, generating all the revenue that we can generate out of our businesses. Having made a number of investments over the past several years, we have a lot of opportunities in our various businesses, so a lot of opportunity there, huge opportunity to continue to focus on rationalizing our cost structure, which is our primary focus at this time.

If you go back to 2 or so years ago, again, just speaking into core area, we started a pretty major rebuild of our backroom with 3 major projects: our general ledger system, which is now completed; our new commercial loan system, which is about 75% completed; and our new state-of-the-art data center, which is completed and getting ready to open. So there had been substantial upfront expenses and time commitment with regard to all of those. We're now heading into the period of time over the next year or so as that will crest, and then we'll begin to get the benefits on a relative basis. Two kinds of benefits: one will be, you'll see relatively less expenses moving forward versus what we just invested in the previous periods; and then, we'll begin to -- and this would take 2 or 3 years, but we'll begin to get to the efficiencies out of these new investments, which will be meaningful over a long-term point of view. So the core fundamental operating expenses of BB&T are poised to improve as we go forward. We're not making a grand big promises for the third quarter and that kind of thing. That's not the way we operate. But in terms of our focus today with the major projects underway and substantially complete, and with our intense focus on continued reconceptualization, we feel good about expense management going forward."

It was pretty much across the board, but it was slanted toward more the corporate side. As far as far as our specialized lending area, we have said that other than subprime, although we would expect those platforms to grow relatively faster than the core bank. Now we are purposely constraining the growth in the subprime sector to make sure it doesn't grow any faster than the core bank, so we don't increase our relative exposure there. But we believe those Specialized Lending areas, even with the high RWAs, do represent with the yields, a very strong risk return advantage for us.

Pre-crises, we and the other good banks were operating at about 15%. You've got to start from kind of the top. Way I think about it, there's about 2% kind of drawn off the top because of the higher capital. And then you've got about 1% to 1.5%, which is just the environment, economy, margins, et cetera. And then, the difference really is in accreting for regulatory costs and some type of logical cost. So from the capital point of view, we're going to continue to try to manage our capital efficiently, but it's going to stay high compared to past periods. So that 2%, at least, at a short run, is kind of non-retrievable. But that gets you to, say, 13. So the 1% to 1.5% in terms of economy, obviously, can come back and come back quickly depending on the growth rates and the economy and the margins. We're not counting on that, but I personally think the flat rate scenario that everybody's projecting is overstated. The underlying strength of our economy is not great, but it's good. Fed, I believe, clearly knows they need to raise rates and I think they will the minute they see a window, which could still easily happen, at least one rate increase towards the fall. And then the whole thing about regulatory and technological cost is about becoming efficient. Scale is a part of that and then, [indiscernible] settle in that we have put into place. And then finally, Gerard, I would say, this is a brave new world. I mean, you can't run a bank today that way you did 5, 10, 15 years ago. Everything has to be reconceptualized. We're having a very intense focus right now on looking at our businesses. And here's how -- kind of how I've asked our best people to approach it: I'm saying go back 20 years ago when things were pretty good and take a look at into what our structure was then and examine anything today that we're doing that we weren't doing 20 years ago. If it's something that we are doing that we are absolutely required to do by our regulation, then obviously, we have no choice. If it's something that has the [indiscernible] to creep into the structure, which can happen when times are fairly good, then it is suspect. And so we're going to examine every one of those in terms of their economic productivity, and I suspect that we will find material changes. So we will be restructuring the business. We already have a number of things underway. I'm not quite ready to announce it this morning, but we have a number of things that we're working on. There's not going to be any big, grand announcements. There's not going to be any big, grand announced cost-saving plan. That's not our style. But you could count on the fact that we are laser-focused on running our businesses efficiently and getting those returns up. I frankly think in the bottom line, Gerard, that it's -- material change in that is over the next couple of years. I certainly think we'll be in the 10% range over the next couple of years [indiscernible] cost of capital, I don't have any concerns about that. From 10 to 12 or 13 is more difficult as I described, and somewhat circumstantial based on what's going on in the world. But we will be in the top tier of the performing banks based on the then existing circumstances."

I know everybody likes to be hyper focused on the efficiency ratio and we're willing talk about it. But remember that it is a ratio, and so we have a lot of visibility in terms of the numerator but we don't have as much visibility in terms of the denominator, that is revenues. Obviously, if we did nothing today with our expenses and the economy got better and margins got better, efficiency ratio would go down. I mean, you wouldn't give us any credit for that, but that's what would happen. Conversely, if you have a period where revenues go down, maybe if you're doing a great job on expenses, then your efficiency ratio goes up. You will blame us for that. So I think that the efficiency ratio is taken out of context. Having said that, we think we are generally on a downward trajectory with regard to the efficiency ratio. We're just not going to be able to give you exactly what it's going to be quarter-by-quarter. We think for the rest of this year and into next year, it will be down. Immediate term, I'll call that 2 to 3 years, once we get into the 56% to 57% range, assuming reasonableness with regard to revenues, which I think will happen. And that will be very good. That will be a top-performing level of efficiency. We're not trying to drive expenses so low that we put revenues at risk. And so I'm very, very confident about our ability to execute on a very efficient organization. And I think that will show up as a very slow but methodical decline in the efficiency ratio."

The CCAR 2015, we actually used up over 100% of our capital, so our capital ratios came down a little bit. So when we did CCAR '16, we wanted to make sure our capital ratios stayed above 10% intangible common Tier 1, which is really what we're targeting. So you will see us slowly accrete even with the repurchase and dividend increase, a little bit more capital over this next 4 quarters, probably around 20 basis points or so, which is exactly what we plan for. If you look at our ask though in total, in '16 versus '15, it's basically 5% higher. Yes, I know we did an extra acquisition and all that, but the actual ask that we came in with came in a little bit higher overall, if you don't count the acquisitions."

On the GAAP side, it's basically -- the difference is purchase accounting. And you're going to see, if we did no other acquisition whatsoever, GAAP will converge to core over several years.

We've got one significant piece of news this morning, and it's apparently Jamie  Dimon and Warren Buffett and Larry Fink and some others have gotten together, are going to put forth a set of principles, I guess, for corporate governance or corporate behavior. And one of them is a lessened emphasis on quarterly guidance. And I would contend that the banking industry has probably been one of the ones most negatively impacted by the need to guide on a quarterly basis. Can you just reflect on that?

Good morning, everybody, and thanks for your interest in BB&T. We always appreciate you joining our call. So we had a very strong quarter from an organic performance perspective and a strategic perspective. Net income totaled $541 million,",1612,"Thanks, Alan. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for your interest in BB&T. We always appreciate you joining our call. 
So we had a very strong quarter from an organic performance perspective and a strategic perspective. Net income totaled $541 million, up 19.2% versus the second quarter '15 and 10.7% versus first quarter '16. If you look at diluted EPS, it totaled $0.66, up from $0.62 on a like quarter but down $0.01 from the first quarter. But that was due to high merger-related and restructuring charges in this quarter, as you would expect. Adjusted diluted EPS totaled $0.71, excluding merger-related and restructuring charges and the benefits from the special tax-advantaged asset, which I'll talk -- cover in a minute. 
GAAP ROA was a strong 1.06% and return on tangible common was 14.33%. Now if you make the adjustments we alluded to, our ROA adjusted would be 1.16% and adjusted return on tangible would be 15.76%, which is very good. 
For the record, FTE revenues totaled $2.8 billion, up 17.7% versus second quarter '15, 31% versus first quarter. Obviously, that was driven by 2 acquisitions in this quarter. We had a record net interest income of $1.7 billion, which was up 22.9% versus the second; 22.8% versus the first of '16. Margin did decline 2 basis points in line with what we projected, and Daryl will give you a little color on that in a little bit. 
Efficiency was 59.3% compared to 59.2% in the second of '15 and 58.3% in the first of '16. It was up a bit but we had guided you to that because we knew the timing of the acquisitions-related conversions and cost savings would impact. 
Noninterest expense has increased $250 million versus the first quarter of '16, but that was led by the impact of National Penn, Swett & Crawford and the merger-related and restructuring charges. If you ex out these items, we'd hit the number that we had projected. And again, Daryl will give you more color on that when we go forward. 
Average loans and leases held for investment totaled $141 billion in the second quarter. It was an increase of 20.2% versus the first quarter. And if you exclude the impact of National Penn, growth was still a solid 2.6%. 
We do continue to have runoff in our residential mortgage portfolio by design, and our prime auto portfolio because of our design and structural change due to very strategic region -- decisions relative to the cost and the spreads in each one of these segments. If you exclude residential mortgage loans and National Penn, average loans held for investment grew a very respectable 4.7%, which frankly, in an economy growing 2% to 2.5% is about right, what we would expect to have happened. Loan quality is great. Net charge-offs were 0.28%, lowest level since 2006. 
We did not get an objection to our FRB CCAR plan. So as you've seen, we propose a 7.1% increase in the quarterly dividend, $640 million in share repurchases. So if you recall over the years, we've said very clearly that our priorities with regard to capital disposition is: number one, organic growth; number two, dividend; number three, M&A; and number four, buyback. So we've also said when things change, then the priorities change. So today, organic growth is somewhat slower. We are increasing our dividend at a very nice rate. M&A is off the table for now, so buyback rises up to the higher level of importance, and that's exactly what we had said, exactly what we plan to do. 
We did complete the conversion of National Penn just last week, and it's going absolutely, absolutely great. We could not be more pleased about that. 
We're very, very excited about all of our acquisitions over the last 18 months, and we're really, really focused on execution on the profit improvement that will come from them. But we continue to not to be interested in M&A for a while as we've said. We've got plenty to do and frankly, we owe it to our shareholders to execute on what we've already done. And that's what we are doing. 
If you're following on the slides, look at the Slide 4 in your deck. This is what I've related to you before. So our merger-related restructuring charges were higher than we had expected. It's $92 million pretax and $58 million after tax, which was $0.07 on a diluted EPS basis. Now that $92 million was made up of $63 million on merger charges from Nat Penn, Susquehanna and Swett & Crawford. $29 million was in restructuring charges, which is including severance, branch and facility restructuring and other real estate write-downs. All of these will improve our run rate going forward. And so while that $92 million is higher, the truth is we just simply found more opportunities than we had expected to accelerate write-downs and therefore make it easy to do asset dispositions and also reduce FTEs where we had to take some severance, but they help us going forward. So it's a good news story. It's a little higher, but it was higher for a very, very good reason. 
I do want to reinforce that we are intensely focused on expenses. We've been focusing for a number of years, as you've heard me describe, about reconceptualization of our business. That continues, but I would say to you, it continues at a much more intense rate. The economy is relatively slow. We project a relatively low, flat yield curve for a period of time. And as a result, we are accelerating our focus on expense reductions. We still do it from a kind of top-down, bottom-up perspective, focusing on allowing our people to help figure out the best way to restructure their businesses versus us trying to sit in our offices and make the decision. We think that's just a better way. Our people are excited about the endeavor, and I think that we'll get really, really good results from that. 
You following along on Slide 5. Just a couple of comments on the -- in loan area. It was a really good quarter with regard to loans. Our average loans, again, excluding Nat Penn, increased 2.6% primarily due to strong growth in C&I and CRE IPP. Our C&I on a linked-quarter basis was 9.4%, which was very, very strong, and CRE IPP was 4.3%. So we feel very, very good about that. So if you exclude the residential mortgage rundown, which is by strategic design and Nat Penn, we had an annualized growth rate of 4.7%, which I frankly feel very, very good about. 
We did have our typical very strong seasonal performance in a number of our consumer-related businesses, like Sheffield, which was up 33%; dealer floor plan was up 21%; premium finance, up 12%; and Regional Acceptance, up 11.2%. So those, remember, are our very good diversifying businesses and they're performing very, very well; very, very good quality; and very, very good profitability. 
So looking forward, we expect about the same kind of loan growth in the third quarter as we had in the second, about 1% to 3%. Unless there's some dramatic change in the economy, that's what we would expect. 
Speaking of the economy, we think the economy is okay, still growing about 2% to 2.5%. Been an interesting 6 months as we came out of the first of the year, when everybody thought the world was coming to an end with changes in China and so forth. And then it settled down. Now more recently, everybody's gotten really, really excited about Brexit. We think the Brexit change is serious, but has been almost exaggerated in terms of its impact on the world and certainly on us. Our exports to the entire European Union is relatively small and it's just not going to have a material impact on us and probably not going to have a material impact on the world once the dust settles. 
And also, as the political uncertainty wanes, we think businesses will have more confidence. Lack of confidence has been what's holding back investment for several years. The way things seem to be developing on the political front, it looks like, I think, the business community will feel pretty good and certainly, they'll feel more confident going forward. And they do need to invest but there has not lot of them -- a lot of active investment for the last several years, and I think you're likely to see that as we head into '17. 
Nonetheless, we are planning on a continuation of the same: slow economy, 2% to 2.5%, low rates. If we get higher rates and more confidence, more investment, that's just good but that's not what we're planning on in terms of running our businesses. 
If you look quickly at Slide 6, we continue to improve our mix and lower our overall deposit cost. Our total deposits averaged $160 billion. That was an increase of $10 billion, obviously, merger related. If you excluded acquisitions, total deposits increased $3.9 billion, still a very strong 10.5%. And what I'm particularly pleased about is our mix improvement, where our noninterest-bearing deposits, ex acquisitions, increased $1.4 billion or 12.1%, which is really, really strong. And we reduced our total cost to funds on deposits by another 2 basis points, which is really, really good, down to 0.23%. So our deposit machine is working great. Our loan machine is working solid. And as Daryl will report to you, our overall fee income businesses and our expense management is really hitting on all cylinders. 
So let me turn now to Daryl for some more commentary."
19109,343558476,1009883,"BB&T Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Truist Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. Turning to Slide 7. Overall, we had a really strong quarter with regard t",1423,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. 
Turning to Slide 7. Overall, we had a really strong quarter with regard to credit quality. Net charge-offs totaled $97 million or 28 basis points, a decrease from 46 basis points last quarter. This is our lowest charge-off rate since 2006. We restated loans for 90 days or more past due because of our Ginnie Mae buyback program. Given this change, loans 90 days past due were essentially flat from last quarter. Loans 30 to 89 days past due increased $89 million or 10.8%, mostly due to seasonality in our consumer-related portfolios. 
NPAs decreased 1.9% to 40 basis points with the majority of the loan portfolio showing improvement. If you look at the graph, excluding energy, NPAs have improved steadily in recent quarters. In the third quarter, we expect NPAs to remain in a similar range and net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 to 45 basis points, assuming no unexpected deterioration in the economy. 
Continuing on Slide 8. We had a stable and quiet quarter in our oil and gas portfolio, with lower nonaccruals and substantially lower charge-offs compared with last quarter. The balances decreased 6%, and we will continue to have a good mix with less than 10% in oil field services. 
Our reserve coverage for oil and gas has risen to 9.3% and the coverage for coal, a very modest portfolio, has risen to 9.7%. Following the spring redeterminations, we reduced our average commitment. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our allowance coverage ratios remain strong at 3.88x for net charge-offs and 1.9x for NPLs. The allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.06% compared to 1.1% last quarter. Excluding the acquired portfolio, the allowance-to-loan ratio is 1.16%, so our effective allowance coverage is strong. 
Remember, our acquired loans have a combined mark of about $750 million. We recorded a provision of $111 million compared to net charge-offs of $97 million. Looking forward, our provision is expected to match charge-offs plus loan growth. 
Turning to Slide 10. Compared to last quarter, net interest margin was 3.41%, down 2 basis points. Core margin was 3.16%, also down 2 basis points. Net interest margin decrease resulted from lower interest rate environment and higher security balances as a result of National Penn. 
Looking into the third quarter, we expect GAAP margin to decline a few basis points, driven by lower rate, including a flatter yield curve and a reduction in benefits from purchase accounting. We expect core margin to remain relatively stable as lower rates will be offset by asset mix and funding costs and mix changes. We do not anticipate average earning assets to remain relatively stable next quarter. Asset sensitivity increased primarily due to changes in free funds as well as investment and deposit mix changes. 
Continuing on Slide 11. Noninterest income totaled $1.1 billion, up $114 million compared to last quarter. The fee income ratio improved to 42.8%. 
Looking at a few of the changes in noninterest income. Insurance income increased $46 million, driven by several factors: First, the acquisition of Swett & Crawford, which added $57 million in the second quarter. We also had $34 million seasonal increase in property/casualty commissions and a $13 million increase in other insurance revenues. This was offset by a seasonal decline in employee benefit commissions of $36 million and a decrease of $23 million, which is mostly due to lower bonus commissions. Excluding acquisitions, insurance income grew about 1% versus the same quarter last year. 
Mortgage banking income totaled $111 million, up $20 million, mostly due to higher gains on sale, an increase in salable residential loan volume and seasonally higher commercial mortgage income. The other income increased $65 million due to a $65 million increase in income related to certain post-employment benefits. Looking ahead to the third quarter, total fee income is expected to be relatively flat due to a seasonal decrease in insurance revenues. 
Turning to Slide 12. Noninterest expenses totaled $1.8 billion, up $252 million versus last quarter. Personnel expense increased $124 million, driven by several factors: First, we had a $44 million increase in salary expense mostly due to the addition of approximately 1,900 FTEs from recent acquisitions. We also had a $40 million increase in post-employment benefit expense and a $36 million increase in incentives. This was due to the acquisition of Swett & Crawford and higher overall volume. Excluding acquisitions, FTEs were lower by 276. 
Merger-related and restructuring charges increased $69 million. We also had $29 million in restructuring charges related to severance and real estate write-downs. In addition, other expense increased $33 million, mostly due to operating charge-offs, charitable contributions and travel expense. Our effective tax rate was 30%, slightly below expectations due to the tax benefit this quarter. We expect the third quarter effective tax rate to be about 31%. 
Going forward, our expenses will be -- will include an $11 million quarterly increase with the FDIC insurance premiums. Even with this increase, we expect expenses to decline 1% to 2%, mostly due to cost saves from recent acquisitions, excluding merger-related and restructuring charges. We are still targeting to generate positive operating leverage in the second half of 2016. 
Turning to Slide 13. Capital ratios remain very healthy with a fully phased-in common equity Tier 1 of 9.8%. Our LCR was 135%, and our liquid asset buffer at the end of the quarter was very strong at 13.7%. 
Finally, we were pleased to receive a non-objection to our capital plan. As a result, we will seek board approval to increase our quarterly dividend $0.30 per quarter and initiate a share repurchase program in the third quarter, repurchasing up to $160 million of our shares.
Now let's look at segments, beginning on Slide 14. Before I walk through the Community Banking segment, I would note that National Penn is not included. Now that the conversion is complete, those results will become part of our segment reporting next quarter. 
Net income totaled $294 million, a decrease of $7 million from last quarter and up $63 million from second quarter of last year. Net interest income increased $5 million for the first quarter and $188 million for the second quarter of 2015. A little more than half of the increase was driven by Susquehanna. 
Turning to Slide 15. Residential Mortgage Banking net income totaled $44 million, up $5 million from last quarter, driven by higher gains on residential mortgage loan production and sales. Production mix was 57% purchased and 43% refi, similar to last quarter. 
Looking to Slide 16. Dealer Financial Services totaled $51 million, up $9 million, mostly due to lower charge-offs and regional acceptance. Our subprime auto portfolio totals $3.4 billion, and losses totaled 6% in the quarter, a significant improvement. Net charge-offs for the prime portfolio remain excellent at 15 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 17. Specialized Lending net income totaled $61 million, up $5 million from last quarter. This was driven mostly by loan and production growth in both Sheffield and equipment finance as well as good, strong production in Grandbridge, our commercial mortgage business. 
Looking at Slide 18. Insurance services net income totaled $44 million, down $9 million from last quarter. Noninterest income totaled $465 million, up $44 million, mostly driven by the addition of Swett & Crawford and higher P&C and life commissions, partially offset by seasonally lower employment benefit commissions. Noninterest expense increased $58 million, mostly due to Swett & Crawford. Going forward, we will continue to focus on achieving both cost savings and revenue synergies from Swett & Crawford acquisition. 
Turning to Slide 19. Financial Services segment had $87 million in net income, up $60 million from last quarter. This was largely driven by a provision decrease of $84 million related to charge-offs and increased reserves in the energy portfolio last quarter. Corporate Banking generated 24% loan growth, and wealth had 14% loan and 16% transaction deposit growth. 
In summary, for the quarter, we achieved excellent credit quality, a relatively stable net interest margin, the successful restructuring of some of our corporate real estate and, as Kelly mentioned earlier, successful conversion of National Penn. We are working hard to achieve synergies and efficiencies from our merger partners. With a steady outlook for loan growth and tight controls on our core expenses, we are set up to have a strong second half of 2016.

So in summary, it was a solid quarter from an organic and a strategic perspective. Very pleased with earnings up 19%; record revenue, up 18%. Loan growth was very good given the challenging environment. Deposits were excellent. National Penn has been converted in a very, very excellent manner. We're executing on the cost saves from that end, continuing with Susquehanna. M&A, as we've said, is off the track but we're -- I mean, off the table, so we're focusing on expense management. We're very pleased with our shareholder-friendly capital plan with the 7% increase in dividends and proposed buybacks. 
And so in this type of environment, we think that the most important thing to focus on is to execute with precision, generating all the revenue that we can generate out of our businesses. Having made a number of investments over the past several years, we have a lot of opportunities in our various businesses, so a lot of opportunity there, huge opportunity to continue to focus on rationalizing our cost structure, which is our primary focus at this time.

If you go back to 2 or so years ago, again, just speaking into core area, we started a pretty major rebuild of our backroom with 3 major projects: our new general ledger system, which is now completed; our new commercial loan system, which is about 75% completed; and our new state-of-the-art data center, which is completed and getting ready to open. So there had been substantial upfront expenses and time commitment with regard to all of those. We're now heading into the period of time over the next year or so as that will crest, and then we'll begin to get the benefits on a relative basis. Two kinds of benefits: one will be, you will see relatively less expenses moving forward versus what we just invested in the previous periods; and then, we'll begin to -- and this would take 2 or 3 years, but we'll begin to get the efficiencies out of these new investments, which will be meaningful over a long-term point of view. So the core fundamental operating expenses of BB&T are poised to improve as we go forward. We're not making any grand big promises for the third quarter and that kind of thing. That's not the way we operate. But in terms of our focus today with the major projects underway and substantially complete, and with our intense focus on continued reconceptualization, we feel good about expense management going forward."

This quarter, our mortgage warehouse lending with low rates. That certainly seasonally moved in the public finance area in our dealer floor plan. So it wasn't any one area. It was pretty much across the board, but it was slanted toward more the corporate side. As far as our specialized lending area, we have said that other than subprime, although we would expect those platforms to grow relatively faster than the core bank, now we are purposely constraining the growth in the subprime sector to make sure it doesn't grow any faster than the core bank so we don't increase our relative exposure there. But we believe those Specialized Lending areas, even with the high RWAs, do represent with the yields, a very strong risk return advantage for us.

Way I think about it, there's about 2% kind of",604,"Well, Gerard, as you know, I think that's the grand question for all of us in the industry today. Pre-crises, we and the other good banks were operating at about 15%. You've got to start from kind of the top. Way I think about it, there's about 2% kind of drawn off the top because of the higher capital. And then you've got about 1% to 1.5%, which is just the environment, economy, margins, et cetera. And then, the difference really is in accreting for regulatory costs and some type of logical cost. So from the capital point of view, we're going to continue to try to manage our capital efficiently, but it's going to stay high compared to past periods. So that 2%, at least, at a short run, is kind of non-retrievable. But that gets you to, say, 13. So the 1% to 1.5% in terms of economy, obviously, can come back and come back quickly depending on the growth rates and the economy and the margins. We're not counting on that, but I personally think the flat rate scenario that everybody's projecting is overstated. The underlying strength of our economy is not great, but it's good. Fed, I believe, clearly knows they need to raise rates and I think they will the minute they see a window, which could still easily happen, at least one rate increase towards the fall. And then the whole thing about regulatory and technological cost is about becoming efficient. Scale is a part of that and then, [indiscernible] settle in that we have put into place. And then finally, Gerard, I would say, this is a brave new world. I mean, you can't run a bank today that way you did 5, 10, 15 years ago. Everything has to be reconceptualized. We're having a very intense focus right now on looking at our businesses. And here's how -- kind of how I've asked our best people to approach it: I'm saying go back 20 years ago when things were pretty good and take a look at into what our structure was then and examine anything today that we're doing that we weren't doing 20 years ago. If it's something that we are doing that we are absolutely required to do by our regulation, then obviously, we have no choice. If it's something that has evolved or creeped into the structure, which can happen when times are fairly good, then it is suspect. And so we're going to examine every one of those in terms of their economic productivity, and I suspect that we will find material changes. So we will be restructuring the business. We already have a number of things underway. I'm not quite ready to announce it this morning, but we have a number of things that we're working on. There's not going to be any big, grand announcements. There's not going to be any big, grand announced cost-saving plan. That's not our style. But you could count on the fact that we are laser-focused on running our businesses efficiently and getting those returns up. I frankly think in the bottom line, Gerard, that it's -- material change in that is over the next couple of years. I certainly think we'll be in the 10% range over the next couple of years covering cost of capital, I don't have any concerns about that. From 10 to 12 or 13 is more difficult as I described and somewhat circumstantial based on what's going on in the world. But we will be in the top tier of the performing banks based on the then existing circumstances."

I know everybody likes to be hyper focused on the efficiency ratio and we're willing talk about it. But remember that it is a ratio, and so we have a lot of visibility in terms of the numerator but we don't have as much visibility in terms of the denominator, that is revenues. Obviously, if we did nothing today with our expenses and the economy got better and margins got better, efficiency ratio would go down. I mean, you wouldn't give us any credit for that, but that's what would happen. Conversely, if you have a period where revenues go down, maybe if you're doing a great job on expenses, then your efficiency ratio goes up. You will blame us for that. So I think that the efficiency ratio is taken out of context. Having said that, we think we are generally on a downward trajectory with regard to the efficiency ratio. We're just not going to be able to give you exactly what it's going to be quarter-by-quarter. We think for the rest of this year and into next year, it will be down. In immediate term, I'll call that 2 to 3 years, once we get into the 56% to 57% range, assuming reasonableness with regard to revenues, which I think will happen. And that will be very good. That will be a top-performing level of efficiency. We're not trying to drive expenses so low that we put revenues at risk. And so I'm very, very confident about our ability to execute on a very efficient organization. And I think that will show up as a very slow but methodical decline in the efficiency ratio."

That's about as far as I think we ought to give. And then they measure us over time, and if they like what we do, they buy more stock; they don't, they sell."

Good morning, everybody, and thanks for your interest in BB&T. We always appreciate you joining our call. So we had a very strong quarter from an organic performance perspective and a strategic perspective. Net income totaled $541 million,",1612,"Thanks, Alan. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for your interest in BB&T. We always appreciate you joining our call. 
So we had a very strong quarter from an organic performance perspective and a strategic perspective. Net income totaled $541 million, up 19.2% versus the second quarter '15 and 10.7% versus first quarter '16. If you look at diluted EPS, it totaled $0.66, up from $0.62 on a like quarter but down $0.01 from the first quarter. But that was due to high merger-related and restructuring charges in this quarter, as you would expect. Adjusted diluted EPS totaled $0.71, excluding merger-related and restructuring charges and the benefits from the special tax-advantaged asset, which I'll talk -- cover in a minute. 
GAAP ROA was a strong 1.06% and return on tangible common was 14.33%. Now if you make the adjustments we alluded to, our ROA adjusted would be 1.16% and adjusted return on tangible would be 15.76%, which is very good. 
For the record, FTE revenues totaled $2.8 billion, up 17.7% versus second quarter '15, 31% versus first quarter. Obviously, that was driven by 2 acquisitions in this quarter. We had a record net interest income of $1.7 billion, which was up 22.9% versus the second; 22.8% versus the first of '16. Margin did decline 2 basis points in line with what we projected, and Daryl will give you a little color on that in a little bit. 
Efficiency was 59.3% compared to 59.2% in the second of '15 and 58.3% in the first of '16. It was up a bit but we had guided you to that because we knew the timing of the acquisitions-related conversions and cost savings would impact. 
Noninterest expense has increased $250 million versus the first quarter of '16, but that was led by the impact of National Penn, Swett & Crawford and the merger-related and restructuring charges. If you ex out these items, we'd hit the number that we had projected. And again, Daryl will give you more color on that when we go forward. 
Average loans and leases held for investment totaled $141 billion in the second quarter. It was an increase of 20.2% versus the first quarter. And if you exclude the impact of National Penn, growth was still a solid 2.6%. 
We do continue to have runoff in our residential mortgage portfolio by design, and our prime auto portfolio because of our design and structural change due to very strategic region -- decisions relative to the cost and the spreads in each one of these segments. If you exclude residential mortgage loans and National Penn, average loans held for investment grew a very respectable 4.7%, which frankly, in an economy growing 2% to 2.5% is about right, what we would expect to have happened. Loan quality is great. Net charge-offs were 0.28%, lowest level since 2006. 
We did not get an objection to our FRB CCAR plan. So as you've seen, we propose a 7.1% increase in the quarterly dividend, $640 million in share repurchases. So if you recall over the years, we've said very clearly that our priorities with regard to capital disposition is: number one, organic growth; number two, dividend; number three, M&A; and number four, buyback. So we've also said when things change, then the priorities change. So today, organic growth is somewhat slower. We are increasing our dividend at a very nice rate. M&A is off the table for now, so buyback rises up to the higher level of importance, and that's exactly what we had said, exactly what we plan to do. 
We did complete the conversion of National Penn just last week, and it's going absolutely, absolutely great. We could not be more pleased about that. 
We're very, very excited about all of our acquisitions over the last 18 months, and we're really, really focused on execution on the profit improvement that will come from them. But we continue to not to be interested in M&A for a while as we've said. We've got plenty to do and frankly, we owe it to our shareholders to execute on what we've already done. And that's what we are doing. 
If you're following on the slides, look at the Slide 4 in your deck. This is what I've related to you before. So our merger-related restructuring charges were higher than we had expected. It's $92 million pretax and $58 million after tax, which was $0.07 on a diluted EPS basis. Now that $92 million was made up of $63 million on merger charges from Nat Penn, Susquehanna and Swett & Crawford. $29 million was in restructuring charges, which is including severance, branch and facility restructuring and other real estate write-downs. All of these will improve our run rate going forward. And so while that $92 million is higher, the truth is we just simply found more opportunities than we had expected to accelerate write-downs and therefore make it easy to do asset dispositions and also reduce FTEs where we had to take some severance, but they help us going forward. So it's a good news story. It's a little higher, but it was higher for a very, very good reason. 
I do want to reinforce that we are intensely focused on expenses. We've been focusing for a number of years, as you've heard me describe, about reconceptualization of our business. That continues, but I would say to you, it continues at a much more intense rate. The economy is relatively slow. We project a relatively low, flat yield curve for a period of time. And as a result, we are accelerating our focus on expense reductions. We still do it from a kind of top-down, bottom-up perspective, focusing on allowing our people to help figure out the best way to restructure their businesses versus us trying to sit in our offices and make the decision. We think that's just a better way. Our people are excited about the endeavor, and I think that we'll get really, really good results from that. 
You following along on Slide 5. Just a couple of comments on the -- in loan area. It was a really good quarter with regard to loans. Our average loans, again, excluding Nat Penn, increased 2.6% primarily due to strong growth in C&I and CRE IPP. Our C&I on a linked-quarter basis was 9.4%, which was very, very strong, and CRE IPP was 4.3%. So we feel very, very good about that. So if you exclude the residential mortgage rundown, which is by strategic design and Nat Penn, we had an annualized growth rate of 4.7%, which I frankly feel very, very good about. 
We did have our typical very strong seasonal performance in a number of our consumer-related businesses, like Sheffield, which was up 33%; dealer floor plan was up 21%; premium finance, up 12%; and Regional Acceptance, up 11.2%. So those, remember, are our very good diversifying businesses and they're performing very, very well; very, very good quality; and very, very good profitability. 
So looking forward, we expect about the same kind of loan growth in the third quarter as we had in the second, about 1% to 3%. Unless there's some dramatic change in the economy, that's what we would expect. 
Speaking of the economy, we think the economy is okay, still growing about 2% to 2.5%. Been an interesting 6 months as we came out of the first of the year, when everybody thought the world was coming to an end with changes in China and so forth. And then it settled down. Now more recently, everybody's gotten really, really excited about Brexit. We think the Brexit change is serious, but has been almost exaggerated in terms of its impact on the world and certainly on us. Our exports to the entire European Union is relatively small and it's just not going to have a material impact on us and probably not going to have a material impact on the world once the dust settles. 
And also, as the political uncertainty wanes, we think businesses will have more confidence. Lack of confidence has been what's holding back investment for several years. The way things seem to be developing on the political front, it looks like, I think, the business community will feel pretty good and certainly, they'll feel more confident going forward. And they do need to invest but there has not lot of them -- a lot of active investment for the last several years, and I think you're likely to see that as we head into '17. 
Nonetheless, we are planning on a continuation of the same: slow economy, 2% to 2.5%, low rates. If we get higher rates and more confidence, more investment, that's just good but that's not what we're planning on in terms of running our businesses. 
If you look quickly at Slide 6, we continue to improve our mix and lower our overall deposit cost. Our total deposits averaged $160 billion. That was an increase of $10 billion, obviously, merger related. If you excluded acquisitions, total deposits increased $3.9 billion, still a very strong 10.5%. And what I'm particularly pleased about is our mix improvement, where our noninterest-bearing deposits, ex acquisitions, increased $1.4 billion or 12.1%, which is really, really strong. And we reduced our total cost to funds on deposits by another 2 basis points, which is really, really good, down to 0.23%. So our deposit machine is working great. Our loan machine is working solid. And as Daryl will report to you, our overall fee income businesses and our expense management is really hitting on all cylinders. 
So let me turn now to Daryl for some more commentary."
19109,343558476,1010222,"BB&T Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Truist Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. Turning to Slide 7. Overall, we had a really strong quarter with regard t",1423,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. 
Turning to Slide 7. Overall, we had a really strong quarter with regard to credit quality. Net charge-offs totaled $97 million or 28 basis points, a decrease from 46 basis points last quarter. This is our lowest charge-off rate since 2006. We restated loans for 90 days or more past due because of our Ginnie Mae buyback program. Given this change, loans 90 days past due were essentially flat from last quarter. Loans 30 to 89 days past due increased $89 million or 10.8%, mostly due to seasonality in our consumer-related portfolios. 
NPAs decreased 1.9% to 40 basis points with the majority of the loan portfolio showing improvement. If you look at the graph, excluding energy, NPAs have improved steadily in recent quarters. In the third quarter, we expect NPAs to remain in a similar range and net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 to 45 basis points, assuming no unexpected deterioration in the economy. 
Continuing on Slide 8. We had a stable and quiet quarter in our oil and gas portfolio, with lower nonaccruals and substantially lower charge-offs compared with last quarter. The balances decreased 6%, and we will continue to have a good mix with less than 10% in oil field services. 
Our reserve coverage for oil and gas has risen to 9.3% and the coverage for coal, a very modest portfolio, has risen to 9.7%. Following the spring redeterminations, we reduced our average commitment. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our allowance coverage ratios remain strong at 3.88x for net charge-offs and 1.9x for NPLs. The allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.06% compared to 1.1% last quarter. Excluding the acquired portfolio, the allowance-to-loan ratio is 1.16%, so our effective allowance coverage is strong. 
Remember, our acquired loans have a combined mark of about $750 million. We recorded a provision of $111 million compared to net charge-offs of $97 million. Looking forward, our provision is expected to match charge-offs plus loan growth. 
Turning to Slide 10. Compared to last quarter, net interest margin was 3.41%, down 2 basis points. Core margin was 3.16%, also down 2 basis points. Net interest margin decrease resulted from lower interest rate environment and higher security balances as a result of National Penn. 
Looking into the third quarter, we expect GAAP margin to decline a few basis points, driven by lower rate, including a flatter yield curve and a reduction in benefits from purchase accounting. We expect core margin to remain relatively stable as lower rates will be offset by asset mix and funding costs and mix changes. We do not anticipate average earning assets to remain relatively stable next quarter. Asset sensitivity increased primarily due to changes in free funds as well as investment and deposit mix changes. 
Continuing on Slide 11. Noninterest income totaled $1.1 billion, up $114 million compared to last quarter. The fee income ratio improved to 42.8%. 
Looking at a few of the changes in noninterest income. Insurance income increased $46 million, driven by several factors: First, the acquisition of Swett & Crawford, which added $57 million in the second quarter. We also had $34 million seasonal increase in property/casualty commissions and a $13 million increase in other insurance revenues. This was offset by a seasonal decline in employee benefit commissions of $36 million and a decrease of $23 million, which is mostly due to lower bonus commissions. Excluding acquisitions, insurance income grew about 1% versus the same quarter last year. 
Mortgage banking income totaled $111 million, up $20 million, mostly due to higher gains on sale, an increase in salable residential loan volume and seasonally higher commercial mortgage income. The other income increased $65 million due to a $65 million increase in income related to certain post-employment benefits. Looking ahead to the third quarter, total fee income is expected to be relatively flat due to a seasonal decrease in insurance revenues. 
Turning to Slide 12. Noninterest expenses totaled $1.8 billion, up $252 million versus last quarter. Personnel expense increased $124 million, driven by several factors: First, we had a $44 million increase in salary expense mostly due to the addition of approximately 1,900 FTEs from recent acquisitions. We also had a $40 million increase in post-employment benefit expense and a $36 million increase in incentives. This was due to the acquisition of Swett & Crawford and higher overall volume. Excluding acquisitions, FTEs were lower by 276. 
Merger-related and restructuring charges increased $69 million. We also had $29 million in restructuring charges related to severance and real estate write-downs. In addition, other expense increased $33 million, mostly due to operating charge-offs, charitable contributions and travel expense. Our effective tax rate was 30%, slightly below expectations due to the tax benefit this quarter. We expect the third quarter effective tax rate to be about 31%. 
Going forward, our expenses will be -- will include an $11 million quarterly increase with the FDIC insurance premiums. Even with this increase, we expect expenses to decline 1% to 2%, mostly due to cost saves from recent acquisitions, excluding merger-related and restructuring charges. We are still targeting to generate positive operating leverage in the second half of 2016. 
Turning to Slide 13. Capital ratios remain very healthy with a fully phased-in common equity Tier 1 of 9.8%. Our LCR was 135%, and our liquid asset buffer at the end of the quarter was very strong at 13.7%. 
Finally, we were pleased to receive a non-objection to our capital plan. As a result, we will seek board approval to increase our quarterly dividend $0.30 per quarter and initiate a share repurchase program in the third quarter, repurchasing up to $160 million of our shares.
Now let's look at segments, beginning on Slide 14. Before I walk through the Community Banking segment, I would note that National Penn is not included. Now that the conversion is complete, those results will become part of our segment reporting next quarter. 
Net income totaled $294 million, a decrease of $7 million from last quarter and up $63 million from second quarter of last year. Net interest income increased $5 million for the first quarter and $188 million for the second quarter of 2015. A little more than half of the increase was driven by Susquehanna. 
Turning to Slide 15. Residential Mortgage Banking net income totaled $44 million, up $5 million from last quarter, driven by higher gains on residential mortgage loan production and sales. Production mix was 57% purchased and 43% refi, similar to last quarter. 
Looking to Slide 16. Dealer Financial Services totaled $51 million, up $9 million, mostly due to lower charge-offs and regional acceptance. Our subprime auto portfolio totals $3.4 billion, and losses totaled 6% in the quarter, a significant improvement. Net charge-offs for the prime portfolio remain excellent at 15 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 17. Specialized Lending net income totaled $61 million, up $5 million from last quarter. This was driven mostly by loan and production growth in both Sheffield and equipment finance as well as good, strong production in Grandbridge, our commercial mortgage business. 
Looking at Slide 18. Insurance services net income totaled $44 million, down $9 million from last quarter. Noninterest income totaled $465 million, up $44 million, mostly driven by the addition of Swett & Crawford and higher P&C and life commissions, partially offset by seasonally lower employment benefit commissions. Noninterest expense increased $58 million, mostly due to Swett & Crawford. Going forward, we will continue to focus on achieving both cost savings and revenue synergies from Swett & Crawford acquisition. 
Turning to Slide 19. Financial Services segment had $87 million in net income, up $60 million from last quarter. This was largely driven by a provision decrease of $84 million related to charge-offs and increased reserves in the energy portfolio last quarter. Corporate Banking generated 24% loan growth, and wealth had 14% loan and 16% transaction deposit growth. 
In summary, for the quarter, we achieved excellent credit quality, a relatively stable net interest margin, the successful restructuring of some of our corporate real estate and, as Kelly mentioned earlier, successful conversion of National Penn. We are working hard to achieve synergies and efficiencies from our merger partners. With a steady outlook for loan growth and tight controls on our core expenses, we are set up to have a strong second half of 2016.  
Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing thoughts and Q&A."

So in summary, it was a solid quarter from an organic and a strategic perspective. Very pleased with earnings up 19%; record revenue, up 18%. Loan growth was very good given the challenging environment. Deposits were excellent. National Penn has been converted in a very, very excellent manner. We're executing on the cost saves from that end, continuing with Susquehanna. M&A, as we've said, is off the track but we're -- I mean, off the table, so we're focusing on expense management. We're very pleased with our shareholder-friendly capital plan with the 7% increase in dividends and proposed buybacks. 
And so in this type of environment, we think that the most important thing to focus on is to execute with precision, generating all the revenue that we can generate out of our businesses.

If you go back to 2 or so years ago, again, just speaking into core area, we started a pretty major rebuild of our backroom with 3 major projects: our new general ledger system, which is now completed; our new commercial loan system, which is about 75% completed; and our new state-of-the-art data center, which is completed and getting ready to open. So there had been substantial upfront expenses and time commitment with regard to all of those. We're now heading into the period of time over the next year or so as that will crest, and then we'll begin to get the benefits on a relative basis. Two kinds of benefits: one will be, you will see relatively less expenses moving forward versus what we just invested in the previous periods; and then, we'll begin to -- and this would take 2 or 3 years, but we'll begin to get the efficiencies out of these new investments, which will be meaningful over a long-term point of view. So the core fundamental operating expenses of BB&T are poised to improve as we go forward. We're not making any grand big promises for the third quarter and that kind of thing. That's not the way we operate. But in terms of our focus today with the major projects underway and substantially complete, and with our intense focus on continued reconceptualization, we feel good about expense management going forward."

This quarter, our mortgage warehouse lending with low rates. That certainly seasonally moved in the public finance area in our dealer floor plan. So it wasn't any one area. It was pretty much across the board, but it was slanted toward more the corporate side. As far as our specialized lending area, we have said that other than subprime, although we would expect those platforms to grow relatively faster than the core bank, now we are purposely constraining the growth in the subprime sector to make sure it doesn't grow any faster than the core bank so we don't increase our relative exposure there. But we believe those Specialized Lending areas, even with the high RWAs, do represent with the yields, a very strong risk return advantage for us. So we want to be sure we do that in a measured fashion, but we certainly would expect those to grow relatively faster than the core."

Way I think about it, there's about 2% kind of",604,"Well, Gerard, as you know, I think that's the grand question for all of us in the industry today. Pre-crises, we and the other good banks were operating at about 15%. You've got to start from kind of the top. Way I think about it, there's about 2% kind of drawn off the top because of the higher capital. And then you've got about 1% to 1.5%, which is just the environment, economy, margins, et cetera. And then, the difference really is in accreting for regulatory costs and some type of logical cost. So from the capital point of view, we're going to continue to try to manage our capital efficiently, but it's going to stay high compared to past periods. So that 2%, at least, at a short run, is kind of non-retrievable. But that gets you to, say, 13. So the 1% to 1.5% in terms of economy, obviously, can come back and come back quickly depending on the growth rates and the economy and the margins. We're not counting on that, but I personally think the flat rate scenario that everybody's projecting is overstated. The underlying strength of our economy is not great, but it's good. Fed, I believe, clearly knows they need to raise rates and I think they will the minute they see a window, which could still easily happen, at least one rate increase towards the fall. And then the whole thing about regulatory and technological cost is about becoming efficient. Scale is a part of that and then, [indiscernible] settle in that we have put into place. And then finally, Gerard, I would say, this is a brave new world. I mean, you can't run a bank today that way you did 5, 10, 15 years ago. Everything has to be reconceptualized. We're having a very intense focus right now on looking at our businesses. And here's how -- kind of how I've asked our best people to approach it: I'm saying go back 20 years ago when things were pretty good and take a look at into what our structure was then and examine anything today that we're doing that we weren't doing 20 years ago. If it's something that we are doing that we are absolutely required to do by our regulation, then obviously, we have no choice. If it's something that has evolved or creeped into the structure, which can happen when times are fairly good, then it is suspect. And so we're going to examine every one of those in terms of their economic productivity, and I suspect that we will find material changes. So we will be restructuring the business. We already have a number of things underway. I'm not quite ready to announce it this morning, but we have a number of things that we're working on. There's not going to be any big, grand announcements. There's not going to be any big, grand announced cost-saving plan. That's not our style. But you could count on the fact that we are laser-focused on running our businesses efficiently and getting those returns up. I frankly think in the bottom line, Gerard, that it's -- material change in that is over the next couple of years. I certainly think we'll be in the 10% range over the next couple of years covering cost of capital, I don't have any concerns about that. From 10 to 12 or 13 is more difficult as I described and somewhat circumstantial based on what's going on in the world. But we will be in the top tier of the performing banks based on the then existing circumstances."

I know everybody likes to be hyper focused on the efficiency ratio and we're willing talk about it. But remember that it is a ratio, and so we have a lot of visibility in terms of the numerator but we don't have as much visibility in terms of the denominator, that is revenues. Obviously, if we did nothing today with our expenses and the economy got better and margins got better, efficiency ratio would go down. I mean, you wouldn't give us any credit for that, but that's what would happen. Conversely, if you have a period where revenues go down, maybe if you're doing a great job on expenses, then your efficiency ratio goes up. You will blame us for that. So I think that the efficiency ratio is taken out of context. Having said that, we think we are generally on a downward trajectory with regard to the efficiency ratio. We're just not going to be able to give you exactly what it's going to be quarter-by-quarter. We think for the rest of this year and into next year, it will be down. In immediate term, I'll call that 2 to 3 years, once we get into the 56% to 57% range, assuming reasonableness with regard to revenues, which I think will happen. And that will be very good. That will be a top-performing level of efficiency. We're not trying to drive expenses so low that we put revenues at risk. And so I'm very, very confident about our ability to execute on a very efficient organization. And I think that will show up as a very slow but methodical decline in the efficiency ratio."

So in the investment portfolio, you are correct in that the agency securities we've been buying, we've been buying at premiums. We are very disciplined to try to have a handle of 102 [ph] or less if at all possible. We did actually have an advantage though. If you go back to crises, we got a lot of non-agency securities back then at discounts. So we, overall, if you go back quarter-after-quarter, we would relatively balance where the premiums on the higher-quality agencies have been offset by the non-agency securities. This quarter was a big drop in interest rates. We actually saw a slight benefit in the guidance that were at a discount. The non-agency guys were prepaying faster and we were accreting more, and that's kind of that duration adjustment that you saw come through. So we actually had a slight benefit in the security yields. As far as mortgage banking income goes, is that was your other question?"

Our GAAP ROA, ROE and ROTCE were 1.15%, 8.87% and 15.20%, which I think were very strong in this environment. Taxable-equivalent revenues totaled $2.8 billion, up 13.1% versus third of '15 and 3.9% versus second quarter of '16 on an annualized basis. I'm very pleased that our net interest margin declined only 2 basis points to 3.39%, and our core net interest margin increased to 3.17%. Daryl will give you a lot more color on that in just a little bit. 
Our GAAP efficiency ratio improved to 61.7% versus 65.4% in the second quarter of '16. Our adjusted efficiency ratio improved to 58.7% versus 59.6% in the second quarter. [indiscernible] Noninterest expenses were $1.7 billion, a decrease of 19% versus the second quarter annualized. 
Average loans and leases held for investment totaled $141.3 billion in the third quarter, which was up just slightly compared to the second quarter. We do continue to have significant runoff in our Residential Mortgage portfolio and prime auto based on some very clear strategic decisions that we have made. 
Ex these, though, we had a respectable 3 -- 2.2% annual growth, which I think is pretty good consistent with the economic growth, and I'll talk a bit more about that in a minute. NPAs did continue, a slight decrease of 4.9%. 
We did settle a loss share agreement with the FDIC. Recall that we had a loss share agreement on that 2009 acquisition of Colonial. We incurred an $18 million charge this quarter, but it will result in future benefits with regard to earnings. We did settle a dated FHA insurance loan matter, and we made a $50 million charitable contribution, which will reduce expenses in future quarters. And as indicated, we did repurchase $160 million of outstanding shares. 
Now Slide 4, these selected items that I related to, the merger-related restructuring charges was $43 million pretax or $0.03 negative impact to diluted EPS. Charitable contribution is $50 million pretax, which was $0.04 dilution to EPS. On the other hand, we had a settlement of FHA insurance loan matters net of recoveries, which was a positive $73 million or $0.05 and then the termination of the FDIC loss share agreements, the $18 million I mentioned, was $0.01. So if you net those out, it was about [ph] $0.03 net negative impact on EPS because of those selected items. 
If you go to Slide 5, a few comments with regard to loans. As I've said, they were up slightly 0.3%, but for several quarters now, we have indicated to you that we have been allowing our Residential Mortgage portfolio to decline. That's a strategic decision because of the mix of our business, expectations with regard to rising rates and the spreads, frankly, in that business. So the risk-adjusted return is not at a level we would like to be on a marginal basis and so we're letting it run off. And in the sales finance in the prime portfolio, we did restructure some quarters ago to a flat program. That program transition's actually going very well. The old portfolio is running off today but, frankly, the new portfolio going off [ph] more profitable. So we feel good about that, but it does show a loan decline. So again, net adjusted 2.2%. 
We did have some key very strong performances on a seasonal basis, which we expect from some of our Specialized Lending businesses. Premium finance was up 57.1% annualized; Sheffield, up 21.3% annualized; Regional Acceptance, up 15.5% annualized; and revolving credit was up 9.6%. So you can see that while we're being very careful with regard to our basic growth [ph] portfolio, our Specialized Lending portfolio has continued to do very, very well. 
Now we, like probably others, did experience higher payoffs in our commercial area in the quarter. Frankly, a lot of good quality loans have just been refi-ed out into the market because of, I think, participants' expectations that rates are going up. So they're going [ph] out and taking advantage of long-term loan markets. That's not a long-term change in terms of the commercial lending productivity. It's just a temporary increase in payoffs. Production in the pipelines and all still looks solid. 
And I'll remind you that we are a very disciplined lender. We're just not doing cheap loans outside of our risk appetite. But quite frankly, I mean, we could be growing faster, but the risk-adjusted return on equity's just unacceptable. So we're getting all that the market will give us and we're not going to try to beat the market. That's not a good bet from a long-term point of view. 
On Page 6, our DDA growth continue to be very strong at 14.3%, feel really good about that. We are increasing market share in most of our markets, and we continue to hold our costs at a very low 0.3%. So our deposit business is doing extremely well and supporting the asset growth that we have. 
Let me turn it to Daryl now for some additional detail, and then we'll have questions."
19109,379896003,1056692,"BB&T Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Truist Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. Turning to Slide 7. Overall, we had a really good quarter with regard to",1232,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. 
Turning to Slide 7. Overall, we had a really good quarter with regard to credit quality. Net charge-offs totaled $130 million, up 9 basis points from last quarter. This was mostly driven by expected seasonality in our retail portfolios as well as returning to more normalized levels after a very low charge-off quarter. 
Loans 30 to 89 days past due increased $66 million or 7.2%, again, mostly due to seasonality in our consumer-related portfolios. NPAs decreased 4.9% to 38 basis points. Excluding energy, NPAs have improved steadily in recent quarters. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect NPAs to remain at a similar range. We also expect net charge-offs to be in a range of 35 to 45 basis points assuming no unexpected deterioration in the economy. 
Continuing on Slide 8. Our energy portfolio totaled $1.3 billion, about 1% of total loans. Outstanding balances, total commitments and nonaccruals all decreased from last quarter, and all nonperforming borrowers are paying as agreed. 
Allocated reserves increased to 11.5%. This was mostly due to the implementation of guidance from the recent shared national credit review that was received in early October. We continue to have good quality mix, with less than 10% in oilfield services. Lastly, the reserve coverage for coal, a very modest portfolio, rose to 13.7%. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our allowance coverage ratios remained strong at 2.91x for net charge-offs and 2x for NPLs. The allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.06%, flat compared to last quarter. Excluding the acquired portfolio, the allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.15%. So our effective allowance coverage remains strong. 
As a reminder, our acquired loans have a combined mark of $670 million. We have recorded a provision of $148 million compared to net charge-offs of $130 million. Looking forward, our provision is expected to match charge-offs plus loan growth. 
Turning to Slide 10. Compared to last quarter, net interest margin was 3.39%, down 2 basis points. Core margin was 3.17%, up 1 basis point. The margin decrease mostly resulted from lower investment yields, which were down 15 basis points. 
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect GAAP margin to decline 3 to 5 basis points, driven by a reduction in benefits from purchase accounting. We expect core margin to remain essentially flat as lower rates will be offset by asset mix, funding cost and mix changes and the possibility of a rate increase in December. 
Additionally, we expect average earning assets to decline by approximately $1 billion next quarter due to lower security balances. Asset sensitivity increased, mostly due to growth in favorable funding sources and positive growth in short -- shorter asset classes. 
Continuing on Slide 11. Noninterest income totaled $1.2 billion, up $34 million compared to last quarter. The fee income ratio improved to 41.9%. 
Looking at a few other changes in noninterest income. Insurance income decreased $55 million, mostly driven by a seasonal decline in property and casualty commissions. Mortgage banking income increased $43 million due to net MSR valuation adjustments and higher production volumes. Other income decreased $10 million due to a $14 million decrease in income related to assets for certain postemployment benefits. 
And finally, we terminated our FDIC loss share agreements associated with Colonial. As a result, $18 million of expense was recognized in the third quarter. Going forward, no FDIC loss share expense will be recognized. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, total fee income is expected to be relatively flat as seasonally stronger insurance is expected to offset by the seasonal decline in mortgage banking income. 
Turning to Slide 12. We had an excellent quarter in terms of expense management. Noninterest expenses totaled $1.7 billion, down $86 million or 19% versus last quarter. Personnel expense decreased $33 million, driven by a $14 million decline in postemployment benefit expense and a $10 million decline in insurance incentive expense due to seasonality. Merger-related and restructuring charges decreased $49 million, largely due to lower acquisition-related charges and last quarter's restructuring charges related to real estate in the amount of $19 million. 
In addition, other expense decreased $34 million, mostly due to the $73 million net benefit related to the settlement of certain FHA-insured mortgages. This is partially offset by a charitable contribution of $50 million. Going forward, excluding merger-related restructuring charges and unusual items, we expect expenses to decrease slightly in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 13. Capital ratios remain very healthy with a fully phased-in common equity Tier 1 of 9.9%. Our LCR was 122%, and our liquid asset buffer was very strong at 13.6%. 
Finally, we will continue with our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter, repurchasing up to $160 million in our shares. 
Now let's look at our segments beginning on Slide 14. Community Bank net income totaled $338 million, an increase of $43 million from last quarter and up $78 million from third quarter of last year. Noninterest income increased $13 million, driven by higher service charges on deposits, letters of credit and bankcard fees. Majority of the growth experienced in the Community Bank was acquisition related. However, third quarter was our best commercial loan production for the year. 
Turning to Slide 15. Residential Mortgage Banking net income totaled $117 million, up $73 million from last quarter, driven by net MSR valuation adjustments and higher salable [ph] loan volume as well as a net recovery from the settlement of FHA-insured loan matters. Production mix was 57% purchase and 43% refi, similar to last quarter. Gain on sale margins were slightly down 3 basis points to 1.06% versus last quarter. 
Looking to Slide 16. Dealer Financial Services income totaled $40 million, a decrease of $11 million compared to prior quarter. The provision for credit losses increased $18 million, mostly driven by loan growth as well as seasonally higher net charge-offs in the Regional Acceptance portfolio. Net charge-offs are still well within risk appetite of approximately 7%. Net charge-offs for the prime portfolio remain excellent at 19 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 17. Specialized Lending net income totaled $64 million, up $3 million from last quarter. This was driven mostly by loan and production growth in both Sheffield and equipment finance as well as strong production in Grandbridge, our commercial mortgage business. 
Looking at Slide 18. Insurance Services net income totaled $23 million, down $21 million from last quarter. Noninterest income totaled $412 million, down $53 million, mostly driven by seasonality in commercial property and casualty insurance. Noninterest expense decreased $21 million, mostly due to lower personnel expense, operating charge-offs and business referral expense. 
Turning to Slide 19. The Financial Services segment had $83 million in net income, down slightly, mostly due to a modest decline in Corporate Banking loan growth. Wealth generated strong loan and deposit growth, 8.6% and 13.7%, respectively, compared to last quarter. 
Lastly, the provision increase of $26 million was largely driven by risk rate mix changes, partially offset by lower loan balances. 
In summary, for the quarter, we achieved solid growth in revenues, continued strong credit quality and a relatively stable net interest margin and excellent expense control. Looking forward, we expect to improve outlook for loan growth, continued benign credit and solid expense control. 
Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A."
19109,379896003,1056692,"BB&T Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Truist Financial Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Daryl. So as you've heard, we believe the quarter was an overall strong performance quarter. I would point out that our mergers are working really well. Expenses are being rationalized.

I would point out that our mergers are working really well. Expenses are being rationalized. Market acceptance in all of our new markets is very, very good, and our Community Bank teams are executing extremely well in expense reduction and revenue production. 
Our loan growth in today's market, to be honest, is just very, very challenging. Still, as Daryl indicated, we do expect our loan growth to be in the 1% to 3% range as we look forward to the fourth quarter. And that's going to be based on, we think, probably somewhat lower levels of payoffs. And we keep looking at possibilities of asset purchases from some other institutions that are rationalizing their balance sheet. So when you put it all together, we think that we'll be in the 1% to 3% range. 
And frankly, I expect not much of an impact on the fourth quarter, but as we head into next year, I think the market is likely to get better once we get through post elections. Part of what is going on in the third quarter in terms of this kind of a slowdown that everybody's talking about is there's just a lot of anxiety out. I saw a report a couple of days ago that 60% or slightly less, but about 60% of the market is just really, really anxious about the elections, and I personally quite understand that. And so I think when all this subsides, however it goes, there'll be less uncertainty and less anxiety. I think that will instill a bit more confidence and people will be a little bit more willing to invest and make acquisitions and borrow money. So I think that's a bit on the positive side. 
We did have several good strategic agreements that will help future earnings. We continue our systems investments, and I'd point out we did add 3 members to our executive management team. So we feel good about where we are, and we at BB&T are building for the future.

We're not going to dismantle it just because we want the 2 50 making incentives. Number one, the way we're doing CCAR today, we actually benefit from it. We think it's a healthy process, and so we would continue basically as it is anyway even if the Fed dropped the whole requirements. But certainly, we wouldn't drop it and then have to pick it back up if we did a strategic deal to put us over 2 50.

We're getting all the expense saves, the synergies that we thought we would. We're probably halfway through that process, and the conversion will occur in February. But your point is right on in that the organic growth, primarily due to the pricing and excess capital in the market, is generally in the 1% range. If I could -- if you look at is year-to-date, we would be growing right on 1%, and there are several factors. Pricing is one. And if you look at the mix of businesses that we are in, the pure property and casualty business is probably down in the 1% to 2%, but the CAT property, which is through our business is probably down in the 15% to 20%. So on balance, we're probably down 4% to 5%. Existing client growth, however, is up. We actually saw a new business growth in the third quarter, which I would assume would be abnormal in the industry today. I think that speaks well to the revenue machine that we've built over the years. And then you're likely to see our performance-based payments, which isn't really based on kind of how you perform with your underwriters. The recent storm is really not large enough to create increases in pricing because there is some excess capital. On the other hand, it does hurt us just a little bit. It won't be significant on our performance. Run rate going forward, I think as we really kind of put the business together, we've got chance to continue to be positive and potentially accelerate if we get any kind of economic pickup, but I'd say it's in that sort of 1% to 2% kind of range looking forward."

Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our call. So overall, I think we had a very strong performance quarter. We had a record quarterly earnings, and we did complete a few strategic agreements, which will benefit future quarters,",949,"Thanks, Alan. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our call. 
So overall, I think we had a very strong performance quarter. We had a record quarterly earnings, and we did complete a few strategic agreements, which will benefit future quarters, which I'll describe. Net income of $599 million, which is up 21.7% versus third of '15 and 42.7% annualized versus second quarter '16. 
Diluted EPS was $0.73, up 14% versus the third and up 42% annualized versus the second. Now if you adjust, which I'll cover again, if you adjust EPS, it totaled $0.76, excluding merger-related and restructuring charges and a few other items on Slide 4. 
Our GAAP ROA, ROE and ROTCE were 1.15%, 8.87% and 15.20%, which I think were very strong in this environment. Taxable-equivalent revenues totaled $2.8 billion, up 13.1% versus third of '15 and 3.9% versus second quarter of '16 on an annualized basis. I'm very pleased that our net interest margin declined only 2 basis points to 3.39%, and our core net interest margin increased to 3.17%. Daryl will give you a lot more color on that in just a little bit. 
Our GAAP efficiency ratio improved to 61.7% versus 65.4% in the second quarter of '16. Our adjusted efficiency ratio improved to 58.7% versus 59.6% in the second quarter. Improvement on -- noninterest expenses were $1.7 billion, a decrease of 19% versus the second quarter annualized. 
Average loans and leases held for investment totaled $141.3 billion in the third quarter, which was up just slightly compared to the second quarter. We do continue to have significant runoff in our Residential Mortgage portfolio and prime auto based on some very clear strategic decisions that we have made. 
Ex these, though, we had a respectable 3 -- 2.2% annual growth, which I think is pretty good consistent with the economic growth, and I'll talk a bit more about that in a minute. NPAs did continue, a slight decrease of 4.9%. 
We did settle a loss share agreement with the FDIC. Recall that we had a loss share agreement on that 2009 acquisition of Colonial. We incurred an $18 million charge this quarter, but it will result in future benefits with regard to earnings. We did settle a dated FHA insurance loan matter, and we made a $50 million charitable contribution, which will reduce expenses in future quarters. And as indicated, we did repurchase $160 million of outstanding shares. 
Now Slide 4, these selected items that I related to, the merger-related restructuring charges was $43 million pretax or $0.03 negative impact to diluted EPS. Charitable contribution is $50 million pretax, which was $0.04 dilution to EPS. On the other hand, we had a settlement of FHA insurance loan matters net of recoveries, which was a positive $73 million or $0.05 and then the termination of the FDIC loss share agreements, the $18 million I mentioned, was $0.01. So if you net those out, it was $0.03 net negative impact on EPS because of those selected items. 
If you go to Slide 5, a few comments with regard to loans. As I've said, they were up slightly 0.3%, but for several quarters now, we have indicated to you that we have been allowing our Residential Mortgage portfolio to decline. That's a strategic decision because of the mix of our business, expectations with regard to rising rates and the spreads, frankly, in that business. So the risk-adjusted return is not at a level we would like to be on a marginal basis and so we're letting it run off. And in the sales finance in the prime portfolio, we did restructure some quarters ago to a flat program. That program transition's actually going very well. The old portfolio is running off today but, frankly, the new portfolio going on is more profitable. So we feel good about that, but it does show a loan decline. So again, net adjusted 2.2%. 
We did have some key very strong performances on a seasonal basis, which we expect from some of our Specialized Lending businesses. Premium finance was up 57.1% annualized; Sheffield, up 21.3% annualized; Regional Acceptance, up 15.5% annualized; and revolving credit was up 9.6%. So you can see that while we're being very careful with regard to our basic growth portfolio, our Specialized Lending portfolio has continued to do very, very well. 
Now we, like probably others, did experience higher payoffs in our commercial area in the quarter. Frankly, a lot of good quality loans have just been refi-ed out into the market because of, I think, participants' expectations that rates are going up. So they're going on out and taking advantage of long-term loan markets. That's not a long-term change in terms of the commercial lending productivity. It's just a temporary increase in payoffs. Production in the pipelines and all still looks solid. 
And I'll remind you that we are a very disciplined lender. We're just not doing cheap loans outside of our risk appetite. But quite frankly, I mean, we could be growing faster, but the risk-adjusted return on equity's just unacceptable. So we're getting all that the market will give us and we're not going to try to beat the market. That's not a good bet from a long-term point of view. 
On Page 6, our DDA growth continue to be very strong at 14.3%, feel really good about that. We are increasing market share in most of our markets, and we continue to hold our costs at a very low 0.3%. So our deposit business is doing extremely well and supporting the asset growth that we have. 
Let me turn it to Daryl now for some additional detail, and then we'll have questions."
19109,379896003,1056792,"BB&T Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Truist Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. Turning to Slide 7. Overall, we had a really good quarter with regard to",1231,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. 
Turning to Slide 7. Overall, we had a really good quarter with regard to credit quality. Net charge-offs totaled $130 million, up 9 basis points from last quarter. This was mostly driven by expected seasonality in our retail portfolios as well as returning to more normalized levels after a very low charge-off quarter. 
Loans 30 to 89 days past due increased $66 million or 7.2%, again, mostly due to seasonality in our consumer-related portfolios. NPAs decreased 4.9% to 38 basis points. Excluding energy, NPAs have improved steadily in recent quarters. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect NPAs to remain at a similar range. We also expect net charge-offs to be in a range of 35 to 45 basis points assuming no unexpected deterioration in the economy. 
Continuing on Slide 8. Our energy portfolio totaled $1.3 billion, about 1% of total loans. Outstanding balances, total commitments and nonaccruals all decreased from last quarter, and all nonperforming borrowers are paying as agreed. 
Allocated reserves increased to 11.5%. This was mostly due to the implementation of guidance from the recent shared national credit review that was received in early October. We continue to have good quality mix, with less than 10% in oilfield services. Lastly, the reserve coverage for coal, a very modest portfolio, rose to 13.7%. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our allowance coverage ratios remained strong at 2.91x for net charge-offs and 2x for NPLs. The allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.06%, flat compared to last quarter. Excluding the acquired portfolio, the allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.15%. So our effective allowance coverage remains strong. 
As a reminder, our acquired loans have a combined mark of $670 million. We have recorded a provision of $148 million compared to net charge-offs of $130 million. Looking forward, our provision is expected to match charge-offs plus loan growth. 
Turning to Slide 10. Compared to last quarter, net interest margin was 3.39%, down 2 basis points. Core margin was 3.17%, up 1 basis point. The margin decrease mostly resulted from lower investment yields, which were down 15 basis points. 
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect GAAP margin to decline 3 to 5 basis points, driven by a reduction in benefits from purchase accounting. We expect core margin to remain essentially flat as lower rates will be offset by asset mix, funding cost and mix changes and the possibility of a rate increase in December. 
Additionally, we expect average earning assets to decline by approximately $1 billion next quarter due to lower security balances. Asset sensitivity increased, mostly due to growth in favorable funding sources and positive growth in short -- shorter asset classes. 
Continuing on Slide 11. Noninterest income totaled $1.2 billion, up $34 million compared to last quarter. The fee income ratio improved to 41.9%. 
Looking at a few other changes in noninterest income. Insurance income decreased $55 million, mostly driven by a seasonal decline in property and casualty commissions. Mortgage banking income increased $43 million due to net MSR valuation adjustments and higher production volumes. Other income decreased $10 million due to a $14 million decrease in income related to assets for certain postemployment benefits. 
And finally, we terminated our FDIC loss share agreements associated with Colonial. As a result, $18 million of expense was recognized in the third quarter. Going forward, no FDIC loss share expense will be recognized. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, total fee income is expected to be relatively flat as seasonally stronger insurance is expected to offset by the seasonal decline in mortgage banking income. 
Turning to Slide 12. We had an excellent quarter in terms of expense management. Noninterest expenses totaled $1.7 billion, down $86 million or 19% versus last quarter. Personnel expense decreased $33 million, driven by a $14 million decline in postemployment benefit expense and a $10 million decline in insurance incentive expense due to seasonality. Merger-related and restructuring charges decreased $49 million, largely due to lower acquisition-related charges and last quarter's restructuring charges related to real estate in the amount of $19 million. 
In addition, other expense decreased $34 million, mostly due to the $73 million net benefit related to the settlement of certain FHA-insured mortgages. This is partially offset by a charitable contribution of $50 million. Going forward, excluding merger-related restructuring charges and unusual items, we expect expenses to decrease slightly in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 13. Capital ratios remain very healthy with a fully phased-in common equity Tier 1 of 9.9%. Our LCR was 122%, and our liquid asset buffer was very strong at 13.6%. 
Finally, we will continue with our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter, repurchasing up to $160 million in our shares. 
Now let's look at our segments beginning on Slide 14. Community Bank net income totaled $338 million, an increase of $43 million from last quarter and up $78 million from third quarter of last year. Noninterest income increased $13 million, driven by higher service charges on deposits, letters of credit and bankcard fees. Majority of the growth experienced in the Community Bank was acquisition related. However, third quarter was our best commercial loan production for the year. 
Turning to Slide 15. Residential Mortgage Banking net income totaled $117 million, up $73 million from last quarter, driven by net MSR valuation adjustments and higher saleable loan volume as well as a net recovery from the settlement of FHA-insured loan matters. Production mix was 57% purchase and 43% refi, similar to last quarter. Gain on sale margins were slightly down 3 basis points to 1.06% versus last quarter. 
Looking to Slide 16. Dealer Financial Services income totaled $40 million, a decrease of $11 million compared to prior quarter. The provision for credit losses increased $18 million, mostly driven by loan growth as well as seasonally higher net charge-offs in the Regional Acceptance portfolio. Net charge-offs are still well within risk appetite of approximately 7%. Net charge-offs for the prime portfolio remain excellent at 19 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 17. Specialized Lending net income totaled $64 million, up $3 million from last quarter. This was driven mostly by loan and production growth in both Sheffield and equipment finance as well as strong production in Grandbridge, our commercial mortgage business. 
Looking at Slide 18. Insurance Services net income totaled $23 million, down $21 million from last quarter. Noninterest income totaled $412 million, down $53 million, mostly driven by seasonality in commercial property and casualty insurance. Noninterest expense decreased $21 million, mostly due to lower personnel expense, operating charge-offs and business referral expense. 
Turning to Slide 19. The Financial Services segment had $83 million in net income, down slightly, mostly due to a modest decline in Corporate Banking loan growth. Wealth generated strong loan and deposit growth, 8.6% and 13.7%, respectively, compared to last quarter. 
Lastly, the provision increase of $26 million was largely driven by risk rate mix changes, partially offset by lower loan balances. 
In summary, for the quarter, we achieved solid growth in revenues, continued strong credit quality and a relatively stable net interest margin and excellent expense control. Looking forward, we expect to improve outlook for loan growth, continued benign credit and solid expense control. 
Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A."

So as you've heard, we believe the quarter was an overall strong performance quarter. I would point out that our mergers are working really well. Expenses are being rationalized.

I would point out that our mergers are working really well. Expenses are being rationalized. Market acceptance in all of our new markets is very, very good, and our Community Bank teams are executing extremely well in expense reduction and revenue production. 
Our loan growth in today's market, to be honest, is just very, very challenging. Still, as Daryl indicated, we do expect our loan growth to be in the 1% to 3% range as we look forward to the fourth quarter. And that's going to be based on, we think, probably somewhat lower levels of payoffs. And we keep looking at possibilities of asset purchases from some other institutions that are rationalizing their balance sheet. So when you put it all together, we think that we'll be in the 1% to 3% range. 
And frankly, I expect not much of an impact on the fourth quarter, but as we head into next year, I think the market is likely to get better once we get through post elections. Part of what is going on in the third quarter in terms of this kind of a slowdown that everybody's talking about is there's just a lot of anxiety out. I saw a report a couple of days ago that 60% or slightly less, but about 60% of the market is just really, really anxious about the elections, and I personally quite understand that. And so I think when all this subsides, however it goes, there'll be less uncertainty and less anxiety. I think that will instill a bit more confidence and people will be a little bit more willing to invest and make acquisitions and borrow money. So I think that's a bit on the positive side. 
We did have several good strategic agreements that will help future earnings. We continue our systems investments, and I'd point out we did add 3 members to our executive management team. So we feel good about where we are, and we at BB&T are building for the future.

He clearly, I think, believes that a CCAR process needs to be much tougher on the large G-SIFIs versus the large regionals like BB&T. And so I think his speech simply, to some degree, codified his movement in that direction. But from our point of view, frankly, it does not change a lot because we have a robust CCAR process. We're not going to dismantle it just because we're under $250 today, it wouldn't make any sense. Number one, the way we're doing CCAR today, we actually benefit from it. We think it's a healthy process, and so we would continue to base [ph] as it is anyway even if the Fed dropped the whole requirements. But certainly, we wouldn't drop it and then have to pick it back up if we did a strategic deal to put us over $250 billion. So it was encouraging in that I think it signals that the intensity of change with regard to really banks under, I think, $500 billion is just not going to increase. In fact, it's kind of stable.

We're getting all the expense saves of the synergies that we thought we would. We're probably halfway through that process, and the conversion will occur in February. But your point is right on, in that the organic growth, primarily due to pricing and excess capital in the market, is generally in the 1% range. In fact, if you look at us year-to-date, we would be growing right on 1%. And there are several factors. Pricing is one. And if you look at the mix of businesses that we are in, the pure property and casualty business is probably down in the 1% to 2%, but the cat property, which is through our AmRisc business, is probably down in the 15% to 20%. So on balance, we're probably down 4% to 5%. Existing client growth, however, is up. We actually saw a new business growth in the third quarter, which I would assume would be abnormal in the industry today. I think that speaks well to the revenue machine that we've built over the years. And then you're likely to see our performance-based payments, which isn't really based on your -- kind of how you perform with your underwriters. The recent storm is really not large enough to create increases in pricing because there's so much excess capital. On the other hand, it does hurt us just a little bit. It won't be significant on our performance payment. So run rate going forward, I think as we really kind of put the business together, we've got a chance to continue to be positive and potentially accelerate if we get any kind of economic pickup. But I'd say it's in that sort of 1% to 2% kind of range looking forward."

With regard to Texas in general, our acquisitions of CD [ph] branches, de novo branches are going extremely well. The Texas market overall is doing well. We're beginning to see a little bit of softness in Houston around some multifamily and others, which you might expect. Nothing dramatic, but you're beginning to see the effect of that a bit, nowhere else really across Texas. So we're gaining momentum substantially. We have about a $7 billion or $8 billion operation in Texas at this point, which is strong. We're 14th in market share, up from 53rd in market share when we started in 2009. So Texas is still growing at about 1,000 people a day. So we'll continue to grow faster than the market in Texas, and continue to build out our franchise with de novo types of branch expansions. We will certainly, in the long term, be interested in acquisition, but that's not a part of our strategy today. And our organic strategy is play it very well.

So overall, I think we had a very strong performance quarter. We had record quarterly earnings, and we did complete a few strategic agreements which will benefit future quarters, which I'll describe. Net income of $599 million, which is up 21.7% versus third of '15 and 42.7% annualized versus second quarter '16. 
Diluted EPS was $0.73, up 14% versus the third and up 42% annualized versus the second. Now if you adjust, which I'll cover again, if you adjust EPS, it totaled $0.76, excluding merger-related and restructuring charges and a few other items on Slide 4. 
Our GAAP ROA, ROE and ROTCE were 1.15%, 8.87% and 15.20%, which I think were very strong in this environment. Taxable-equivalent revenues totaled $2.8 billion, up 13.1% versus third of '15 and 3.9% versus second quarter of '16 on an annualized basis. I'm very pleased that our net interest margin declined only 2 basis points to 3.39%, and our core net interest margin increased to 3.17%. Daryl will give you a lot more color on that in just a little bit. 
Our GAAP efficiency ratio improved to 61.7% versus 65.4% in the second quarter of '16. Our adjusted efficiency ratio improved to 58.7% versus 59.6% in the second quarter. Improvement on -- noninterest expenses were $1.7 billion, a decrease of 19% versus the second quarter annualized. 
Average loans and leases held for investment totaled $141.3 billion in the third quarter, which was up just slightly compared to the second quarter. We do continue to have significant runoff in our Residential Mortgage portfolio and prime auto based on some very clear strategic decisions that we have made. 
Ex these, though, we had a respectable 3 -- 2.2% annual growth, which I think is pretty good consistent with the economic growth, and I'll talk a bit more about that in a minute. NPAs did continue, a slight decrease of 4.9%. 
We did settle a loss share agreement with the FDIC. Recall that we had a loss share agreement on that 2009 acquisition of Colonial. We incurred an $18 million charge this quarter, but it will result in future benefits with regard to earnings. We did settle a dated FHA insurance loan matter, and we made a $50 million charitable contribution, which will reduce expenses in future quarters. And as indicated, we did repurchase $160 million of outstanding shares. 
Now Slide 4, these selected items that I related to, the merger-related restructuring charges was $43 million pretax or $0.03 negative impact to diluted EPS. Charitable contribution was $50 million pretax, which was $0.04 dilution to EPS. On the other hand, we had a settlement of FHA insurance loan matters net of recoveries, which was a positive $73 million or $0.05 and then the termination of the FDIC loss share agreements, the $18 million I mentioned, was $0.01. So if you net those out, it was $0.03 net negative impact on EPS because of those selected items. 
If you go to Slide 5, a few comments with regard to loans. As I've said, they were up slightly 0.3%, but for several quarters now, we have indicated to you that we have been allowing our Residential Mortgage portfolio to decline. That's a strategic decision because of the mix of our business, expectations with regard to rising rates and the spreads, frankly, in that business. So the risk-adjusted return is not at a level we would like to be on a marginal basis and so we're letting it run off. And in the sales finance in the prime portfolio, we did restructure some quarters ago to a flat program. That program transition's actually going very well. The old portfolio is running off today but, frankly, the new portfolio going on is more profitable. So we feel good about that, but it does show a loan decline. So again, net adjusted 2.2%. 
We did have some key very strong performances on a seasonal basis, which we expect from some of our Specialized Lending businesses. Premium finance was up 57.1% annualized; Sheffield, up 21.3% annualized; Regional Acceptance, up 15.5% annualized; and revolving credit was up 9.6%. So you can see that while we're being very careful with regard to our basic commercial portfolio, our Specialized Lending portfolio has continued to do very, very well. 
Now we, like probably others, did experience higher payoffs in our commercial area in the quarter. Frankly, a lot of good quality loans have just been refi-ed out into the market because of, I think, participants' expectations that rates are going up. So they're going on out and taking advantage of long-term low markets. That's not a long-term change in terms of the commercial lending productivity. It's just a temporary increase in payoffs. Production in the pipelines and all still looks solid. 
And I'll remind you that we are a very disciplined lender. We're just not doing cheap loans outside of our risk appetite. Because quite frankly, I mean, we could be growing faster, but the risk-adjusted return on equity's just unacceptable. So we're getting all that the market will give us and we're not going to try to beat the market. That's not a good bet from a long-term point of view. 
On Page 6, our DDA growth continues to be very strong at 14.3%, feel really good about that. We are increasing market share in most of our markets, and we continue to hold our costs at a very low 0.3%. So our deposit business is doing extremely well and supporting the asset growth that we have. 
Let me turn it to Daryl now for some additional detail, and then we'll have questions."
19109,379896003,1056855,"BB&T Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Truist Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. Turning to Slide 7. Overall, we had a really good quarter with regard to",1233,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. 
Turning to Slide 7. Overall, we had a really good quarter with regard to credit quality. Net charge-offs totaled $130 million, up 9 basis points from last quarter. This was mostly driven by expected seasonality in our retail portfolios as well as returning to more normalized levels after a very low charge-off quarter. 
Loans 30 to 89 days past due increased $66 million or 7.2%, again, mostly due to seasonality in our consumer-related portfolios. NPAs decreased 4.9% to 38 basis points. Excluding energy, NPAs have improved steadily in recent quarters. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect NPAs to remain at a similar range. We also expect net charge-offs to be in a range of 35 to 45 basis points assuming no unexpected deterioration in the economy. 
Continuing on Slide 8. Our energy portfolio totaled $1.3 billion, about 1% of total loans. Outstanding balances, total commitments and nonaccruals all decreased from last quarter, and all nonperforming borrowers are paying as agreed. 
Allocated reserves increased to 11.5%. This was mostly due to the implementation of guidance from the recent shared national credit review that was received in early October. We continue to have good quality mix, with less than 10% in oilfield services. Lastly, the reserve coverage for coal, a very modest portfolio, rose to 13.7%. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our allowance coverage ratios remained strong at 2.91x for net charge-offs and 2x for NPLs. The allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.06%, flat compared to last quarter. Excluding the acquired portfolio, the allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.15%. So our effective allowance coverage remains strong. 
As a reminder, our acquired loans have a combined mark of $670 million. We have recorded a provision of $148 million compared to net charge-offs of $130 million. Looking forward, our provision is expected to match charge-offs plus loan growth. 
Turning to Slide 10. Compared to last quarter, net interest margin was 3.39%, down 2 basis points. Core margin was 3.17%, up 1 basis point. The margin decrease mostly resulted from lower investment yields, which were down 15 basis points. 
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect GAAP margin to decline 3 to 5 basis points, driven by a reduction in benefits from purchase accounting. We expect core margin to remain essentially flat as lower rates will be offset by asset mix, funding cost and mix changes and the possibility of a rate increase in December. 
Additionally, we expect average earning assets to decline by approximately $1 billion next quarter due to lower security balances. Asset sensitivity increased, mostly due to growth in favorable funding sources and positive growth in short -- shorter asset classes. 
Continuing on Slide 11. Noninterest income totaled $1.2 billion, up $34 million compared to last quarter. The fee income ratio improved to 41.9%. 
Looking at a few other changes in noninterest income. Insurance income decreased $55 million, mostly driven by a seasonal decline in property and casualty commissions. Mortgage banking income increased $43 million due to a net MSR valuation adjustment and higher production volumes. Other income decreased $10 million due to a $14 million decrease in income related to assets for certain postemployment benefits. 
And finally, we terminated our FDIC loss share agreements associated with Colonial. As a result, $18 million of expense was recognized in the third quarter. Going forward, no FDIC loss share expense will be recognized. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, total fee income is expected to be relatively flat as seasonally stronger insurance is expected to offset by the seasonal decline in mortgage banking income. 
Turning to Slide 12. We had an excellent quarter in terms of expense management. Noninterest expenses totaled $1.7 billion, down $86 million or 19% versus last quarter. Personnel expense decreased $33 million, driven by a $14 million decline in postemployment benefit expense and a $10 million decline in insurance incentive expense due to seasonality. Merger-related and restructuring charges decreased $49 million, largely due to lower acquisition-related charges and last quarter's restructuring charges related to real estate in the amount of $19 million. 
In addition, other expense decreased $34 million, mostly due to the $73 million net benefit related to the settlement of certain FHA-insured mortgages. This is partially offset by a charitable contribution of $50 million. Going forward, excluding merger-related restructuring charges and unusual items, we expect expenses to decrease slightly in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 13. Capital ratios remain very healthy with a fully phased-in common equity Tier 1 of 9.9%. Our LCR was 122%, and our liquid asset buffer was very strong at 13.6%. 
Finally, we will continue with our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter, repurchasing up to $160 million in our shares. 
Now let's look at our segments beginning on Slide 14. Community Bank net income totaled $338 million, an increase of $43 million from last quarter and up $78 million from third quarter of last year. Noninterest income increased $13 million, driven by higher service charges on deposits, letters of credit and bank card fees. Majority of the growth experienced in the Community Bank was acquisition related. However, third quarter was our best commercial loan production for the year. 
Turning to Slide 15. Residential Mortgage Banking net income totaled $117 million, up $73 million from last quarter, driven by net MSR valuation adjustments and higher saleable loan volume as well as a net recovery from the settlement of FHA-insured loan matters. Production mix was 57% purchase and 43% refi, similar to last quarter. Gain on sale margins were slightly down 3 basis points to 1.06% versus last quarter. 
Looking to Slide 16. Dealer Financial Services income totaled $40 million, a decrease of $11 million compared to prior quarter. The provision for credit losses increased $18 million, mostly driven by loan growth as well as seasonally higher net charge-offs in the Regional Acceptance portfolio. Net charge-offs are still well within risk appetite of approximately 7%. Net charge-offs for the prime portfolio remain excellent at 19 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 17. Specialized Lending net income totaled $64 million, up $3 million from last quarter. This was driven mostly by loan and production growth in both Sheffield and equipment finance as well as strong production in Grandbridge, our commercial mortgage business. 
Looking at Slide 18. Insurance Services net income totaled $23 million, down $21 million from last quarter. Noninterest income totaled $412 million, down $53 million, mostly driven by seasonality in commercial property and casualty insurance. Noninterest expense decreased $21 million, mostly due to lower personnel expense, operating charge-offs and business referral expense. 
Turning to Slide 19. The Financial Services segment had $83 million in net income, down slightly, mostly due to a modest decline in Corporate Banking loan growth. Wealth generated strong loan and deposit growth, 8.6% and 13.7%, respectively, compared to last quarter. 
Lastly, the provision increase of $26 million was largely driven by risk rate mix changes, partially offset by lower loan balances. 
In summary, for the quarter, we achieved solid growth in revenues, continued strong credit quality and a relatively stable net interest margin and excellent expense control. Looking forward, we expect to improve outlook for loan growth, continued benign credit and solid expense control. 
Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A."

I would point out that our mergers are working really well. Expenses are being rationalized. Market acceptance in all of our new markets is very, very good, and our Community Bank teams are executing extremely well in expense reduction and revenue production. 
Our loan growth in today's market, to be honest, is just very, very challenging. Still, as Daryl indicated, we do expect our loan growth to be in the 1% to 3% range as we look forward to the fourth quarter. And that's going to be based on, we think, probably somewhat lower levels of payoffs. And we keep looking at possibilities of asset purchases from some other institutions that are rationalizing their balance sheet. So when you put it all together, we think that we'll be in the 1% to 3% range. 
And frankly, I expect not much of an impact on the fourth quarter, but as we head into next year, I think the market is likely to get better once we get through post elections. Part of what is going on in the third quarter in terms of this kind of a slowdown that everybody's talking about is there's just a lot of anxiety out. I saw a report a couple of days ago that 60% or slightly less, but about 60% of the market is just really, really anxious about the elections, and I personally quite understand that. And so I think when all this subsides, however it goes, there'll be less uncertainty and less anxiety. I think that will instill a bit more confidence and people will be a little bit more willing to invest and make acquisitions and borrow money. So I think that's a bit on the positive side. 
We did have several good strategic agreements that will help future earnings. We continue our systems investments, and I'd point out we did add 3 members to our executive management team. So we feel good about where we are, and we at BB&T are building for the future. 
Now I'll turn it to Alan."

He's been, I think, appropriately moving to adjust some of the initial Fed criteria around CCAR. He clearly, I think, believes that a CCAR process needs to be much tougher on the large G-SIFIs versus the large regionals like BB&T. And so I think his speech simply, to some degree, codified his movement in that direction. But from our point of view, frankly, it does not change a lot because we have a robust CCAR process. We're not going to dismantle it just because we're under $250 today, it wouldn't make any sense. Number one, the way we're doing CCAR today, we actually benefit from it. We think it's a healthy process, and so we would continue to base that as it is anyway even if the Fed dropped the whole requirements. But certainly, we wouldn't drop it and then have to pick it back up if we did a strategic deal to put us over $250 billion. So it was encouraging in that I think it signals that the intensity of change with regard to really banks under, I think, $500 billion is just not going to increase. In fact, it's kind of stable. And as he said, the intensity of additional increased scrutiny is on G-SIFIs, so that relatively is good news for us."

The 2 areas that we're most cautious in right now is multifamily because we believe the market may have peaked or is peaking. There's a lot of projects in the pipeline that are going to affect potentially absorption and vacancy and those sorts of things. So we're very careful to make sure we don't create an undue concentration there. And we'll see some issues market-by-market there, where you see some of those symptoms. The other area is hospitality. We think that's also at a peak and likely to potentially have some overcapacity as we move forward.

We're getting all the expense saves of the synergies that we thought we would. We're probably halfway through that process, and the conversion will occur in February. But your point is right on, in that the organic growth, primarily due to pricing and excess capital in the market, is generally in the 1% range. In fact, if you look at us year-to-date, we would be growing right on 1%. And there are several factors. Pricing is one. And if you look at the mix of businesses that we are in, the pure property and casualty business is probably down in the 1% to 2%, but the cat property, which is through our AmRisc business, is probably down in the 15% to 20%. So on balance, we're probably down 4% to 5%. Existing client growth, however, is up. We actually saw a new business growth in the third quarter, which I would assume would be abnormal in the industry today. I think that speaks well to the revenue machine that we've built over the years. And then you're likely to see our performance-based payments, which isn't really based on your -- kind of how you perform with your underwriters. The recent storm is really not large enough to create increases in pricing because there's so much excess capital. On the other hand, it does hurt us just a little bit. It won't be significant on our performance payment. So run rate going forward, I think as we really kind of put the business together, we've got a chance to continue to be positive and potentially accelerate if we get any kind of economic pickup. But I'd say it's in that sort of 1% to 2% kind of range looking forward."

With regard to Texas in general, our acquisitions of the Citi branches, de novo branches are going extremely well. The Texas market overall is doing well. We're beginning to see a little bit of softness in Houston around some multifamily and others, which you might expect. Nothing dramatic, but you're beginning to see the effect of that a bit, nowhere else really across Texas. So we're gaining momentum substantially. We have about a $7 billion or $8 billion operation in Texas at this point, which is strong. We're 14th in market share, up from 53rd in market share when we started in 2009. So Texas is still growing about 1,000 people a day. So we'll continue to grow faster than the market in Texas and continue to build out our franchise with de novo types of branch expansions.

Taxable-equivalent revenues totaled $2.8 billion, up 13.1% versus third of '15 and 3.9% versus second quarter of '16 on an annualized basis. I'm very pleased that our net interest margin declined only 2 basis points to 3.39%, and our core net interest margin increased to 3.17%. Daryl will give you a lot more color on that in just a little bit. 
Our GAAP efficiency ratio improved to 61.7% versus 65.4% in the second quarter of '16. Our adjusted efficiency ratio improved to 58.7% versus 59.6% in the second quarter. Improvement on -- noninterest expenses were $1.7 billion, a decrease of 19% versus the second quarter annualized. 
Average loans and leases held for investment totaled $141.3 billion in the third quarter, which was up just slightly compared to the second quarter. We do continue to have significant runoff in our Residential Mortgage portfolio and prime auto based on some very clear strategic decisions that we have made. 
Ex these, though, we had a respectable 3 -- 2.2% annual growth, which I think is pretty good consistent with the economic growth, and I'll talk a bit more about that in a minute. NPAs did continue, a slight decrease of 4.9%. 
We did settle a loss share agreement with the FDIC. Recall that we had a loss share agreement on that 2009 acquisition of Colonial. We incurred an $18 million charge this quarter, but it will result in future benefits with regard to earnings. We did settle a dated FHA insurance loan matter, and we made a $50 million charitable contribution, which will reduce expenses in future quarters. And as indicated, we did repurchase $160 million of outstanding shares. 
Now Slide 4, these selected items that I related to, the merger-related restructuring charges was $43 million pretax or $0.03 negative impact to diluted EPS. Charitable contribution was $50 million pretax, which was $0.04 dilution to EPS. On the other hand, we had a settlement of FHA insurance loan matters net of recoveries, which was a positive $73 million or $0.05 and then the termination of the FDIC loss share agreements, the $18 million I mentioned, was $0.01. So if you net those out, it was $0.03 net negative impact on EPS because of those selected items. 
If you go to Slide 5, a few comments with regard to loans. As I've said, they were up slightly 0.3%, but for several quarters now, we have indicated to you that we have been allowing our Residential Mortgage portfolio to decline. That's a strategic decision because of the mix of our business, expectations with regard to rising rates and the spreads, frankly, in that business. So the risk-adjusted return is not at a level we would like to be on a marginal basis and so we're letting it run off. And in the sales finance in the prime portfolio, we did restructure some quarters ago to a flat program. That program transition's actually going very well. The old portfolio is running off today but, frankly, the new portfolio going on is more profitable. So we feel good about that, but it does show a loan decline. So again, net adjusted 2.2%. 
We did have some key very strong performances on a seasonal basis, which we expect from some of our Specialized Lending businesses. Premium finance was up 57.1% annualized; Sheffield, up 21.3% annualized; Regional Acceptance, up 15.5% annualized; and revolving credit was up 9.6%. So you can see that while we're being very careful with regard to our basic commercial portfolio, our Specialized Lending portfolio has continued to do very, very well. 
Now we, like probably others, did experience higher payoffs in our commercial area in the quarter. Frankly, a lot of good quality loans have just been refi-ed out into the market because of, I think, participants' expectations that rates are going up. So they're going on out and taking advantage of long-term low markets. That's not a long-term change in terms of the commercial lending productivity. It's just a temporary increase in payoffs. Production in the pipelines and all still looks solid. 
And I'll remind you that we are a very disciplined lender. We're just not doing cheap loans outside of our risk appetite. Because quite frankly, I mean, we could be growing faster, but the risk-adjusted return on equity's just unacceptable. So we're getting all that the market will give us and we're not going to try to beat the market. That's not a good bet from a long-term point of view. 
On Page 6, our DDA growth continues to be very strong at 14.3%, feel really good about that. We are increasing market share in most of our markets, and we continue to hold our costs at a very low 0.3%. So our deposit business is doing extremely well and supporting the asset growth that we have. 
Let me turn it to Daryl now for some additional detail, and then we'll have questions."
19109,379896003,1057250,"BB&T Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Truist Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. Turning to Slide 7. Overall, we had a really good quarter with regard to",1233,"Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, noninterest expense, capital and our segment results. 
Turning to Slide 7. Overall, we had a really good quarter with regard to credit quality. Net charge-offs totaled $130 million, up 9 basis points from last quarter. This was mostly driven by expected seasonality in our retail portfolios as well as returning to more normalized levels after a very low charge-off quarter. 
Loans 30 to 89 days past due increased $66 million or 7.2%, again, mostly due to seasonality in our consumer-related portfolios. NPAs decreased 4.9% to 38 basis points. Excluding energy, NPAs have improved steadily in recent quarters. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect NPAs to remain at a similar range. We also expect net charge-offs to be in a range of 35 to 45 basis points assuming no unexpected deterioration in the economy. 
Continuing on Slide 8. Our energy portfolio totaled $1.3 billion, about 1% of total loans. Outstanding balances, total commitments and nonaccruals all decreased from last quarter, and all nonperforming borrowers are paying as agreed. 
Allocated reserves increased to 11.5%. This was mostly due to the implementation of guidance from the recent shared national credit review that was received in early October. We continue to have good quality mix, with less than 10% in oilfield services. Lastly, the reserve coverage for coal, a very modest portfolio, rose to 13.7%. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our allowance coverage ratios remained strong at 2.91x for net charge-offs and 2x for NPLs. The allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.06%, flat compared to last quarter. Excluding the acquired portfolio, the allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.15%. So our effective allowance coverage remains strong. 
As a reminder, our acquired loans have a combined mark of $670 million. We have recorded a provision of $148 million compared to net charge-offs of $130 million. Looking forward, our provision is expected to match charge-offs plus loan growth. 
Turning to Slide 10. Compared to last quarter, net interest margin was 3.39%, down 2 basis points. Core margin was 3.17%, up 1 basis point. The margin decrease mostly resulted from lower investment yields, which were down 15 basis points. 
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect GAAP margin to decline 3 to 5 basis points, driven by a reduction in benefits from purchase accounting. We expect core margin to remain essentially flat as lower rates will be offset by asset mix, funding cost and mix changes and the possibility of a rate increase in December. 
Additionally, we expect average earning assets to decline by approximately $1 billion next quarter due to lower security balances. Asset sensitivity increased, mostly due to growth in favorable funding sources and positive growth in short -- shorter asset classes. 
Continuing on Slide 11. Noninterest income totaled $1.2 billion, up $34 million compared to last quarter. The fee income ratio improved to 41.9%. 
Looking at a few other changes in noninterest income. Insurance income decreased $55 million, mostly driven by a seasonal decline in property and casualty commissions. Mortgage banking income increased $43 million due to a net MSR valuation adjustment and higher production volumes. Other income decreased $10 million due to a $14 million decrease in income related to assets for certain postemployment benefits. 
And finally, we terminated our FDIC loss share agreements associated with Colonial. As a result, $18 million of expense was recognized in the third quarter. Going forward, no FDIC loss share expense will be recognized. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, total fee income is expected to be relatively flat as seasonally stronger insurance is expected to offset by the seasonal decline in mortgage banking income. 
Turning to Slide 12. We had an excellent quarter in terms of expense management. Noninterest expenses totaled $1.7 billion, down $86 million or 19% versus last quarter. Personnel expense decreased $33 million, driven by a $14 million decline in postemployment benefit expense and a $10 million decline in insurance incentive expense due to seasonality. Merger-related and restructuring charges decreased $49 million, largely due to lower acquisition-related charges and last quarter's restructuring charges related to real estate in the amount of $19 million. 
In addition, other expense decreased $34 million, mostly due to the $73 million net benefit related to the settlement of certain FHA-insured mortgages. This is partially offset by a charitable contribution of $50 million. Going forward, excluding merger-related restructuring charges and unusual items, we expect expenses to decrease slightly in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 13. Capital ratios remain very healthy with a fully phased-in common equity Tier 1 of 9.9%. Our LCR was 122%, and our liquid asset buffer was very strong at 13.6%. 
Finally, we will continue with our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter, repurchasing up to $160 million in our shares. 
Now let's look at our segments beginning on Slide 14. Community Bank net income totaled $338 million, an increase of $43 million from last quarter and up $78 million from third quarter of last year. Noninterest income increased $13 million, driven by higher service charges on deposits, letters of credit and bank card fees. Majority of the growth experienced in the Community Bank was acquisition related. However, third quarter was our best commercial loan production for the year. 
Turning to Slide 15. Residential Mortgage Banking net income totaled $117 million, up $73 million from last quarter, driven by net MSR valuation adjustments and higher saleable loan volume as well as a net recovery from the settlement of FHA-insured loan matters. Production mix was 57% purchase and 43% refi, similar to last quarter. Gain on sale margins were slightly down 3 basis points to 1.06% versus last quarter. 
Looking to Slide 16. Dealer Financial Services income totaled $40 million, a decrease of $11 million compared to prior quarter. The provision for credit losses increased $18 million, mostly driven by loan growth as well as seasonally higher net charge-offs in the Regional Acceptance portfolio. Net charge-offs are still well within risk appetite of approximately 7%. Net charge-offs for the prime portfolio remain excellent at 19 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 17. Specialized Lending net income totaled $64 million, up $3 million from last quarter. This was driven mostly by loan and production growth in both Sheffield and equipment finance as well as strong production in Grandbridge, our commercial mortgage business. 
Looking at Slide 18. Insurance Services net income totaled $23 million, down $21 million from last quarter. Noninterest income totaled $412 million, down $53 million, mostly driven by seasonality in commercial property and casualty insurance. Noninterest expense decreased $21 million, mostly due to lower personnel expense, operating charge-offs and business referral expense. 
Turning to Slide 19. The Financial Services segment had $83 million in net income, down slightly, mostly due to a modest decline in Corporate Banking loan growth. Wealth generated strong loan and deposit growth, 8.6% and 13.7%, respectively, compared to last quarter. 
Lastly, the provision increase of $26 million was largely driven by risk rate mix changes, partially offset by lower loan balances. 
In summary, for the quarter, we achieved solid growth in revenues, continued strong credit quality and a relatively stable net interest margin and excellent expense control. Looking forward, we expect to improve outlook for loan growth, continued benign credit and solid expense control. 
Now let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A."
19109,379896003,1057250,"BB&T Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Truist Financial Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Daryl. So as you've heard, we believe the quarter was an overall strong performance quarter. I would point out that our mergers are working really well. Expenses are being rationalized.

I would point out that our mergers are working really well. Expenses are being rationalized. Market acceptance in all of our new markets is very, very good, and our Community Bank teams are executing extremely well in expense reduction and revenue production. 
Our loan growth in today's market, to be honest, is just very, very challenging. Still, as Daryl indicated, we do expect our loan growth to be in the 1% to 3% range as we look forward to the fourth quarter. And that's going to be based on, we think, probably somewhat lower levels of payoffs. And we keep looking at possibilities of asset purchases from some other institutions that are rationalizing their balance sheet. So when you put it all together, we think that we'll be in the 1% to 3% range. 
And frankly, I expect not much of an impact on the fourth quarter, but as we head into next year, I think the market is likely to get better once we get through post elections. Part of what is going on in the third quarter in terms of this kind of a slowdown that everybody's talking about is there's just a lot of anxiety out. I saw a report a couple of days ago that 60% or slightly less, but about 60% of the market is just really, really anxious about the elections, and I personally quite understand that. And so I think when all this subsides, however it goes, there'll be less uncertainty and less anxiety. I think that will instill a bit more confidence and people will be a little bit more willing to invest and make acquisitions and borrow money. So I think that's a bit on the positive side. 
We did have several good strategic agreements that will help future earnings. We continue our systems investments, and I'd point out we did add 3 members to our executive management team. So we feel good about where we are, and we at BB&T are building for the future. 
Now I'll turn it to Alan."

He's been, I think, appropriately moving to adjust some of the initial Fed criteria around CCAR. He clearly, I think, believes that a CCAR process needs to be much tougher on the large G-SIFIs versus the large regionals like BB&T. And so I think his speech simply, to some degree, codified his movement in that direction. But from our point of view, frankly, it does not change a lot because we have a robust CCAR process. We're not going to dismantle it just because we're under $250 today, it wouldn't make any sense. Number one, the way we're doing CCAR today, we actually benefit from it. We think it's a healthy process, and so we would continue to base that as it is anyway even if the Fed dropped the whole requirements. But certainly, we wouldn't drop it and then have to pick it back up if we did a strategic deal to put us over $250 billion. So it was encouraging in that I think it signals that the intensity of change with regard to really banks under, I think, $500 billion is just not going to increase. In fact, it's kind of stable.

We're getting all the expense saves of the synergies that we thought we would. We're probably halfway through that process, and the conversion will occur in February. But your point is right on, in that the organic growth, primarily due to pricing and excess capital in the market, is generally in the 1% range. In fact, if you look at us year-to-date, we would be growing right on 1%. And there are several factors. Pricing is one. And if you look at the mix of businesses that we are in, the pure property and casualty business is probably down in the 1% to 2%, but the cat property, which is through our AmRisc business, is probably down in the 15% to 20%. So on balance, we're probably down 4% to 5%. Existing client growth, however, is up. We actually saw a new business growth in the third quarter, which I would assume would be abnormal in the industry today. I think that speaks well to the revenue machine that we've built over the years. And then you're likely to see our performance-based payments, which isn't really based on your -- kind of how you perform with your underwriters. The recent storm is really not large enough to create increases in pricing because there's so much excess capital. On the other hand, it does hurt us just a little bit. It won't be significant on our performance payment. So run rate going forward, I think as we really kind of put the business together, we've got a chance to continue to be positive and potentially accelerate if we get any kind of economic pickup. But I'd say it's in that sort of 1% to 2% kind of range looking forward."
