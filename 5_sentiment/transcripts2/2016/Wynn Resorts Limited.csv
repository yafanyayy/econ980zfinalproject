Joining us on behalf of the company today are Steve Wynn, Matt Maddox, Maurice Wooden and myself here in Las Vegas.

And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Mr. Wynn."

I think probably what's interesting is to say that January in Macau, if I can anticipate some of the questions, was our best month in a long time, happy to say so. And Chinese New Year is in progress but early in the week, a little too soon to say. 
The mass component clearly looks a little stronger than in the past. It's too soon to tell because the weekend's coming up with the VIPs. So that's pretty much the way we feel about China in terms of current first quarter numbers. 
With regard to Las Vegas, January was terrific, and Super Bowl and February are off to a roaring start. And between that and President's weekend, Las Vegas is in apple pie shape up through the 15th, which will be Monday. The question in Las Vegas will be how's the last 14 days, but as of now, business is pretty good in the United States and holding its own in Macau.
With regard to our project, we issued some statements. We're working with our contractor to get them to catch up, so that we'll have an opening in June. They believe they'll make the June 25 date, which was the contract date of our relationship with our builder, and it's possible they could be late, but hopefully they won't be. We're working very closely with them to try and catch up in any areas that need to be caught up, and our fancy hotel will be ready for public display later this year. 
We're going to start work in Boston, hard construction. We're doing remediation at the moment. We've come to happy terms with our neighbors in Boston, and that was a relief. And now, we're going to proceed with constructing this wonderful destination resort in Boston Metropolitan area and Everett and benefit, I hope, people throughout the region and have a very exciting hotel to boot. 
And with that, and reminding you that all of us are here to take your questions. We'll begin to do so."

We sold our Ferrari dealership to the Rolls-Royce dealer in town, Roger Penske and I, and reclaiming that valuable space. We're moving poker over to Encore, and starting at the casino corner where the ticket counter is now for the showrooms, we're going to have retail and the new retail mall that goes through where Ferrari was and a 2-story building with a beautiful glass roof, an atrium kind of structure that has 75,000 feet of rentable space. And we expect it will pick up somewhere between $20 million and $25 million in extra income and probably $0.30 worth of new payroll. I mean, it just pick up in EBITDA because we had 300-or-more feet on The Strip right on the sidewalk in unused real estate that was very, very valuable and along with other real estate that we own in Las Vegas, represents opportunity for future development that is quite unique. We -- I remind everybody that the golf course is 130 acres, and we have 1,000-acre feet of water in our own wells that were purchased with the desert and water company in 2000. I look at that as an asset. And China and its complexity has made us refocus on some of the things that we have going for us and are already in our -- under our control. So all of that is the kind of thing that we can examine. As I told you, The Strip real estate I've already committed to withdrawing, and the project's underway. It probably cost $70 million and the interest on the money is if we borrow 100% of it or if we use our cash, our cost of money, is less than 5%, and we pick up $20 million or $23 million in EBITDA just by plucking off something that we own for nothing. We've got a lot of options like that here, and that makes a company exciting. So it's another reason why I like the stock because none of our assets are secret. None of the opportunities that this company possesses are unknown to anybody. They're all sitting out there in plain view, and I don't mind discussing them when someone asks, but I'm certainly not going to ignore them. I think Boston's going to be -- the Everett, Boston metropolitan area opportunity is enormous, and we can't wait to be there. It's the first time we've ever had a hotel that's nonstop service from every major capital in the world, Hainan Airlines and Cathay Pacific fly nonstop from Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai to Boston. So does every other world capital, nonstop to Boston, and we're 12 minutes from Logan Airport with our new hotel. So all of that sort of makes me feel confident and positive about our future prospects."

And when we talk about devaluation, QE 1, 2 and 3 took the U.S. dollar down by 18% or 20%.

That's a description of where we stand. Now in the trenches, the work is feverish. There are 9,500 people on the job, and everybody has got their chins down and are paying attention. It's a very, very ambitious, extravagant product. I've talked about it over a period of a year or 2 to all of you in these conference calls. We aim very high, and that's put pressure on the finishes of the building. Of course, it's a fancy place, to say the least. And all the subs are working to their best shot, and they'll get there. They'll get there. Give or take a few weeks, I think we're going to be fine. Not that much more you can say about it than that. I mean, when they told me they were going to finish early in September, they gave us a written notice that they were going to achieve the early completion bonus of $38 million, and so we shared that with you because they notified us in writing. And then when they told us that, that was doubtful because we had shared it with the public, we thought it was incumbent upon us to also share with the public that there wasn't going to be an early bonus or an early completion, but I want to remind everybody that the original contract was for June 25, that we will complete this project in the first half of 2016. And hopefully, that date will stand or right close to it, and that's where we are at the moment."

Usually, the way it's worked in the past, we have 2 critical paths. One is that of the completion, the construction and the finishing of the building, and the other one is the critical path that is the spooling up and the hiring and training of the full staff of thousands of people to run the place. Under ideal conditions, those 2 critical paths move in exactly parallel and coterminous step. They meet at the exact same points on the opening day. When the construction gets behind, in and of itself, that's not a big deal. I mean, so the building is a few weeks late, but what is important is that you don't go and hire all bunch of people that are sitting getting paid and twiddling their thumbs. That's very, very damaging financially. So what I did with Matthew when we were there a couple of months ago, I've changed the order of March, and I said I want our landmark dates on turnover of the building to occur before we do the hiring, if possible. In other words, let's make sure that our critical path of hiring doesn't get ahead of the critical path of the building. Then the impact of being a few weeks late is not so -- is not quite as serious as it might have been if we went to full staff. So that's where that stands, and I'm happy to say that we are in equilibrium at the moment."

There are advantages and disadvantages of having a high-end super quality resort. For example, your average customer tends to be a little wealthier, a little better able to afford more expensive food and wine and hotel rates. On the other hand, if you were at the place of choice for baccarat for international visitors, anything that interferes with that tends to work against you because we had more baccarat business than anybody else in Las Vegas. So when baccarat's affected from China, we're the ones that get the biggest impact. On the other hand, there's still a lot of good customers around. And from what we can see, we're still one of the places of first choice, if not the place of first choice, and we do everything we can to keep it that way, of course. And since New Year's, it's working as it was designed to work. We've got better room rates, and our casino's profitable. Our margins in the casino, even though sometimes our drop or our handle is off, we tend to be very fastidious about having all of our games be profitable. We don't pay so much attention to the top line as we do to the bottom line. So when we evaluate the casino, we don't evaluate the handle or the win. We evaluate the contribution to EBITDA of our games, and we try to maximize every foot of the casino with one metric in mind: contribution of EBITDA per foot. Well, that sort of thing comes home after a while, and we get the benefits of it, and we see it now. That's why I said the place is in good shape. I'm happy with their performance, and our turnout for New Year's, for Christmas, New Year's, in January with the conventions. It's another thing, when there there's a big city wide convention and corporate leaders and high-paid people come to the conventions, they want to stay here, and their propensity to gamble is higher as is their desire to eat at better restaurants and shop at better stores and so forth. So I'm happy with the way Wynn Las Vegas is performing, and that's what I meant when I said it's an apple pie shape. That's an old-fashioned expression. Did I answer your question?"

We made modest adjustments in the facility presentation and the furniture, so to speak. But look, there used to be this avalanche of revenue for all these casinos and all these junket operators in Macau. So now, there are fewer of them. So where are they going to gamble? I mean, they're going to go to the place that somehow meets all of their expectations. We designed a place to be that. So I think that considering how many casinos there are in America and in Las Vegas, and we get more than our share of the business, then to worry about whether you're going to get more -- get a proper share in Macau is really a waste of time. The answer is positively yes. We'll be able to fill our casino with the most selective customers available on the market. I'm sure of that, and we'll have a demonstration of that shortly this summer. But let's not think that all VIP players have disappeared because that's simply enough the way it works. They have been lessened in number, but there's still a lot of them around."

We can advertise very limited ways about rooms, but they're very, very careful of that there. I'm not sure that a place like Wynn Palace lends itself to mass marketing techniques, places like the kind we operate. 99% of the marketing is word-of-mouth. See, the people that would come and stay in Macau, as large as that country is, the percentage of the population that comes to Macau is relatively small compared to the total size of the country. And that group that comes to Macau, they know everything about every hotel. They go to the one they can afford or they go to the one they think is best depending on their income status. So what happens is within 60 or 90 days of when Wynn Palace opens up, an enormous percentage of that market will -- the people who attend that market will know all about it, and word-of-mouth will take place the first 12 months that place is open, and it will establish itself as Wynn and The Peninsula did as the nicest place to stay, and we never advertised at The Peninsula in the first Wynn Macau nor did we advertise in Encore. And we filled those thousand rooms, and we could have filled 2,000 of them, and we got 1,700 new rooms, and I'm not sure what we would gain if we could advertise in every place, but you could be sure that any wealthy guy that's in Beijing, Shanghai, or who's ever close to Macau, they know all about us already. That's one of the good things about the gaming type of visitor. They're very, very hip. Everybody knew about Caesar's Palace and Bellagio and Mirage within a few months when they opened. And so commercial advertising and traditional marketing isn't quite as important when you open up really grand destination hotels. Everybody writes about them and talks about them.

I'm confident that the government wants these places to get off on the right foot, and I think that the government will do what they have to do to see that, that happens, and that's the basis of my confidence.

It's just the size of the country, the priority that the central government has put on the success of both SARs, both the special administrative regions, both Hong Kong and Macau. The dynamism of that country is overwhelming. And remember that the Communist Party is a meritocracy in China. And although one leader may be a bit more conservative than his predecessor or a bit more liberal, generally speaking, they want a successful life for the citizens of China and for the people in Hong Kong and Macau. The personalities of those cities are highly developed and not under discussion anymore. Macau is the destination resort place along with Henson Island, and Hong Kong is the financial center. There's no argument in the higher echelons of government of People's Republic of China on what role those cities play in the overall scheme of things in China. And so consistent with what I said a moment ago that the government seeks to make the country successful, I'm positive that they will. That doesn't mean that in the short term, the enormity of problems they face is directly proportional to the enormity of the country. It's 4x the size of the United States. And imagine the problems we have and the complexity that our government faces with 350 million or 330 million people. How would you like to add a billion to that without the kind of infrastructure we've got? I mean, managing China is a daunting task, and they've got a lot of smart people doing it. And where they've come, you draw your confidence in the future from a careful study of the past. Starting with Deng Xiaoping in 1979 when he said if it's a black cat or a white cat, it doesn't make a difference to me as long as it catches mice, it's a good cat. The government of Macau -- of China has been empirical and pragmatic and has brought hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, a feat unequaled in the history of civilization in any country. Obviously, somebody's doing something wrong -- doing something right rather. They're tapping into the latent energy of that population. Why would we consider that, that would not continue? And when it comes to recreation, Macau is the place of choice. That big picture kind of common sense based upon history is the basis that so -- when you ask where is the inflection point, I don't know that, but when you ask me why do I think the long-term prospects in Macau are incredibly positive, that's my answer. I love being part of the Chinese scene as a businessman. That doesn't mean that there aren't short-term discomfort and adjustments. But hell, what kind of adjustments do we have to make in the United States considering what's going on? It's just as tricky here as it is there. Did I help you with that answer? You made an intelligent question. I don't know if I gave an intelligent answer."

And you thought by so doing, you would give yourself a competitive advantage, almost as if you had a trick up your sleeve then I will tell you what you would have to do to get to that point. And if we've got a trick up our sleeve, here it is, and I'm going to confess. The way you make a hotel go to another level is you start with every single minute element of it. And as you construct the plan for the building and the design and the human resource engineering, you revisit every single assumption once again from day 1 using all of your experience and asking how could we make each individual component better? And if you did that from the bottom up starting with the back of the house, the doorway, the lighting, the hallway widths, the training of the employees, the compensation of the employees, the way you cook their food, the way you clean the floor, everything. What it's like when you're laying in the bed? What do you see when you're in this room or that room type? If you have the patience and the experience to take that journey, which would take you at least 2 years before you could build the building, then you would have traveled our path to the creation of Wynn Palace, and that is what we did, and that's how we're doing it. And if we're right, it'll work. And if not, boohoo. Does that answer your question? We're going to do what we've always done. We're going to keep trying to make it better in every way and that -- look, the customers aren't going to change. They're people who come to Las Vegas and Macau to live big and have fun. And whoever gives them that product consistently and fully wins the race to the top, I guess, the way to put it or ends up in first position. Now that doesn't mean that we're going to be bigger than anybody else. It will mean that our hotel will be successful, and we'll have a proper return on its investment and that sort of thing, and we'll have a loyal and growing clientele. Now we took the long way home in The Peninsula. We weren't the first to open in Macau. We just made the most money when we built the place downtown, and that's Wynn Macau now. So I don't see any reason to change our strategy. It's not broke. We don't need to fix it. And in the hospitality business whether you're in Boston, Macau, Las Vegas or anywhere else, the rules aren't going to change. We know who our customers are. We know what they want, and we're going to try to figure out a better way to give it to them. That's my ace in the hole. That's my secret, which I just blabbed out. So now everybody knows. Funny thing is they haven't copied it in the past."

I think probably what's interesting is to say that January in Macau, if I can anticipate some of the questions, was our best month in a long time. Happy to say so. And Chinese New Year is in progress. But early in the week, a little too soon to say. The mass component clearly looks a little stronger than in the past. It's too soon to tell because the weekend's coming up with the VIPs. So that's pretty much the way we feel about China in terms of current first quarter numbers. 
With regard to Las Vegas, January was terrific, and Super Bowl and February are off to a roaring start. And between that and President's weekend, Las Vegas is an apple pie shape up through the 15, which will be Monday. The question in Las Vegas will be, how's the last 14 days? But as of now, business is pretty good in the United States and holding its own in Macau.
With regard to our project, we have issued some statements. We're working with our contractor to get them to catch up so that we'll have an opening in June. They believe they'll make the June 25 date, which was the contract date of our relationship with our builder. And it's possible they could be late, but hopefully, they won't be. We're working very closely with them to try and catch up in any areas that need to be caught up, and our fancy hotel will be ready for public display later this year. 
We're going to start work in Boston, a hard construction. We're doing remediation at the moment. We've come to happy terms with our neighbors in Boston, and that was a relief. And now we're going to proceed with constructing this wonderful destination resort in Boston metropolitan area and Everett and benefit, I hope, people throughout the region and have a very exciting hotel to boot.

We sold our Ferrari dealership to the Rolls-Royce dealer in town, Roger Penske and I, and reclaiming that valuable space. We're moving poker over to Encore. And starting at the casino corner where the ticket counter is now for the showrooms, we're going to have retail and a new retail mall that goes through where Ferrari was and a 2-story building with a beautiful glass roof, an atrium kind of structure, that has 75,000 feet of rentable space. And we expect it will pick up somewhere between $20 million and $25 million in extra income and probably $0.30 worth of new payroll. I mean, it's just a pickup in EBITDA because we had 300-or-more feet on The Strip right on the sidewalk in unused real estate that was very, very valuable and along with other real estate that we own in Las Vegas, represents an opportunity for future development that is quite unique. We -- I'll remind everybody that the golf course is 130 acres, and we have 1,000 acre feet of water in our own wells that were purchased with the desert and water company in 2000. I look at that as an asset. And China and its complexity has made us refocus on some of the things that we have going for us and are already in our -- under our control. So all of that is the kind of thing that we can examine. As I told you, The Strip real estate, I've already committed to withdrawing, and the project's underway. It probably costs $70 million, and the interest on the money is if we borrow 100% of it or if we used our cash, our cost of money, is less than 5%, and we pick up $20 million or $23 million in EBITDA just by plucking off something that we own for nothing. We've got a lot of options like that here, and that makes a company exciting. It's another reason why I like the stock because none of our assets are a secret. None of the opportunities that this company possesses are unknown to anybody. They're all sitting out there in plain view. And I don't mind discussing them when someone asks, but I'm certainly not going to ignore them. I think Boston's going to be -- the Everett, Boston metropolitan area opportunity is enormous, and we can't wait to be there. It's the first time we've ever had a hotel that has nonstop service from every major capital in the world, Hainan Airlines and Cathay Pacific fly nonstop from Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai to Boston. So does every other world capital. Nonstop to Boston. And we're 12 minutes from Logan Airport with our new hotel.

Usually, the way it's worked in the past, we have 2 critical paths: One is that of the completion, the construction and the finishing of the building; and the other one is the critical path that is the spooling up and the hiring and training of the full staff of thousands of people to run the place. And under ideal conditions, those 2 critical paths move in exactly parallel and a coterminous step. They meet at the exact same point on the opening day. When the construction gets behind, in and of itself, that's not a big deal. I mean, so? The building is a few weeks late. But what is important is that you don't go and hire all bunch of people that are sitting getting paid and twiddling their thumbs. That's very, very damaging financially. So what I did with Matthew when we were there a couple of months ago, I've changed the order of March. And I said I want our landmark dates on turnover of the building to occur before we do the hiring, if possible. In other words, let's make sure that our critical path of hiring doesn't get ahead of the critical path of the building. Then the impact of being a few weeks late is not so -- is not quite as serious as it might have been if we went to full staff.

There are advantages and disadvantages of having a high-end, super-quality resort. For example, your average customer tends to be a little wealthier, a little better able to afford more expensive food and wine and hotel rates. On the other hand, if you are the place of choice for baccarat for international visitors, anything that interferes with that tends to work against you because we had more baccarat business than anybody else in Las Vegas. So when baccarat's affected from China, we're the ones that get the biggest impact. On the other hand, there's still a lot of good customers around. And from what we can see, we're still the -- one of the places of first choice, if not the place of first choice. And we do everything we can to keep it that way, of course. And since New Year's, it's working as it was designed to work. We've got better room rates, and our casino's profitable. Our margins in the casino, even though sometimes our drop or our handle is off, we tend to be very fastidious about having all of our games be profitable. We don't pay so much attention to the top line as we do to the bottom line. So when we evaluate the casino, we don't evaluate the handle or the win. We evaluate the contribution to EBITDA of our games, and we try to maximize every foot of the casino with one metric in mind: contribution of EBITDA per foot. Well, that sort of thing comes home after a while, and we get the benefits of it, and we see it now. That's why I said the place was in good shape. I'm happy with the performance, and our turnout for New Year's, for Christmas, New Year's, January with the conventions. It's another thing. When there there's a big citywide convention and corporate leaders and high-paid people come to the conventions, they want to stay here. And their propensity to gamble is higher as is their desire to eat in better restaurants and shop in better stores and so forth.

I'd say baccarat business is off in Las Vegas, unquestionably. Is it going to get worse? Or is it stabilized? I don't know. Too soon for me to answer that question. But if there's a recession in America, and it's hard to see why there won't be if we keep going the way we are, then Las Vegas will ultimately reflect whatever is going on in the rest of the United States. It always has. There sometimes have been a delay if conventions are booked and things like that. But at the end, we always seem to be just like anybody else, part of America and a big reflection of it. So I don't want you to construe my remarks about a healthy January and a promising February to mean that we're running counter to anything else you're seeing. We're just lucky, that's all. Just luck we are holding high. I don't want to make too much of it."

And our building was -- we made an adjustment to allow for some of the junket areas to be premium mass and stuff like that. We made modest adjustments in the facility presentation and the furniture, so to speak. But look, there used to be this avalanche of revenue for all these casinos and all these junket operators in Macau. So now there are fewer of them. So where are they going to gamble? I mean, they're going to go to the place that somehow meets all of their expectations. We designed a place to be that. So I think that considering how many casinos there are in America and in Las Vegas, and we get more than our share of the business, to worry about whether you're going to get more -- get a proper share in Macau is really a waste of time. The answer is positively yes. We'll be able to fill our casino with the most selective customers available in the market. I'm sure of that, and we'll have a demonstration of that shortly this summer. But let's not think that all VIP players have disappeared because that's simply not the way it works. They have been lessened in number, but there's still a lot of them around."

We can advertise very limited ways about rooms, but they're very, very careful of that. And I'm not sure that a place like Wynn Palace lends itself to mass marketing techniques, places like the kind we operate. 99% of the marketing is word of mouth. See, the people that would come and stay in Macau, as large as that country is, the percentage of the population that comes to Macau is relatively small compared to the total size of the country. And that group that comes to Macau, they know everything about every hotel. They go to the one they can afford or they go to the one they think is best depending on their income status. So what happens is within 60 or 90 days of when Wynn Palace opens up, an enormous percentage of that market will -- the people who attend that market will know all about it, and word of mouth will take place the first 12 months that place is open, and it'll establish itself as Wynn and The Peninsula did as the nicest place to stay. And we never advertised in The Peninsula, in the first Wynn Macau nor did we advertise in Encore. And we filled those thousand rooms, and we could have filled 2,000 of them. And we got 1,700 new rooms, and I'm not sure what we would gain if we could advertise in every place. But you could be sure that any wealthy guy that's in Beijing, Shanghai, Fuxin, Guangzhou or Dalian who's ever goes to Macau, they know all about us already. That's one of the good things about the gaming-type visitor. They're very, very hip. Everybody knew about Caesars Palace and Bellagio and Mirage within a few months when they opened. And so commercial advertising and traditional marketing isn't quite as important when you open up really grand destination hotels. Everybody writes about them and talks about them. So that's not actually one of the problems that I'm trying to solve at the moment."

It's just the size of the country, the priority that the central government has put on the success of both SARs, both the Special Administrative Regions, both Hong Kong and Macau. The dynamism of that country is overwhelming. And remember that the communist party is a meritocracy in China. And although one leader may be a bit more conservative than his predecessor or a bit more liberal, generally speaking, they want a successful life for the citizens of China and for the people in Hong Kong and Macau. The personalities of those cities are highly developed and not under discussion anymore. Macau is the destination resort place along with Hanson Island, and Hong Kong is the financial center. There's no argument in the higher echelons of government of People's Republic of China on what role those cities play in the overall scheme of things in China. And so consistent with what I said a moment ago that the government seeks to make the country successful, I'm positive that they will. That doesn't mean that in the short term, the enormity of problems they face is directly proportional to the enormity of the country. It's 4x the size of the United States. And imagine the problems we have and the complexity that our government faces with 350 million or 330 million people. How would you like to add 1 billion to that without the kind of infrastructure we've got? I mean, managing China is a daunting task, and they got a lot of smart people doing it. And where they've come, you draw your confidence in the future from a careful study of the past. Starting with Deng Xiaoping in 1979, when he said if it's a black cat or a white cat, it doesn't make any difference to me. So long as it catches mice, it's a good cat. The government of Macau -- of China has been empirical and pragmatic and has brought hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, a feat unequaled in the history of civilization in any country. Obviously, somebody's doing something wrong -- doing something right, rather. They're tapping into the latent energy of that population. Why would we consider that, that would not continue? And when it comes to recreation, Macau is the place of choice. That big-picture kind of common sense based upon history is the basis that -- so when you ask where is the inflection point, I don't know that. But when you ask me why do I think the long-term prospects in Macau are incredibly positive, that's my answer. I love being part of the Chinese scene as a businessman. That doesn't mean that there aren't short-term discomfort and adjustments. But hell, what kind of adjustments do we have to make in the United States considering what's going on? It's just as tricky here as it is there. Did I help you with that answer? You made an intelligent question. I don't know if I gave an intelligent answer."

And if we've got a trick up our sleeve, here it is, and I'm going to confess. The way you make a hotel go to another level is you start with every single minute element of it. And as you construct the plan for the building and the design and the human resource engineering, you revisit every single assumption once again from day 1 using all of your experience and asking how could we make each individual component better. And if you did that from the bottom up starting with the back of the house, the doorway, the lighting, the hallway widths, the training of the employees, the compensation of the employees, the way you cook their food, the way you clean the floor, everything, what it's like when you're laying in the bed? What do you see when you're in this room or that room type? If you had the patience and the experience to take that journey, which would take you at least 2 years before you could bid the building, then you would have traveled our path in the creation of Wynn Palace. And that is what we did. That's how we're doing it. And if we're right, it'll work. And if not, boo hoo. Does that answer your question? We're going to do what we've always done. We're going to keep trying to make it better in every way. And that -- look, the customers aren't going to change. They're people who come to Las Vegas and Macau to live big and have fun. And whoever gives them that product consistently and fully wins the race to the top, I guess, the way to put it or ends up in first position. Now that doesn't mean that we're going to be bigger than anybody else. It will mean that our hotel will be successful, and we'll have a proper return on its investment and that sort of thing, and we'll have a loyal and growing clientele. Now we took the long way home in The Peninsula. We weren't the first to open in Macau. We just made the most money when we built the place downtown, and that's Wynn Macau now. So I don't see any reason to change our strategy. It's not broke. We don't need to fix it. And in the hospitality business, whether you're in Boston, Macau, Las Vegas or anywhere else, the rules aren't going to change. We know who our customers are. We know what they want, and we're going to try to figure out a better way to give it to them. That's my ace in the hole. That's my secret, which I just blabbed out so now everybody knows.

They had that place right next door to us, and it's interesting. There's a clientele downtown -- down in The Peninsula, and there's a clientele at Cotai. The Cotai clientele is different. It's more mass-oriented. Have you noticed? With the people coming across the border. Ian, Gamal, what do you think the difference is between downtown and Cotai? And what do you think is going to happen in -- do you envision any changes in The Peninsula when Gamal -- opens the Palace?"

I think probably what's interesting is to say that January in Macau, if I can anticipate some of the questions, was our best month in a long time. Happy to say so. And Chinese New Year is in progress. But early in the week, a little too soon to say. The mass component clearly looks a little stronger than in the past. It's too soon to tell because the weekend's coming up with the VIPs. So that's pretty much the way we feel about China in terms of current first quarter numbers. 
  
  With regard to Las Vegas, January was terrific, and Super Bowl and February are off to a roaring start. And between that and President's weekend, Las Vegas is an apple pie shape up through the 15th, which will be Monday. The question in Las Vegas will be, how's the last 14 days? But as of now, business is pretty good in the United States and holding its own in Macau.
  
  With regard to our project, we have issued some statements. We're working with our contractor to get them to catch up so that we'll have an opening in June. They believe they'll make the June 25 date, which was the contract date of our relationship with our builder. And it's possible they could be late, but hopefully, they won't be. We're working very closely with them to try and catch up in any areas that need to be caught up, and our fancy hotel will be ready for public display later this year. 
  
  We're going to start work in Boston, a hard construction. We're doing remediation at the moment. We've come to happy terms with our neighbors in Boston, and that was a relief. And now we're going to proceed with constructing this wonderful destination resort in Boston metropolitan area in Everett and benefit, I hope, people throughout the region and have a very exciting hotel to boot. 
  
  And with that, and reminding you that all of us are here to take your questions, we'll begin to do so."

We sold our Ferrari dealership to the Rolls-Royce dealer in town, Roger Penske and I, and reclaiming that valuable space, we're moving poker over to Encore. And starting at the casino corner where the ticket counter is now for the showrooms, we're going to have retail and a new retail mall that goes through where Ferrari was and a 2-story building with a beautiful glass roof, an atrium kind of structure, that has 75,000 feet of rentable space. And we expect it will pick up somewhere between $20 million and $25 million in extra income and probably $0.30 worth of new payroll. I mean, it's just a pickup in EBITDA because we had 300-or-more feet on The Strip right on the sidewalk in unused real estate that was very, very valuable and along with other real estate that we own in Las Vegas, represents an opportunity for future development that is quite unique. We -- I'll remind everybody that the golf course is 130 acres, and we have 1,000 acre feet of water in our own wells that were purchased with the desert and water company in 2000. I look at that as an asset. And China and its complexity has made us refocus on some of the things that we have going for us and are already in our -- under our control. So all of that is the kind of thing that we can examine. As I told you, The Strip real estate, I've already committed to a drawing, and the project's underway. It probably costs $70 million, and the interest on the money is, if we borrow 100% of it or if we used our cash, our cost of money, is less than 5%, and we pick up $20 million or $23 million in EBITDA just by plucking off something that we own for nothing. We've got a lot of options like that here, and that makes a company exciting. It's another reason why I like the stock because none of our assets are a secret. None of the opportunities that this company possesses are unknown to anybody. They're all sitting out there in plain view. And I don't mind discussing them when someone asks, but I'm certainly not going to ignore them. I think Boston's going to be -- the Everett, Boston metropolitan area opportunity is enormous, and we can't wait to be there. It's the first time we've ever had a hotel that has nonstop service from every major capital in the world, Hainan Airlines and Cathay Pacific fly nonstop from Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai to Boston. So does every other world capital. Nonstop to Boston. And we're 12 minutes from Logan Airport with our new hotel. So all of that sort of makes me feel confident and positive about our future prospects."

It's a very, very ambitious, extravagant product. I've talked about it over a period of a year or 2 to all of you in these conference calls. We aimed very high, and that's put pressure on the finishes of the building. Of course, it's a fancy place, to say the least. And all the subs are working to do their best job, and they'll get there. They'll get there. Give or take a few weeks, I think it'll be fine. There's not much more you can say about it than that. I mean, when they told me they were going to finish early in September, they gave us a written notice that they were going to achieve the early completion bonus of $38 million. And so we shared that with you because they notified us in writing. And then when they told us that, that was doubtful because we had shared it with the public, we thought it was incumbent upon us to also share with the public that there wasn't going to be an early bonus or an early completion. But I want to remind everybody that the original contract was for June 25, that we will complete this project in the first half of 2016. And hopefully, that date will stand or right close to it.

Usually, the way it's worked in the past, we have 2 critical paths: One is that of the completion, the construction and the finishing of the building; and the other one is the critical path that is the spooling up and the hiring and training of the full staff of thousands of people to run the place. And under ideal conditions, those 2 critical paths move in exactly parallel and a coterminous step. They meet at the exact same point on the opening day. When the construction gets behind, in and of itself, that's not a big deal. I mean, so? The building is a few weeks late. But what is important is that you don't go and hire a whole bunch of people that are sitting getting paid and twiddling their thumbs. That's very, very damaging financially. So what I did with Matthew when we were there a couple of months ago, I've changed the order of March. And I said I want our landmark dates on turnover of the building to occur before we do the hiring, if possible. In other words, let's make sure that our critical path of hiring doesn't get ahead of the critical path of the building. Then the impact of being a few weeks late is not so -- is not quite as serious as it might have been if we went to full staff. So that's where that stands, and I'm happy to say that we are in equilibrium at the moment."

There are advantages and disadvantages of having a high-end, super-quality resort. For example, your average customer tends to be a little wealthier, a little better able to afford more expensive food and wine and hotel rates. On the other hand, if you are the place of choice for baccarat for international visitors, anything that interferes with that tends to work against you because we had more baccarat business than anybody else in Las Vegas. So when baccarat's affected from China, we're the ones that get the biggest impact. On the other hand, there's still a lot of good customers around. And from what we can see, we're still the -- one of the places of first choice, if not the place of first choice. And we do everything we can to keep it that way, of course. And since New Year's, it's working as it was designed to work. We've got better room rates, and our casino's profitable. Our margins in the casino, even though sometimes our drop or our handle is off, we tend to be very fastidious about having all of our games be profitable. We don't pay so much attention to the top line as we do to the bottom line. So when we evaluate the casino, we don't evaluate the handle or the win. We evaluate the contribution to EBITDA of our games, and we try to maximize every foot of the casino with one metric in mind: contribution of EBITDA per foot. Well, that sort of thing comes home after a while, and we get the benefits of it, and we see it now. That's why I said the place was in good shape. I'm happy with the performance, and our turnout for New Year's, for Christmas, New Year's, January with the conventions. It's another thing. When there there's a big citywide convention and corporate leaders and high-paid people come to the conventions, they want to stay here. And their propensity to gamble is higher as is their desire to eat in better restaurants and shop in better stores and so forth. So I'm happy with the way Wynn Las Vegas is performing, and that's what I meant when I said it's an apple pie shape. That's an old-fashioned expression. Did I answer your question?"

But if there's a recession in America, and it's hard to see why there won't be if we keep going the way we are, then Las Vegas will ultimately reflect whatever is going on in the rest of the United States. It always has. There sometimes have been a delay if conventions are booked and things like that.

And our building was -- we made an adjustment to allow for some of the junket areas to be premium mass and stuff like that. We made modest adjustments in the facility presentation and the furniture, so to speak. But look, there used to be this avalanche of revenue for all these casinos and all these junket operators in Macau. So now there are fewer of them. So where are they going to gamble? I mean, they're going to go to the place that somehow meets all of their expectations. We designed a place to be that. So I think that considering how many casinos there are in America and in Las Vegas, and we get more than our share of the business, to worry about whether you're going to get more -- get a proper share in Macau is really a waste of time. The answer is positively yes. We'll be able to fill our casino with the most selective customers available in the market. I'm sure of that, and we'll have a demonstration of that shortly this summer. But let's not think that all VIP players have disappeared because that's simply not the way it works. They have been lessened in number, but there's still a lot of them around."

We can advertise very limited ways about rooms, but they're very, very careful of that. And I'm not sure that a place like Wynn Palace lends itself to mass marketing techniques, places like the kind we operate. 99% of the marketing is word of mouth. See, the people that would come and stay in Macau, as large as that country is, the percentage of the population that comes to Macau is relatively small compared to the total size of the country. And that group that comes to Macau, they know everything about every hotel. They go to the one they can afford or they go to the one they think is best depending on their income status. So what happens is within 60 or 90 days of when Wynn Palace opens up, an enormous percentage of that market will -- the people who attend that market will know all about it, and word of mouth will take place the first 12 months that place is open, and it'll establish itself as Wynn and The Peninsula did as the nicest place to stay. And we never advertised in The Peninsula, in the first Wynn Macau nor did we advertise in Encore. And we filled those thousand rooms, and we could have filled 2,000 of them. And we got 1,700 new rooms, and I'm not sure what we would gain if we could advertise in every place. But you could be sure that any wealthy guy that's in Beijing, Shanghai, Fuxin, Guangzhou or Dalian whose ever goes to Macau, they know all about us already. That's one of the good things about the gaming-type visitor. They're very, very hip. Everybody knew about Caesars Palace and Bellagio and Mirage within a few months when they opened. And so commercial advertising and traditional marketing isn't quite as important when you open up really grand destination hotels. Everybody writes about them and talks about them.

It's just the size of the country, the priority that the central government has put on the success of both SARs, both the Special Administrative Regions, both Hong Kong and Macau. The dynamism of that country is overwhelming. And remember that the communist party is a meritocracy in China. And although one leader may be a bit more conservative than his predecessor or a bit more liberal, generally speaking, they want a successful life for the citizens of China and for the people in Hong Kong and Macau. The personalities of those cities are highly developed and not under discussion anymore. Macau is the destination resort place along with Hanson Island, and Hong Kong is the financial center. There's no argument in the higher echelons of government of People's Republic of China on what role those cities play in the overall scheme of things in China. And so consistent with what I said a moment ago that the government seeks to make the country successful, I'm positive that they will. That doesn't mean that in the short term, the enormity of problems they face is directly proportional to the enormity of the country. It's 4x the size of the United States. And imagine the problems we have and the complexity that our government faces with 350 million or 330 million people. How would you like to add 1 billion to that without the kind of infrastructure we've got? I mean, managing China is a daunting task, and they got a lot of smart people doing it. And where they've come, you draw your confidence in the future from a careful study of the past. Starting with Deng Xiaoping in 1979, when he said if it's a black cat or a white cat, it doesn't make any difference to me. So long as it catches mice, it's a good cat. The government of Macau -- of China has been empirical and pragmatic and has brought hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, a feat unequaled in the history of civilization in any country. Obviously, somebody's doing something wrong -- doing something right, rather. They're tapping into the latent energy of that population. Why would we consider that, that would not continue? And when it comes to recreation, Macau is the place of choice. That big-picture kind of common sense based upon history is the basis that -- so when you ask where is the inflection point, I don't know that. But when you ask me why do I think the long-term prospects in Macau are incredibly positive, that's my answer. I love being part of the Chinese scene as a businessman. That doesn't mean that there aren't short-term discomfort and adjustments. But hell, what kind of adjustments do we have to make in the United States considering what's going on? It's just as tricky here as it is there. Did I help you with that answer? You made an intelligent question. I don't know if I gave an intelligent answer."

If you set out to take a resort hotel to another level, and when you say another level, superior level, and you thought by so doing you would give yourself a competitive advantage almost as if you had a trick up your sleeve, then I will tell you what you would have to do to get to that point. And if we've got a trick up our sleeve, here it is, and I'm going to confess. The way you make a hotel go to another level is you start with every single minute element of it. And as you construct the plan for the building and the design and the human resource engineering, you revisit every single assumption once again from day 1 using all of your experience and asking how could we make each individual component better. And if you did that from the bottom up starting with the back of the house, the doorway, the lighting, the hallway widths, the training of the employees, the compensation of the employees, the way you cook their food, the way you clean the floor, everything, what it's like when you're laying in the bed? What do you see when you're in this room or that room type? If you had the patience and the experience to take that journey, which would take you at least 2 years before you could bid the building, then you would have traveled our path in the creation of Wynn Palace. And that is what we did. That's how we're doing it. And if we're right, it'll work. And if not, boo hoo. Does that answer your question? We're going to do what we've always done. We're going to keep trying to make it better in every way. And that -- look, the customers aren't going to change. They're people who come to Las Vegas and Macau to live big and have fun. And whoever gives them that product consistently and fully wins the race to the top, I guess, the way to put it or ends up in first position. Now that doesn't mean that we're going to be bigger than anybody else. It will mean that our hotel will be successful, and we'll have a proper return on its investment and that sort of thing, and we'll have a loyal and growing clientele. Now we took the long way home in The Peninsula. We weren't the first to open in Macau. We just made the most money when we built the place downtown, and that's Wynn Macau now. So I don't see any reason to change our strategy. It's not broke. We don't need to fix it. And in the hospitality business, whether you're in Boston, Macau, Las Vegas or anywhere else, the rules aren't going to change. We know who our customers are. We know what they want, and we're going to try to figure out a better way to give it to them. That's my ace in the hole. That's my secret, which I just blabbed out so now everybody knows. Funny thing is they haven't copied it in the past."

We have been obsessed on a daily basis and on weekends with the whole team of creative people that include Disney animators that I when I do these kinds of things with animators very much Walt Disney did. And as we work on ideas, one of them sketches in real time, the perspective drawings, the elevations.
The lake is -- when I had the Investor Day, we showed the west end of the lake, which was 1,300 feet by 1,300 feet. We realized that our development sites that were further to the east on the corner of Desert Inn and Paradise, and on Paradise itself; and on the south side, which is Paradise and the side that backs up. We had these rather large development sites of 2019 and 17 acres. And we wanted to extend the lake to create more beachfront property. So we extended the lake another 600 feet. And that happened after the Investor Day.
Now picture this in your mind when you understand how we do this. Here is this body of water that has a boardwalk surrounding it this over a mile long, it's 5,800 feet. And there are all these properties and offerings of shopping retailed cul-de-sac of little villages, like little village square of them, it's a discovery place for people walking and staying in the hotel now. We show a thousand room addition this connected to Wynn that is totally integrated with the Country Club restaurant as it's presently known and the rest of our hotel. But then we should the rest of this property with its convention and meeting space around it and the development sites for beachfront. What we realize is that in order for this to have the critical mass that is irresistible to the public, it has be a place that is irresistible for the public. And so therefore, what I didn't show on Investor Day, but because I didn't already is that in the middle of this 1,300 by 2,000-foot piece of water is an island that is 8 to 10 stories tall, but it's an irregular topography, it slop  up to 2 twin peaks that are connected with a rope bridge. And built into the side are cabanas and other special effects platforms, some of which are going to be occupied in the daytime by people and very luxurious premium kinds of recreational spots. And then there's a beach bar with white sand. And then from our convention center on the north, there are zip lines that take people to the bar. And from the side of the mountain, there is zip line to take them back the other way. There are ferries, little electric ferries that go out to the dock at the beach bar. That is to say, this place is populated. And at night, the Twin Peaks are launching positions for our firework show, and for other special effects that make up an entertainment moment at 9:00 to 9:30 or so at night. And the water ski show is in the afternoon at 3:00. So all of these elements make up this world behind here that we refer to as Paradise Park. When I had the Investor Day, I had some preliminary stuff that we've worked on that was available to show. But we had stuff that wasn't in model form, where we had taken the project further. The creative process in the design development phase or something like this is very dynamic and it changes on a weekly basis as we layer in all of the attractions and that things that make it irresistible to the 800,000 people a week that come to Las Vegas, the 118,000 people a day from and up that stayed for 3.5 days and turnover twice a week.
It also adds immeasurably to the sex appeal and value of the undeveloped real estate that is also fronted on the waterfront and viewing the island and enjoying all the water interactive things that take place. So that's a little bit more conversation about Paradise Park. And you can understand that as these ideas are flushed out, then we would be able to decide on the cost per foot to build the structure. In a fact, it's a hollow building that looks like on the outside, but is hollow in the inside very much like the small one that's in front of Wynn and the Lake of Dreams. Only this is taking an idea much further into another realm altogether. But this is not yet, just building a body of water from an gauge. The American public have seen that before. When we do something here, we do something that hasn't seen before, and offers people a chance to enjoy it, explore is and hopefully they'll find it irresistible. that's is the developer speaking, you're to take me, the kinds of things I say with, I guess. But we've been for 45 years, we've always managed to keep that."

And I'm just kind of curious how high level when you think about what are you's doing, what is the goal is behind Paradise Park? Is there an interplay here that you're trying to a accomplish between the high end and luxurious environment that you created Wynn with a bit of more mass market appeal or how you want to balance those 2 elements in terms of accessibility?"

We offer a more luxurious property with all kinds of choices in food, beverage and nightclubs for the young people. 5,000 people a night in excess into beach club, 5,000 people a day. These are not casino customers. These are people who are in search of a different form of recreation. And we satisfy their demand. And we benefit from that to the tune of $30 to $35 million a year. For example, if you're talking about nightclubs and EBITDA. So when we talk about Paradise Park, first of all, we put 1,000 rooms that are going to be the on-core room with the 40-foot length room with the sitting area that suites and we're going to add a balcony on each room facing the lake in a 17-story structure. Now, that's probably going to be one of the most desirable hotel rooms in the country. I mean, fireworks every night. And all of this lunacy going on outside, staring at these remarkable scenes that we're going to build, with activity going on. That certainly goes after a higher value customer and then we're adding these gorgeous meeting rooms, both as an add-on of an 85,000-foot meeting room and 50,000 feet, I mean, the 85,000 ballroom and the 50,000 feet of meeting rooms next to in the Wynn side, and then we're adding a 25,000 and a 50,000-foot ballroom. And I guess, another 35,000-foot of meeting rooms on the new side, on the Paradise Parkside, all of these rooms and facilities have terraces, an open area, open onto this show that's in the middle. So to that extent, we're playing to high price point. But on the other hand, I'm going to charge every single person $20 to $30 to experience Paradise Park. Whether I do it as a part of the room charge, as a resource fee per night or whether I do it for the people coming in off the street, part of those 180,000 people a day that are visiting the town. I'm going to charge for it. And that's going to make this place successful. It is 100 or dollars to go to Disney land. We're going to charge 20 bucks. What are you talking about revenues of $300,000 or $400,000 a day if anybody shows up. This is high-margin business. So to 1 extent, as we do in our existing 4,700 rooms, soon to be 5,700, if this project proceeds as planned, we'll be getting mass business, and we will be increasing our occupancy in the existing rooms and creating occupancy inexpensive rooms on the lake. That's what we're trying to do. But, I made a point that it's worth repeating incessantly.
You cannot get dynamics with gaming equipment. It's only gaming equipment. It's always the same everywhere in the world at the most humble regional box of slots to the fanciest place. The trickiest how many people come through the casino, and what is their average income. At what level in the economic scale are they? That's how we manage to increase and break the record in casino revenue and every place we've ever built since 1989. Nothing really, in conceptually, in our planning, nothing is really changing. Wynn Paradise Park is a further extension of the same mentality, taking advantage of the imagination and fantasy on property that we own for 0, with water rights that we own for 0, and we're the only ones that have them at the size, and we're going to do it with solar power and we're going to use less water than the golf course. So we're going to be very green at the same time.
I hope that response to your question."

We've repeated many times that we expected a competitive environment. Matt at the Investor Day took quite a bit of time to show where the business was, that where does casino activity in Macau really come from. And that there has been this fals",737,"Yes. Okay. We've repeated many times that we expected a competitive environment. Matt at the Investor Day took quite a bit of time to show where the business was, that where does casino activity in Macau really come from. And that there has been this false identification of mass versus premium. The junket operator with ships or the low level mass table games with the buses on the other hand. And nothing is further from the truth. That is a misunderstanding. The bulk of this market ranges rapidly up into what we call, and I think we tend to categorize this a little bit too generally, mass premium. But the money in Macau is all based upon the better customer, both the cash customer with regular chips, and of course, the people who play with the nonredeemable chips.
But the money in Macau, when we say mass, we're not talking about circus, circus for example, 1 end of the Las Vegas spectrum versus Wynn or. What really goes on in Macau is all the money is in the better category of players at every level. Now the people that design these various a new hotels, they make a bunch of decisions, long before groundbreaking about what they're going to show the public. Who they want their customers to be. And they designed these things by the size of the rooms, the width of the corridors, the quality and selection of restaurants, the entire treatment of the interior decor, the flow and -- the flow of the elements of the hotel, which incidentally plays specific emphasis on priorities on certain elements versus others. Because as you create the flow in these places, you demonstrate your priorities to the public. This hotel, the Wynn Palace was designed to appeal, specifically, to the heart and soul, the premium customer in Macau. The Studio City project was articulated by its developers as a place that was designed to appeal to the mass of lower end per region, as a bulk of rooms, many of whom are much smaller than ours.
The cost factors associated with these places, all of the decisions that are made by the developers, defined the product when it finally is launched. We've seen the competition in Macau. We studied them with respect, and in some cases, admiration for their execution. But I'm going to say it one more time, we're not in that ZIP Code. We're not in that area code. When you see it, Robin, you will understand this place has a different level in Bellagio, Wynn, Macau, Wynn Las Vegas, or Macau, or encore Las Vegas. This is a different place. So it's is designed in every single element to appeal to that part of the market that goes from a 1,000 unit average debt of Hong Kong dollars to a million. And so when we look at Studio City, we don't see any comparison with us. Now when you ask me about, and how do I feel about that opening it right after us, I don't really know what Sheldon did because we haven't seen it. And what his thinking was and his colleagues, and when they were going. But I suspect that no one is directly challenging our market position at this point, unless as does, there is -- that character with the red Rose Royce that's building a place called that has 100 rooms or something and doesn't have any tables yet, but is over. I think, his is that is going to be the fanciest thing in the world, the 100 rooms on. We don't stay up late night worrying about him. But in terms of the Parisian, as we've heard, Sheldon Adelson prefers to stay in the middle, of what he calls the front part of the market. And they do a very good job at that. We are positioned differently Robin and if you were on our side of this, I think, you probably agree that's the only way to go if you are Wynn. And that's what we've done. So we don't have much heartburn about Studio City. I hope for this it's big success. And sooner or later, I believe that Lawrence Ho and James Packer will figure that out and make that place perform. And we do like a long-term prospects of Macau. We think the market will catch up with this all sooner or later."

It will be a -- remember I said at the Investor Day that both the Palace in Asia and the Wynn in Boston, in the metropolitan area of Boston, both of them are not only great investments for this company, but their case studies, going forward for any other city that wants to try it in Asia, any other country, or any other city in America that wants to have a grand hotel that employs people and is a credit to the community. We're gambling as subordinated, but available, but the resort and destination aspects of the building are. The Massachusetts project will be exactly that sort of the case study. And we think that's an important part of our future. Instead of having you to develop a speak, like I'm today, talking about Paradise Park, we can just keep quite. Say, here, look at this, here, Korea, Taiwan, any place out, look at Wynn Palace, we have nothing else to say, we rest. We don't have anybody copy.

So we just want to make sure We are properly armed in case there was something strange that happens on Wall Street and the stock market dropped to our stock went to a level that we thought was grossly oversold, we would jump on it. As long as the short players fool around for a month or 2, that's is fine. When shots -- the exchanges really don't enforce the rules of making. So I mean, it's unconscionable manipulation of the stock that occurs. They'll every morning and the high frequency traders in the shorts have a ball selling shares and then value buyers stepping in the afternoon and they cover the shorts. I mean, it is regular casino activity. The activity on the stock markets is, in my view, poorly regulated, and irresponsibly policed, especially with regard to short sales. And when it gets out of hand, we see a lot of shorts because of China. Because we are such a clear China play, we probably have a bigger percentage when you say, Steve Cootey that shortage shares, 14 million shares. And although, I can't do about myself, I take advantage of it when it comes online and buy shares. I mean it's fine when they drive the stock down for reasons that are irrelevant and completely disconnected from any doing our business operations. So the stock markets has got more volatile, more stupid as a gambling game than ever before. And I look at it that way, to be honest with you. I have very little respect for the integrity of the trading on the exchange in more stock and I have particular for the fact that the SEC has failed to deal with high-frequency traders for doing nothing more than taking advantage of inside information, a buy or sell order because of technology advantages. If you read flash, it's all spelled out for you. And if I execute an order, I use the IX, I use if I would buy something, so that I couldn't be fronted by the high-frequency traders, which is awful, lot of that going on. Yet, the other day, I was watching the stock open up and it went up on share volumes of a few thousand shares. I mean, every trade was a tick up. Well, that's not the way it should operate in a honestly or intelligently run exchange. But that's the thing, all those guys sold their, and their order flow, and they positioning on the floors of the servers to the HFTs. And it's made a couple of guys that I'm friendly with very rich because they are high-frequency traders. But I don't respect the activity. And I'm severely critical of it.

And if you recall, what I said was that until all of the costs are complete and compared to the revenue and we know that the business plan is as good as we think it is, I'm not going to take it to the board. And so my management team, and a lot of it is myself and the group that have created these hotels in the last 40 years, we have been obsessed on a daily basis and on weekends with a whole team of creative people that include former [ph] Disney animators that -- I sit, when I do these kinds of things, with animators very much the way Walt Disney did. And as we work on ideas, one of them then sketches in real time, the perspective drawings, the elevations.
The lake is -- when I had the Investor Day, we showed the west end of the lake, which was 1,300 feet by 1,300 feet. We realized that our development sites that were further to the east on the corner of Desert Inn and Paradise and on Paradise itself, and on the south side, which is Paradise and the side that backs up to Sands road, we had these rather large development sites of 20, 19 and 17 acres. And we wanted to extend the lake to create more beachfront property. So we extended the lake another 600 feet. And that happened after the Investor Day. Now picture this in your mind when you understand where -- how we do this. Here is this body of water that has a boardwalk surrounding it that's over a mile long, it's 5,800 feet, and there are all these properties and offerings of shopping, retail, there's even little cul-de-sacs of little villages, like a little village square off them, it's a discovery place for people walking and staying in the hotel. Now we show a 1,000-room addition that's connected to Wynn that is totally integrated with the Country Club restaurant, as it's presently known, and the rest of our hotel. But then we show the rest of this property with its convention and meeting space around it and the development sites that are beachfront. What we realized is that in order for this to have the critical mass that is irresistible to the public, it has be a place that is irresistible to the public. And so therefore, what I didn't show on Investor Day, but because I didn't have the model ready, is that in the middle of this 1,300- by 2,000-foot piece of water is a mountain, an island that is 8 to 10 stories tall, but it's in irregular topography. It's a slope up to 2 twin peaks that are connected with a rope bridge. And built into the side are cabanas and other special effects platforms, some of which are going to be occupied in the daytime by people and very luxurious, premium kinds of recreational spots. And then there's a beach bar with white sand. And then from our convention center on the north, there are zip lines that take people to the bar. And from the side of the mountain, there are zip lines that take them back the other way. There are ferries, little electric ferries that go out to the dock at the beach bar. That is to say, this place is populated. And at night, the twin peaks are launching positions for our fireworks show and for other special effects that make up an entertainment moment at 9 to 9:30 or so at night and the water ski show is in the afternoon at 3:00. So all of these elements make up this world behind here that we refer to as Paradise Park. When I had the Investor Day, I had some preliminary stuff that we have worked on that was available to show, but we had stuff that wasn't in model form where we had taken the project further. The creative process in a -- in the design development phase of something like this is very dynamic, and it changes on a weekly basis as we layer in all of the attractions and the things that make it irresistible to the 800,000 people a week that come to Las Vegas, the 118,000 people a day that promenade up and down that stay for 3.5 days and turn over twice a week. It also adds immeasurably to the sex appeal and value of the undeveloped real estate that is also fronted on the waterfront and viewing the island and enjoying all the water interactive things that take place. So that's a little bit more conversation about Paradise Park. And you can understand that as these ideas are fleshed out, then we'd be able to decide on the cost per foot to build the structure. In effect, it's a hollow building that looks like Fantasy Island on the outside but is hollow in the inside, very much like the small one that's in front of Wynn and the Lake of Dreams. Only, this is taking an idea much further into another realm altogether. But we -- this is not Epcot; we're not just building a body of water with a promenade around the edge. The American public has seen that before. When we do something here, we do something that hasn't been seen before and offers people a chance to enjoy it, explore it, and hopefully they'll find that irresistible. Of course, that's the developer speaking, and you have to take me, the kinds of things I say, with a grain of salt, I guess. But we've been at it for 45 years, and we've always managed to keep that promise."

And a large competitor on the strip reported earnings this morning and also mentioned about some of the programming that they are doing around the park -- their park project and talking a little bit more about accessible price points. And I'm just kind of curious, at a high level, when you think about what you're doing and what the goal is behind Paradise Park, is there an interplay here that you're trying to accomplish between the high-end and luxurious environment that you create at Wynn with a bit of a more mass market appeal?

We offer a more luxurious property with all kinds of choices in food, beverage and nightclubs for the young people. 5,000 people a night, in excess; and the beach club, 5,000 people a day. These are not casino customers. These are people who are in search of a different form of recreation. And we satisfy their demand. And we benefit from that to the tune of $30 to $35 million a year, for example, if we're talking about nightclubs, in EBITDA. So when we talk about Paradise Park, first of all, we put 1,000 rooms that are going to be the encore room with -- a 40-foot length room with a sitting area, they're petite suites, and we're going to add a balcony on each room facing the lake in a 17-story structure. Now that's probably going to be one of the most desirable hotel rooms in the country. I mean, fireworks every night and all of this lunacy going on outside, staring at these remarkable scenes that we're going to build with activity going on. That certainly goes after a higher-value customer. And then we're adding these gorgeous meeting rooms, both as an add-on of an 85,000-foot meeting room and 50,000 feet of -- I mean, the 85,000 ballroom and 50,000 feet of meeting rooms next to Lafite in the Wynn side, and then we're adding a 25,000- and a 50,000-foot ballroom, and I guess, another 35,000 foot of meeting rooms on the new side, on the Paradise Park side. All of these rooms and facilities have terraces and open areas open onto this show that's in the middle. So to that extent, we're playing, aren't we, to a high price point. But on the other hand, I'm going to charge every single person $20 to $30 to experience Paradise Park. Whether I do it as part of the room charge, as a resort fee per night or whether I do it for the -- for people coming in off the street, part of those 118,000 people a day that are visiting the town, I'm going to charge for it. And that's going to make this place accessible. It's $100 to go to Disneyland; we're going to charge $20. But you're talking about revenues of $300,000 or $400,000 a day if anybody shows up, and this is high-margin business. So to one extent, as we do in our existing 4,700 rooms, soon to be 5,700, we're -- if this project proceeds as planned, the -- we will be getting mass business, and we will be increasing our occupancy in the existing rooms and creating occupancy in expensive rooms on the lake. That's what we're trying to do. But I made a point that I -- that's worth repeating incessantly. You cannot get dynamic with gaming equipment. It's only gaming equipment. It's always the same everywhere in the world, at the most humble regional box of slots to the fanciest place. The trick is how many people come through the casino and how -- and what is their average income? At what level in the economic scale are they? That's how we've managed to increase and break the record in casino revenue at every place we've ever built since 1989. Nothing really -- and conceptually, in our planning, nothing is really changing. Wynn Paradise Park is a further extension of the same mentality taking advantage of imagination and fantasy on property that we own for 0 with water rights that we own for 0, and we're the only ones that have them at this size, and we're going to do it with solar power, and we're going to use less water than a golf course. So we're going to be very green at the same time. I hope that responds to your question."

We've repeated many times that we expected a competitive environment. Matt, at the Investor Day, took quite a bit of time to show where the business was.

Matt, at the Investor Day, took quite a bit of time to show where the business was. That -- where does casino activity in Macau really come from? And that there's been this false identification of mass versus premium, the junket operator with the dead ships or the low-level mass table games with the buses on the other hand. And nothing is further from the truth. That is a misunderstanding. The bulk of this market ranges rapidly up into what we call, and I think we tend to categorize this a little bit too generally, mass premium. But the money in Macau is all based upon the better customer, both the cash customer with the regular chips and, of course, the people who play with the nonredeemable chips. But the money in Macau, when we say mass, we're not talking about Circus Circus, for example, at one end of the Las Vegas spectrum versus Wynn or Bellagio. What really goes on in Macau is all the money is in the better category of player at every level. Now the people that design these various new hotels, they make a bunch of decisions, long before groundbreaking, about what they're going to show the public, who they want their customer to be. And they defined these things by the size of the rooms, the width of the corridors, the quality and selection of restaurants, the entire treatment of the interior decor, the flow and -- the flow of the elements of the hotel, which, incidentally, plays specific emphasis and priorities on certain elements versus others. Because as you create the flow in these places, you demonstrate your priorities to the public. This hotel, the Wynn Palace, was designed to appeal specifically to the heart and soul, the premium customer in Macau. The Studio City project was articulated by its developers as a place that was designed to appeal to the mass, the lower end. Parisian has a bulk of rooms, many of whom are much smaller than ours. The cost factors associated with these places. All of the decisions that are made by the developers define the product when it finally is launched. We've seen the competition in Macau. We studied them with respect and, in some cases, admiration for their execution. But I'm going to say it one more time. We're not in that zip code. We're not in that area code. When you see it, Robin, you will understand. This place has a different level than Bellagio, Wynn Macau, Wynn Las Vegas or Macau -- or Encore Las Vegas. This is a different place. So it's designed in every single element to appeal to that part of the market that goes from a HKD 1,000 unit average bet to HKD 1 million. And so when we look at Studio City, we don't see any comparison with us. Now when you ask me about Parisian and how do I feel about it opening right after us, I don't really know what Sheldon did, because we haven't seen it, and what his thinking was, and his colleagues, in where they were going to position Parisian. But I suspect that no one is directly challenging our market position at this point, unless SJM does, there is that character with the red Rolls-Royce that's building a place called Louis XIV (sic) [ Louis XIII ]. It has 100 rooms or something and doesn't have any tables yet, but it's over in Coloane. I think his rhetoric is that it's going to be the fanciest thing in the world, the 100 rooms on Coloane. We don't stay up late night worrying about him. But in terms of the Parisian, as we've heard, Sheldon Adelson prefers to stay in the middle, or what he calls the fat part of the market, and they do a very good job at that. We are positioned differently, Robin. And if you were on our side of this, I think you'd probably agree that's the only way to go if you're Wynn. And that's what we've done. So we don't have much heartburn about Studio City. I hope for their sake that it's a big success. And sooner or later, I believe that Lawrence Ho and James Packer will figure that out and make that place perform. And we do like the long-term prospects of Macau, and we think the market will catch up with this all sooner or later. Meantime, we may snatch a little market share here and there. Along with..."

But remember, Robin, it's not a project until my board says it's a project. And all of us in management have more work to do before we present it for the green light vote at the board level. And because of the complexity and the really transitional impact that this project will have on Las Vegas, we want to make sure that we've done our homework and been very complete. And then we're going to discuss all this in great detail with you and the members of the investment community, the buy- and sell-side people, in enormous detail.

We have a few last-minute tweaks that we can do in value engineering, but it'll stand alone against anything that exist other than the city of Las Vegas or The Strip in Las Vegas. Period. Period. It'll be a -- look, remember, I said at the Investor Day that both the Palace in Asia and the Wynn in Boston, in the metropolitan area of Boston, both of them are not only great investments for this company, but they are case studies going forward for any other city that wants to try it in Asia, any other country, or any other city in America that wants to have a grand hotel that employs people and is a credit to the community; where gambling is subordinated but available, but that the resort and destination aspects of the building are unequivocal. The Massachusetts project will be exactly that sort of a case study. And we think that's an important part of our future. Instead of having to do the developer speak, like I am today talking about Paradise Park, we can just keep quiet and say, ""Here, look at this. Here. Seoul, Korea; Taiwan, any place else.

I mean, it's fine when they drive the stock down for reasons that are irrelevant and completely disconnected from anything to do with our business operations. So the stock markets got more volatile, more stupid as a gambling game than ever before. And I look at it that way, to be honest with you. I have very little respect for the integrity of the trading on the exchange in most stocks, and I have particular disdain for the fact that the SEC has failed to deal with high-frequency traders who are doing nothing more than taking advantage of inside information, a buy or a sell order, because of technology advantages. If you read Flash Boys, it's all spelled out for you. And if I execute an order, I'll use the IEX. I'll use Brad Katsuyama if I was buying something so that the -- so I couldn't be fronted by the high-frequency traders, which is an awful lot of that going on. The other day, I was watching the stock open up, and it went up on share volumes of a few thousand shares. I mean, every trade was a tick-up. Well, that's not the way it should operate in an honestly or intelligently run exchange. But that's the thing. All those guys sold their dark pools and their order flow and the positioning on the floors of the servers to the HFTs.

And if you recall, what I said was that until all of the costs are complete and compared to the revenue and we know that the business plan is as good as we think it is, I'm not going to take it to the board. And so my management team, and a lot of it is myself and the group that have created these hotels in the last 40 years, we have been obsessed on a daily basis and on weekends with a whole team of creative people that include former Disney animators that -- I sit, when I do these kinds of things, with animators very much the way Walt Disney did. And as we work on ideas, one of them then sketches in real time, the perspective drawings, the elevations.
The lake is -- when I had the Investor Day, we showed the west end of the lake, which was 1,300 feet by 1,300 feet. We realized that our development sites that were further to the east on the corner of Desert Inn and Paradise and on Paradise itself, and on the south side, which is Paradise and the side that backs up to Sands road, we had these rather large development sites of 20, 19 and 17 acres. And we wanted to extend the lake to create more beachfront property. So we extended the lake another 600 feet. And that happened after the Investor Day. Now picture this in your mind when you understand where -- how we do this. Here is this body of water that has a boardwalk surrounding it that's over a mile long, it's 5,800 feet, and there are all these properties and offerings of shopping, retail, there's even little cul-de-sacs of little villages, like a little village square off them, it's a discovery place for people walking and staying in the hotel. Now we show a 1,000-room addition that's connected to Wynn that is totally integrated with the Country Club restaurant, as it's presently known, and the rest of our hotel. But then we show the rest of this property with its convention and meeting space around it and the development sites that are beachfront. What we realized is that in order for this to have the critical mass that is irresistible to the public, it has be a place that is irresistible to the public. And so therefore, what I didn't show on Investor Day, but because I didn't have the model ready, is that in the middle of this 1,300- by 2,000-foot piece of water is a mountain, an island that is 8 to 10 stories tall, but it's in irregular topography. It's a slope up to 2 twin peaks that are connected with a rope bridge. And built into the side are cabanas and other special effects platforms, some of which are going to be occupied in the daytime by people and very luxurious, premium kinds of recreational spots. And then there's a beach bar with white sand. And then from our convention center on the north, there are zip lines that take people to the bar. And from the side of the mountain, there are zip lines that take them back the other way. There are ferries, little electric ferries that go out to the dock at the beach bar. That is to say, this place is populated. And at night, the twin peaks are launching positions for our fireworks show and for other special effects that make up an entertainment moment at 9 to 9:30 or so at night and the water ski show is in the afternoon at 3:00. So all of these elements make up this world behind here that we refer to as Paradise Park. When I had the Investor Day, I had some preliminary stuff that we have worked on that was available to show, but we had stuff that wasn't in model form where we had taken the project further. The creative process in a -- in the design development phase of something like this is very dynamic, and it changes on a weekly basis as we layer in all of the attractions and the things that make it irresistible to the 800,000 people a week that come to Las Vegas, the 118,000 people a day that promenade up and down that stay for 3.5 days and turn over twice a week. It also adds immeasurably to the sex appeal and value of the undeveloped real estate that is also fronted on the waterfront and viewing the island and enjoying all the water interactive things that take place. So that's a little bit more conversation about Paradise Park. And you can understand that as these ideas are fleshed out, then we'd be able to decide on the cost per foot to build the structure. In effect, it's a hollow building that looks like Fantasy Island on the outside but is hollow in the inside, very much like the small one that's in front of Wynn and the Lake of Dreams. Only, this is taking an idea much further into another realm altogether. But we -- this is not Epcot; we're not just building a body of water with a promenade around the edge. The American public has seen that before. When we do something here, we do something that hasn't been seen before and offers people a chance to enjoy it, explore it, and hopefully they'll find that irresistible. Of course, that's the developer speaking, and you have to take me, the kinds of things I say, with a grain of salt, I guess. But we've been at it for 45 years, and we've always managed to keep that promise."

And a large competitor on the strip reported earnings this morning and also mentioned about some of the programming that they are doing around the park -- their park project and talking a little bit more about accessible price points. And I'm just kind of curious, at a high level, when you think about what you're doing and what the goal is behind Paradise Park, is there an interplay here that you're trying to accomplish between the high-end and luxurious environment that you create at Wynn with a bit of a more mass market appeal?

We offer a more luxurious property with all kinds of choices in food, beverage and nightclubs for the young people. 5,000 people a night, in excess; and the beach club, 5,000 people a day. These are not casino customers. These are people who are in search of a different form of recreation. And we satisfy their demand. And we benefit from that to the tune of $30 to $35 million a year, for example, if we're talking about nightclubs, in EBITDA. So when we talk about Paradise Park, first of all, we put 1,000 rooms that are going to be the encore room with -- a 40-foot length room with a sitting area, they're petite suites, and we're going to add a balcony on each room facing the lake in a 17-story structure. Now that's probably going to be one of the most desirable hotel rooms in the country. I mean, fireworks every night and all of this lunacy going on outside, staring at these remarkable scenes that we're going to build with activity going on. That certainly goes after a higher-value customer. And then we're adding these gorgeous meeting rooms, both as an add-on of an 85,000-foot meeting room and 50,000 feet of -- I mean, the 85,000 ballroom and 50,000 feet of meeting rooms next to Lafite in the Wynn side, and then we're adding a 25,000- and a 50,000-foot ballroom, and I guess, another 35,000 foot of meeting rooms on the new side, on the Paradise Park side. All of these rooms and facilities have terraces and open areas open onto this show that's in the middle. So to that extent, we're playing, aren't we, to a high price point. But on the other hand, I'm going to charge every single person $20 to $30 to experience Paradise Park. Whether I do it as part of the room charge, as a resort fee per night or whether I do it for the -- for people coming in off the street, part of those 118,000 people a day that are visiting the town, I'm going to charge for it. And that's going to make this place accessible. It's $100 to go to Disneyland; we're going to charge $20. But you're talking about revenues of $300,000 or $400,000 a day if anybody shows up, and this is high-margin business. So to one extent, as we do in our existing 4,700 rooms, soon to be 5,700, we're -- if this project proceeds as planned, the -- we will be getting mass business, and we will be increasing our occupancy in the existing rooms and creating occupancy in expensive rooms on the lake. That's what we're trying to do. But I made a point that I -- that's worth repeating incessantly. You cannot get dynamic with gaming equipment. It's only gaming equipment. It's always the same everywhere in the world, at the most humble regional box of slots to the fanciest place. The trick is how many people come through the casino and how -- and what is their average income? At what level in the economic scale are they? That's how we've managed to increase and break the record in casino revenue at every place we've ever built since 1989. Nothing really -- and conceptually, in our planning, nothing is really changing. Wynn Paradise Park is a further extension of the same mentality taking advantage of imagination and fantasy on property that we own for 0 with water rights that we own for 0, and we're the only ones that have them at this size, and we're going to do it with solar power, and we're going to use less water than a golf course. So we're going to be very green at the same time. I hope that responds to your question."

We've repeated many times that we expected a competitive environment. Matt, at the Investor Day, took quite a bit of time to show where the business was. That -- where does casino activity in Macau really come from? And that there's been this false",764,"Okay. We've repeated many times that we expected a competitive environment. Matt, at the Investor Day, took quite a bit of time to show where the business was. That -- where does casino activity in Macau really come from? And that there's been this false identification of mass versus premium, the junket operator with the dead ships or the low-level mass table games with the buses on the other hand. And nothing is further from the truth. That is a misunderstanding. The bulk of this market ranges rapidly up into what we call, and I think we tend to categorize this a little bit too generally, mass premium. But the money in Macau is all based upon the better customer, both the cash customer with the regular chips and, of course, the people who play with the nonredeemable chips. But the money in Macau, when we say mass, we're not talking about Circus Circus, for example, at one end of the Las Vegas spectrum versus Wynn or Bellagio. What really goes on in Macau is all the money is in the better category of player at every level. Now the people that design these various new hotels, they make a bunch of decisions, long before groundbreaking, about what they're going to show the public, who they want their customer to be. And they defined these things by the size of the rooms, the width of the corridors, the quality and selection of restaurants, the entire treatment of the interior decor, the flow and -- the flow of the elements of the hotel, which, incidentally, placed specific emphasis and priorities on certain elements versus others. Because as you create the flow in these places, you demonstrate your priorities to the public. This hotel, the Wynn Palace, was designed to appeal specifically to the heart and soul, the premium customer in Macau. The Studio City project was articulated by its developers as a place that was designed to appeal to the mass, the lower end. Parisian has a bulk of rooms, many of whom are much smaller than ours. The cost factors associated with these places. All of the decisions that are made by the developers define the product when it finally is launched. We've seen the competition in Macau. We studied them with respect and, in some cases, admiration for their execution. But I'm going to say it one more time. We're not in that zip code. We're not in that area code. When you see it, Robin, you will understand. This place has a different level than Bellagio, Wynn Macau, Wynn Las Vegas or Macau -- or Encore Las Vegas. This is a different place. So it's designed in every single element to appeal to that part of the market that goes from a HKD 1,000 unit average bet to HKD 1 million. And so when we look at Studio City, we don't see any comparison with us. Now when you ask me about Parisian and how do I feel about it opening right after us, I don't really know what Sheldon did, because we haven't seen it, and what his thinking was, and his colleagues, in where they were going to position Parisian. But I suspect that no one is directly challenging our market position at this point, unless SJM does, there is that character with the red Rolls-Royce that's building a place called Louis XIV (sic) [ Louis XIII ]. It has 100 rooms or something and doesn't have any tables yet, but it's over in Coloane. I think his rhetoric is that it's going to be the fanciest thing in the world, the 100 rooms on Coloane. We don't stay up late night worrying about him. But in terms of the Parisian, as we've heard, Sheldon Adelson prefers to stay in the middle, or what he calls the fat part of the market, and they do a very good job at that. We are positioned differently, Robin. And if you were on our side of this, I think you'd probably agree that's the only way to go if you're Wynn. And that's what we've done. So we don't have much heartburn about Studio City. I hope for their sake that it's a big success. And sooner or later, I believe that Lawrence Ho and James Packer will figure that out and make that place perform. And we do like the long-term prospects of Macau, and we think the market will catch up with this all sooner or later. Meantime, we may snatch a little market share here and there. Along with..."

And because of the complexity and the really transitional impact that this project will have on Las Vegas, we want to make sure that we've done our homework and been very complete.

It'll be a -- look, remember, I said at the Investor Day that both the Palace in Asia and the Wynn in Boston, in the metropolitan area of Boston, both of them are not only great investments for this company, but they are case studies going forward for any other city that wants to try it in Asia, any other country, or any other city in America that wants to have a grand hotel that employs people and is a credit to the community; where gambling is subordinated but available, but that the resort and destination aspects of the building are unequivocal. The Massachusetts project will be exactly that sort of a case study. And we think that's an important part of our future. Instead of having to do the developer speak, like I am today talking about Paradise Park, we can just keep quiet and say, ""Here, look at this. Here. Seoul, Korea; Taiwan, any place else. Look at Wynn Palace. We have nothing else to say. We rest."" We have no -- we don't have any body copy. We have no developer speak, just look at what we've done.

I have very little respect for the integrity of the trading on the exchange in most stocks, and I have particular disdain for the fact that the SEC has failed to deal with high-frequency traders who are doing nothing more than taking advantage of inside information, a buy or a sell order, because of technology advantages. If you read Flash Boys, it's all spelled out for you. And if I execute an order, I'll use the IEX.

Well, that's not the way it should operate in an honestly or intelligently run exchange. But that's the thing.

We held high, but we made $20 million more than we did last year, and it's another increase in our quarter. And even though we held high, we were also carrying an equal amount of extra payroll for the Palace, which opens next month. So the increase is real. We'll be transferring all those employees in the next few weeks -- in the next few days, actually. And so we'll have a different expense pattern for the Peninsula operation of Wynn and Encore in the months ahead as we legalize of the payroll. 
I think we mentioned table allocations in our press release, and I'd like to take a moment or 2 to comment upon those and give some insight to those 160-odd people that are on this call, according to the operator. 
We haven't analyzed, in the past, as we headed towards the opening. We were unable because of the table gap to predict how many tables we would get. So we established, a long time ago, various scenarios where we could operate from 100 tables to 280 tables, new tables on how to operate both hotels, all 3 of them actually, efficiently and profitably. Some of the things that you may find interesting, for example, in recent months, and this is pretty typical. We had 180 tables allocated at Wynn and Encore to VIP to junkets. And then analyzed, as we do now for the past year, we've had a completely different focus in this company about the gambling activity of our clientele. And instead of analyzing the casino on win or turnover, we've analyzed both in the United States and in the People's Republic of China in Macau, we've analyzed and we run our business on a completely different model. And that model is contribution to EBITDA, to profitability of each unit in the casino, regardless of win or turnover or activity of a gambling customer. 
What instead we looked at is how much money do we make with such pieces of equipment, would it be a table, a baccarat table or a slot machine. And the source of our inquiry both in the United States and China have a been a very enlightening, and I'll share them with you. As an example, of 180 junket tables in a month, 60 of them were responsible for all of the EBITDA. The other 120 we either break even, or in some cases, losses taking all costs into account. That is to say that our profitability was limited to a much smaller group than one would at first imagine. Now with -- and we made a number of very startling changes in the way we laid out our casino, the policies that we employed with regard to the rules of the game, craps, blackjack and baccarat, roulette included, that embraced limits, the moments with the client when we would give free promotional allowance, allocations of rooms, food, beverage or airfare, we took a different look at all of that. And since last July 10, year ago, a little bit over a year ago, we changed Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau because we were the largest recipient of Asian business in our hotel in Las Vegas. And when that business tailed off, as it has in the industry, we decided that -- then we lost $150 million in win at one point, that's how big our baccarat business was, if we could lose $150 million, and we were left with a smaller number. We used to give discounts to blackjack players and crap shooters. We dealt blackjack at 3-to-2 if you've got 21. We started  putting in tables where we paid 6-to-5 and dealt single decks or double decks. We changed the layout of the floor. We put our higher yielding games in more prominent locations. We put destination type games like craps in secondary locations. We changed the amount of odd -- free odds that we gave in dice games from what was commonly referred to as the 3, 4, 5 game. And that had to do with the amount of free odds you get if you made a line bet to double odds. 
To give you an example, when someone has a 3, 4, 5 crap game, the house advantage is 37 basis points, 38 basis points. When you go to double odds, the house advantage is 58 or 57 basis points. Now that doesn't sound like a lot, that's a very narrow margin of a house advantage mathematically. However, 20 basis points is a 60% or 70% increase in a margin of a dice game. So that the outcome, in terms of profitability, was based upon a rather granular analysis of each game. 
We made a bunch of changes. And in so doing, we were able to overcome, in terms of profitability, what would ordinarily have been a massive loss of top line revenue. So the gaming industry is a little deceptive in many respects. It takes a very sharp analysis and very, very high degree of self-awareness because when you take rooms away from the casino block and you can sell them for cash, our margins in the hotel rooms are very high as they are slot machines. 
Casino table games in Las Vegas, if you were to do an analysis, would have a profit margin in the teens, at best. We were able to take our profit margins in table games up to the 40s, which I think is unique in our industry. With this kind of analysis applied to China is also very enlightening and instructive.
Having allocations, having table craps, as we are experiencing in places like Pennsylvania. I was, this week, I stopped at Bethlehem at The Sands facility and I was watching what an alert management team did to offset limitations imposed politically on the amount of tables. And they used a concept known as stadium games. We used 3 or 4 dealers for roulette and blackjack and have 150 automated digital stations for players that allow people that is a much more efficient use of an allocation of tables because you get 150 players with 4 dealers. And in the case of Bethlehem, when I watched the other day, on Tuesday, and they were able to take advantage of that and introduce people at the lower minimum table limits to roulette and baccarat who may not have played those games who were not for the low entry-level afforded by the Stadium concept. 
Now we use those at the Wynn Macau, and they're being used in Singapore and around the country. And I suspect that because of the payroll efficiency inherent in such concepts, that we're going to see more of it. And it allows us to make better use of our staffing levels and offer the opportunity for excitement on a playing level to customers in a manner that's very efficient. 
Having said all that, we anticipate the following aspects of our business, which will not impact our profitability. That by having fewer games, you get to have higher utilization. Remember, in most casinos around the world, utilization is less than 50%. You're sort of keeping the payroll in the games for the periods, weekends, a few shifts a week. By having fewer tables, you increase utilization dramatically, and you're able to control limits. So let's get to the second part of my presentation, which is this: a close analysis of the market in Macao will demonstrate that the bulk of the profitability in business is in what is now referred to as premium mass business. We distinguish between mass and VIP because in mass, very much like America, people buying in for cash. They play with regular chips that are negotiable, as opposed to the VIP or junket end, where we use nonredeemable chips that are purchased by junket operators, are supplied to us and then the customers are forced to bet that nonredeemable chip, and they keep betting the nonredeemable chips and they save the redeemable ones and then either cash out or buy more nonredeemable chips, in which case, can get a can discount. My point is this: the money we make and the margin that we enjoy is based upon the best premium bet. And that premium mass end is not a hard line of division. It isn't a question if one guy bets $25 using U.S. currency for a moment. That's $25 and the premium guide bet is $500. No, there's a whole range in between where people bet $2,000 $3,000 a decision, but they're playing in the mass area of the casino. We refer to those as a more premium customer. Now the Wynn Palace in Cotai was designed from day 1, 6 years ago, specifically for premium mass business. Some of our competitors who are very intelligent operators, they've designed buildings that are specifically designed for the lower end of the mass market. The Wynn Palace is not such a structure. The rooms, the restaurants, the retail, all of the amenities, the layout of the place its this entire conceptual framework was based upon getting the higher type of mass player. So we were always in a position to operate our casino with less equipment than our competitors. Just to give you one example of that one, when we opened Wynn Las Vegas, we have close to 2,900 slot machines and we won $180 million a year. Today, even with Encore, we win well over $200 million with less than 1,800 machines. Technology has played a role in this, and it is playing a role in table games as well. 
So to close this little presentation of mine, we feel positive and comfortable about the hotel and we're looking forward to the opening to the 22nd of August and I'm hoping that some of the things that I've just highlighted in my comments are instructive to all of you. 
One other note away from China and the United States and Las Vegas for a moment is on Tuesday at 5:00, we expect to get our final environmental permit in Boston and begin full-scale construction on Wednesday. Although we've had hundreds of people at work already on areas that were not impacted by the environmental permit work that was necessary to build our building underthings like the Slurry Wall and other preparatory constructions -- aspects of the foundation. But hard construction begins on the tower itself Wednesday morning, and we don't anticipate any other interference with that process. I think that about covers it. Matt, Steve, Bob is on the call from Massachusetts and is happy to elaborate on any of the comments that I made or any comments you have, which you may begin asking right now.

And those numbers jump up and down, depending on who shows up. I mean, to give you an example, in the last week in Las Vegas, in 5 days, we won $22 million in our own program in baccarat, from a handful of customers. So we get this -- we benefit from having an extremely loyal high-end group of customers that come to us in a number of ways, some through junkets in China and some in our own programs here. And they vary -- the volatility or the attendance of such clientele varies, unpredictably from month-to-month and week-to-week. So the reason we don't discuss it is because it would be irrelevant.

You may -- those of you who watch this industry so closely and our competitors as well, may find this to be a fascinating observation. When we concentrate this business on the tables that we haven't predetermined to be the ones that are most profitable and increased their utilization. Some of this speculation has to remain a speculation. But I think you're going to see the results quick enough in August, the last week in August, and in September leading up to Golden Week. And I think that we might find this very instructive before it's over. And we don't do much spinning here. We let the numbers speak for themselves. But I want to point out that the trend in our industry is constantly been to less equipment and more efficient utilization of that equipment. I also want to remind everybody that you cannot get dynamic in a casino. You can only get dynamic in a noncasino area where you create attractions that produce people of a certain income level that make the place profitable. And I can't overstate that simple observation more strongly enough. In a hotel casino, in these integrated resorts, the hotel itself is the show. A lot of conversation has been promulgated about the diversification of gaming away from just gambling to non-gambling things, and that conversation has widely and largely been misunderstood. So let me make about that now. When you say diversify to noncasino things, you have to understand, that isn't a simplistic thing. We'll have more restaurants, we'll have more shows, we'll have more to this or that other than a slot machine or a baccarat table. Diversification means how well do you make the entire place an attraction from a hospitality and touristic point of view, so that you don't just rely on a baccarat player or a slot machine player. Now that diversification involves the entire building. We spend, without exception and without any possibility of contradiction, more money on noncasino attractions in Wynn Palace then has ever been spent on any facility of that sort on the planet Earth. And it has been done in the things that really matter to people, the whip of the hallways, the height of the ceilings, the attractiveness, the decor, the size of the rooms, the elegance and luxury of the retail offerings, and most importantly, the entertainment quotient of each and every food and beverage outlet. The customers of Macau in the past, since '02 and even before with Stanley Ho's operations. The customers have a very distinctive personality. They shop, they eat and they gamble. Their attendance to traditional entertainment attractions has been unpredictable, and in most cases, unsatisfactory. We saw Cirque du Soleil show, remarkable company that we pioneered ourselves in the Las Vegas. We saw that show open and close at the Venetian. The entertainment attraction at the City of Dreams is primarily being supported by freebies and people go in and offer the experience complementarity. What we have seen at Wynn Macau and Wynn Las Vegas, the only five-star facility in Macau and the most complete in terms of 5 stars in spot, 5 stars in food, 5 stars in rooms, that's very unique in the gaming industry. We're the only ones that have that kind of across-the-board five-star rating. That is diversification. When Wynn Palace begins at 8:00 in the evening, on the night of August 22, everybody will experience visually for the first time, the press will see at the week before with me, the most diverse, the most elegant, the most completely diversified attraction in the hospitality industry that exists anywhere in the world. I say that unequivocally because it took us 6 years to be able to make that statement. And all of you who have enough interest in the matter and the press will get to see it for themselves. You'll eat the food with the incredible array of chefs from pastry to -- we have a lane to CAS chef in our coffee shop in this hotel. It's on the water. Experiencing $70 or $80 million worth of entertainment on the fountains. That filters through the entertainment quality in each of the restaurants, even in the gaming areas. So in the lobbies, tens and millions of dollars have been spent on floors that open, the theme of the hotel is flowers. We're talking about Ferris wheels, carousels, 25-foot wall Fabergé eggs that open, all made of flowers. Everywhere in the hotel, there is entertainment, public entertainment. And in every aspect of the hotel, the hospitality, diversification has been intensified and redoubled and those are the things -- you if you want to take a hotel to another level, not a casino, a hotel, then you have to revisit each and every component, down to the most minute detail, and revisit them, ask all of the questions, question your history, question fundamental assumptions. The ones that survive have survived cross examination and recross. And new stuff emerges as you apply a great deal of self-critical judgment in the design development phase. All of this will be self-explanatory and self evident at 8:00 on 22nd of August to the rest of the world when this hotel takes its first breath publicly. The press will get to see it, and the financial community in the days preceding August 22. Incidentally, we adopted a technique. I was asked how do you want to handle the opening, Steve? I said I'd tell you how I want to handle the opening. I want to show the world -- I want to show the political leaders who don't attend these hotels, I want them to see the Vilas, the penthouses, the entertainment attractions, alone in small groups of tourists in each of these remarkable moments in this building before it opens. And then during the month, that's what I'm going to do on the 22nd to our invited guests. But in the weeks preceding August 22, all 12,000 or 13,000 of our employees will be in small groups of 8 to 10 and experience the identical tour and visualization of this hotel in tours with music and with full tilt presentations, so that by the time we get to August 22, there will be an awareness in the community of what we have built. That is the policy we're following and it begins in 2 days. And that is the indoctrination and the display. When you talk about the Vilas and the penthouses and the other attractions in this hotel, normal people will never get to see them. They will be reserved for special guests that are being entertained, that are being fed in these restaurants, the politicians and political leaders, union leaders, line employees will never see every part of this place, because they're specialized in certain parts of it. But our job from August 1 to August 22 will be to make sure that anybody who works for the Wynn Macau company in either the Peninsula operations or the one in Cotai are completely exposed to what we have built for them as a place to work. Because at the end of the day, this is all about our employees. Because if our employees have a sense of the place and its luxury and its special nature, then it they will pass that onto the public. Those are our strategies, those are our philosophy. That's our thinking. And we're going to bring it all to bear, along with 40-odd years of experience to see if we can get this place off and running in a nice way. It was built to take market share, no question about it, no need to word about it and we'll see we can keep a promise. Personally, I saw 3 weeks ago, I thought it was of the most joyful place we've ever built. My wife and I walked through the building and we were quite dazzled by it.

None of those remarkable infrastructure additions that the government has instigated. They've not yet matured and come in to season. So what we're seeing is the picture that you're sharing with us at the moment, based upon the numbers from our results and the other and the other companies in Macau. The things that are in the pipeline, the bridges is being constructed, monorail with its growing pains, seems to be settling in and work, as work is proceeding on that. Those things all add to the viability of all of the operators in the special administrative region. And they can do nothing but help, as far as I understand them. All they can do is make it easy year for more people to get to Macau. The penetration of Macau in terms of the general population is still small. The room for growth is astronomical when you consider coming into play in how many folks there are. The visitation in Macau is being augmented and enhanced not only by these infrastructure projects that are breathtaking, that bridge and the monorail, that light rail. But by the very facilities of that the concessionaires have invested in and have opened.

It's almost impossible to predict exactly what effect that will have without getting into on economics discussion. I mean, we have, sooner or later, our political establishment is going to be forced, regardless of party affiliation, to deal with $19 trillion in debt that's climbing by around $1.6 billion a day. That means that if the treasury auction each month in downtown Washington we're printing money at the rate of $40 billion or $50 billion a month, which is of course, increasing the money supply and directly impacting the living standard or the buying power of the US dollar of people who are being paid, like everybody on this call today. Now part of the frustration in America and is the fact that the deficit is having an enormous impact on the living style living standard of Americans but not all of this is well understood by the folks, to use Bill O'Reilly's term. The folks are being -- their living standard is being clipped by the deficit and by the printing of money and the increase of the money supply. How long can this go on? In the history of the Western world, inflating your way out of this kind of a problem, taken to its extreme, to use the Weimar Republic, as an example, people went grocery shopping with wheelbarrows full of currency. Now when -- before the recession, the euro was $0.87 -- $0.85 on a dollar. During quantitative easing 1, 2 and 3, it went up to $1.48. That was the valuation of American currency by 20%. Now it's about 10 and to use of that as a benchmark for a moment. It isn't that the dollar got stronger. It's the euro got weaker because of they started quantitatively leasing and printing money in the euro So this deficit issue impacts the mental health, the frustration, the positive sense of tomorrow that working people feel in America. It doesn't have to do with rich folks. It has got to do with government, fiscal and monetary policy. We have $14 trillion in public debt and $5 trillion in intergovernmental debt. The coupon on that $19 trillion and climbing is around 2.3%, and that's with short-term interest rates at 0, virtually. The Fed -- the current Fed, the lady is going to keep interest rates where they are. That of course, protects all of the credit card debt of 1 trillion that's out there and so we don't have mass panic on the credit card interest. But I know that the government is in a quandary on what to do about this. Now the issue about what's going to happen with the election isn't so much an issue of Trump versus Clinton at the moment. It's a question of whether the House and the Senate and the Executive branch can get together and make Americans feel safer and have a fiscal and monetary policy that isn't self-destructive, which currently, it is. Now I know that in this time of year, everybody is making all kinds of promises and declarations that they can do things or they will do things but of course,, they cannot without exacerbating problems that are currently plaguing the country. What is lamentable is about the public discourse today on both sides, misses the point entirely. We're in the chicken for every pot season where everybody is promising the moon. I recall that one of the most popular themes this year is that we've got to get student loans and the burden of sin loans off the back of the kids. When of the Affordable Care Act was passed, and it was going to have a negative impact on the deficit, which sponsors have promised it wouldn't, the sponsors went looking for a way to offset $8 billion or so in additional deficit and they came up with a kind of a stunned that we did with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when we eliminated mortgage brokers and we just took the loans directly into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And that led to the collapse of $5 trillion of the system. Well, they did the same thing with the Department of Education. They gave the student loans directly from the Department of Education and eliminated a middle people. And then they charge 6.5 points or 650 basis points for student loans instead of passing these savings because the Department of Education that is really at a cost of money. But they're making dissident loans direct since the Affordable Care Act. Bernie Sanders did not talk about that. But that 650 basis points, that carry is being made by the government to offset what would have been even greater impact on the deficit by the Affordable Care Act. Well, if you really were sincere about making a better life for the kids, you would have the past the loans from the Department of Education to the kids at cost, which would have been interest-free. But this kind of hypocrisy, which sort of is endemic to the whole system, regardless of party, has got to come to a halt. Because if it doesn't, then it insinuates itself into economic demand for services and products. It certainly insinuates itself into the price of everything, from Walmart to shoes and sneakers. Those things haven't, by themselves, becoming more precious. The value of the dollar has declined. I know that we talked about China pulling with their currency. The United States has pulled with its currency even more aggressively than the People's Republic of China. I'm not an apologist for China or anybody. I'm stating a fact but you want see this in of the conventions of either party. You won't hear this sort of thing because it's so uncomfortable to talk about. But the election could put America on a better track if all the Senators and Congressmen and the President and the cabinet members decide that they should work it won't. I don't know about anybody on this call but I'm not in a position to make that prediction. But it surely, surely impacts the life of every American. Tax policy and all the rest all, rolled into this. And businessmen across the country and people at work in businesses will be affected by this, as sure as sunrise tomorrow. And there seems to be a fear to deal with it directly. So count me as 1 of those old white guys that is frustrated."

And yet, our cost of operating these places has climbed steadily over that period. And the mentality of the marketing people and of the gaming people that deals directly with that sector of the business has been trained, has been grown and matured with a focus on the top line. The average bet, the length of play, how often does the customer, what is our chance of winning x dollars? And then let's get that customer, give him a room, pay for his airfare, send him a limousine, give him a bottle of free word. Do anything. Give him a shopping spree. These are the earmarks of the superficial thought that has guided casino management for decades. When it should have been focused on what is the profitability of every table and every customer. I'm not suggesting that they don't have profitability meanings and reviews in these various enterprises, but I am in a position to say that any examination by any financial person, in or out of the industry, will reveal that the profit margins of table games in the gaming -- in the United States of America stinks. Lousy, less than 20%. Now, these businesses end up with margins close to 30 because they have slot machines and rooms and bars and nightclubs. But they forgotten sector has been profitability of table games. We decided to take another look at that a year ago. I remember exactly it was at the end of the second quarter and I went after it the 1st week of July. We started moving furniture and changing rules in collaboration with my colleagues like Maurice Wooden, vacation in Hawaii this week, Matt Maddox, Linda Chen, Ian Cochrane, word, Steve Cootey, made Chief Financial Officer, and everybody in China. So and we decided that there had to be a better way to do this. Is it stuff to model table games. You. I don't know how you do your model but if you do a deep dive in companies like the ones about light on The Strip in Las Vegas or regional casinos and took a look at the profitability of table games, that model is shaky. We changed that here. We don't care about the drop. We don't care about that. We care about the profitability of every foot in the casino. We take a very merchandising retail approach to the floor. I think Sheldon has done that in China when he opened up years ago. It's harder to do it when you're not living in an avalanche revenue the way we did when casinos first started in Macau. In a day-to-day disciplined grind of normal operations, it requires reeducating all of the marketing and casino personnel to look at the customers differently. We don't even issue promotional allowances or comps based upon past performance. We do it on current business activity. That is to say, if you play The Strip at a certain level, we'll give you free meals or free rooms. But if you played that way last year and you show up this week, we're waiting to see what happens this week. That's a big change in the way they thought in this business. And it requires a lot of discipline, and frankly, rededication of the people who work in the casinos. It took us months to get to where we want to be in Las Vegas. But imagine, we were able to overcome the loss of $50 million or $80 million of baccarat and save money in Las Vegas. That's hard to do. But now when someone plays it's a business, it's a business. Otherwise, we solid rooms to cash customers and we reallocate the space in our building. The business model is constantly morphing and changing and is it not doing so in every business in the world? And of the price goes to who's agile. We're trying. We are, so to speak, in a commercial sense, constantly in a yoga class. So factor that into your modeling. Maybe you'd be able to follow us."

And even though we held hig",1826,"Hello, everybody, and it's very nice to have this call. I think you've seen our earnings. And we were happy with Macau. We held high, but we made $20 million more than we did last year, and it's another increase in our quarter. And even though we held high, we were also carrying an equal amount of extra payroll for the Palace, which opens next month. So the increase is real. We'll be transferring all those employees in the next few weeks -- in the next few days, actually. And so we'll have a different expense pattern for the Peninsula operation of Wynn and Encore in the months ahead as we equalize the payroll. 
I think we mentioned table allocations in our press release, and I'd like to take a moment or 2 to comment upon those and give some insight to those 160-odd people that are on this call, according to the operator. 
We haven't analyzed in the past as we headed towards the opening. We were unable because of the table gap to predict how many tables we would get. So we established long time ago various scenarios where we could operate from 100 tables to 280 tables, new tables, on how to operate both hotels, all 3 of them actually, efficiently and profitably. Some of the things that you may find interesting, for example, in a recent month, and this is pretty typical. We had 180 tables allocated at Wynn and Encore to VIP to junkets. And then we analyzed, as we do now, for the past year, we've had a completely different focus in this company about the gambling activity of our clientele. And instead of analyzing the casino on win or turnover, we've analyzed both in the United States and in the People's Republic of China in Macau. We've analyzed and we run our business on a completely different model. And that model is contribution to EBITDA, to profitability of each unit in the casino, regardless of win or turnover or activity of a gambling customer. 
What instead we look at is how much money do we make with such pieces of equipment, whether it be a table, a baccarat table or a slot machine. And the results of our inquiry both in the United States and China have been very, very enlightening, and I'll share them with you. As an example, of 180 junket tables in a month, 60 of them were responsible for all of the EBITDA. The other 120 were either breaking even or, in some cases, losses, taking all costs into account. That is to say that our profitability was limited to a much smaller group than one would at first imagine. Now with -- and we made a number of very startling changes in the way we laid out our casino, the policies that we employed with regard to the rules of the game, craps, blackjack and baccarat, roulette included, that embraced limits, the moments with the client when we would give free promotional allowance, allocations of rooms, food, beverage or airfare. We took a different look at all of that. And since last July 10, year ago, a little over a year ago, we changed Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, because we were the largest recipient of Asian business in our hotel in Las Vegas. And when that business tailed off, as it has in the industry, we decided that -- and we lost $150 million in win at one point. That's how big our baccarat business was, if we could lose $150 million, and we were left with a smaller number. We used to give discounts to blackjack players and crap shooters. We dealt blackjack at 3:2 if you've got 21. We started  putting in tables where we paid 6:5 and dealt single decks or double decks. We changed the layout on the floor. We put our higher yielding games in more prominent locations. We put destination-type games like craps in secondary locations. We changed the amount of odd -- free odds that we gave in dice games from what was commonly referred to as the 3, 4, 5 game. And that had to do with the amount of free odds you get if you made line bet to double odds. 
To give you an example, when someone has a 3, 4, 5 crap game, the house advantage is 37 basis points -- 38 basis points. When you go to double odds, the house advantage is 58 or 57 basis points. Now that doesn't sound like a lot. That's a very narrow margin of a house advantage mathematically. However, 20 basis points is a 60% or 70% increase in the margin of a dice game. So that the outcome in terms of profitability was based upon a rather granular analysis of each game. 
We made a bunch of changes. And in so doing, we were able to overcome in terms of profitability what would ordinarily have been a massive loss of top line revenue. So the gaming industry is a little deceptive in many respects. It takes a very sharp analysis and very, very high degree of self-awareness because when you take rooms away from the casino block and you can sell them for cash, our margins in the hotel rooms are very high, as they are slot machines. 
Casino table games in Las Vegas, if you were to do an analysis, would have a profit margin in the teens. At best, we were able to take our profit margins in table games up into the 40s, which I think is unique in our industry. With this kind of analysis applied to China is also very enlightening and instructive.
Having allocations, having table caps, as we are experiencing in places like Pennsylvania, I was -- this week, I stopped at Bethlehem at the Sands facility, and I was watching what an alert management team did to offset limitations imposed politically on the amount of tables. And they used a concept known as stadium games, where you use 3 or 4 dealers for roulette and blackjack and have 150 automated digital stations for players that allowed people -- it is a much more efficient use of an allocation of tables because you get 150 players with 4 dealers. And in the case of Bethlehem, when I watched the other day, on Tuesday, and they were able to take advantage of that and introduce people at lower minimum table limits to roulette and baccarat, who might not have played those games were it not for the low entry level afforded by the stadium concept. 
Now we use those at the Wynn Macau, and they're being used in Singapore and around the country. And I suspect that because of the payroll efficiency inherent in such concepts that we're going to see more of it. And it allows us to make better use of our staffing levels and offer the opportunity for excitement on a playing level to customers in a manner that's very efficient. 
Having said all that, we anticipate the following aspects of our business, which will not impact our profitability. That by having fewer games, you get to have higher utilization. Remember, in most casinos around the world, utilization is less than 50%. You're sort of keeping the payroll in the games for peak periods, weekends, a few shifts a week. By having fewer tables, you increase utilization dramatically, and you're able to control limits. So let's get to the second part of my presentation, which is this: a close analysis of the market in Macao will demonstrate that the bulk of the profitability in business is in what is now referred to as premium mass business. We distinguish between mass and VIP, because in the mass, very much like America, people buy in for cash. They play with regular chips that are negotiable as opposed to the VIP or junket end, where we use nonredeemable chips that are purchased by junket operators who supplied to us and then the customer is forced to bet that nonredeemable chip, and they keep betting the nonredeemable chips and they save the redeemable ones and then either cash out or buy more nonredeemable chips, in which case they get a discount. My point is this: the money we make and the margin that we enjoy is based upon the mass premium end. And that premium mass end is not a hard line of division. It isn't a question of while one guy bets $25 -- using U.S. currency for a moment -- bets $25 and a premium guy bets $500. No, there's a whole range in between where people bet $2,000, $3,000 of decision, but they're playing in the mass area of a casino. We refer to those as a more premium customer. Now the Wynn Palace in Cotai was designed from day 1, 6 years ago, specifically for premium mass business. Some of our competitors, who are very intelligent operators, they've designed buildings that are specifically designed for the lower end of the mass market. The Wynn Palace is not such a structure. The rooms, the restaurants, the retail, all of the amenities, the layout of the place, its this entire conceptual framework was based upon getting the higher type of mass player. So we were always in a position to operate our casino with less equipment than our competitors. Incidentally to give you an example of that, when we opened Wynn Las Vegas, we had close to 2,900 slot machines and we won $180 million a year. Today, even with Encore, we win well over $200 million with less than 1,800 machines. Technology has played a role in this, and it is playing a role in table games as well. 
So to close this little presentation of mine, we feel positive and comfortable about the hotel, and we're looking forward to the opening on the 22nd of August. And I'm hoping that some of the things that I've just highlighted in my comments are instructive to all of you. 
One other note away from China and the United States, and Las Vegas for a moment, is on Tuesday at 5:00, we expect to get our final environmental permit in Boston and begin full-scale construction on Wednesday, although we've had hundreds of people at work already on areas that were not impacted by the environmental permit, work that was necessary to build our building on things like a slurry wall and other preparatory constructions -- aspects of the foundation. But hard construction begins on the tower itself Wednesday morning, and we don't anticipate any other interference with that process. I think that about covers it. Matt, Steve, Bob DeSalvio is on the call from Massachusetts and is happy to elaborate on any of the comments that I've made or any other questions you may have, which you can begin asking right now.

And they're going to be both. They're all established with proper tables in both Cotai and in the Peninsula in August at the opening regardless of anything that we've discussed so far. But we also run our own program very much like we do in Las Vegas, where we give credit to people in Hong Kong where we're permitted to do so. And those numbers jump up and down depending on who shows up. I mean, to give you an example, in the last week in Las Vegas, in 5 days, we won $22 million in our own program in baccarat from a handful of customers. So we get this -- we benefit from having an extremely loyal high-end group of customers that come to us in a number of ways, some through junkets in China and some in our own programs here. And they vary -- the volatility or the attendance of such clientele varies, unpredictably from month-to-month and week-to-week. So the reason we don't discuss it is because it would be irrelevant. It's not instructive, and it's unpredictable, which is why we don't give guidance on it, because we really don't know what to say other than what I've just told you."

How should we also be thinking about the potential that you're actually peeling off more of Wynn Macau's tables and what you would do to your revenue of your existing Wynn Macau? Basically, I'm trying to understand this risk of self-cannibalization, which I think, Steve, you brought the point that maybe only 60 tables out of the 183 in VIP are contributing to the profits, so you have some slack to pick up there. But what about some of the mass market tables and premium mass market tables in the existing Wynn Macau today that you may have to shift to get Wynn Palace to the right size. How do you feel about this risk of self-cannibalization in the coming weeks as you open Wynn Palace?"

You may -- those of you who watch this industry so closely and our competitors as well may find this to be a fascinating observation, when we concentrate this business on the tables that we have predetermined to be the ones that are most profitable and increase their utilization. Some of this speculation has to remain a speculation. But I think you're going to see the results quick enough in August, the last week in August, and in September leading up to Golden Week. And I think that we might find this very instructive before it's over. And we don't do much spinning here. We let the numbers speak for themselves. But I want to point out that the trend in our industry has constantly been to less equipment and more efficient utilization of that equipment. I also want to remind everybody that you cannot get dynamic in a casino. You can only get dynamic in a noncasino area where you create attractions that produce people of a certain income level that make the place profitable. And it's -- I can't overstate that simple observation more strongly enough. In a hotel casino, in these integrated resorts, the hotel itself is the show. A lot of conversation has been promulgated about the diversification of gaming away from just gambling to non-gambling things, and that conversation has widely and largely been misunderstood. So let me make a point about that now. When you say diversify to noncasino things, you have to understand that isn't a simplistic thing, well, we'll have more restaurants, we'll have more shows, we'll have more this or that, other than a slot machine or a baccarat table. Diversification means how well do you make the entire place an attraction from a hospitality and touristic point of view, so that you don't just rely on a baccarat player or a slot machine player. Now that diversification involves the entire building. We spent, without exception and without any possibility of contradiction, more money on noncasino attractions in Wynn Palace than has ever been spent on any facility of that sort on the planet Earth. And it has been done in the things that really matter to people: the whip of the hallways; the height of the ceilings; the attractiveness; the decor; the size of the rooms; the elegance and luxury of the retail offerings; and most importantly, the entertainment quotient of each and every food and beverage outlet. The customers of Macau in the past since '02 and even before with Stanley Ho's operation, the customers have a very distinctive personality. They shop, they eat and they gamble. Their attendance to traditional entertainment attractions has been unpredictable, and in most cases, unsatisfactory. We saw Cirque du Soleil show, remarkable company that we pioneered ourselves in the Las Vegas. We saw that show open and close at the Venetian. The entertainment attraction at the City of Dreams is primarily being supported by freebies when people that go in and are offered the experience complementarily. What we have seen at Wynn Macau and Wynn Las Vegas, the only 5-star facility in Macau and the most complete in terms of 5 stars in spa, 5 stars in food, 5 stars in rooms. That's very unique in the gaming industry. We're the only ones that have that kind of across-the-board 5-star rating. That is diversification. When Wynn Palace begins at 8:00 in the evening, on the night of August 22, everybody will experience visually for the first time, the press will see it the week before with me, the most diverse, the most elegant, the most completely diversified attraction in the hospitality industry that exists anywhere in the world. I say that, I say that unequivocally, because it took us 6 years to be able to make that statement. And all of you who have enough interest in the matter and the press will get to see it for themselves. You'll eat the food with the incredible array of chefs from pastry to -- we have Alain Ducasse, chef, in our coffee shop in this hotel. It's on the water, experiencing $70 or $80 million worth of entertainment on the fountains. That filters through to the entertainment quality in each of the restaurants, even in the gaming areas. So in the lobbies, tens of millions of dollars have been spent on floors that open. The theme of the hotel is flowers. We're talking about Ferris wheels, carousels, 25-foot tall Fabergé eggs that open, all made of flowers. Everywhere in the hotel, there is entertainment, public entertainment. And in every aspect of the hotel, the hospitality, diversification has been intensified and redoubled. And those are the things -- if you want to take a hotel to another level, not a casino, a hotel, then you have to revisit each and every component down to the most minute detail and revisit them, ask all of the questions, question your history, question fundamental assumptions, the ones that survive, have survived cross examination and recross. And new stuff emerges as you apply a great deal of self-critical judgment in the design development phase. All of this will be self-explanatory and self evident at 8:00 on 22nd of August to the rest of the world when this hotel takes its first breath publicly. The press will get to see it, and the financial community in the days preceding August 22. Incidentally, we adopted a technique. I was asked how do you want to handle the opening, Steve? I said, tell you how I want to handle the opening? I want to show the world, I want to show the political leaders who don't attend these hotels, I want them to see the villas, the penthouses, the entertainment attractions, alone, in small groups of tourists in each of these remarkable moments in this building before it opens. And then during the month, that's what I'm going to do on the 22nd to our invited guests. But in the weeks preceding August 22, all 12,000 or 13,000 of our employees will be in small groups of 8 to 10 and experience the identical tour and visualization of this hotel in tours with music and with Full Tilt presentations, so that by the time we get to August 22, there will be an awareness in the community of what we have built. That is the policy we're following, and it begins in 2 days. And that is the indoctrination and the display. When you talk about the villas and the penthouses and the other attractions in this hotel, normal people will never get to see them. They'll be reserved for special guests that are being entertained, that are being fed in these restaurants: the politicians and political leaders, union leaders. Line employees will never see every part of this place, because they're specialized in certain parts of it. But our job from August 1 to August 22 will be to make sure that anybody who works for the Wynn Macau company in either the Peninsula operations or the one in Cotai are completely exposed to what we have built for them as a place to work. Because at the end of the day, this is all about our employees. Because if our employees have a sense of the place and its luxury and its special nature, then they'll pass that on to the public. Those are our strategies. Those are our philosophy. That's our thinking. And we're going to bring it all to bear, along with 40-odd years of experience to see if we can get this place off and running in a nice way. It was built -- it was built to take market share. No question about it. No need to pussyfoot about it. And we'll see if we can keep the promise. Personally, I saw it 3 weeks ago. I thought it was most joyful place we've ever built. My wife, Andrea, and I walked through the building and we were quite dazzled by it. I'm hoping that all of you [indiscernible]."

They've not yet matured and come in to season. So what we're seeing is the picture that you're sharing with us at the moment, based upon the numbers from ourselves and the other gents and the other companies in Macau. The things that are in the pipeline, the bridges is it's mildly being constructed, monorail with its growing pains, seems to be settling in and work is proceeding on that. Those things all add to the viability of all of the operators in the special administrative region. And they can do nothing but help as far as I understand them. All they can do is make it easier for more people to get to Macau. The penetration of Macau in terms of the general population is still small. The room for growth is astronomical when you consider coming into play and how many folks there are. The visitation of Macau is being augmented and enhanced not only by these infrastructure projects that are breathtaking, that bridge and the monorail, the light rail. But by the very facilities that the concessionaires have invested in and then have opened. I mean, Galaxy and Venetian and the City of Dreams and Studio City are very aggressive, massive projects. And then Parisian comes on shortly. And then eventually, we'll have the SJM property, which I think in a stroke of real originality called the Palace, that comes on at some time next year, I guess. When is that due, Matt?"

No accident there, of course. We did it deliberately. And then that gondola station feeds the MGM, which is coming along in a few months. It feeds Parisian, it feeds the City of Dreams and Wynn, the Palace. So I like the interaction of the infrastructure as it comes on board, and it sort of matches and enhances the performance of the buildings and the projects that have been built.

It's almost impossible to predict exactly what effect that will have without getting into an economics discussion. I mean, we have, sooner or later, our political establishment is going to be forced, regardless of party affiliation, to deal with $19 trillion in debt that's climbing by around $1.6 billion a day. That means that in the treasury auction each month in downtown Washington, we're printing money at the rate of $40 billion or $50 billion a month, which is of course increasing the money supply and directly impacting the living standard or the buying power of the U.S. dollar of people who are being paid like everybody on this call today. Now part of the frustration in America and -- is the fact that the deficit is having an enormous impact on the living style and the living standard of Americans but not all of this is well understood by the folks, to use Bill O'Reilly's term. The folks are being -- their living standard being clipped by the deficit and by the printing of money and the increase of the money supply. How long can this go on? In the history of the Western world, inflating your way out of this kind of a problem, taken to its extreme, to use the Weimar Republic as an example, people went grocery shopping with wheelbarrows full of currency. Now when -- before the recession, the euro was $0.87 -- $0.85 on a dollar. During quantitative easing 1, 2 and 3, it went up to $1.48. That was a devaluation of American currency by 20%. Now it's above 10% and to use that as a benchmark for a moment, it isn't that the dollar got stronger. It's that the euro got weaker because they started quantitative easing and printing money in the euro community. So this deficit issue impacts the mental health, the frustration, the positive sense of tomorrow that working people feel in America. It hasn't got to do with rich folks. It's got to do with government, fiscal and monetary policy. We have $14 trillion in public debt and $5 trillion in intergovernmental debt. The coupon on that $19 trillion and climbing is around 2.3%. And that's with short-term interest rates at 0, virtually. Now the Fed -- the current Fed, the lady is going to keep interest rates where they are. That, of course, protects all of the credit card debt of $1 trillion that's out there and so we don't have mass panic on the credit card interest. But I know that the government is in a quandary as to what to do about this. Now the issue about what's going to happen with the election isn't so much an issue of Trump versus Clinton at the moment. It's a question of whether the House and the Senate and the Executive branch can get together and make Americans feel safer and have a fiscal or monetary policy that isn't self-destructive, which currently, it is. Now I know that in this time of year, everybody is making all kinds of promises and declarations that they can do things or they will do things but, of course, they cannot without exacerbating the problems that are currently plaguing the country. What is lamentable is that the public discourse today on both sides misses the point entirely. We're in the chicken for every pot season where everybody is promising the moon. I recall that one of the most popular themes this year is that we've got to get student loans and the burden of student loans off the back of the kids. When the Affordable Care Act was passed, and it was going to have a negative impact on the deficit, which its sponsors have promised it wouldn't, the sponsors went looking for a way to offset $8 billion or so in additional deficit, and they came up with the kind of a stunt that we did with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when we eliminated mortgage brokers and we just took the loans directly into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and that led to the collapse of $5 trillion of the system. Well, they did the same thing with the Department of Education. They gave the student loans directly from the Department of Education and eliminate any middle people. And then they charged 6.5 points or 650 basis points for student loans instead of passing these savings because the Department of Education doesn't really have a cost of the money. But they're making the student loans direct since the Affordable Care Act. Bernie Sanders didn't talk about that. But that 650 basis points, that carry is being made by the government to offset what would have been even greater impact on the deficit by the Affordable Care Act. Well, if you really were sincere about making a better life for the kids, you would have passed the loans from the Department of Education to the kids at cost, which would have been interest-free. But this kind of hypocrisy, which sort of is endemic to the whole system, regardless of party, has got to come to a halt. Because if it doesn't, then it insinuates itself into economic demand for services and products. It certainly insinuates itself into the price of everything, from Walmart to shoes and sneakers. Those things haven't been, by themselves, become more precious. The value of the dollar has declined. I know that we talk about China pulling with their currency. The United States has pulled with its currency even more aggressively than the People's Republic of China. I'm not an apologist for China or anybody. I'm simply stating a fact. But you won't see this in the conventions of either party. You won't hear this sort of thing because it's so uncomfortable to talk about it. But the election could put America on a better track if all the Senators and Congressmen and the Presidents and the cabinet members decide that they should or it won't. I don't know about anybody on this call but I'm not in a position to make that prediction. But it surely, surely impacts the life of every American. Tax policy and all the rest all roll into this. And businessmen across the country and people at work in businesses will be affected by this as sure as sunrise tomorrow. And there seems to be a fear to deal with it directly. So count me as one of those old white guys that's frustrated.
Robin, if I can, I'm going to say something to Robin. Robin, there's 465 agencies in government, and there's 4,150,000 federal employees. 1.5 million are in uniform. 2,650,000 of them are civilians covered by the SEIU Union and the Civil Service Act. If you want to make government more efficient, you've got to have a big idea that resonates with all of the government employees, all 2,650,000 of them in 460 agencies. And it's going to have to be the kind of big idea that we used to run businesses, which is namely to reinforce positively the behavior that you wish to encourage. And that can be done with tax policy and with employment techniques in the federal government that works so well in the private sector. If we told everybody in those 465 agencies, you ran the business for x amount of dollars last year, if you maintained service levels and you can save $1, we'll distribute $0.20 on every dollar you save to those of you in those departments, you'd see the government contract in terms of its cost of operation overnight, we should have to incentivize the people in those 2,650,000  employees the way we incentivize people in the private sector and gain efficiency and better functionality. But those big ideas don't seem to apply in Washington. Enough of the speech. Go ahead with the questions."

And yet, our cost of operating these places has climbed steadily over that period. And the mentality of the marketing people and the gaming people that deal directly with that sector of the business has been trained, has been grown and matured with a focus on the top line. The average bet, the length of play, how often does the customer come? What is our chance of winning x dollars? And then, let's get that customer, give him a room, pay for his airfare, send a limousine, give him a bottle of Lafite Rothschild, do anything, give him a shopping spree. These are the earmarks of the superficial thought that has guided casino management for decades when it should have been focused on what is the profitability of every table and every customer. Now I'm not suggesting that they only profitability meetings and reviews at these various enterprises, but I am in a position to say that any examination by any financial person, in or out of the industry, will reveal that the profit margins of table games in the gaming -- in the United States of America stinks, lousy, less than 20%. Now these businesses end up with margins close to 30 because they have slot machines and rooms and bars and nightclubs. But the forgotten sector has been profitability of table games. We decided to take another look at that a year ago. I remember exactly. It was at the end of the second quarter and I went after it the 1st week of July. We started moving furniture and changing rules in collaboration with my colleagues like Maurice Wooden, who happens to be on vacation in Hawaii this week, Matt Maddox, Linda Chen, Ian Coughlan, Gamal Aziz, Steve Cootey, my Chief Financial Officer, and everybody in China. So -- and we decided that there had to be a better way to do this. You say it's tough to model table games. Dude, I don't know how you're doing your model. But if you do a deep dive in companies like the ones that lie on The Strip in Las Vegas or regional casinos and take a look at the profitability of table games, that model is shaky. We changed that here. We don't care about the drop. We don't care about that. We care about the profitability of every foot in the casino. We take a very merchandising retail approach to the floor. Incidentally, I think Sheldon has done that in China when he opened up years ago. It's harder to do it when you're not living in an avalanche of revenue the way we did when casinos first started in Macau. In the day-to-day disciplined grind of normal operation, it requires reeducating all of the marketing and casino personnel to look at the customers differently. We don't even issue promotional allowances or comps based upon past performance. We do it on current business activity. That is to say, if you play at The Strip at a certain level, we'll give you free meals or free rooms. But if you played that way last year and you show up this week, we're waiting to see what happens this week. That's a big change in the way they thought in this business. And it requires a lot of discipline and, frankly, reeducation of the people that work in the casinos. It took us months to get to where we wanted to be in Las Vegas. But imagine, we were able to overcome a loss of $50 million or $80 million of baccarat [indiscernible] make the same money [indiscernible]. That's hard to do. But now when someone plays, it's a business, it's a business. Otherwise, we sell the rooms to cash customers and we reallocate the space in our building. The business model is constantly morphing and changing and is it not doing so in every business in the world? And the price goes to who's agile. We're trying. We are, so to speak, in a commercial sense, constantly in a yoga class. So factor that into your modeling. Maybe you'd be able to follow us."

We held high, but we made $20 million more than we did last year, and it's another increase in our quarter. And even though we held high, we were also carrying an equal amount of extra payroll for the Palace, which opens next month. So the increase is real. We'll be transferring all those employees in the next few weeks -- in the next few days, actually. And so we'll have a different expense pattern for the Peninsula operation of Wynn and Encore in the months ahead as we equalize the payroll. 
I think we mentioned table allocations in our press release, and I'd like to take a moment or 2 to comment upon those and give some insight to those 160-odd people that are on this call, according to the operator. 
We haven't analyzed in the past as we headed towards the opening. We were unable because of the table gap to predict how many tables we would get. So we established long time ago various scenarios where we could operate from 100 tables to 280 tables, with new tables, on how to operate both hotels, all 3 of them actually, efficiently and profitably. Some of the things that you may find interesting, for example, in a recent month, and this is pretty typical. We had 180 tables allocated at Wynn and Encore to VIP -- to junkets. And then we analyzed, as we do now, for the past year, we've had a completely different focus in this company about the gambling activity of our clientele. And instead of analyzing the casino on win or turnover, we've analyzed both in the United States and in the People's Republic of China in Macau. We've analyzed and we run our business on a completely different model. And that model is contribution to EBITDA, to profitability of each unit in the casino, regardless of win or turnover or activity of a gambling customer. 
What instead we look at is how much money do we make with such pieces of equipment, whether it be a table, a baccarat table or a slot machine. And the results of our inquiry both in the United States and China have been very, very enlightening, and I'll share them with you. As an example, of 180 junket tables in a month, 60 of them were responsible for all of the EBITDA. The other 120 were either breaking even or, in some cases, losses, taking all costs into account. That is to say that our profitability was limited to a much smaller group than one would at first imagine. Now with -- and we made a number of very startling changes in the way we laid out our casino, the policies that we employed with regard to the rules of the game, craps, blackjack and baccarat, roulette included, that embraced limits, the moments with the client when we would give free promotional allowance, allocations of rooms, food, beverage or airfare. We took a different look at all of that. And since last July 10, year ago, a little over a year ago, we changed Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, because we were the largest recipient of Asian business in our hotel in Las Vegas. And when that business tailed off, as it has in the industry, we decided that -- and we lost $150 million in win at one point. That's how big our baccarat business was, if we could lose $150 million, and we were left with a smaller number. We used to give discounts to blackjack players and crap shooters. We dealt blackjack at 3:2 if you've got 21. We started  putting in tables where we paid 6:5 and dealt single decks or double decks. We changed the layout of the floor. We put our higher yielding games in more prominent locations. We put destination-type games like craps in secondary locations. We changed the amount of odd -- free odds that we gave in dice games from what was commonly referred to as the 3, 4, 5 game. And that had to do with the amount of free odds you get if you made line bet to double odds. 
To give you an example, when someone has a 3, 4, 5 crap game, the house advantage is 37 basis points -- 38 basis points. When you go to double odds, the house advantage is 58 or 57 basis points. Now that doesn't sound like a lot. That's a very narrow margin of a house advantage mathematically. However, 20 basis points is a 60% or 70% increase in the margin of a dice game. So that the outcome in terms of profitability was based upon a rather granular analysis of each game. 
We made a bunch of changes. And in so doing, we were able to overcome in terms of profitability what would ordinarily have been a massive loss of top line revenue. So the gaming industry is a little deceptive in many respects. It takes a very sharp analysis and very, very high degree of self-awareness because when you take rooms away from the casino block and you can sell them for cash, our margins in the hotel rooms are very high, as they are slot machines. 
Casino table games in Las Vegas, if you were to do an analysis, would have a profit margin in the teens. At best, we were able to take our profit margins in table games up into the 40s, which I think is unique in our industry. With this kind of analysis applied to China is also very enlightening and instructive.
Having allocations, having table caps, as we are experiencing in places like Pennsylvania, I was -- this week, I stopped at Bethlehem at the Sands facility, and I was watching what an alert management team did to offset limitations imposed politically on the amount of tables. And they used a concept known as stadium games, where you use 3 or 4 dealers for roulette and blackjack and have 150 automated digital stations for players that allowed people -- it is a much more efficient use of an allocation of tables because you get 150 players with 4 dealers. And in the case of Bethlehem, when I watched the other day, on Tuesday, and they were able to take advantage of that and introduce people at lower minimum table limits to roulette and baccarat, who might not have played those games were it not for the low entry level afforded by the stadium concept. 
Now we use those at the Wynn Macau, and they're being used in Singapore and around the country. And I suspect that because of the payroll efficiency inherent in such concepts that we're going to see more of it. And it allows us to make better use of our staffing levels and offer the opportunity for excitement on a playing level to customers in a manner that's very efficient. 
Having said all that, we anticipate the following aspects of our business, which will not impact our profitability. That by having fewer games, you get to have higher utilization. Remember, in most casinos around the world, utilization is less than 50%. You're sort of keeping the payroll in the games for peak periods, weekends, a few shifts a week. By having fewer tables, you increase utilization dramatically, and you're able to control limits. So let's get to the second part of my presentation, which is this: a close analysis of the market in Macao will demonstrate that the bulk of the profitability in business is in what is now referred to as premium mass business. We distinguish between mass and VIP, because in the mass, very much like America, people buy in for cash. They play with regular chips that are negotiable as opposed to the VIP or junket end, where we use nonredeemable chips that are purchased by junket operators who supplied to us and then the customer is forced to bet that nonredeemable chip, and they keep betting the nonredeemable chips and they save the redeemable ones and then either cash out or buy more nonredeemable chips, in which case they get a discount. My point is this: the money we make and the margin that we enjoy is based upon the mass premium end. And that premium mass end is not a hard line of division. It isn't a question of while one guy bets $25 -- using U.S. currency for a moment -- bets $25 and a premium guy bets $500. No, there's a whole range in between where people bet $2,000, $3,000 of decision, but they're playing in the mass area of the casino. We refer to those as a more premium customer. Now the Wynn Palace in Cotai was designed from day 1, 6 years ago, specifically for premium mass business. Some of our competitors, who are very intelligent operators, they've designed buildings that are specifically designed for the lower end of the mass market. The Wynn Palace is not such a structure. The rooms, the restaurants, the retail, all of the amenities, the layout of the place, its entire conceptual framework was based upon getting the higher type of mass player. So we were always in a position to operate our casino with less equipment than our competitors. Incidentally to give you an example of that, when we opened Wynn Las Vegas, we had close to 2,900 slot machines and we won $180 million a year. Today, even with Encore, we win well over $200 million with less than 1,800 machines. Technology has played a role in this, and it is playing a role in table games as well. 
So to close this little presentation of mine, we feel positive and comfortable about the hotel, and we're looking forward to the opening on the 22nd of August. And I'm hoping that some of the things that I've just highlighted in my comments are instructive to all of you. 
One other note away from China and the United States, and Las Vegas for a moment, is on Tuesday at 5:00, we expect to get our final environmental permit in Boston and begin full-scale construction on Wednesday, although we've had hundreds of people at work already on areas that were not impacted by the environmental permit, work that was necessary to build our building on things like a slurry wall and other preparatory constructions -- aspects of the foundation. But hard construction begins on the tower itself Wednesday morning, and we don't anticipate any other interference with that process. I think that about covers it. Matt, Steve, Bob DeSalvio is on the call from Massachusetts and is happy to elaborate on any of the comments that I've made or any other questions you may have, which you can begin asking right now.

How should we also be thinking about the potential that you're actually peeling off more of Wynn Macau's tables and what it would do to your revenue of your existing Wynn Macau? Basically, I'm trying to understand this risk of self-cannibalization, which I think, Steve, you brought the point that maybe only 60 tables out of the 183 in VIP are contributing to the profits, so you have some slack to pick up there. But what about some of the mass market tables and premium mass market tables in the existing Wynn Macau today that you may have to shift to get Wynn Palace to the right size.

You may -- those of you who watch this industry so closely and our competitors as well may find this to be a fascinating observation, when we concentrate this business on the tables that we have predetermined to be the ones that are most profitable and increase their utilization. Some of this speculation has to remain a speculation. But I think you're going to see the results quick enough in August, the last week in August, and in September leading up to Golden Week. And I think that we might find this very instructive before it's over. And we don't do much spinning here. We let the numbers speak for themselves. But I want to point out that the trend in our industry has constantly been to less equipment and more efficient utilization of that equipment. I also want to remind everybody that you cannot get dynamic in a casino. You can only get dynamic in a noncasino area where you create attractions that produce people of a certain income level that make the place profitable. And it's -- I can't overstate that simple observation more strongly enough. In a hotel casino, in these integrated resorts, the hotel itself is the show. A lot of conversation has been promulgated about the diversification of gaming away from just gambling to non-gambling things, and that conversation has widely and largely been misunderstood. So let me make a point about that now. When you say diversify to noncasino things, you have to understand that isn't a simplistic thing, well, we'll have more restaurants, we'll have more shows, we'll have more this or that, other than a slot machine or a baccarat table. Diversification means how well do you make the entire place an attraction from a hospitality and touristic point of view, so that you don't just rely on a baccarat player or a slot machine player. Now that diversification involves the entire building. We spent, without exception and without any possibility of contradiction, more money on noncasino attractions in Wynn Palace than has ever been spent on any facility of that sort on the planet Earth. And it has been done in the things that really matter to people: the whip of the hallways; the height of the ceilings; the attractiveness; the decor; the size of the rooms; the elegance and luxury of the retail offerings; and most importantly, the entertainment quotient of each and every food and beverage outlet. The customers of Macau in the past, since '02 and even before with Stanley Ho's operation, the customers have a very distinctive personality. They shop, they eat and they gamble. Their attendance to traditional entertainment attractions has been unpredictable, and in most cases, unsatisfactory. We saw Cirque du Soleil show, remarkable company that we pioneered ourselves in the Las Vegas. We saw that show open and close at the Venetian. The entertainment attraction at the City of Dreams is primarily being supported by freebies when people that go in and are offered the experience complementarily. What we have seen at Wynn Macau and Wynn Las Vegas, the only 5-star facility in Macau and the most complete in terms of 5 stars in spa, 5 stars in food, 5 stars in rooms. That's very unique in the gaming industry. We're the only ones that have that kind of across-the-board 5-star rating. That is diversification. When Wynn Palace begins at 8:00 in the evening, on the night of August 22, everybody will experience visually for the first time, the press will see it the week before with me, the most diverse, the most elegant, the most completely diversified attraction in the hospitality industry that exists anywhere in the world. I say that, I say that unequivocally, because it took us 6 years to be able to make that statement. And all of you who have enough interest in the matter and the press will get to see it for themselves. You'll eat the food with the incredible array of chefs from pastry to -- we have Alain Ducasse, chef, in our coffee shop in this hotel. It's on the water, experiencing $70 or $80 million worth of entertainment on the fountains. That filters through to the entertainment quality in each of the restaurants, even in the gaming areas. So in the lobbies, tens of millions of dollars have been spent on floors that open. The theme of the hotel is flowers. We're talking about Ferris wheels, carousels, 25-foot tall Fabergé eggs that open, all made of flowers. Everywhere in the hotel, there is entertainment, public entertainment. And in every aspect of the hotel, the hospitality, diversification has been intensified and redoubled. And those are the things -- if you want to take a hotel to another level, not a casino, a hotel, then you have to revisit each and every component down to the most minute detail and revisit them, ask all of the questions, question your history, question fundamental assumptions, the ones that survive, have survived cross examination and recross. And new stuff emerges as you apply a great deal of self-critical judgment in the design development phase. All of this will be self-explanatory and self evident at 8:00 on 22nd of August to the rest of the world when this hotel takes its first breath publicly. The press will get to see it, and the financial community in the days preceding August 22. Incidentally, we adopted a technique. I was asked how do you want to handle the opening, Steve? I said, I'll tell you how I want to handle the opening? I want to show the world, I want to show the political leaders who don't attend these hotels, I want them to see the villas, the penthouses, the entertainment attractions, alone, in small groups of tourists in each of these remarkable moments in this building before it opens. And then during the month, that's what I'm going to do on the 22nd to our invited guests. But in the weeks preceding August 22, all 12,000 or 13,000 of our employees will be in small groups of 8 to 10 and experience the identical tour and visualization of this hotel in tours with music and with Full Tilt presentations, so that by the time we get to August 22, there will be an awareness in the community of what we have built. That is the policy we're following, and it begins in 2 days. And that is the indoctrination and the display. When you talk about the villas and the penthouses and the other attractions in this hotel, normal people will never get to see them. They'll be reserved for special guests that are being entertained, that are being fed in these restaurants: the politicians and political leaders, union leaders. Line employees will never see every part of this place, because they're specialized in certain parts of it. But our job from August 1 to August 22 will be to make sure that anybody who works for the Wynn Macau company in either the Peninsula operations or the one in Cotai are completely exposed to what we have built for them as a place to work. Because at the end of the day, this is all about our employees. Because if our employees have a sense of the place and its luxury and its special nature, then they'll pass that on to the public. Those are our strategies. Those are our philosophy. That's our thinking. And we're going to bring it all to bear, along with 40-odd years of experience to see if we can get this place off and running in a nice way. It was built -- it was built to take market share. No question about it. No need to pussyfoot about it. And we'll see if we can keep the promise. Personally, I saw it 3 weeks ago. I thought it was most joyful place we've ever built. My wife, Andrea, and I walked through the building and we were quite dazzled by it. I'm hoping that all of you [indiscernible]."

The things that are in the pipeline, the bridges as you know, it's, mightily being constructed, monorail with its growing pains, seems to be settling in and work is proceeding on that. Those things all add to the viability of all of the operators in the special administrative region. And they can do nothing but help as far as I understand them. All they can do is make it easier for more people to get to Macau. The penetration of Macau in terms of the general population is still small. The room for growth is astronomical when you consider coming to play and how many folks there are. The visitation of Macau is being augmented and enhanced not only by these infrastructure projects that are breathtaking, that bridge and the monorail, the light rail. But by the very facilities that the concessionaires have invested in and then have opened. I mean, Galaxy and Venetian and the City of Dreams and Studio City are very aggressive, massive projects.

It's almost impossible to predict exactly what effect that will have without getting into an economics discussion. I mean, we have, sooner or later, our political establishment is going to be forced, regardless of party affiliation, to deal with $19 trillion in debt that's climbing by around $1.6 billion a day. That means that in the treasury auction each month in downtown Washington, we're printing money at the rate of $40 billion or $50 billion a month, which is of course increasing the money supply and directly impacting the living standard or the buying power of the U.S. dollar for people who are being paid like everybody on this call today. Now part of the frustration in America and -- is the fact that the deficit is having an enormous impact on the living style and the living standard of Americans but not all of this is well understood by the folks, to use Bill O'Reilly's term. The folks are being -- their living standard being clipped by the deficit and by the printing of money and the increase of the money supply. How long can this go on? In the history of the Western world, inflating your way out of this kind of a problem, taken to its extreme, to use the Weimar Republic as an example, people went grocery shopping with wheelbarrows full of currency. Now when -- before the recession, the euro was $0.87 -- $0.85 on a dollar. During quantitative easing 1, 2 and 3, it went up to $1.48. That was a devaluation of American currency by 20%. Now it's above 10% and to use that as a benchmark for a moment, it isn't that the dollar got stronger. It's that the euro got weaker because they started quantitative easing and printing money in the euro community. So this deficit issue impacts the mental health, the frustration, the positive sense of tomorrow that working people feel in America. It hasn't got to do with rich folks. It's got to do with government, fiscal and monetary policy. We have $14 trillion in public debt and $5 trillion in intergovernmental debt. The coupon on that $19 trillion and climbing is around 2.3%. And that's with short-term interest rates at 0, virtually. Now the Fed -- the current Fed, the lady is going to keep interest rates where they are. That, of course, protects all of the credit card debt of $1 trillion that's out there and so we don't have mass panic on the credit card interest. But I know that the government is in a quandary as to what to do about this. Now the issue about what's going to happen with the election isn't so much an issue of Trump versus Clinton at the moment. It's a question of whether the House and the Senate and the Executive branch can get together and make Americans feel safer and have a fiscal or monetary policy that isn't self-destructive, which currently, it is. Now I know that in this time of year, everybody is making all kinds of promises and declarations that they can do things or they will do things but, of course, they cannot without exacerbating the problems that are currently plaguing the country. What is lamentable is that the public discourse today on both sides misses the point entirely. We're in the chicken for every pot season where everybody is promising the moon. I recall that one of the most popular themes this year is that we've got to get student loans and the burden of student loans off the back of the kids. When the Affordable Care Act was passed, and it was going to have a negative impact on the deficit, which its sponsors have promised it wouldn't, the sponsors went looking for a way to offset $8 billion or so in additional deficit, and they came up with the kind of a stunt that we did with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when we eliminated mortgage brokers and we just took the loans directly into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and that led to the collapse of $5 trillion of the system. Well, they did the same thing with the Department of Education. They gave the student loans directly from the Department of Education and eliminate any middle people. And then they charged 6.5 points or 650 basis points for student loans instead of passing these savings because the Department of Education doesn't really have a cost of the money. But they're making the student loans direct since the Affordable Care Act. Bernie Sanders didn't talk about that. But that 650 basis points, that carry is being made by the government to offset what would have been even greater impact on the deficit by the Affordable Care Act. Well, if you really were sincere about making a better life for the kids, you would have passed the loans from the Department of Education to the kids at cost, which would have been interest-free. But this kind of hypocrisy, which sort of is endemic to the whole system, regardless of party, has got to come to a halt. Because if it doesn't, then it insinuates itself into economic demand for services and products. It certainly insinuates itself into the price of everything, from Walmart to shoes and sneakers. Those things haven't been, by themselves, become more precious. The value of the dollar has declined. I know that we talk about China fooling with their currency. The United States has fooled with its currency even more aggressively than the People's Republic of China. I'm not an apologist for China or anybody. I'm simply stating a fact. But you won't see this in the conventions of either party. You won't hear this sort of thing because it's so uncomfortable to talk about it. But the election could put America on a better track if all the Senators and Congressmen and the Presidents and the cabinet members decide that they should or it won't. I don't know about anybody on this call but I'm not in a position to make that prediction. But it surely, surely impacts the life of every American. Tax policy and all the rest all roll into this. And businessmen across the country and people at work in businesses will be affected by this as sure as sunrise tomorrow. And there seems to be a fear to deal with it directly. So count me as one of those old white guys that's frustrated.
Robin, if I can, I'm going to say something to Robin. Robin, there's 465 agencies in government, and there's 4,150,000 federal employees. 1.5 million are in uniform. 2,650,000 of them are civilians covered by the SEIU Union and the Civil Service Act. If you want to make government more efficient, you've got to have a big idea that resonates with all of the government employees, all 2,650,000 of them in 460 agencies. And it's going to have to be the kind of big idea that we use to run businesses, which is namely to reinforce positively the behavior that you wish to encourage. And that can be done with tax policy and with employment techniques in the federal government that works so well in the private sector. If we told everybody in those 465 agencies, you ran the business for x amount of dollars last year, if you maintained service levels and you can save $1, we'll distribute $0.20 on every dollar you save to those of you in those departments, you'd see the government contract in terms of its cost of operation overnight. We should have to incentivize the people in those 2,650,000  employees the way we incentivize people in the private sector and gain efficiency and better functionality. But those big ideas don't seem to apply in Washington. Enough of the speech. Go ahead with the questions."

And yet, our cost of operating these places has climbed steadily over that period. And the mentality of the marketing people and the gaming people that deal directly with that sector of the business has been trained, has been grown and matured with a focus on the top line. The average bet, the length of play, how often does the customer come? What is our chance of winning x dollars? And then, let's get that customer, give him a room, pay for his airfare, send a limousine, give him a bottle of Lafite Rothschild, do anything, give him a shopping spree. These are the earmarks of the superficial thought that has guided casino management for decades when it should have been focused on what is the profitability of every table and every customer. Now I'm not suggesting that they don't have profitability meetings and reviews at these various enterprises, but I am in a position to say that any examination by any financial person, in or out of the industry, will reveal that the profit margins of table games in the gaming -- in the United States of America stinks, lousy, less than 20%. Now these businesses end up with margins close to 30 because they have slot machines and rooms and bars and nightclubs. But the forgotten sector has been profitability of table games. We decided to take another look at that a year ago. I remember exactly. It was at the end of the second quarter and I went after it the 1st week of July. We started moving furniture and changing rules in collaboration with my colleagues like Maurice Wooden, who happens to be on vacation in Hawaii this week, Matt Maddox, Linda Chen, Ian Coughlan, Gamal Aziz (sic) [Abdelaziz], Steve Cootey, my Chief Financial Officer, and everybody in China. So -- and we decided that there had to be a better way to do this. You say it's tough to model table games. Dude, I don't know how you do your model. But if you do a deep dive in companies like the ones that lie on The Strip in Las Vegas or regional casinos and take a look at the profitability of table games, that model is shaky. We changed that here. We don't care about the drop. We don't care about that. We care about the profitability of every foot in the casino. We take a very merchandising retail approach to the floor. Incidentally, I think Sheldon has done that in China when he opened up years ago. It's harder to do it when you're not living in an avalanche of revenue the way we did when casinos first started in Macau. In the day-to-day disciplined grind of normal operation, it requires reeducating all of the marketing and casino personnel to look at the customers differently. We don't even issue promotional allowances or comps based upon past performance. We do it on current business activity. That is to say, if you play at The Strip at a certain level, we'll give you free meals or free rooms. But if you played that way last year and you show up this week, we're waiting to see what happens this week. That's a big change in the way they thought in this business. And it requires a lot of discipline and, frankly, reeducation of the people that work in the casinos. It took us months to get to where we wanted to be in Las Vegas. But imagine, we were able to overcome a loss of $50 million or $80 million of baccarat [indiscernible] make the same money [indiscernible]. That's hard to do. But now when someone plays, it's a business, it's a business. Otherwise, we sell the rooms to cash customers and we reallocate the space in our building. The business model is constantly morphing and changing and is it not doing so in every business in the world? And the price goes to who's agile. We're trying. We are, so to speak, in a commercial sense, constantly in a yoga class. So factor that into your modeling. Maybe you'd be able to follow us."

We held high, but we made $20 million more than we did last year, and it's another increase in our quarter. And even though we held high, we were also carrying an equal amount of extra payroll for the Palace, which opens next month. So the increase is real. We'll be transferring all those employees in the next few weeks -- in the next few days, actually. And so we'll have a different expense pattern for the Peninsula operation of Wynn and Encore in the months ahead as we equalize the payroll. 
I think we mentioned table allocations in our press release, and I'd like to take a moment or 2 to comment upon those and give some insight to those 160-odd people that are on this call, according to the operator. 
We haven't analyzed in the past as we headed towards the opening. We were unable because of the table gap to predict how many tables we would get. So we established long time ago various scenarios where we could operate from 100 tables to 280 tables, with new tables, on how to operate both hotels, all 3 of them actually, efficiently and profitably. Some of the things that you may find interesting, for example, in a recent month, and this is pretty typical. We had 180 tables allocated at Wynn and Encore to VIP -- to junkets. And then we analyzed, as we do now, for the past year, we've had a completely different focus in this company about the gambling activity of our clientele. And instead of analyzing the casino on win or turnover, we've analyzed both in the United States and in the People's Republic of China in Macau. We've analyzed and we run our business on a completely different model. And that model is contribution to EBITDA, to profitability of each unit in the casino, regardless of win or turnover or activity of a gambling customer. 
What instead we look at is how much money do we make with such pieces of equipment, whether it be a table, a baccarat table or a slot machine. And the results of our inquiry both in the United States and China have been very, very enlightening, and I'll share them with you. As an example, of 180 junket tables in a month, 60 of them were responsible for all of the EBITDA. The other 120 were either breaking even or, in some cases, losses, taking all costs into account. That is to say that our profitability was limited to a much smaller group than one would at first imagine. Now with -- and we made a number of very startling changes in the way we laid out our casino, the policies that we employed with regard to the rules of the game, craps, blackjack and baccarat, roulette included, that embraced limits, the moments with the client when we would give free promotional allowance, allocations of rooms, food, beverage or airfare. We took a different look at all of that. And since last July 10, year ago, a little over a year ago, we changed Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, because we were the largest recipient of Asian business in our hotel in Las Vegas. And when that business tailed off, as it has in the industry, we decided that -- and we lost $150 million in win at one point. That's how big our baccarat business was, if we could lose $150 million, and we were left with a smaller number. We used to give discounts to blackjack players and crap shooters. We dealt blackjack at 3:2 if you've got 21. We started  putting in tables where we paid 6:5 and dealt single decks or double decks. We changed the layout of the floor. We put our higher yielding games in more prominent locations. We put destination-type games like craps in secondary locations. We changed the amount of odd -- free odds that we gave in dice games from what was commonly referred to as the 3, 4, 5 game. And that had to do with the amount of free odds you get if you made line bet to double odds. 
To give you an example, when someone has a 3, 4, 5 crap game, the house advantage is 37 basis points -- 38 basis points. When you go to double odds, the house advantage is 58 or 57 basis points. Now that doesn't sound like a lot. That's a very narrow margin of a house advantage mathematically. However, 20 basis points is a 60% or 70% increase in the margin of a dice game. So that the outcome in terms of profitability was based upon a rather granular analysis of each game. 
We made a bunch of changes. And in so doing, we were able to overcome in terms of profitability what would ordinarily have been a massive loss of top line revenue. So the gaming industry is a little deceptive in many respects. It takes a very sharp analysis and very, very high degree of self-awareness because when you take rooms away from the casino block and you can sell them for cash, our margins in the hotel rooms are very high, as they are slot machines. 
Casino table games in Las Vegas, if you were to do an analysis, would have a profit margin in the teens. At best, we were able to take our profit margins in table games up into the 40s, which I think is unique in our industry. With this kind of analysis applied to China is also very enlightening and instructive.
Having allocations, having table caps, as we are experiencing in places like Pennsylvania, I was -- this week, I stopped at Bethlehem at the Sands facility, and I was watching what an alert management team did to offset limitations imposed politically on the amount of tables. And they used a concept known as stadium games, where you use 3 or 4 dealers for roulette and blackjack and have 150 automated digital stations for players that allowed people -- it is a much more efficient use of an allocation of tables because you get 150 players with 4 dealers. And in the case of Bethlehem, when I watched the other day, on Tuesday, and they were able to take advantage of that and introduce people at lower minimum table limits to roulette and baccarat, who might not have played those games were it not for the low entry level afforded by the stadium concept. 
Now we use those at the Wynn Macau, and they're being used in Singapore and around the country. And I suspect that because of the payroll efficiency inherent in such concepts that we're going to see more of it. And it allows us to make better use of our staffing levels and offer the opportunity for excitement on a playing level to customers in a manner that's very efficient. 
Having said all that, we anticipate the following aspects of our business, which will not impact our profitability. That by having fewer games, you get to have higher utilization. Remember, in most casinos around the world, utilization is less than 50%. You're sort of keeping the payroll in the games for peak periods, weekends, a few shifts a week. By having fewer tables, you increase utilization dramatically, and you're able to control limits. So let's get to the second part of my presentation, which is this: a close analysis of the market in Macao will demonstrate that the bulk of the profitability in business is in what is now referred to as premium mass business. We distinguish between mass and VIP, because in the mass, very much like America, people buy in for cash. They play with regular chips that are negotiable as opposed to the VIP or junket end, where we use nonredeemable chips that are purchased by junket operators who supplied to us and then the customer is forced to bet that nonredeemable chip, and they keep betting the nonredeemable chips and they save the redeemable ones and then either cash out or buy more nonredeemable chips, in which case they get a discount. My point is this: the money we make and the margin that we enjoy is based upon the mass premium end. And that premium mass end is not a hard line of division. It isn't a question of while one guy bets $25 -- using U.S. currency for a moment -- bets $25 and a premium guy bets $500. No, there's a whole range in between where people bet $2,000, $3,000 of decision, but they're playing in the mass area of the casino. We refer to those as a more premium customer. Now the Wynn Palace in Cotai was designed from day 1, 6 years ago, specifically for premium mass business. Some of our competitors, who are very intelligent operators, they've designed buildings that are specifically designed for the lower end of the mass market. The Wynn Palace is not such a structure. The rooms, the restaurants, the retail, all of the amenities, the layout of the place, its entire conceptual framework was based upon getting the higher type of mass player. So we were always in a position to operate our casino with less equipment than our competitors. Incidentally to give you an example of that, when we opened Wynn Las Vegas, we had close to 2,900 slot machines and we won $180 million a year. Today, even with Encore, we win well over $200 million with less than 1,800 machines. Technology has played a role in this, and it is playing a role in table games as well. 
So to close this little presentation of mine, we feel positive and comfortable about the hotel, and we're looking forward to the opening on the 22nd of August. And I'm hoping that some of the things that I've just highlighted in my comments are instructive to all of you. 
One other note away from China and the United States, and Las Vegas for a moment, is on Tuesday at 5:00, we expect to get our final environmental permit in Boston and begin full-scale construction on Wednesday, although we've had hundreds of people at work already on areas that were not impacted by the environmental permit, work that was necessary to build our building on things like a slurry wall and other preparatory constructions -- aspects of the foundation. But hard construction begins on the tower itself Wednesday morning, and we don't anticipate any other interference with that process. I think that about covers it. Matt, Steve, Bob DeSalvio is on the call from Massachusetts and is happy to elaborate on any of the comments that I've made or any other questions you may have, which you can begin asking right now.

So we get this -- we benefit from having an extremely loyal high-end group of customers that come to us in a number of ways, some through junkets in China and some in our own programs here. And they vary -- the volatility or the attendance of such clientele varies, unpredictably from month-to-month and week-to-week. So the reason we don't discuss it is because it would be irrelevant.

And it's -- I can't overstate that simple observation more strongly enough. In a hotel casino, in these integrated resorts, the hotel itself is the show. A lot of conversation has been promulgated about the diversification of gaming away from just gambling to non-gambling things, and that conversation has widely and largely been misunderstood. So let me make a point about that now. When you say diversify to noncasino things, you have to understand that isn't a simplistic thing, well, we'll have more restaurants, we'll have more shows, we'll have more this or that, other than a slot machine or a baccarat table. Diversification means how well do you make the entire place an attraction from a hospitality and touristic point of view, so that you don't just rely on a baccarat player or a slot machine player. Now that diversification involves the entire building. We spent, without exception and without any possibility of contradiction, more money on noncasino attractions in Wynn Palace than has ever been spent on any facility of that sort on the planet Earth. And it has been done in the things that really matter to people: the whip of the hallways; the height of the ceilings; the attractiveness; the decor; the size of the rooms; the elegance and luxury of the retail offerings; and most importantly, the entertainment quotient of each and every food and beverage outlet. The customers of Macau in the past, since '02 and even before with Stanley Ho's operation, the customers have a very distinctive personality. They shop, they eat and they gamble. Their attendance to traditional entertainment attractions has been unpredictable, and in most cases, unsatisfactory. We saw Cirque du Soleil show, remarkable company that we pioneered ourselves in the Las Vegas. We saw that show open and close at the Venetian. The entertainment attraction at the City of Dreams is primarily being supported by freebies when people that go in and are offered the experience complementarily. What we have seen at Wynn Macau and Wynn Las Vegas, the only 5-star facility in Macau and the most complete in terms of 5 stars in spa, 5 stars in food, 5 stars in rooms. That's very unique in the gaming industry. We're the only ones that have that kind of across-the-board 5-star rating. That is diversification. When Wynn Palace begins at 8:00 in the evening, on the night of August 22, everybody will experience visually for the first time, the press will see it the week before with me, the most diverse, the most elegant, the most completely diversified attraction in the hospitality industry that exists anywhere in the world. I say that, I say that unequivocally, because it took us 6 years to be able to make that statement. And all of you who have enough interest in the matter and the press will get to see it for themselves. You'll eat the food with the incredible array of chefs from pastry to -- we have Alain Ducasse, chef, in our coffee shop in this hotel. It's on the water, experiencing $70 or $80 million worth of entertainment on the fountains. That filters through to the entertainment quality in each of the restaurants, even in the gaming areas. So in the lobbies, tens of millions of dollars have been spent on floors that open. The theme of the hotel is flowers. We're talking about Ferris wheels, carousels, 25-foot tall Fabergé eggs that open, all made of flowers. Everywhere in the hotel, there is entertainment, public entertainment. And in every aspect of the hotel, the hospitality, diversification has been intensified and redoubled. And those are the things -- if you want to take a hotel to another level, not a casino, a hotel, then you have to revisit each and every component down to the most minute detail and revisit them, ask all of the questions, question your history, question fundamental assumptions, the ones that survive, have survived cross examination and recross. And new stuff emerges as you apply a great deal of self-critical judgment in the design development phase. All of this will be self-explanatory and self evident at 8:00 on 22nd of August to the rest of the world when this hotel takes its first breath publicly. The press will get to see it, and the financial community in the days preceding August 22. Incidentally, we adopted a technique. I was asked how do you want to handle the opening, Steve? I said, I'll tell you how I want to handle the opening? I want to show the world, I want to show the political leaders who don't attend these hotels, I want them to see the villas, the penthouses, the entertainment attractions, alone, in small groups of tourists in each of these remarkable moments in this building before it opens. And then during the month, that's what I'm going to do on the 22nd to our invited guests. But in the weeks preceding August 22, all 12,000 or 13,000 of our employees will be in small groups of 8 to 10 and experience the identical tour and visualization of this hotel in tours with music and with Full Tilt presentations, so that by the time we get to August 22, there will be an awareness in the community of what we have built. That is the policy we're following, and it begins in 2 days. And that is the indoctrination and the display. When you talk about the villas and the penthouses and the other attractions in this hotel, normal people will never get to see them. They'll be reserved for special guests that are being entertained, that are being fed in these restaurants: the politicians and political leaders, union leaders. Line employees will never see every part of this place, because they're specialized in certain parts of it. But our job from August 1 to August 22 will be to make sure that anybody who works for the Wynn Macau company in either the Peninsula operations or the one in Cotai are completely exposed to what we have built for them as a place to work. Because at the end of the day, this is all about our employees. Because if our employees have a sense of the place and its luxury and its special nature, then they'll pass that on to the public. Those are our strategies. Those are our philosophy. That's our thinking. And we're going to bring it all to bear, along with 40-odd years of experience to see if we can get this place off and running in a nice way. It was built -- it was built to take market share. No question about it. No need to pussyfoot about it. And we'll see if we can keep the promise. Personally, I saw it 3 weeks ago. I thought it was most joyful place we've ever built. My wife, Andrea, and I walked through the building and we were quite dazzled by it. I'm hoping that all of you [indiscernible]."

So what we're seeing is the picture that you're sharing with us at the moment, based upon the numbers from ourselves and the other gents and the other companies in Macau. The things that are in the pipeline, the bridges as you know, it's, mightily being constructed, monorail with its growing pains, seems to be settling in and work is proceeding on that. Those things all add to the viability of all of the operators in the special administrative region. And they can do nothing but help as far as I understand them. All they can do is make it easier for more people to get to Macau. The penetration of Macau in terms of the general population is still small. The room for growth is astronomical when you consider coming to play and how many folks there are. The visitation of Macau is being augmented and enhanced not only by these infrastructure projects that are breathtaking, that bridge and the monorail, the light rail. But by the very facilities that the concessionaires have invested in and then have opened. I mean, Galaxy and Venetian and the City of Dreams and Studio City are very aggressive, massive projects. And then Parisian comes on shortly. And then eventually, we'll have the SJM property, which I think in a stroke of real originality called the Palace, that comes on at some time next year, I guess.

It's almost impossible to predict exactly what effect that will have without getting into an economics discussion. I mean, we have, sooner or later, our political establishment is going to be forced, regardless of party affiliation, to deal with $19 trillion in debt that's climbing by around $1.6 billion a day. That means that in the treasury auction each month in downtown Washington, we're printing money at the rate of $40 billion or $50 billion a month, which is of course increasing the money supply and directly impacting the living standard or the buying power of the U.S. dollar for people who are being paid like everybody on this call today. Now part of the frustration in America and -- is the fact that the deficit is having an enormous impact on the living style and the living standard of Americans but not all of this is well understood by the folks, to use Bill O'Reilly's term. The folks are being -- their living standard being clipped by the deficit and by the printing of money and the increase of the money supply. How long can this go on? In the history of the Western world, inflating your way out of this kind of a problem, taken to its extreme, to use the Weimar Republic as an example, people went grocery shopping with wheelbarrows full of currency. Now when -- before the recession, the euro was $0.87 -- $0.85 on a dollar. During quantitative easing 1, 2 and 3, it went up to $1.48. That was a devaluation of American currency by 20%. Now it's above 10% and to use that as a benchmark for a moment, it isn't that the dollar got stronger. It's that the euro got weaker because they started quantitative easing and printing money in the euro community. So this deficit issue impacts the mental health, the frustration, the positive sense of tomorrow that working people feel in America. It hasn't got to do with rich folks. It's got to do with government, fiscal and monetary policy. We have $14 trillion in public debt and $5 trillion in intergovernmental debt. The coupon on that $19 trillion and climbing is around 2.3%. And that's with short-term interest rates at 0, virtually. Now the Fed -- the current Fed, the lady is going to keep interest rates where they are. That, of course, protects all of the credit card debt of $1 trillion that's out there and so we don't have mass panic on the credit card interest. But I know that the government is in a quandary as to what to do about this. Now the issue about what's going to happen with the election isn't so much an issue of Trump versus Clinton at the moment. It's a question of whether the House and the Senate and the Executive branch can get together and make Americans feel safer and have a fiscal or monetary policy that isn't self-destructive, which currently, it is. Now I know that in this time of year, everybody is making all kinds of promises and declarations that they can do things or they will do things but, of course, they cannot without exacerbating the problems that are currently plaguing the country. What is lamentable is that the public discourse today on both sides misses the point entirely. We're in the chicken for every pot season where everybody is promising the moon. I recall that one of the most popular themes this year is that we've got to get student loans and the burden of student loans off the back of the kids. When the Affordable Care Act was passed, and it was going to have a negative impact on the deficit, which its sponsors have promised it wouldn't, the sponsors went looking for a way to offset $8 billion or so in additional deficit, and they came up with the kind of a stunt that we did with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when we eliminated mortgage brokers and we just took the loans directly into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and that led to the collapse of $5 trillion of the system. Well, they did the same thing with the Department of Education. They gave the student loans directly from the Department of Education and eliminate any middle people. And then they charged 6.5 points or 650 basis points for student loans instead of passing these savings because the Department of Education doesn't really have a cost of the money. But they're making the student loans direct since the Affordable Care Act. Bernie Sanders didn't talk about that. But that 650 basis points, that carry is being made by the government to offset what would have been even greater impact on the deficit by the Affordable Care Act. Well, if you really were sincere about making a better life for the kids, you would have passed the loans from the Department of Education to the kids at cost, which would have been interest-free. But this kind of hypocrisy, which sort of is endemic to the whole system, regardless of party, has got to come to a halt. Because if it doesn't, then it insinuates itself into economic demand for services and products. It certainly insinuates itself into the price of everything, from Walmart to shoes and sneakers. Those things haven't been, by themselves, become more precious. The value of the dollar has declined. I know that we talk about China fooling with their currency. The United States has fooled with its currency even more aggressively than the People's Republic of China. I'm not an apologist for China or anybody. I'm simply stating a fact. But you won't see this in the conventions of either party. You won't hear this sort of thing because it's so uncomfortable to talk about it. But the election could put America on a better track if all the Senators and Congressmen and the Presidents and the cabinet members decide that they should or it won't. I don't know about anybody on this call but I'm not in a position to make that prediction. But it surely, surely impacts the life of every American. Tax policy and all the rest all roll into this. And businessmen across the country and people at work in businesses will be affected by this as sure as sunrise tomorrow. And there seems to be a fear to deal with it directly. So count me as one of those old white guys that's frustrated.
Robin, if I can, I'm going to say something to Robin. Robin, there's 465 agencies in government, and there's 4,150,000 federal employees. 1.5 million are in uniform. 2,650,000 of them are civilians covered by the SEIU Union and the Civil Service Act. If you want to make government more efficient, you've got to have a big idea that resonates with all of the government employees, all 2,650,000 of them in 460 agencies. And it's going to have to be the kind of big idea that we use to run businesses, which is namely to reinforce positively the behavior that you wish to encourage. And that can be done with tax policy and with employment techniques in the federal government that works so well in the private sector. If we told everybody in those 465 agencies, you ran the business for x amount of dollars last year, if you maintained service levels and you can save $1, we'll distribute $0.20 on every dollar you save to those of you in those departments, you'd see the government contract in terms of its cost of operation overnight. We should have to incentivize the people in those 2,650,000  employees the way we incentivize people in the private sector and gain efficiency and better functionality. But those big ideas don't seem to apply in Washington. Enough of the speech. Go ahead with the questions."

And yet, our cost of operating these places has climbed steadily over that period. And the mentality of the marketing people and the gaming people that deal directly with that sector of the business has been trained, has been grown and matured with a focus on the top line. The average bet, the length of play, how often does the customer come? What is our chance of winning x dollars? And then, let's get that customer, give him a room, pay for his airfare, send a limousine, give him a bottle of Lafite Rothschild, do anything, give him a shopping spree. These are the earmarks of the superficial thought that has guided casino management for decades when it should have been focused on what is the profitability of every table and every customer. Now I'm not suggesting that they don't have profitability meetings and reviews at these various enterprises, but I am in a position to say that any examination by any financial person, in or out of the industry, will reveal that the profit margins of table games in the gaming -- in the United States of America stinks, lousy, less than 20%. Now these businesses end up with margins close to 30 because they have slot machines and rooms and bars and nightclubs. But the forgotten sector has been profitability of table games. We decided to take another look at that a year ago. I remember exactly. It was at the end of the second quarter and I went after it the 1st week of July. We started moving furniture and changing rules in collaboration with my colleagues like Maurice Wooden, who happens to be on vacation in Hawaii this week, Matt Maddox, Linda Chen, Ian Coughlan, Gamal Aziz (sic) [Abdelaziz], Steve Cootey, my Chief Financial Officer, and everybody in China. So -- and we decided that there had to be a better way to do this. You say it's tough to model table games. Dude, I don't know how you do your model. But if you do a deep dive in companies like the ones that lie on The Strip in Las Vegas or regional casinos and take a look at the profitability of table games, that model is shaky. We changed that here. We don't care about the drop. We don't care about that. We care about the profitability of every foot in the casino. We take a very merchandising retail approach to the floor. Incidentally, I think Sheldon has done that in China when he opened up years ago. It's harder to do it when you're not living in an avalanche of revenue the way we did when casinos first started in Macau. In the day-to-day disciplined grind of normal operation, it requires reeducating all of the marketing and casino personnel to look at the customers differently. We don't even issue promotional allowances or comps based upon past performance. We do it on current business activity. That is to say, if you play at The Strip at a certain level, we'll give you free meals or free rooms. But if you played that way last year and you show up this week, we're waiting to see what happens this week. That's a big change in the way they thought in this business. And it requires a lot of discipline and, frankly, reeducation of the people that work in the casinos. It took us months to get to where we wanted to be in Las Vegas. But imagine, we were able to overcome a loss of $50 million or $80 million of baccarat [indiscernible] make the same money [indiscernible]. That's hard to do. But now when someone plays, it's a business, it's a business. Otherwise, we sell the rooms to cash customers and we reallocate the space in our building. The business model is constantly morphing and changing and is it not doing so in every business in the world? And the price goes to who's agile. We're trying. We are, so to speak, in a commercial sense, constantly in a yoga class. So factor that into your modeling. Maybe you'd be able to follow us."

I personally have been focused very heavily on the finishing touches of all of our construction and fit outs that are associated with the Massachusetts property and the stuff that we're doing here in Las Vegas. But I think, we should start off today by talking about Macau, and Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau because the palace is now several weeks old and underway.
The first thing I would mention is that first of all, we are very happy with the way the property turned out. We finished and completely closed the cost of the place with our contractor Layton [ph] at $4.4 billion, and that is now behind us.
There is something about our property in Cotai that I want to frame this conversation today. We -- our 52 or so acres there is surrounded on all 4 sides by streets. On the east is the staging yard where the light rail system that sort of resembles a monorail that seeks to bring people from the airport and then the Cotai Ferry Terminal to the various hotels in Cotai. That project has been underway for several years, experienced some developmental complexities and problems and delays and is now scheduled for completion in a few years.
The staging area and the construction area for the light rail system covers our entire East side, and is across the street from our property in the entire parcel on the east side. Next to it is the airport. The light rail system, it goes from the ferry terminal and the airport along the entire north side of our property and then makes a 90-degree left-hand turn and goes down the west side of our property. Across the street, the West side of our property is the City of Dreams, the Melco development on the right, and then as the light rail proceeds, it passes at the midpoint of our front of our Property, street going perpendicularly west to Venetia.
On the other side, representing the other half of our Western front is the construction job of MGM. And then on our South side, we have the construction job of SJM's hotel that's scheduled to open in the future. MGM is scheduled to open this spring at the end of May or the mid of [ph] June at last check.
So what we have is an anomalous situation, where all 4 sides of our property are currently are being enclosed by either barricades or construction blockage of one kind or another. It has tended to isolate our property on all 4 sides, and it's made access to the Palace temporarily highly encumbered, crossing the street or getting through this barricades that have been erected by MGM and by the folks who are building the light rail system. 
And it comes to a -- its first stop with escalators and bridges right in the midpoint of our front yard, where our gondola station is. And of course, and the short term, it's turn to about to be a disadvantage having all the barricades and the construction on all 4 sides, but in the long term, of course, it's very advantageous to us. 
But in that context, it's represented a handicap in our -- in the access that the public has, both in buses, in cars or taxicabs. And we have worked in the last month or so in conjunction with the government on trying to mitigate these substantial barricades that enclose our property.
And the government has been understanding and sympathetic to our situation and has promised to ameliorate the situation in the next several months. But it is at the moment, a handicap for us and one we are forced to deal with. 
Scheduling for all of this was supposed to be done when we opened at the time that we broke ground on the hotel, but as I mentioned a moment ago, there had been delays in all of these, both in the construction of our 2 neighboring hotels and of the light rail itself.
With that in mind, I still think it would be constructive for us to review the performances of these properties and address issues of cannibalization, start ups and ramp ups and that sort of thing.
I would add to that conversation, one other element from my perspective, for the past 40-odd years that we've been building these hotels and the Cotai hotel was number 12 for us. 
We have followed a philosophy of how to open major destination hotels. And I'll describe it as follows. 
We open a hotel without any real marketing support or pressure because we are very curious to see when it's naked, unstimulated kind of revenues are. And then, in the months following the opening, we do sort of a low key opening. In the months following the opening, we constructively, and with a very targeted approach, ramp-up and institute marketing programs, both in hotel occupancy and casino revenue and that sort of thing in a very layered fashion that allows us to protect our price.
By not throwing the kitchen sink in a place when we open, we risk less than dramatic instant results, but we also protect our price. And instead, resort to a more progressive and orderly filled up of our promotional and marketing approaches, based upon what we see when we first open. 
With those -- with that general philosophical framework in mind, I'll let Mr. Maddox, Mr. Cootey and Ian Coughlan talk about what's happened since August 22nd. Matt, you want to go first?"

So I think, as Steve said, the ramp-up at Wynn Palace is clearly taking a little longer than we expected and likely will, due to the circumstances surrounding the property. 
But when we look at what's going on in at Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau, comparing September, at Wynn Palace, which is our full month to October, which we just completed, we've seen in our volume metrics that turn over, mask off [ph] and slot handle, those increased sequentially from September to October by about 20%, which was in line with the market that also increased from September to October by around 19%. 
So Wynn Palace, each day, is continuing to gain traction in the Cotai market.
Wynn Macau has also experienced the same increase from September to October in its volume metrics of about 20%. So while the process is taking longer, we are maintaining our share in these markets and in September combined, we were at on a normalized basis, roughly 13.5% market share. In October, we didn't hold this wealth in the VIP segment but from a volume standpoint, we've maintained that share. 
So we are happy with the progress but believe it is going to take longer than we anticipated due to the challenges in our locations. Ian?"

We have a very well-executed opening of all facilities, customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, rooms and food and beverage particularly are a new standard for the market. Despite all of the challenges that Steve referred to, with the light rail and resort building around the property, visitation has been good, particularly on the weekends. We are very focused on ramping up premium mass, which we believe is a real edge giver, given our service in our facility.
When we look at the VIP turn for the 2 properties over at Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace, we've actually doubled our VIP turn versus the previous 60 days since we opened. So the junkets have managed to backfill downtown very effectively.
We have a new junket opening at Wynn Palace on the 5th of November. We are also introducing some casual junkets over building that side of the business. We are actively bringing back customers that are already in [indiscernible] previously Wynn customers. 
And we're just learning and adapting to a very competitive market, seeing is believing and people experiencing the property is really going to help us. We've made a number of significant casino floor changes with game mixes. 
We are watching how people are reacting to the property, what they enjoy. We've got a lot of new promotions to animate the casino that we've been introducing. We're driving occupancy post the holidays, occupancy has grown 10 points in October. We finished that 81% when we continue to bring the occupancy up. 
Our food and beverage offer and the variety of offer we're altering and changing, again to meet the customer need. 
We've been tackling the bus program. We've effectively double our buses around the road, picking up people from different entry points into the Macao within the city itself. 
We've introduced a taxi incentive program, which has proved to be effective. And we are going to becoming part of the Cotai connection, which can ask all of the properties in Cotai from a bus travel perspective. 
At the same time, we're looking at post opening cost-based management. When you open, there's always areas that needs to be tweaked and come back on. And looking back town -- back downtown at the cannibalization aspect, pretty much what we perceive was going to happen has happened. There's been a fairly significant impact on our direct VIP downtown, because we have a lot of Wynn players that wanted to come and experience the new property. The junkets very well as I discussed already. On the mass were less affected, our customers downtown seem to be very Peninsula downtown centric, while some of them have experienced a new property, they are being very sticky downtown.
And overall, downtown was pretty settled, and we're just growing business uptown and our competitors are smart people. A lot of the ways that we bring business to the new property is personalized selling, seeing is believing, and we will take care of the comes to the property and bring new people in over the coming months."

Thanks, Steve. We've gotten off to a really good start on construction. As most everyone knows, we began on August 3, and at this point, the foundations are done in the areas of the central utility plant, the garage, the hotel, the casino, sections of the building. 
And we've now started the mass excavation of the dirt from the parking garage area that represents 3 floors below the main section of the building. And that's gone very well. 
We're starting to pour the slabs in the back of the house in central utility plant areas and we expect on-site steel deliveries in December. And by first quarter of next year, we'll be standing steel in those -- the back of the house and the central utility plan area. 
So far very good fall construction season, weather has been great, very -- actually a little bit of rain. And so that's helped us move things along. So about 325 workers now currently on-site, and we are running right on schedule. 
So all good news on the construction front, Steve."
3449701,408095332,1070799,"Wynn Resorts Ltd., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Wynn Resorts, Limited","Executives","We've been polishing our the people -- we've been polishing the invitations and the -- in the food and beverage promenade and all of those things, we've been able to interest some very substantial local personalities with various forms of food and beverag",666,"We've been polishing our the people -- we've been polishing the invitations and the -- in the food and beverage promenade and all of those things, we've been able to interest some very substantial local personalities with various forms of food and beverage and we're in the process of making room for them to join in, so that the facility is very locally-oriented at the top end, with the kinds of people that are very popular in Boston -- with the Boston public already. And we think that adds to our general appeal as we go forward in a couple of years with that project. 
So I think, generally, that's what's going on. I have spent my time in continuing the planning and the refining of the development of our real estate in Las Vegas. And that planning process discontinuing -- one of the most interesting things in the 49 years I've been doing this, is that the golf course and the available real estate in the company presents so many options that making these final decisions and choices has been extremely challenging and an awful lot of fun too. 
With our land, our water and our location we are seeking to come to a final layout to all of our facilities that put us in a much stronger position to be a very dominant force in all aspects of non-casino revenue.
I think that I want to share something with the people on the call. 
Ever since 1989, when we opened the Mirage, the facilities that we built have always broken the record for casino revenue in Las Vegas and in America. Our casinos have won more money than any other gambling floor in the United States. And in the world, with the exception of Asia, Hong Kong, Macau market and Singapore.
I have made this point in previous phone calls that in spite of the fact that we break the annual revenue for casino numbers in Nevada, we've always had more non-casino revenue, starting with the Mirage, when it went through $500 million, we had $600 million in our casino revenue. When we did $700 million at-- $600 million rather at Bellagio, we did $800 million in non-casino revenue. And at Wynn, when we went through $700 million, we had $800 million or $900 million in casino revenue and then finally, over $1 billion with the Encore Wynn facility, when the casino revenue went through $800 million.  So therefore, there's always been this pattern of 48%, 47% casino, 53%, 54% non-casino. 
In September, in this hotel in Las Vegas, I saw something that was even surprising for me, but very encouraging in the point that I'll make in a moment. 
In the month of September, our casino revenue was $1,870,000 a day, well over $50 million in that 30-day period. But that was probably the biggest number in the world, except for Singapore and Macau. $1,870,000 a day. But what was dazzling for me privately and personally was in our non-casino revenue was $3,340,000 a day. And if you normalize whole percentage, because we played a little lucky, the ratio of gaming to non-gaming in the #1 casino in Las Vegas was 2 to 1. 
I take that development as follows. It tells us that these 43 million a day a year that come to Las Vegas, 800,000-odd people a week are spending more money and have more disposable income for the non-casino aspects, which are really the drivers in our industry. And therefore, I am heartened by the fact that we have almost unlimited possibility expanding and convention and other related business on our property in Las Vegas, and that has made the design development process even more challenging and exciting as we exploit our undeveloped real estate in various parts of this assembly on the strip and Las Vegas. 
Having made that point and hopefully, share that insight would you, I'll turn the questioning over to the folks on the call."

I spent the month of August there and I've been back again since. And my take on this is that one of the facilities that we have downtown that is extremely well-received called Red 8 [ph], which is casual dining. We did, in Cotai, but we did it on a scale that based upon the customer reaction is not adequate. So what we're doing on one side of the mass gaming area is building a larger Red 8 to handle the demand that we've had, and that's going to take several months to install, but we had the room to do it, and we're going to increase that. So as far as the project goes, that restaurant modification represents, what I think, is an investment we're going to make several million dollars. It's not earthshaking, but it's very significant. We've also added -- we had a -- we had 2 spaces in our retail area that we held to ourselves so that we could do exactly what we're doing now. And it's a pattern that we follow. We always lead a number of spaces either unassigned or temporarily occupied so that we can react to the surprises are the things we learned after the place opens. And so we have some spaces, and we feel them with things that we could move easily that our own like a luggage store that we operate ourselves. We actually -- we actually left 15,000 square feet empty but shelled in, in a critical location and hit it with a [indiscernible] wall so that we'll have that capacity and that element to resort to, if we wanted to -- because each one of these hotels takes on a personality of its own, that is in many cases, surprising or unexpected after the public gets possession of it. So the casual dining additions that we're adding don't represent serious capital in the scheme of things, but their alterations going to make in terms of casual dining in the months ahead. Matt, do you have anything you want to add to that?"

The sequential delays that took place and the problems that government's have had in resolving their own problems with the light rail construction have been a moving thing, and so and we knew that -- you will certainly saw that everybody knew that SGM was in under construction on one side and MGM on the other. MGM thought they were going to be done earlier as of the last people in our neighborhood. I don't know that it's a bad thing that they're going to open when they open, instead of earlier. But we never had a terrific insight as to the status of our competitor's scheduling. We can read what they say on their quarterlies, but they are subject to the same kind of contingent events that we were, with regard to construction and completion dates in China. So to that extent, we look around us and everything that was happening was fairly obvious. There wasn't anything we could do about it. There was no dynamic actions that was available to us, and we were hoping that the situation would improve as we approach the summer months, when we are getting ready to open the property. I, myself, didn't realize how critical the blockade was until I went there in August. I was there in the month of August for 3 or 4 weeks before the place opened. And I didn't realize how critical it was until I try to go across the street to the City of Dreams. And you took your life in your hands, trying to get through the barricade and cross the street, because of the traffic. There's no crossing. All of that is tied up at the moment at the middle, where the construction is taking place for the escalators. See there's a big terminal for the -- a big stop right in front of our hotel on the light rail. As I mentioned, it's the first stop from the ferry terminal. And they built a bridge that goes from the West side of the street, which is MGM and City of Dreams, to the east side of the street, which is us and our gondola station.  I didn't realize how big the holes were and how primitive state of the construction with the walls they built. And I guess, accept it, it is what it is. We weren't in charge of that construction. We didn't have a dialogue going with the builder. This situation happened when we were opening the hotel on the Peninsula, on the east side of our hotel between us and StarWorld and Arc, there was the street that originally was a sewer canal. And they were going to make a street out of it and cover the sewer canal, and 5 months after our hotels opened, it was still a canal, an open trench. And then all of a sudden, in a space of 12 weeks, a street emerged. It was an amazing, rapid transformation, which proved that the Chinese people could do -- the Chinese government could do pretty much what it wanted at a speed that was quite remarkable under certain circumstances.
Apparently, with this light rail, they haven't been able to get some kind of acceleration, and I believe they are trying to get that fixed up. But I didn't really know what to expect as I looked at the construction during the -- of the surrounding properties and the light rail while we were building our place. We were sort of heavily-focused inside on our problems. I don't know if my answer is helpful do you, but does that deal with your question?"

And it's starting it a $500,000 a day, $600,000 a day in EBITDA. And it was slower getting to $1 million a day, but it was much quicker getting to $2 million a day, or a $3 million a day. And the  reason is, is that this -- in our kind of property, the acquisition of clientele of customers is done sort of one at a time. There's an old phrase, ""eagles don't flock, you got to catch them one at a time."" So laying the groundwork for building the clientele for a hotel and that is exemplary, that's unique and the Palace turned out to be the most beautiful job we've ever done by far. The rooms are exquisite. The place is absolutely magnificent, physically. Now you introduced such a property to people, and they elected or data aunt. You asked yourself would the customers, who do you build place for? And you do so with certain for conviction that when people see something wonderful and special, that they like it and they'll be loyal to it or they'll come back again and again. So the exposure of the building at first is aggregate, at sort of compounds on itself. And we've got to the first day we opened the place we made $1 million and we are operating at $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 level or something like that in October. And I expect that decline on a steady basis. Because I believe that the people will respond to our product as they have for the past 49 years in Atlantic City, Freemont [ph] Street, The Strip in Las Vegas, the Peninsula in Macau, every place else that we've ever been. This property is following the same pattern that I've observed in our developments over the years. I guess you have to use your own arithmetic and do these things I don't like -- I don't want to make a lot of promises about the statements. I make one statement, that it's the most magnificent hotel we've ever built. And clearly, clearly, the most dramatically elegant and beautiful hotel in China or maybe anywhere in the world for that matter. Now what public acceptance would be based upon an our experience so far pretty good, but in tackling the mass market and the premium mass market as mentioned before, this sort of the sequential pauses, you how to expose the place to people for them to find out what's in it, but in order to the, you they had to be able together. And right now that's a bit challenging and that's temporary, of course. It will go away. And these very things that are complicated are the very things that, that will underwrite its future. Having that light rail, that being the first stop is a cool thing. So I'm looking forward to it.

I think, if you ask me to be candid about any adjustment that I thought we needed that -- it was that I wanted to see more after the opening. As I looked at our neighbors and I look to more closely in our own trade and the response to various outlets in our hotel, I realized, because we were so overrun with the casual dining things that we offer, that we needed more of them. I think, if anything, I might have under underestimated what my colleagues, the amount of casual dining that we needed compared to the other folks. They have dozens and dozens of these casual dining restaurants throughout Cotai. We had [indiscernible] 2 or 3, but I've found out with the mass of people that it's not enough. So we've got to increase that. And we are doing that in 2 specific locations adjacent to the casino, straightaway. Now we've got to get through the approval of the government to do the work, and we're doing the drawings, lickety split as fast as we can to get that job done. As a matter of fact, we want to put up construction barricades to get on with, it immediately. But if that's -- I guess if you ask me, done that what surprise or what did I see after the place gave birth and the public came in? I was -- immediately and the rest of us, Ian, we all recognized we needed to up our casual dining capacities beyond what we originally thought. And it was pretty easy to do actually, because we had sort of anticipated that there would be something that we wanted to add or change after opening, which is why I left those spaces available for it.

In terms of the implications to local policy and to a certain extent, Visa policies, I think, that you have to look at the arc of all aspects of the central government behavior or actions and take that into account with the local governments reaction and their independent actions, because you know if you're in Beijing, they'll tell you that the SAR is autonomous, that it's self-governing. And that although they pay close attention and they want to support it, that they look to the government of Macau to run Macau. And we have this interaction with them on a regular basis. Usually, it's on detail stuff like trying to fix the roads and things like that. And so with different parts of the government. In my conversations with the top-level of the Macau government, they definitely want to protect the job security of the people that are engaged, the Macau citizens and everybody else, that are engaged in working at these places. There's a strong preference for protecting the employee base of the industry. When issues that affect them, meaning the employees and the local employees in particular, the government is particularly responsive and on point. When we get to more subtle things that had to do for example, with smoking, then the matter -- the speed of decision slows down. This conversation about smoking was secretary and even with the Chief Executive Officer and Secretary has been more protected. There's compete of interest here, the health and safety of the employees, the strong preference of the customers to have the freedom to smoke, it's a very popular in China, still. And then, there's this whole thing about trying to make people healthier even if it goes them to do so. So when you get to areas like this, that is certainly relevant to our -- right now the smoking -- I'm using this example, the smoking policy is mixed. Some places been grandfathered in, other places have tried to take advantage of the interim policy allowing smoking lounges, but yet the final approval of those smoking lounges has been delayed and nobody is sure whether there's going to be a complete ban on smoking, regardless of any condition within the buildings or whether they'll be unmitigated or ameliorated compromised position. So when you talk about the policies of the government since the premier's visit, you really have to separate the general support that mainland China and Beijing gives the SAR from the intricacies in the more granular aspects of the things that we are interested in, that may seem mundane in comparison, but are not. You get my drift on this? It's not a simple answer to your question. It got [indiscernible] details on this one. You want to have a follow-up on that? It's a tough question that you asked me."

I personally have been focused very heavily on the finishing touches of all of our construction and fit outs that are associated with the Massachusetts property and the stuff that we're doing here in Las Vegas. But I think we should start off today by talking about Macau, and Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau because the Palace is now several weeks old and underway.
The first thing I would mention is that first of all, we're very happy with the way the property turned out. We finished and completely closed the cost of the place with our contractor, Leighton, at USD 4.4 billion, and that is now behind us.
There is something about our property in Cotai that I want to frame this conversation today. We -- our 52 or so acres there is surrounded on all 4 sides by streets. On the east is the staging yard where the light rail system that sort of resembles a monorail that seeks to bring people from the airport and the Cotai ferry terminal to the various hotels in Cotai. That project has been underway for several years, experienced some developmental complexities and problems and delays and is now scheduled for completion in a few years.
The staging area and the construction area for the light rail system covers our entire east side, and is across the street from our property, the entire parcel on the east side. Next to it is the airport. The light rail system, it goes from the ferry terminal and the airport along the entire north side of our property and then makes a 90-degree left-hand turn and goes down the west side of our property. Across the street, the west side of our property is the City of Dreams, the Melco development on the right, and then as the light rail proceeds, it passes at the midpoint of our -- front of our property street going perpendicularly west to Venetia.
On the other side, representing the other half of our western front is the construction job of MGM. And then on our south side, we have the construction job of SJM's hotel that's scheduled to open in the future. MGM is scheduled to open this spring at the end of May or the beginning of June at last check.
So what we have is an anomalous situation, where all four sides of our property are currently -- are being enclosed by either barricades or construction blockage of one kind or another. It has tended to isolate our property on all four sides, and it's made access to the Palace temporarily highly encumbered, crossing the street or getting through these barricades that have been erected by MGM and by the folks who are building the light rail system.
And it comes to a -- its first stop with escalators and bridges right in the midpoint of our front yard where our gondola station is. And of course, in the short term, it's turned -- about to be a disadvantage having all the barricades and the construction on all four sides, but in the long term, of course, it's very advantageous to us.
But in that context, it's representing a handicap in our -- in the access that the public has, both in buses, in cars or taxicabs. And we have worked in the last month or so in conjunction with the government on trying to mitigate these substantial barricades that enclose our property. And the government has been understanding and sympathetic to our situation and has promised to ameliorate the situation in the next several months. But it is at the moment, a handicap for us and one we're forced to deal with. 
Scheduling for all of this was supposed to be done when we opened at the time that we broke ground on the hotel, but as I mentioned a moment ago, there had been delays in all of these, both in the construction of our 2 neighboring hotels and of the light rail itself.
With that in mind, I still think it would be constructive for us to review the performances of these properties and address issues of cannibalization, start ups and ramp ups and that sort of thing.
I would add to that conversation one other element from my perspective, for the past 40-odd years that we've been building these hotels and the Cotai hotel was number 12 for us.
We have followed a philosophy of how to open major destination hotels. And I'll describe it as follows.
We open a hotel without any real marketing support or pressure because we are very curious to see when it's naked, unstimulated kind of revenues are. And then in the months following the opening -- we do sort of a low key opening. In the months following the opening, we constructively, and with a very targeted approach, ramp-up and institute marketing programs, both in hotel occupancy and casino revenue and that sort of thing in a very layered fashion that allows us to protect our price.
By not throwing the kitchen sink at a place when we open, we risk less than dramatic instant results, but we also protect our price. And instead, resort to a more progressive and orderly fill up of our promotional and marketing approaches, based upon what we see when we first open. 
With those -- with that general philosophical framework in mind, I'll let Mr. Maddox, Mr. Cootey and Ian Coughlan talk about what's happened since August 22nd. Matt, you want to go first?"

So I think, as Steve said, the ramp-up at Wynn Palace is clearly taking a little longer than we expected and likely will, due to the circumstances surrounding the property. 
But when we look at what's going on in at Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau, comparing September, at Wynn Palace, which was our full month, to October, which we just completed, we've seen in our volume metrics, that's turnover, mass drop, and slot handle, those increased sequentially from September to October by about 20%, which was in line with the market that also increased from September to October by around 19%.
So Wynn Palace, each day, is continuing to gain traction in the Cotai market.
Wynn Macau also experienced the same increase from September to October in its volume metrics of about 20%. So while the process is taking longer, we are maintaining our share in these markets and in September combined, we were at -- on a normalized basis, roughly 13.5% market share. In October, we didn't hold this well in the VIP segment but from a volume standpoint, we've maintained that share.
So we are happy with the progress but believe it is going to take longer than we anticipated due to the challenges in our location. Ian?"

We had a very well-executed opening of all facilities, customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, rooms and food and beverage particularly are a new standard for the market. Despite all of the challenges that Steve referred to, with the light rail and resort buildings around the property, visitation has been good, particularly on the weekends. We're very focused on ramping up premium mass, which we believe is a real edge giver, given our service in our facility.
When we look at VIP turn for the 2 properties over at Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace, we've actually doubled our VIP turn versus the previous 60 days since we opened. So the junkets have managed to backfill downtown very effectively.
We have a new junket opening at Wynn Palace on the 5th of November. We're also introducing some casual junkets that we're building up that side of the business. We're actively bringing back customers that are already in Cotai that were previously Wynn customers. 
And we're just learning and adapting to a very competitive market. Seeing is believing and people experiencing the property is really going to help us. We've made a number of significant casino floor changes with game mixes.
We're watching how people are adapting to the property, what they enjoy. We've got a lot of new promotions to animate the casino that we've been introducing. We're driving occupancy post the holidays. Occupancy has grown 10 points in October. We finished that 81% and we continue to bring the occupancy up. 
Our food and beverage offer and the variety of offer were altering and changing, again, to meet the customer need. 
We've been tackling the bus program. We've effectively doubled our buses that are around the road, picking up people from different entry points into the Macau within the city itself.
We've introduced a taxi incentive program, which has proved to be extremely effective. And we are going to becoming a part of the Cotai connection, which connects all of the properties in Cotai from a bus travel perspective.
At the same time, we're looking at post opening cost-based management. When you open, there's always areas that need to be tweaked and cut back on. And looking back town -- back downtown at the cannibalization aspect, pretty much what we perceived was going to happen, has happened. There's been a fairly significant impact on our direct VIP downtown, because we have a lot of Wynn players that wanted to come and experience the new property. The junkets backfilled very well as I discussed already. On the mass, we're less affected. Our customers downtown seem to be very Peninsula downtown-centric, while some of them have experienced our new property, they've been very sticky downtown.
And overall, downtown was pretty settled, and we're just growing business uptown and our competitors are smart people. A lot of the ways that we bring business to the new property is personalized selling. Seeing is believing, and we will take care of the players that comes to the property and bringing new people in over the coming months."

And we think that adds to our general appeal as we go forward in a couple of years with that project.
So I think, generally, that's what's going on. I have spent my time in continuing the planning and the refining of the development of our real estate in Las Vegas. And that planning process is continuing -- one of the most interesting things in the 49 years I've been doing this is that the golf course and the available real estate in the company presents so many options that making these final decisions and choices has been extremely challenging and an awful lot of fun, too. 
With our land, our water and our location, we're seeking to come to a final layout of all of our facilities that put us in a much stronger position to be a very dominant force in all aspects of non-casino revenue.
I think that I want to share something with the people on the call. 
Ever since 1989, when we opened the Mirage, the facilities that we built have always broken the record for casino revenue in Las Vegas and in America. Our casinos have won more money than any other gambling floor in the United States and in the world, with the exception of Asia, Hong Kong, Macau market and Singapore.
I have made this point in previous phone calls that in spite of the fact that we break the annual revenue for casino numbers in Nevada, we've always had more non-casino revenue, starting with the Mirage, when it went through $500 million, we had $600 million in our casino revenue. When we did $700 million at -- $600 million rather, at Bellagio, we did $800 million in non-casino revenue. And at Wynn, when we went through $700 million, we had $800 million or $900 million in casino revenue and then finally, over $1 billion with the Encore Wynn facility, when the casino revenue went through $800 million. So therefore, there's always been this pattern of 48%, 47% casino, 53%, 54% non-casino.
In September, in this hotel in Las Vegas, I saw something that was even surprising for me, but very encouraging in a point that I'll make in a moment. 
In the month of September, our casino revenue was $1,870,000 a day, well over $50 million in that 30-day period. That was probably the biggest number in the world except for Singapore and Macau, $1,870,000 a day. But what was dazzling for me privately and personally was in our non-casino revenue was $3,340,000 a day. And if you normalize whole percentage, because we played a little lucky, the ratio of gaming to non-gaming in the #1 casino in Las Vegas was 2:1.
I take that development as follows. It tells us that these 43 million people a day -- a year that come to Las Vegas, 800,000-odd people a week are spending more money and have more disposable income for the non-casino aspects, which are really the drivers in our industry. And therefore, I am heartened by the fact that we have almost unlimited possibility of this expanding and convention and other related business on our property in Las Vegas, and that has made the design development process even more challenging and exciting as we exploit our undeveloped real estate in various parts of this assembly on the Strip in Las Vegas. 
Having made that point, and hopefully, share that insight would you, I'll turn the questioning over to the folks on the call."

I spent the month of August there and I've been back again since. And my take on this is that one of the facilities that we have downtown that is extremely well-received, called Red 8, which is casual dining. We did in Cotai, but we did it on a scale that based upon the customer reaction, is not adequate. So what we're doing on one side of the mass gaming area is building a larger Red 8 to handle the demand that we've had, and that's going to take several months to install, but we had the room to do it, and we're going to increase that. So as far as the project goes, that restaurant modification represents, what I think, is an investment we're going of make several million dollars. It's not earthshaking, but it's very significant. We've also added -- we had a -- we had 2 spaces in our retail area that we held to ourselves so that we could do exactly what we're doing now. And it's a pattern we followed. We always leave a number of spaces, either unassigned or temporarily occupied, so that we can react to the surprises or the things we learned after the place opens. And so we had some spaces, and we filled them with things that we could move easily that were our own like a luggage store that we operate ourselves. We actually left 15,000 square feet empty but shelled in, in a critical location and hit it with a fault wall so that we'd have that capacity and that element to resort to, if we wanted to. Because each one of these hotels takes on a personality of its own, that is in many cases, surprising or unexpected after the public gets possession of it. So the casual dining additions that we're adding don't represent serious capital in the scheme of things, but their alterations are going to make in terms of casual dining in the months ahead. Matt, do you have anything you want to add to that?"

The sequential delays that took place and the problems the government have had in resolving their own problems with the light rail construction have been a moving thing, and so -- and we knew that -- we certainly saw that and everybody knew that SJM was in under construction on one side and MGM on the other. MGM thought they were going to be done earlier as did a lot of the people in our neighborhood. I don't know that it's a bad thing that they're going to open when they open instead of earlier. But we never had a terrific insight as to the status of our competitor's scheduling. We can read what they say on their quarterlies, but they are subject to the same kind of contingent events that we were with regard to construction and completion dates in China. So to that extent, we looked around us and everything that was happening was fairly obvious. There wasn't anything we could do about it. There was no dynamic actions that was available to us, and we were hoping that the situation would improve as we approached the summer months, when we are getting ready to open the property. I, myself, didn't realize how critical the blockade was until I went there in August. I was there in the month of August for 3 or 4 weeks before the place opened. And I didn't realize how critical it was until I try to go across the street to City of Dreams. And you took your life in your hands, trying to get through the barricade and cross the street because of the traffic. There's no crossing. All of that is tied up at the moment at the middle where the construction's taking place for the escalators. See, there's a big terminal for the -- a big stop right in front of our hotel on the light rail. As I mentioned, it's the first stop from the ferry terminal. And they built a bridge that goes from the west side of the street, which is MGM and City of Dreams, to the east side of the street, which is us and our gondola station.  I didn't realize how big the holes were and how with the primitive state of the construction, with the walls they built. And I guess, there's -- accept it, it is what it is. We weren't in charge of that construction. We didn't have a dialogue going with the builder. This situation happened when we were opening the hotel on the Peninsula, on the east side of our hotel between us and StarWorld and Arc, there was the street that originally was a sewer canal. And they were going to make a street out of it and cover the sewer canal, and 5 months after our hotels opened, it was still a canal, an open trench. And then all of a sudden, in a space of 12 weeks, a street emerged. It was an amazing, rapid transformation, which proved that the Chinese people could do -- the Chinese government could do pretty much what it wanted at a speed that was quite remarkable under certain circumstances.
Apparently, with this light rail, they haven't been able to get the same kind of acceleration, and I believe they're trying to get that fixed up. But I didn't really know what to expect as I looked at the construction during the -- of the surrounding properties and the light rail while we were building our place. We were sort of heavily-focused inside on our own problems. I don't know if my answer is helpful to you, but does that deal with your question?"

When we opened the Wynn Peninsula, we got to $1  million a day on the 12th month. And it's starting it a $500,000 a day, $600,000 a day in EBITDA. And it was slower getting to $1 million a day, but it was",535,"Well, okay. Here's the way I would approach that. When we opened the Wynn Peninsula, we got to $1  million a day on the 12th month. And it's starting it a $500,000 a day, $600,000 a day in EBITDA. And it was slower getting to $1 million a day, but it was much quicker getting to $2 million a day or  $3 million a day. And the reason is, is that this -- in our kind of property, the acquisition of clientele of customers is done sort of one at a time. There's an old phrase, ""Eagles don't flock, you got to catch them one at a time."" So laying the groundwork for building the clientele for a hotel that is exemplary, that's unique, and the Palace turned out to be the most beautiful job we've ever done by far. The rooms are exquisite. The place is absolutely magnificent physically. Now you introduced such a property to people, and they like it or they don't. You asked yourself, ""Who are the customers? Who do you build place for?"" And you do so with sort of a conviction that when people see something wonderful and special, that they like it and they'll be loyal to it or they'll come back again and again. So the exposure of the building, at first, is aggregate, it sort of compounds on itself. And we got to -- the first day we opened the place, we made $1 million and we're operating at $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 level or something like that in October. And I expect that decline on a steady basis. Because I believe that the people will respond to our product as they have for the past 49 years in Atlantic City, Fremont Street, The Strip in Las Vegas, the Peninsula in Macau, and every place else we've ever been. This property is following the same pattern that I've observed in our developments over the years. I guess you'd have to use your own arithmetic when you do these things. I don't like -- I don't want to make a lot of promises or puff piece statements. I make one statement, that it's the most magnificent hotel we've ever built. And clearly, clearly, the most dramatically elegant and beautiful hotel in China, or maybe anywhere in the world for that matter. Now what will public acceptance of it be? Well, based upon our experiences, so far, pretty good. But in tackling the mass market and the premium mass market, as Matt mentioned before, is sort of a sequential process. You have to expose the place to people for them to find out what's in it, but in order to do that, you have to be able to get there. And right now, that's a bit challenging. And that's temporary, of course. It will go away. And these very things that have complicated are launched are the very things that will underwrite its future. Having that light rail, that being the first stop is a cool thing. So I'm looking forward to it. But in the meantime, we'll deal with the shortfall or the inconvenience of the moment as best as we can. Am I responding to you properly?"

The Cotai property was built to appeal to the most discriminating person that would come to China, the premium mass customer and the VIP, and the top end of the mass, even just below what we call premium mass. The idea was that this was going to be the place of choice for people that cared about their choice, and so that was always the program. I think, if you ask me to be candid about any adjustment that I thought we needed that -- it was that I wanted to see more after the opening. As I looked at our neighbors and I looked more closely in our own trade and the response to various outlets in our hotel, I realized because we were so overrun with the casual dining things that we offer, that we needed more of them. I think, if anything, I think I might have under underestimated what my colleagues, the amount of casual dining that we needed compared to the other folks. They have dozens and dozens of these casual dining restaurants throughout Cotai. We had 2 or 3, but I've found out with the mass of  people, it's not enough. So we've got to increase that. And we are doing that in 2 specific locations adjacent to the casino, straightaway. Now we've got to get through the approval of the government to do the work, and we're doing the drawings, lickety split as fast as we can to get that job done. As a matter of fact, we're going to put up construction barricades and get on with it immediately. But if that's -- I guess, if you ask me, what surprise or what did I see after the place gave birth and the public came in? I was -- I immediately, and the rest of us, Ian, we all recognized we needed to up our casual dining capacities beyond what we originally thought. And it was pretty easy to do actually, because we had sort of anticipated that there would be something that we wanted to add or change after opening, which is why I left those spaces available for it. And now we're going to take advantage of it based upon what we learned since August 22. Just pretty much the same thing as we thought before."

My visits to Beijing only reinforced that with the people that I've had the privilege of discussing China with. I go there in occasion to broaden my perspective on China because after all, Macau is part of it. In terms of the implications to local policy and to a certain extent, visa policies, I think that you have to look at the arc of all aspects of the central government behavior or actions and take that into account with the local government's reaction and their independent actions. Because if you're in Beijing, they'll tell you that the SAR is autonomous, that it's self-governing. And that although they pay close attention and want to support it, that they look to the government of Macau to run Macau. And we have this interaction with them on a regular basis. Usually, it's on detailed stuff like trying to fix the roads and things like that, so with different parts of the government. In my conversations with the top level of the Macau government, they definitely want to protect the job security of the people that are engaged, the Macau citizens and everybody else, that are engaged in working at these places. There's a strong preference for protecting the employee base of the industry. When issues that affect them, meaning the employees and the local employees in particular, come up, the government is particularly responsive and on point. When we get to more subtle things that had to do, for example, with smoking, then the matter -- the speed of decision slows down. This conversation about smoking with Secretary Tam,  and even with the Chief Executive Officer and Secretary Leon has been more protracted. There's competing interests here: the health and safety of the employees, the strong preference of the customers to have the freedom to smoke, it's very popular in China, still. And then there's this whole thing about trying to make people healthier even if it kills them to do so. So when you get to areas like this, that are certainly relevant to our -- right now, the smoking -- I'm using this example, the smoking policy is mixed. Some places' been grandfathered in, other places have tried to take advantage of the interim policy allowing smoking lounges but yet, the final approval of those smoking lounges has been delayed and nobody is sure whether there's going to be a complete ban on smoking regardless of any condition within the buildings or whether they'll be a mitigated or ameliorated compromised position. So when you talk about the policies of the government since the Premier's visit, you really have to separate the general support that mainland China and Beijing gives the SAR from the intricacies in the more granular aspects of the things that we're interested in. It may seem mundane in comparison but are not. You get my drift on this? It's not a simple answer to your question. God lives in the details on this one. How did I do? I mean, is there -- you might have a follow-up on that. It's a tough question that you asked me."

I personally have been focused very heavily on the finishing touches of all of our construction and fit-outs that are associated with the Massachusetts property and the stuff that we're doing here in Las Vegas. But I think we should start off today by talking about Macau, and Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau because the Palace is now several weeks old and underway.
The first thing I would mention is that first of all, we're very happy with the way the property turned out. We finished and completely closed the cost of the place with our contractor, Leighton, at USD 4.4 billion, and that is now behind us.
There is something about our property in Cotai that I want to frame this conversation today. We -- our 52 or so acres there is surrounded on all 4 sides by streets. On the east is the staging yard where the light rail system that sort of resembles a monorail that seeks to bring people from the airport and the Cotai ferry terminal to the various hotels in Cotai. That project has been underway for several years, experienced some developmental complexities and problems and delays and is now scheduled for completion in a few years.
The staging area and the construction area for the light rail system covers our entire east side, and is across the street from our property, the entire parcel on the east side. Next to it is the airport. The light rail system, it goes from the ferry terminal and the airport along the entire north side of our property and then makes a 90-degree left-hand turn and goes down the west side of our property. Across the street from the west side of our property is the City of Dreams, the Melco development on the right, and then as the light rail proceeds, it passes at the midpoint of our front of our property, a street going perpendicularly west to Venetia.
On the other side, representing the other half of our western front is the construction job of MGM. And then on our south side, we have the construction job of SJM's hotel that's scheduled to open in the future. MGM is scheduled to open this spring at the end of May or the beginning of June at last check.
So what we have is an anomalous situation, where all 4 sides of our property are currently -- are being enclosed by either barricades or construction blockades of one kind or another. It has tended to isolate our property on all four sides, and it's made access to the Palace temporarily highly encumbered, crossing the street or getting through these barricades that have been erected by MGM and by the folks who are building the light rail system.
And it comes to a -- its first stop with escalators and bridges right in the midpoint of our front yard where our gondola station is. And of course, in the short term, it's turned out to be a disadvantage having all the barricades and the construction on all 4 sides, but in the long term, of course, it's very advantageous to us.
But in that context, it's representing a handicap in our -- in the access that the public has, both in buses, in cars or taxicabs. And we have worked in the last month or so in conjunction with the government on trying to mitigate these substantial barricades that enclose our property. And the government has been understanding and sympathetic to our situation and has promised to ameliorate the situation in the next several months. But it is at the moment, a handicap for us and one we're forced to deal with. 
Scheduling for all of this was supposed to be done when we opened at the time that we broke ground on the hotel, but as I mentioned a moment ago, there had been delays in all of these, both in the construction of our 2 neighboring hotels and of the light rail itself.
With that in mind, I still think it would be constructive for us to review the performances of these properties and address issues of cannibalization, of start-ups and ramp-ups and that sort of thing.
I would add to that conversation one other element from my perspective, for the past 40-odd years that we've been building these hotels -- and the Cotai hotel was number 12 for us -- we have followed a philosophy of how to open major destination hotels. And I'll describe it as follows.
We open a hotel without any real marketing support or pressure because we are very curious to see what its naked, unstimulated kind of revenues are. And then in the months following the opening -- we do sort of a low key opening. In the months following the opening, we constructively, and with a very targeted approach, ramp up and institute marketing programs, both in hotel occupancy and casino revenue and that sort of thing in a very layered fashion that allows us to protect our price.
By not throwing the kitchen sink at a place when we open, we risk less-than-dramatic instant results, but we also protect our price. And instead, resort to a more progressive and orderly build-up of our promotional and marketing approaches, based upon what we see when we first open. 
With those -- with that general philosophical framework in mind, I'll let Mr. Maddox, Mr. Cootey and Ian Coughlan talk about what's happened since August 22nd. Matt, you want to go first?"

So I think, as Steve said, the ramp-up at Wynn Palace is clearly taking a little longer than we expected and likely will, due to the circumstances surrounding the property. 
But when we look at what's going on in at Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau, comparing September at Wynn Palace, which was our full month, to October, which we just completed, we've seen in our volume metrics -- that's turnover, mass drop, and slot handle -- those increased sequentially from September to October by about 20%, which was in line with the market that also increased from September to October by around 19%.
So Wynn Palace, each day, is continuing to gain traction in the Cotai market.
Wynn Macau also experienced the same increase from September to October in its volume metrics of about 20%. So while the process is taking longer, we are maintaining our share in these markets and in September combined, we were at -- on a normalized basis, roughly 13.5% market share. In October, we didn't hold as well in the VIP segment but from a volume standpoint, we've maintained that share.
So we are happy with the progress but believe it is going to take longer than we anticipated due to the challenges in our location. Ian?"

We had a very well-executed opening of all facilities, customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, rooms and food and beverage particularly are a new standard for the market. Despite all of the challenges that Steve referred to, with the light rail and resort buildings around the property, visitation has been good, particularly on the weekends. We're very focused on ramping up premium mass, which we believe is a real edge giver, given our service and our facility.
When we look at VIP turn for the 2 properties over at Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace, we've actually doubled our VIP turn versus the previous 60 days since we opened. So the junkets have managed to backfill downtown very effectively.
We have a new junket opening at Wynn Palace on the 5th of November. We're also introducing some casual junkets that we're building up that side of the business. We're actively bringing back customers that are already in Cotai that were previously Wynn customers. 
And we're just learning and adapting to a very competitive market. Seeing is believing and people experiencing the property is really going to help us. We've made a number of significant casino floor changes with game mixes.
We're watching how people are adapting to the property, what they enjoy. We've got a lot of new promotions to animate the casino that we've been introducing. We're driving occupancy post the holidays. Occupancy has grown 10 points in October. We finished at 81% and we continue to bring the occupancy up. 
Our food and beverage offer and the variety of offer we're altering and changing, again to meet the customer need. 
We've been tackling the bus program. We've effectively doubled our buses that are on the road, picking up people from different entry points into Macau and within the city itself.
We've introduced a taxi incentive program, which has proved to be extremely effective. And we are going to becoming part of the Cotai Connection, which connects all of the properties in Cotai from a bus travel perspective.
At the same time, we're looking at post opening cost-based management. When you open, there's always areas that need to be tweaked and cut back on. And looking back town -- back downtown at the cannibalization aspect, pretty much what we perceived was going to happen, has happened. There's been a fairly significant impact on our direct VIP downtown, because we have a lot of Wynn players that wanted to come and experience the new property. The junkets backfilled very well as I discussed already. On the mass, we're less affected. Our customers downtown seem to be very Peninsula downtown-centric. While some of them have experienced our new property, they've been very sticky downtown.
And overall, downtown was pretty settled, and we're just growing business uptown and our competitors are smart people. A lot of the ways that we bring business to the new property is personalized selling. Seeing is believing, and we will take care of the players that come to the property and bring new people in over the coming months."

We're starting to pour the slabs in the back of the house in central utility plant areas and we expect on-site steel deliveries in December. And by first quarter of next year, we'll be standing steel in those -- the back of the house and the central utility plant area.
So far very good fall construction season, weather's been great, very -- actually a little bit of rain. And so that's helped us move things along. So about 325 workers now currently on-site, and we're running right on schedule.

And we think that adds to our general appeal as we go forward in a couple of years with that project.
So I think, generally, that's what's going on. I have spent my time in continuing the planning and the refining of the development of our real estate in Las Vegas. And that planning process is continuing -- one of the most interesting things in the 49 years I've been doing this is that the golf course and the available real estate in the company presents so many options that making these final decisions and choices has been extremely challenging and an awful lot of fun, too. With our land, our water and our location, we're seeking to come to a final layout of all of our facilities that put us in a much stronger position to be a very dominant force in all aspects of non-casino revenue.
I think that I want to share something with the people on the call. 
Ever since 1989, when we opened the Mirage, the facilities that we built have always broken the record for casino revenue in Las Vegas and in America. Our casinos have won more money than any other gambling floor in the United States and in the world, with the exception of Asia -- Hong Kong, the Macau market and Singapore.
I have made this point in previous phone calls that in spite of the fact that we break the annual revenue for casino numbers in Nevada, we've always had more non-casino revenue, starting with the Mirage, when it went through $500 million, we had $600 million in non-casino revenue. When we did $700 million at -- $600 million rather, at Bellagio, we did $800 million in non-casino revenue. And at Wynn, when we went through $700 million, we had $800 million or $900 million in casino revenue and then finally, over $1 billion with the Encore Wynn facility, when the casino revenue went through $800 million. So therefore, there's always been this pattern of 48%, 47% casino, 53%, 54% non-casino.
In September, in this hotel in Las Vegas, I saw something that was even surprising for me, but very encouraging in a point that I'll make in a moment. 
In the month of September, our casino revenue was $1,870,000 a day, well over $50 million in that 30-day period. That was probably the biggest number in the world except for Singapore and Macau, $1,870,000 a day. But what was dazzling to me privately and personally was that our non-casino revenue was $3,340,000 a day. And if you normalize hold percentage, because we played a little lucky, the ratio of gaming to non-gaming in the #1 casino in Las Vegas was 2:1.
I take that development as follows. It tells us that these 43 million people a day -- a year that come to Las Vegas, 800,000-odd people a week are spending more money and have more disposable income for the non-casino aspects, which are really the drivers in our industry. And therefore, I am heartened by the fact that we have almost unlimited possibility of this expanding in convention and other related business on our property in Las Vegas, and that has made the design development process even more challenging and exciting as we exploit our undeveloped real estate in various parts of this assembly on the Strip in Las Vegas. 
Having made that point, and hopefully, shared that insight would you, I'll turn the questioning over to the folks on the call."

I spent the month of August there and I've been back again since. And my take on this is that one of the facilities that we have downtown that is extremely well-received, called Red 8, which is casual dining, we did in Cotai, but we did it on a scale that based upon the customer reaction, is not adequate. So what we're doing on one side of the mass gaming area is building a larger Red 8 to handle the demand that we've had, and that's going to take several months to install, but we had the room to do it, and we're going to increase that. So as far as the project goes, that restaurant modification represents what I think is an investment we're going of make several million dollars. It's not earthshaking, but it's very significant. We've also added -- we had a -- we had 2 spaces in our retail area that we held to ourselves so that we could do exactly what we're doing now. And it's a pattern we followed. We always leave a number of spaces, either unassigned or temporarily occupied, so that we can react to the surprises or the things we learn after the place opens. And so we had some spaces, and we filled them with things that we could move easily that were our own, like a luggage store that we operate ourselves. We actually left 15,000 square feet empty but shelled in, in a critical location and hid it with a false wall so that we'd have that capacity and that element to resort to, if we wanted to. Because each one of these hotels takes on a personality of its own, that is in many cases, surprising or unexpected after the public gets possession of it. So the casual dining additions that we're adding don't represent serious capital in the scheme of things, but they're alterations we're going to make in terms of casual dining in the months ahead. Matt, do you have anything you want to add to that?"

We -- there are parts of the Wynn Park development that are going to kick in very early. There's -- if we go according to plan -- and that has to do with the addition of meeting rooms and ballrooms on property that is part of Wynn and Encore now and not on the golf course, as we up our convention profile, our meeting space convention, ballroom profile substantially. And then there's the lagoon, the new rooms that are going to be available on both the north and south side of Wynn Park and the other features that go around the lake. And then the issue is adjacent properties that will be available for smaller operators on Paradise Road, and the potential for exhibit space. So balancing all of these things, I don't have a scheduling problem as much as I have a planning problem. But each of these things on our early investigation have overwhelming self-justification financially so we don't really worry about financing them, if that's the direction of your question."

The sequential delays that took place and the problems the governments have had in resolving their own problems with the light rail construction have been a moving thing, and so -- and we knew that -- we certainly saw that everybody knew that SJM was in under construction on one side and MGM on the other. MGM thought they were going to be done earlier as did a lot of the people in our neighborhood. I don't know that it's a bad thing that they're going to open when they open instead of earlier. But we never had terrific insight as to the status of our competitor's scheduling. We can read what they say on their quarterlies, but they're subject to the same kind of contingent events that we were with regard to construction and completion dates in China. So to that extent, we looked around us and everything that was happening was fairly obvious. There wasn't anything we could do about it. There was no dynamic actions that was available to us, and we were hoping that the situation would improve as we approached the summer months, when we are getting ready to open the property. I, myself, didn't realize how critical the blockade was until I went there in August. I was there in the month of August for 3 weeks or 4 weeks before the place opened. And I didn't realize how critical it was until I tried to go across the street to City of Dreams. And you took your life in your hands, trying to get through the barricade and cross the street because of the traffic. There's no crossing. All of that is tied up at the moment at the middle where the construction's taking place for the escalators. See, there's a big terminal for the -- a big stop right in front of our hotel on the light rail. As I mentioned, it's the first stop from the ferry terminal. And they built a bridge that goes from the west side of the street, which is MGM and City of Dreams, to the east side of the street, which is us and our gondola station.  I didn't realize how big the holes were and how with the primitive state of the construction, with the walls they built. And I guess, there's nothing to say, except it is what it is. We weren't in charge of that construction. We didn't have a dialogue going with the builder. This situation happened when we were opening the hotel on the Peninsula, on the east side of our hotel between us and StarWorld and Arc, there was the street that originally was a sewer canal. And they were going to make a street out of it and cover the sewer canal, and 5 months before our hotel opened, it was still a canal, an open trench. And then all of a sudden, in a space of 12 weeks, a street emerged. It was an amazing, rapid transformation, which proved that the Chinese people could do -- the Chinese government could do pretty much what it wanted at a speed that was quite remarkable under certain circumstances. Apparently, with this light rail, they haven't been able to get the same kind of acceleration, and I believe they're trying to get that fixed up. But I didn't really know what to expect as I looked at the construction during the -- of the surrounding properties and the light rail while we were building our place. We were sort of heavily-focused inside on our own problems. I don't know if my answer is helpful to you, but does that deal with your question?"

When we opened the Wynn Peninsula, we got to $1  million a day on the 12th month. And it's starting at $500,000 a day, $600,000 a day in EBITDA.

And it's starting at $500,000 a day, $600,000 a day in EBITDA. And it was slower getting to $1 million a day, but it was much quicker getting to $2 million a day or  $3 million a day. And the reason is, is that this -- in our kind of property, the acquisition of clientele of customers is done sort of one at a time. There's an old phrase, ""Eagles don't flock, you got to catch them one at a time."" So laying the groundwork for building the clientele for a hotel that is exemplary, that's unique -- and the Palace turned out to be the most beautiful job we've ever done by far, the rooms are exquisite, the place is absolutely magnificent physically. Now you introduce such a property to people, and they like it or they don't. You ask yourself, ""Who are the customers? Who do you build a place for?"" And you do so with sort of a conviction that when people see something wonderful and special, that they'll like it and they'll be loyal to it or they'll come back again and again. So the exposure of the building, at first, is -- aggregates, it sort of compounds on itself. And we got to -- the first day we opened the place, we made $1 million and we're operating at $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 level or something like that in October. And I expect that to climb on a steady basis. Because I believe that the people will respond to our product as they have for the past 49 years in Atlantic City, Fremont Street, The Strip in Las Vegas, the Peninsula in Macau, and every place else we've ever been. This property is following the same pattern that I've observed in our developments over the years. I guess you'd have to use your own arithmetic when you do these things. I don't like -- I don't want to make a lot of promises or puffy statements. I make one statement, that it's the most magnificent hotel we've ever built. And clearly, clearly, the most dramatically elegant and beautiful hotel in China, or maybe anywhere in the world for that matter. Now what will public acceptance of it be? Well, based upon our experiences so far, pretty good. But tackling the mass market and the premium mass market, as Matt mentioned before, is sort of a sequential process. You have to expose the place to people for them to find out what's in it, but in order to do that, they have to be able to get there. And right now, that's a bit challenging. And that's temporary, of course. It will go away. And these very things that have complicated our launch are the very things that will underwrite its future. Having that light rail and being the first stop is a cool thing. So I'm looking forward to it. But in the meantime, we'll deal with the shortfall or the inconvenience of the moment as best we can.

The Cotai property was built to appeal to the most discriminating person that would come to China, the premium mass customer and the VIP, and the top end of the mass, even just below what we call premium mass. The idea was that this was going to be the place of choice for people that cared about their choice, and so that was always the program. I think, if you ask me to be candid about any adjustment that I thought we needed that -- it was that I wanted to see more after the opening. As I looked at our neighbors and I looked more closely at our own trade and the response to various outlets in our hotel, I realized because we were so overrun with the casual dining things that we offer, that we needed more of them. I think, if anything, I think I might have underestimated with my colleagues, the amount of casual dining that we needed, compared to the other folks. They have dozens and dozens of these casual dining restaurants throughout Cotai. We had 2 or 3, but I've found out with the mass of  people, it's not enough. So we've got to increase that. And we are doing that in 2 specific locations adjacent to the casino, straightaway. Now we've got to get through the approval of the government to do the work, and we're doing the drawings, lickety split as fast as we can to get that job done. As a matter of fact, we're going to put up construction barricades and get on with it immediately. But if that's -- I guess, if you ask me, what surprise or what did I see after the place gave birth and the public came in? I was -- I immediately, and the rest of us, Ian, we all recognized we needed to up our casual dining capacities beyond what we originally thought.

My visits to Beijing only reinforce that with the people that I've had the privilege of discussing China with. I go there on occasion to broaden my perspective on China because after all, Macau is part of it. In terms of the implications to local policy and to a certain extent, visa policies, I think that you have to look at the arc of all aspects of the central government behavior or actions and take that into account with the local government's reaction and their independent actions. Because if you're in Beijing, they'll tell you that the SAR is autonomous, that it's self-governing. And that although they pay close attention and want to support it, that they look to the government of Macau to run Macau. And we have this interaction with them on a regular basis. Usually, it's on detailed stuff like trying to fix the roads and things like that, so we're with different parts of the government. In my conversations with the top level of the Macau government, they definitely want to protect the job security of the people that are engaged, the Macau citizens and everybody else, that are engaged in working at these places. There's a strong preference for protecting the employee base of the industry. When issues that affect them, meaning the employees and the local employees in particular, come up, the government is particularly responsive and on point. When we get to more subtle things that have to do, for example, with smoking, then the matter -- the speed of decision slows down. This conversation about smoking with Secretary Tam,  and even with the Chief Executive Officer and Secretary Leon [ph] has been more protracted. There's competing interests here: the health and safety of the employees, the strong preference of the customers to have the freedom to smoke; it's very popular in China, still. And then there's this whole thing about trying to make people healthier even if it kills them to do so. So when you get to areas like this, that are certainly relevant to our -- right now, the smoking -- I'm using this example, the smoking policy is mixed. Some places' been grandfathered in, other places have tried to take advantage of the interim policy allowing smoking in lounges but yet, the final approval of those smoking lounges has been delayed and nobody is sure whether there's going to be a complete ban on smoking regardless of any condition within the buildings or whether they'll be a mitigated or ameliorated compromised position. So when you talk about the policies of the government since the Premier's visit, you really have to separate the general support that mainland China and Beijing gives the SAR from the intricacies and the more granular aspects of the things that we're interested in, that may seem mundane in comparison but are not. You get my drift on this? It's not a simple answer to your question. God lives in the details on this one. How did I do? I mean, is there -- you might have a follow-up on that. It's a tough question that you asked me."

I personally have been focused very heavily on the finishing touches of all of our construction and fit-outs that are associated with the Massachusetts property and the stuff that we're doing here in Las Vegas. But I think we should start off today by talking about Macau, and Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau because the Palace is now several weeks old and underway.
The first thing I would mention is that first of all, we're very happy with the way the property turned out. We finished and completely closed the cost of the place with our contractor, Leighton, at USD 4.4 billion, and that is now behind us.
There is something about our property in Cotai that I want to frame this conversation today. We -- our 52 or so acres there is surrounded on all 4 sides by streets. On the east is the staging yard where the light rail system that sort of resembles a monorail that seeks to bring people from the airport and the Cotai ferry terminal to the various hotels in Cotai. That project has been underway for several years, experienced some developmental complexities and problems and delays and is now scheduled for completion in a few years.
The staging area and the construction area for the light rail system covers our entire east side, and is across the street from our property, the entire parcel on the east side. Next to it is the airport. The light rail system, it goes from the ferry terminal and the airport along the entire north side of our property and then makes a 90-degree left-hand turn and goes down the west side of our property. Across the street from the west side of our property is the City of Dreams, the Melco development on the right, and then as the light rail proceeds, it passes at the midpoint of our front of our property, a street going perpendicularly west to Venetia.
On the other side, representing the other half of our western front is the construction job of MGM. And then on our south side, we have the construction job of SJM's hotel that's scheduled to open in the future. MGM is scheduled to open this spring at the end of May or the beginning of June at last check.
So what we have is an anomalous situation, where all 4 sides of our property are currently -- are being enclosed by either barricades or construction blockades of one kind or another. It has tended to isolate our property on all 4 sides, and it's made access to the Palace temporarily highly encumbered, crossing the street or getting through these barricades that have been erected by MGM and by the folks who are building the light rail system.
And it comes to a -- its first stop with escalators and bridges right in the midpoint of our front yard where our gondola station is. And of course, in the short term, it's turned out to be a disadvantage having all the barricades and the construction on all 4 sides, but in the long term, of course, it's very advantageous to us.
But in that context, it's representing a handicap in our -- in the access that the public has, both in buses, in cars or taxicabs. And we have worked in the last month or so in conjunction with the government on trying to mitigate these substantial barricades that enclose our property. And the government has been understanding and sympathetic to our situation and has promised to ameliorate the situation in the next several months. But it is at the moment, a handicap for us and one we're forced to deal with. 
Scheduling for all of this was supposed to be done when we opened at the time that we broke ground on the hotel, but as I mentioned a moment ago, there had been delays in all of these, both in the construction of our 2 neighboring hotels and of the light rail itself.
With that in mind, I still think it would be constructive for us to review the performances of these properties and address issues of cannibalization, of start-ups and ramp-ups and that sort of thing.
I would add to that conversation one other element from my perspective, for the past 40-odd years that we've been building these hotels -- and the Cotai hotel was number 12 for us -- we have followed a philosophy of how to open major destination hotels. And I'll describe it as follows.
We open a hotel without any real marketing support or pressure because we are very curious to see what its naked, unstimulated kind of revenues are. And then in the months following the opening -- we do sort of a low key opening. In the months following the opening, we constructively, and with a very targeted approach, ramp up and institute marketing programs, both in hotel occupancy and casino revenue and that sort of thing in a very layered fashion that allows us to protect our price.
By not throwing the kitchen sink at a place when we open, we risk less-than-dramatic instant results, but we also protect our price. And instead, resort to a more progressive and orderly build-up of our promotional and marketing approaches, based upon what we see when we first open. 
With those -- with that general philosophical framework in mind, I'll let Mr. Maddox, Mr. Cootey and Ian Coughlan talk about what's happened since August 22nd. Matt, you want to go first?"

So I think, as Steve said, the ramp-up at Wynn Palace is clearly taking a little longer than we expected and likely will, due to the circumstances surrounding the property. 
But when we look at what's going on in at Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau, comparing September at Wynn Palace, which was our full month, to October, which we just completed, we've seen in our volume metrics -- that's turnover, mass drop, and slot handle -- those increased sequentially from September to October by about 20%, which was in line with the market that also increased from September to October by around 19%.
So Wynn Palace, each day, is continuing to gain traction in the Cotai market.
Wynn Macau also experienced the same increase from September to October in its volume metrics of about 20%. So while the process is taking longer, we are maintaining our share in these markets and in September combined, we were at -- on a normalized basis, roughly 13.5% market share. In October, we didn't hold as well in the VIP segment but from a volume standpoint, we've maintained that share.
So we are happy with the progress but believe it is going to take longer than we anticipated due to the challenges in our location. Ian?"

We had a very well-executed opening of all facilities, customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, rooms and food and beverage particularly are a new standard for the market. Despite all of the challenges that Steve referred to, with the light rail and resort buildings around the property, visitation has been good, particularly on the weekends. We're very focused on ramping up premium mass, which we believe is a real edge giver, given our service and our facility.
When we look at VIP turn for the 2 properties over at Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace, we've actually doubled our VIP turn versus the previous 60 days since we opened. So the junkets have managed to backfill downtown very effectively.
We have a new junket opening at Wynn Palace on the 5th of November. We're also introducing some casual junkets that we're building up that side of the business. We're actively bringing back customers that are already in Cotai that were previously Wynn customers. 
And we're just learning and adapting to a very competitive market. Seeing is believing and people experiencing the property is really going to help us. We've made a number of significant casino floor changes with game mixes.
We're watching how people are adapting to the property, what they enjoy. We've got a lot of new promotions to animate the casino that we've been introducing. We're driving occupancy post the holidays. Occupancy has grown 10 points in October. We finished at 81% and we continue to bring the occupancy up. 
Our food and beverage offer and the variety of offer we're altering and changing, again to meet the customer need. 
We've been tackling the bus program. We've effectively doubled our buses that are on the road, picking up people from different entry points into Macau and within the city itself.
We've introduced a taxi incentive program, which has proved to be extremely effective. And we are going to becoming part of the Cotai Connection, which connects all of the properties in Cotai from a bus travel perspective.
At the same time, we're looking at post opening cost-based management. When you open, there's always areas that need to be tweaked and cut back on. And looking back town -- back downtown at the cannibalization aspect, pretty much what we perceived was going to happen, has happened. There's been a fairly significant impact on our direct VIP downtown, because we have a lot of Wynn players that wanted to come and experience the new property. The junkets backfilled very well as I discussed already. On the mass, we're less affected. Our customers downtown seem to be very Peninsula downtown-centric. While some of them have experienced our new property, they've been very sticky downtown.
And overall, downtown was pretty settled, and we're just growing business uptown and our competitors are smart people. A lot of the ways that we bring business to the new property is personalized selling. Seeing is believing, and we will take care of the players that come to the property and bring new people in over the coming months."

3449701,408095332,1073319,"Wynn Resorts Ltd., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Wynn Resorts, Limited","Executives","We've been polishing our -- the people -- we've been polishing the invitations and the -- in the food and beverage promenade and all of those things, we've been able to interest some very substantial local personalities with various forms of food and beve",670,"We've been polishing our -- the people -- we've been polishing the invitations and the -- in the food and beverage promenade and all of those things, we've been able to interest some very substantial local personalities with various forms of food and beverage, and we're in the process of making room for them to join in, so that the facility is very locally-oriented at the top end, with the kinds of people that are very popular in Boston -- with the Boston public already. And we think that adds to our general appeal as we go forward in a couple of years with that project.
So I think, generally, that's what's going on. I have spent my time in continuing the planning and the refining of the development of our real estate in Las Vegas. And that planning process is continuing -- one of the most interesting things in the 49 years I've been doing this is that the golf course and the available real estate in the company presents so many options that making these final decisions and choices has been extremely challenging and an awful lot of fun, too. With our land, our water and our location, we're seeking to come to a final layout of all of our facilities that put us in a much stronger position to be a very dominant force in all aspects of non-casino revenue.
I think that I want to share something with the people on the call. 
Ever since 1989, when we opened the Mirage, the facilities that we built have always broken the record for casino revenue in Las Vegas and in America. Our casinos have won more money than any other gambling floor in the United States and in the world, with the exception of Asia -- Hong Kong, the Macau market and Singapore.
I have made this point in previous phone calls that in spite of the fact that we break the annual revenue for casino numbers in Nevada, we've always had more non-casino revenue, starting with the Mirage, when it went through $500 million, we had $600 million in non-casino revenue. When we did $700 million at -- $600 million rather, at Bellagio, we did $800 million in non-casino revenue. And at Wynn, when we went through $700 million, we had $800 million or $900 million in casino revenue and then finally, over $1 billion with the Encore Wynn facility, when the casino revenue went through $800 million. So therefore, there's always been this pattern of 48%, 47% casino, 53%, 54% non-casino.
In September, in this hotel in Las Vegas, I saw something that was even surprising for me, but very encouraging in a point that I'll make in a moment. 
In the month of September, our casino revenue was $1,870,000 a day, well over $50 million in that 30-day period. That was probably the biggest number in the world except for Singapore and Macau, $1,870,000 a day. But what was dazzling to me privately and personally was that our non-casino revenue was $3,340,000 a day. And if you normalize hold percentage, because we played a little lucky, the ratio of gaming to non-gaming in the #1 casino in Las Vegas was 2:1.
I take that development as follows. It tells us that these 43 million people a day -- a year that come to Las Vegas, 800,000-odd people a week are spending more money and have more disposable income for the non-casino aspects, which are really the drivers in our industry. And therefore, I am heartened by the fact that we have almost unlimited possibility of this expanding in convention and other related business on our property in Las Vegas, and that has made the design development process even more challenging and exciting as we exploit our undeveloped real estate in various parts of this assembly on the Strip in Las Vegas. 
Having made that point, and hopefully, shared that insight would you, I'll turn the questioning over to the folks on the call."

I spent the month of August there and I've been back again since. And my take on this is that one of the facilities that we have downtown that is extremely well-received, called Red 8, which is casual dining, we did in Cotai, but we did it on a scale that based upon the customer reaction, is not adequate. So what we're doing on one side of the mass gaming area is building a larger Red 8 to handle the demand that we've had, and that's going to take several months to install, but we had the room to do it, and we're going to increase that. So as far as the project goes, that restaurant modification represents what I think is an investment we're going of make several million dollars. It's not earthshaking, but it's very significant. We've also added -- we had a -- we had 2 spaces in our retail area that we held to ourselves so that we could do exactly what we're doing now. And it's a pattern we followed. We always leave a number of spaces, either unassigned or temporarily occupied, so that we can react to the surprises or the things we learn after the place opens. And so we had some spaces, and we filled them with things that we could move easily that were our own, like a luggage store that we operate ourselves. We actually left 15,000 square feet empty but shelled in, in a critical location and hid it with a false wall so that we'd have that capacity and that element to resort to, if we wanted to. Because each one of these hotels takes on a personality of its own, that is in many cases, surprising or unexpected after the public gets possession of it. So the casual dining additions that we're adding don't represent serious capital in the scheme of things, but they're alterations we're going to make in terms of casual dining in the months ahead. Matt, do you have anything you want to add to that?"

The sequential delays that took place and the problems the governments have had in resolving their own problems with the light rail construction have been a moving thing, and so -- and we knew that -- we certainly saw that everybody knew that SJM was in under construction on one side and MGM on the other. MGM thought they were going to be done earlier as did a lot of the people in our neighborhood. I don't know that it's a bad thing that they're going to open when they open instead of earlier. But we never had terrific insight as to the status of our competitor's scheduling. We can read what they say on their quarterlies, but they're subject to the same kind of contingent events that we were with regard to construction and completion dates in China. So to that extent, we looked around us and everything that was happening was fairly obvious. There wasn't anything we could do about it. There was no dynamic actions that was available to us, and we were hoping that the situation would improve as we approached the summer months, when we are getting ready to open the property. I, myself, didn't realize how critical the blockade was until I went there in August. I was there in the month of August for 3 or 4 weeks before the place opened. And I didn't realize how critical it was until I tried to go across the street to City of Dreams. And you took your life in your hands, trying to get through the barricade and cross the street because of the traffic. There's no crossing. All of that is tied up at the moment at the middle where the construction's taking place for the escalators. See, there's a big terminal for the -- a big stop right in front of our hotel on the light rail. As I mentioned, it's the first stop from the ferry terminal. And they built a bridge that goes from the west side of the street, which is MGM and City of Dreams, to the east side of the street, which is us and our gondola station.  I didn't realize how big the holes were and how with the primitive state of the construction, with the walls they built. And I guess, there's nothing to say, except it is what it is. We weren't in charge of that construction. We didn't have a dialogue going with the builder. This situation happened when we were opening the hotel on the Peninsula, on the east side of our hotel between us and StarWorld and Arc, there was the street that originally was a sewer canal. And they were going to make a street out of it and cover the sewer canal, and 5 months before our hotel opened, it was still a canal, an open trench. And then all of a sudden, in a space of 12 weeks, a street emerged. It was an amazing, rapid transformation, which proved that the Chinese people could do -- the Chinese government could do pretty much what it wanted at a speed that was quite remarkable under certain circumstances. Apparently, with this light rail, they haven't been able to get the same kind of acceleration, and I believe they're trying to get that fixed up. But I didn't really know what to expect as I looked at the construction during the -- of the surrounding properties and the light rail while we were building our place. We were sort of heavily-focused inside on our own problems. I don't know if my answer is helpful to you, but does that deal with your question?"

When we opened the Wynn Peninsula, we got to $1  million a day on the 12th month. And it's starting at $500,000 a day, $600,000 a day in EBITDA. And it was slower getting to $1 million a day, but it was mu",535,"Well, okay. Here's the way I would approach that. When we opened the Wynn Peninsula, we got to $1  million a day on the 12th month. And it's starting at $500,000 a day, $600,000 a day in EBITDA. And it was slower getting to $1 million a day, but it was much quicker getting to $2 million a day or  $3 million a day. And the reason is, is that this -- in our kind of property, the acquisition of clientele of customers is done sort of one at a time. There's an old phrase, ""Eagles don't flock, you got to catch them one at a time."" So laying the groundwork for building the clientele for a hotel that is exemplary, that's unique -- and the Palace turned out to be the most beautiful job we've ever done by far, the rooms are exquisite, the place is absolutely magnificent physically. Now you introduce such a property to people, and they like it or they don't. You ask yourself, ""Who are the customers? Who do you build a place for?"" And you do so with sort of a conviction that when people see something wonderful and special, that they'll like it and they'll be loyal to it or they'll come back again and again. So the exposure of the building, at first, is -- aggregates, it sort of compounds on itself. And we got to -- the first day we opened the place, we made $1 million and we're operating at $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 level or something like that in October. And I expect that to climb on a steady basis. Because I believe that the people will respond to our product as they have for the past 49 years in Atlantic City, Fremont Street, The Strip in Las Vegas, the Peninsula in Macau, and every place else we've ever been. This property is following the same pattern that I've observed in our developments over the years. I guess you'd have to use your own arithmetic when you do these things. I don't like -- I don't want to make a lot of promises or puffy statements. I make one statement, that it's the most magnificent hotel we've ever built. And clearly, clearly, the most dramatically elegant and beautiful hotel in China, or maybe anywhere in the world for that matter. Now what will public acceptance of it be? Well, based upon our experiences so far, pretty good. But tackling the mass market and the premium mass market, as Matt mentioned before, is sort of a sequential process. You have to expose the place to people for them to find out what's in it, but in order to do that, they have to be able to get there. And right now, that's a bit challenging. And that's temporary, of course. It will go away. And these very things that have complicated our launch are the very things that will underwrite its future. Having that light rail and being the first stop is a cool thing. So I'm looking forward to it. But in the meantime, we'll deal with the shortfall or the inconvenience of the moment as best we can. Am I responding to you properly?"

The Cotai property was built to appeal to the most discriminating person that would come to China, the premium mass customer and the VIP, and the top end of the mass, even just below what we call premium mass. The idea was that this was going to be the place of choice for people that cared about their choice, and so that was always the program. I think, if you ask me to be candid about any adjustment that I thought we needed that -- it was that I wanted to see more after the opening. As I looked at our neighbors and I looked more closely at our own trade and the response to various outlets in our hotel, I realized because we were so overrun with the casual dining things that we offer, that we needed more of them. I think, if anything, I think I might have underestimated with my colleagues, the amount of casual dining that we needed, compared to the other folks. They have dozens and dozens of these casual dining restaurants throughout Cotai. We had 2 or 3, but I've found out with the mass of  people, it's not enough. So we've got to increase that. And we are doing that in 2 specific locations adjacent to the casino, straightaway. Now we've got to get through the approval of the government to do the work, and we're doing the drawings, lickety split as fast as we can to get that job done. As a matter of fact, we're going to put up construction barricades and get on with it immediately. But if that's -- I guess, if you ask me, what surprise or what did I see after the place gave birth and the public came in? I was -- I immediately, and the rest of us, Ian, we all recognized we needed to up our casual dining capacities beyond what we originally thought. And it was pretty easy to do actually, because we had sort of anticipated that there would be something that we wanted to add or change after opening, which is why I left those spaces available for it. And now we're going to take advantage of it, based upon what we learned since August 22. It's pretty much the same thing as we thought before."

In terms of the implications to local policy and to a certain extent, visa policies, I think that you have to look at the arc of all aspects of the central government behavior or actions and take that into account with the local government's reaction and their independent actions. Because if you're in Beijing, they'll tell you that the SAR is autonomous, that it's self-governing. And that although they pay close attention and want to support it, that they look to the government of Macau to run Macau. And we have this interaction with them on a regular basis. Usually, it's on detailed stuff like trying to fix the roads and things like that, so we're with different parts of the government. In my conversations with the top level of the Macau government, they definitely want to protect the job security of the people that are engaged, the Macau citizens and everybody else, that are engaged in working at these places. There's a strong preference for protecting the employee base of the industry. When issues that affect them, meaning the employees and the local employees in particular, come up, the government is particularly responsive and on point. When we get to more subtle things that have to do, for example, with smoking, then the matter -- the speed of decision slows down. This conversation about smoking with Secretary Tam,  and even with the Chief Executive Officer and Secretary Leon [ph] has been more protracted. There's competing interests here: the health and safety of the employees, the strong preference of the customers to have the freedom to smoke; it's very popular in China, still. And then there's this whole thing about trying to make people healthier even if it kills them to do so. So when you get to areas like this, that are certainly relevant to our -- right now, the smoking -- I'm using this example, the smoking policy is mixed. Some places' been grandfathered in, other places have tried to take advantage of the interim policy allowing smoking in lounges but yet, the final approval of those smoking lounges has been delayed and nobody is sure whether there's going to be a complete ban on smoking regardless of any condition within the buildings or whether they'll be a mitigated or ameliorated compromised position. So when you talk about the policies of the government since the Premier's visit, you really have to separate the general support that mainland China and Beijing gives the SAR from the intricacies and the more granular aspects of the things that we're interested in, that may seem mundane in comparison but are not. You get my drift on this? It's not a simple answer to your question. God lives in the details on this one. How did I do? I mean, is there -- you might have a follow-up on that. It's a tough question that you asked me."

I think Xi Jinping and the central government have a lot of problems to deal with, a lot of decisions. The liaison office is closely monitoring everything that happens in Macau. They were at our opening. They're very supportive, friendly and warm in every respect, but again, there's this sort of unusual relationship between the announced autonomy of the SAR and the sensitivity of the SAR to the general policies of mainland China. So -- and it's very hard for us to understand sometimes what everybody is thinking. It's not a bad thing in any way, but it makes answering your particular question a little tricky."
