Yesterday afternoon we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include yesterday's press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Our CFO, Don Chappel is available to respond to questions. And also, we have the 5 leaders of Williams operating areas with us. Walter Bennett leads the West; John Dearborn leads NGL & Petchem Services; Rory Miller leads Atlantic Gulf; Bob Purgason leads Access Midstream; and Jim Scheel leads Northeast G&P. 
In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles. These reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. 
Over the past many months we've taken many questions related to the merger between Williams and Energy Transfer. The focus of our call today is our fourth quarter results and business outlook. So we're not going to take questions on the pending merger or other related matters. However, before we discuss our fourth quarter and year-end 2015 results, I can provide a brief update on the transaction. 
Williams Board of Directors is unanimously committed to completing the transaction with Energy Transfer Equity per the merger agreement executed on September 28, 2015 as expeditiously as possible and delivering the benefits of the transaction to Williams stockholders. Completion of the pending transaction remains subject to the approval of Williams stockholders and other customary closing conditions. Integration planning is underway. As previously discussed, in Energy Transfer Corp. registration statement on S-4 filed November 24, 2015 with the SEC, ETE and Williams received a request for additional information and material from the FTC pursuant to the HSR Act review. On February 1, 2016, Energy Transfer Corporation received additional comments from the SEC related to the First Amendment of the S-4. Certain requests made by the SEC relate to information that will be included in ETE and Williams' 10-Ks, which the company's expected filed the final week of February 2016, so next week. Therefore, the company is now expect to file a second amended of the S-4 shortly after filing those 10-Ks. 
With that update, I want to reiterate that we won't be taking questions regarding the pending merger or other related matters. As always, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team for questions you may have. Thank you all in advance for your cooperation. And with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong."

This is going to be a fairly brief presentation, but we do want to -- we'll take a look at the fourth quarter results and also, drivers for the full year to offer our perspective this mor",4370,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. This is going to be a fairly brief presentation, but we do want to -- we'll take a look at the fourth quarter results and also, drivers for the full year to offer our perspective this morning on one of our very important customers, Chesapeake, and a lot of concerns has been raised there, and we look at upcoming drivers that will drive 2016 along with our 2016 capital plan and then finally, some thoughts on the strength of our strategy in this difficult commodity price environment. We're very pleased with the way our business is holding up and as well the kind of opportunities that continue to come at us in our effort to continue to connect these low-priced natural gas supplies into growing demand markets. 
So with that, let's look on slide 2 here. We recorded another strong quarter demonstrating our continued project execution, reliable operating performance and the resilience of our business to grow despite sharply lower commodity prices and what turned out to be a very mild start to the winter here in the fourth quarter. Even with the reduced producer activities and the supplier areas, we enjoyed continued growth in fee-based revenues primarily from demand-driven projects and expansions that were brought into service during the year. Our continued focus on a clear strategy, project execution and cost management are evident in our results and very importantly, despite the pressures impacting the industry, we once again saw the dramatic growth in our fee-based revenues offset the impact of continued lower commodity prices. In fact, our adjusted EBITDA was up 25% over 4Q '14. Our full year adjusted EBITDA was up over $0.26 despite very low NGL and olefins margins. In fact, I think in present status, across all of our systems, just on our gas gathering volumes, we were up off a very big number in terms of our total gathering volumes. We were up 6% on total gathered volumes for the year despite the lower producer activities in a lot of very significant curtailments that continue to exist. 
Looking directly at the fourth quarter. The WPZ DCF of $718 million produced a coverage ratio of 0.99, and of course, this is before we would include -- if you are doing include substantial impact of the $209 million IDR waiver, this would lift our coverage up to 1.39, and of course, this is not insignificant and certainly provides support for funding our 2016 growth capital program. 
Highlights for the fourth quarter of '15 to the fourth quarter of '14 comparison. I'll just give you the highlights here. First of all, fee-based revenues were up $139 million or 12% and that was driven primarily by Atlantic Gulf with a lot of fee-based assets that came online during the year and as well as growth of access. Our olefins margins were up $43 million to $71 million and this was strong operating performance that our guys were planned with low per unit margins due to low olefins prices. So very good results on the operating side at guys who were and actually across all of our NGL & Petchem Services for the quarter, but relatively low olefins margins there in the fourth quarter. The proportion EBITDA of equity method investments were up $37 million or 22% and most of that was coming off of our discovery asset where the Keathley Canyon connector continues to perform very well, but it was a little bit of maintenance during the period, but those volumes remain very strong out there on that system. NGL margins were down $45 million or 52% and NGL prices now, in the fourth quarter, were 13 year low and the full year 2015 NGL margin was only $160 million, which represents less than 4% of our consolidated EBITDA during 2015. 
So -- and I did want to make a note here on the impairments. We took some very large impairments in the fourth quarter and these were largely the result of dramatic decline in the market value of WPZ and some tests required there up against the full market value. And in the fourth quarter -- so that was -- the value of WPZ in the fourth quarter and then the implied market values of the investment and associated goodwill. So looking at the total market value of WPZ, up against the implied market values of our investments and associated goodwill. Of course, as you'll recall, the impaired equity method investments and certain of the impaired goodwill relate primarily to the acquisition of Access Midstream Partners, which we required to book a significant $2.5 billion gain in 2014 and this reflected a purchase price allocation to these assets in 2014. So as you'll recall, we had a big gain in '14 associated with that acquisition and a lot of that goodwill then was taken out with this new test against that market value. 
And so now just a few thoughts on the results by segment. Atlantic Gulf had another great quarter, up $122 million all on fee-based revenues. And so very impressive growth continued there in Atlantic Gulf. And for the year, for the full year, Atlantic Gulf was actually up $453 million and a lot of this is coming off of projects like Gulfstar 1 as well as the Transco expansion projects and again, the Keathley Canyon connector on the discovery system. So tremendous growth there and our fee-based revenues. This was offset a little bit by lower NGL margins. Of course, but overall, really very impressive performance. You might have noticed as well the Atlantic Gulf had a little bit of higher cost in the fourth quarter and most of this was just related to -- we had some repairs on the Leidy line as well as some additional testing required by the regulators there. And so we continue to work on the Leidy line there where we had ruptured on that line earlier in the year and so a lot of continued work there that shows up in our O&M expense. 
On the Access [indiscernible] Central '08 [ph]. We reported fourth quarter of '15 adjusted EBITDA of 3 51 and that was compared to 3 25, and a lot of this was just driven by continued growth in the business, but we did as well have an increased ownership interest in the Utica East Ohio Midstream joint venture that helps drive some of that as well. The Northeast G&P, flat fourth quarter to '15 to fourth quarter of '14, but a 30% growth year-over-year. So we were at, in 2014 full year, was 2 76 and we were up $80 million to 3 56 there in -- here in 2015 for the full year. So really driven by continued increased service fees at Ohio Valley Midstream, higher overall volumes, and those were offset by some higher operating expenses, including some line repairs that were required earlier in the year as well there. 
Really important note here. We did sign a new gathering agreement with an existing customer during here very recently, and we're really excited about this. That's going -- we do -- it does produce a lower rate for the customer, but we've got some incremental volumes that are coming on associated with that agreement as well as some much larger acreage dedication that came with that. So really excited about this new agreement and we're not counting on any new drilling anticipated here for 2016 on that and with -- even without that new drilling, we expect our revenues to be held flat for 2016 despite the lower rate just because there are some new volumes that come to us as a result of the transaction and some new wells or some new productions being tied in. So a lot of similar story in the Northeast where we continue to tie in production that's already been drilled. We're really not relying in the Northeast. We're really not relying on new drilling rigs out there. Really just relying on tieing in continued tight end of production, but the real key for us there will be when we start to see some of the takeaway projects take hold because that clearly is the constraint out here. It's not a matter of rigs running in the area. It's simply a matter of seeing some of this big bottlenecks open up and then us tieing in a lot of this already completed production and seeing that flow force. 
In the fourth quarter -- sorry, on the NGL & Petchem side, really great operating results for NGL and Petchem, from an operating standpoint, but we did have lower unit margins during the period. So really pretty good operating stent, both in Canada and guys were in terms of volumes, but again, very low unit margins. For the year, just to remind you there for the year, we were $216 million lower, but this was due to the lack of the insurance proceeds and about $89 million lower commodity margins. So big step down, but again most of that was just due to the loss of some assumed business interruption proceeds that we booked in 2014. 
In the West, great continued focus on cost management in the area. We were off about $15 million versus fourth quarter of '14 and that was really driven by $27 million lower NGL margins during -- as compared to the fourth quarter of '14. And again, I'll remind you, our NGL margins are now at a 13-year low. But really proud of the team out there and their continued focus on cost management and able to continue to generate very significant EBITDA despite low prices. 
Moving on to Slide 3. This is a really important slide here. We wanted to show you, certainly, had a lot of questions about Chesapeake and our relationship and a lot of focus by investors on the credit risk related to Chesapeake. And so we really just want to take this opportunity to walk everyone through some facts and some of our perspective as a midstream service provider that plays a critical role in getting the natural gas production from the wellhead to marketable condition and location. So first, I note that we have a very strong relationship with Chesapeake. We appreciate them as a great operator and the nations very best shale resources. They have some of the very best acreage and large contiguous blocks, and we are very pleased to have the opportunity to serve them as a key customer and one of the best large-scale operators from our perspective. So I tell you, we are constantly impressed with the way this team continue to be able to lower their cost and work out accretive solutions with us and other parties and really thankful for the relationship. They are paying their bills in a timely manner as usual and including, we just recently got paid for the minimum volume commitment related to the Haynesville and we fully expect them to pay the NBC invoice on the Barnett when it's due. It's not do yet, but we're excited about continue to work with them on that and fully expect that to come through as well just as they paid the Haynesville on time. So from our view, they continue to reduce their costs and operate efficiently and effectively to maintain liquidity. And nevertheless, though, we are mindful of the credit risk that these continued low prices pose for many producers including Chesapeake. 
And so here's how we think about the risks. First of all, we have long-term dedications with strong contextual advances of interest in on produced gas. We like our argument that we hold the current real estate interest in non-produce gas and that our rights are covenant running with the land not subject to the rejection and bankruptcy. We certainly are following current bankruptcy cases like Sabine where the general question is that issue. But people should understand that the ultimate outcome in individual cases will turn on specific facts and circumstances. Regardless, even if the court were to rule, we don't have such legal rights. Our gathering lines are physically connected to Chesapeake's wellheads and pads and we provide very critical service conditioning and connecting Chesapeake's production to points where they can then choose the best markets for long-haul transportation alternatives. In exchange for the dedication of production, we invested capital to build gathering lines that are uniquely positioned to serve Chesapeake's wells. So all these systems were built out specifically for their needs and generally, at their direction as and to the size and scale that they needed to be able to produce volumes on a projected basis. In most cases, there are not other gathering lines nearby because these are big contiguous areas and any systems were built specifically for their production. And in many cases, our pipelines have been built on populated places such as beneath the city of Fort Worth and it would be very costly for others to replicate our gathering lines. And the rates of return that we generate from these investments and assets are very typical for a midstream provider. Likewise, our gathering lines have been in place for some time and thus, the reserves behind them are now partially produced. To continue to produce such gas, Chesapeake and its creditors have, if it ever came to that, would want and need to utilize our gathering lines to deliver gas to the market. So such gathering lines are just very distinguishable from long-haul transportation service because the intra and interstate pipelines initiate service after the gas is already pulled at marketable points. Producers then have many options to receive cash for their products other than transportation on any one particular interstate pipeline. If it did come to a bankruptcy, a producer can argue that it can reject certain types of contracts and we believe gathering contracts such as ours are not the type of contract that would be reject. However, but even if a gathering contract were allowed to be rejected, a producer and its creditors will continue to need the gathering service to be able to produce gas and create revenue. If a producer rejects the gathering contract and the bankruptcy, the gatherer will no longer be obligated to provide the gathering service. Furthermore, rejection of a contract is all or nothing. Therefore, the analysis of the risk of any producers bankruptcy is best analyzed contract by contract and really understanding the particulars of the services being provided and how unique those services are that are being provided. As any prudent midstream service provider would do, we have studied each of our Chesapeake contracts and conserved the relative Chesapeake's results, our physical connection to their wells and their alternative options for delivering gas to market and we believe that we understand much better than anyone the real value of our assets, if it ever came to a bankruptcy process. But let me be very clear on this matter. We have great confidence in Chesapeake, in their assets and more importantly, in their tremendous operating capabilities and management team. Thus far, they have continued to do all the right things in very difficult circumstances, and we look forward to helping them be very successful for years and years to come and we have great confidence in their ability to do that. We will continue to find win-win solutions that align our interests and to support them where we can in their asset sales. And as you can see on the table on this slide, Williams scope and scale of gathering in all of the key natural gas basis is significant. And there are a significant non-Chesapeake working interest in basins as well that also give us confidence in the continued cash flows from these assets. So overall, we just tell you, we are very proud of our relationship with Chesapeake and we're very impressed with them and we also don't have our head in the sand, and we are looking very closely to these alternatives and we feel very strong about our position if it ever were to come to a bankruptcy. 
Moving on to Slide 4. This is just an overview here of some of the recent developments and what we see coming soon. First of all, I want to reiterate that the demand side of the natural gas market is really driving our capital investment. And you can just see that as you look at some of these projects. The Transco Leidy expansion just came in and that first part of that started up in the -- on December 8th and then we continue to bring segments on -- in-service through the month of December and now, here in January where we are fully completed with all segments and service now for the Leidy Southeast expansion. Great work by the team under some difficult circumstances, but really great performance by the team that managed that project. The Transco Gulf trace project, this is a project to serve the Cheniere's Sabine pass LNG facility construction is underway with a target in-service of first quarter 2017. We just tell you, it's nice to be able to be doing construction and more friendly environments like Louisiana in teams have done a great job of bringing that project on board as well. The Transco Gulf Connector project, which is a new long-term contract we just announced for 475 million a day of new expansion service that will also serve Cheniere's Corpus Christi and LNG facilities, that would be in 2019. 
And then just a note here quickly on the Marcellus and Utica volumes. The real story going on in the Marcellus and Utica is that we are seeing both growth in available productions. So what do we mean by available production? We mean the production if there was markets available that could actually be flowing, we continue to see that grow behind our systems and we also saw significant price related to [indiscernible] in the quarter. So this bottleneck, if you will, continues to grow in size with available production growing up behind very constrained outlet and low regional -- lower-than-usual regional demands in the areas. But I think it's important to know that we now have over 33% of the gathered volumes in the area and this really leaves us with great exposure once the bottlenecks are clear. And I think what's really important to note there is that we are not relying on drilling capital for those volumes. All we need is some of those bottlenecks to open up and we'll have volumes flowing without the need for a lot of additional drilling capital. And so this is very different in most areas of the country where there's a lot of concerns about producers not having the capital to drill. In this area, it's just a matter of the infrastructure being built out in front of it. 
And finally, our plant, really proud of the way the team operated the plant and we exceeded our production expectations for the quarter there and are off to a good start here in 1Q of '15 as well there -- sorry, 1Q of '16 as well. 
Just looking forward, some things are going to driver us looking forward. The Canadian Off Gas Processing business. The Horizon project that you've heard us talk about quite a bit. That plan is now the Fort McMurray plant. So that's the plant that actually extracts the liquids out of the offgas is now rolling and has begun extracting liquids, but that will be a process here over the next 3 weeks or so to get that up to full production. And then finally, we've got to some remaining work at Red Water to be able to fractionate all those liquids and we expect that to be coming on in March. So a lot of new revenues that will show up there on WPZ as those volumes hit both the pipeline and the Red Water fractionator. And then I'll remind you that the margin side of that business is left at WMD at the Horizon facility upstream. As well, our Kodiak tieback, this is a tieback to our Devils Tower platform and that project is being brought online and has been in the testing phase here for the last couple of weeks and is just about to begin and really have some very significant cash flow here in the first quarter. And then the Gunflint tieback, which we expect to come on now in the second quarter, which will be our first big tieback to the Gulfstar 1 project and this will also be contributing very substantial cash flow growth with very minimal additional capital investment on our part. We do expect the GulfStar production to be a little bit higher in the first quarter than we saw in the fourth quarter due to some well workover work that was going on out there. And so we're excited to see some of the benefits of that work that will start to improve things here in the first quarter and beyond. 
Last year, we announced plans to increase the capacity on our Eastern Interstate Pipelines from 10.8 BcF to more than 17 Bcf per day by the end of 2017. And in fact, by 2017, we expect to double the capacity of the transco system from its 2010 level. So once again, these projects just keep coming and we've got great transparency into our predictable growth and it provides clear evidence that Williams has a truly unique position in terms of our asset footprint, especially in challenging market times. Our backlog of projects remains robust and the demand side project just keep coming at us with amazing pace and consistency and in particular, along the transco system. These are fully contracted demand pool projects and we will continue to high grade these opportunities as we balance constrained funding sources up against continued robust backlog. So our issue is not a matter of backlog. We have plenty of great investment opportunities. Really a matter of getting lower -- better funding sources and low cost funding sources to supply all these opportunity. So we're in an envious position of having plenty of opportunity and again, just a matter of getting those funded appropriately. 
Moving on to Slide 5. So as we said before, much of the attention in the industry is focused on producers and shut-ins and commodity prices, but we remain focused on serving and capturing the growing demand for natural gas. This focus is especially important in the Northeast where we're working to unlock the tremendous value of the Marcellus and Utica areas by providing market access via the Constitution and Atlantic Gulf projects. Our strategy remains intact and the underlying fundamentals of our business are strong despite reduced producer activities in the supply areas appear. And just a few weeks ago, we announced our revived business plan to address the realities of our current market environment while continuing to invest in our business. In addition to significantly lower operating expenses in 2016, the revised 2016 plan includes growth capital funding needs of around $2.1 billion, which is about $1 billion or 32% less than our previous plans. The plan includes $1.3 billion of transco expansions and other interstate pipeline projects and the non-interstate pipelines growth that's embedded here totals about $700 million and this is primarily reflecting additional investments across our gathering and processing systems where capital spending for gathering and processing in 2016 will be limited to really new producer volumes, including mostly wells that are already drilled and completed but they're waiting connecting infrastructure. So as I said earlier, really not depending on a whole lot of drilling here in 2016. We're really just focused on connecting and getting volumes that are already connected flowing. 
Moving on to Slide 6 here. Just to close out, first of all, the fourth quarter results certainly demonstrate the resilience of our fee-based assets, approximately 93% of PZ's gross margin were from fee-based revenues. The continued growth in Atlantic Gulf segment continue to be driven by great expansions on our Transco system as well as our Deepwater volumes and sequential growth in the Marcellus and Utica volumes really was impressive. In fact, total operated volumes in this key region were up 8% as you compare the fourth quarter to the third quarter, while the total volumes in the regions, so not just ours, but looking at the total industry production, actually declined a little less than 1%. So, again, total region declined a little less than 1%, but our volumes were up -- actually up by 8%. So really, continued to grow our market share in this very important region. 
Our 2016 WPZ business plan really address the realities of our current market environment and continues our investments in growing the demand side of our business and you certainly -- we continue to high grade our opportunities and a lot of that capital is going towards really important demand-driven infrastructure projects that serve long-term natural gas needs of local distribution companies, electric power generations, LNG and industrial sources. So just to reiterate, this quarter's results and our continued strong backlog of projects are a direct reflection of our strategy to uniquely position Williams to connect the best natural gas supplies to the best markets regardless of significant market swings and cycles. 
And so as we move to questions, I'd like to highlight what John mentioned in the opening. The Williams Board of Directors is unanimously committed to completing the transaction with Energy Transfer for the merger agreement executed on September 28, 2015 and delivering the benefits of the transaction to Williams stockholder. Beyond that though, we're only discussing our fourth quarter and year-end results and we ask that you keep your questions focused on our results. We will not take questions related to the pending transaction between Williams and DCE or related matters. And we thank you in advance for your cooperation for that request. And so now, operator, let's please move on to questions."

So we actually have seen some people taking advantage. We've seen some of these cold-weather surges. But you have to really remember about the demand in the Northeast there is it's driven by 2 things. First of all, its capacity to get out of the region, and that's pretty fixed. In other words, those pipelines are completely full getting out of the region. And so that doesn't move a whole lot. But what does move is any regional demand based on whether loads in the area where gas is consumed in the region. And so that will be driven by cold-weather, which we've seen a little bit here in the first quarter or it'll be driven by very hot whether in the summertime. And those are the 2 things that will drive the variable until some of these projects, new projects, come online, that will be what drives the volume in the Northeast. There's plenty of gas ready to meet that demand as it opens up."

The -- as to the contracts and any negotiations, that was a situation where the rate from a legacy cost of service contract was so high that there was no way the reserves in the area would ever be produced. And so it was a matter of rate being even in excess for the price of gas. And so this was a matter of actually getting the gas flowing and assuring ourselves that gas would continue to flow in exchange for some additional volumes and additional dedication in the area. So wherever we have opportunities like that that we can bring increment to our gas market -- sorry, our cash flows as we look on a long-term basis, we certainly will take advantage. And there are plenty of win-win opportunities out there to increase our cash flows to get gas flowing that's not flowing today. Obviously, we have to be cognizant of the fact, as I mentioned earlier, that there's only so much gas that's going to get out of the region.

And so on the ethylene side, we think that's going to be favorable to margins during the second quarter, but then as we look at the ethylene industry overall, in North America, this past year, we set an all-time new record for ethylene production. And of course, our ability to export ethylene and ethylene derivatives is somewhat yet limited by begging internally, particularly, in the polyethylene case. So we would expect that the second half of the year on ethylene reverts back to margins more akin to what we're experiencing today. On the propylene side, likewise, propylene refinery turnarounds are happening right around now. They get those done in expectation of gasoline productions for the summer season basically. And so we kind of -- we have a rather stable outlook on propylene at the moment through the rest of the year."

And because these assets are built uniquely for these reserves, the ability to duplicate these assets would be, from our vantage point anyway and most of these cases just will not be feasible to duplicate these facilities in this very heavily, but taking places like the Barnett very heavily populated and very expensive to build, especially when you've got less reserves then you started with to build the assets in the first place. So anyway, it could come down to negotiation if there was value to be shared between the parties and a better contract. But our point is just that there isn't any ability to just separate if somebody accepts the contract, they accept the contract in its whole. And if they reject, they take the risk of not being able to get the product moved out of the basin."

Over the past many months, we've taken many questions related to the merger between Williams and Energy Transfer. The focus of our call today is our fourth quarter results and business outlook, so we're not going to take questions on the pending merger or other related matters. However, before we discuss our fourth quarter and year-end 2015 results, I can provide a brief update on the transaction. 
Williams' Board of Directors has unanimously committed to completing the transaction with Energy Transfer Equity, per the merger agreement executed on September 28, 2015, as expeditiously as possible and delivering the benefits of the transaction to Williams' stockholders. Completion of the pending transaction remains subject to the approval of Williams' stockholders and other customary closing conditions. Integration planning is underway. As previously discussed, in Energy Transfer Corp. registration statement on S-4 filed November 24, 2015, with the SEC, ETE and Williams received a request for additional information and material from the FTC pursuant to the HSR Act review. On February 1, 2016, Energy Transfer Corporation received additional comments from the SEC related to the first amendment of the S-4. Certain requests made by the SEC relate to information that will be included in ETE and Williams' 10-Ks, which the companies expect to file the final week of February 2016, so next week. Therefore, the companies now expect to file a second amendment of the S-4 shortly after filing those 10-Ks. 
With that update, I want to reiterate that we won't be taking questions regarding the pending merger or other related matters. As always, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team for questions you may have. Thank you all in advance for your cooperation. And with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong."

This is going to be a fairly brief presentation, but we do want to -- we will take a look at the fourth quarter results and also drivers for the full year. We'll offer our perspective this morning on one of our very important customers, Chesapeake, and a lot of concerns have been raised there. And we'll look at upcoming drivers that will drive 2016 along with our 2016 capital plan, and then finally, some thoughts on the strength of our strategy in this difficult commodity price environment. We're very pleased with the way our business is holding up and as well the kind of opportunities that continue to come at us in our effort to continue to connect these low-priced natural gas supplies into growing demand markets. 
So with that, let's look on Slide 2 here. We recorded another strong quarter, demonstrating our continued project execution, reliable operating performance and the resilience of our business to grow despite sharply lower commodity prices and what turned out to be a very mild start to the winter here in the fourth quarter. Even with the reduced producer activities and the supplier areas, we enjoyed continued growth in fee-based revenues, primarily from demand-driven projects and expansions that were brought into service during the year. Our continued focus on a clear strategy, project execution and cost management are evident in our results, and very importantly, despite the pressures impacting the industry, we once again saw the dramatic growth in our fee-based revenues offset the impact of continued lower commodity prices. In fact, our adjusted EBITDA was up 25% over 4Q '14. Our full year adjusted EBITDA was up over 26% despite very low NGL and olefins margins. In fact, I think in present status, across all of our systems, just on our gas gathered volumes, we were up off a very big number in terms of our total gathered volumes. We were up 6% on total gathered volumes for the year despite the lower producers' activities and a lot of very significant curtailments that continue to exist. 
Looking directly at the fourth quarter. The WPZ DCF of $718 million produced a coverage ratio of 0.99x, and of course, this is before we would -- if you were to include the substantial impact of the $209 million IDR waiver, this would lift our coverage up to 1.39x, and of course, this is not insignificant and certainly provides support for funding our 2016 growth capital program.
Highlights for the fourth quarter of '15 to the fourth quarter of '14 comparison. I'll just give you the highlights here. First of all, fee-based revenues were up $139 million or 12%, and that was driven primarily by Atlantic Gulf, with a lot of fee-based assets that came online during the year and as well as growth of Access. Our olefins margins were up $43 million to $71 million, and this strong operating performance at our Geismar plant, with low per-unit margins due to low olefins prices. So great results on the operating side at Geismar and actually across all of our NGL & Petchem Services for the quarter, but relatively low olefins margins there in the fourth quarter. The proportional EBITDA of equity method investments were up $37 million or 22%, and most of that was coming off of our discovery asset where the Keathley Canyon Connector continues to perform very well, but there was a little bit of maintenance during the period, but those volumes remain very strong out there on that system. NGL margins were down $45 million or 52%, and NGL prices now, in the fourth quarter, were at 13-year low and the full year 2015 NGL margin was only $160 million, which represents less than 4% of our consolidated EBITDA during 2015. 
So -- and I did want to make a note here on the impairments. We took some very large impairments in the fourth quarter, and these will largely result to dramatic decline in the market value of WPZ and some tests required there up against the full market value. And in the fourth quarter -- so that was -- the value of WPZ in the fourth quarter and then the implied market values of the investments and associated goodwill. So looking at the total market value of WPZ, up against the implied market values of our investments and associated goodwill. Of course, as you'll recall, the impaired equity method investments and certain of the impaired goodwill relate primarily to the acquisition of Access Midstream Partners, which we required to book a significant $2.5 billion gain in 2014, and this reflected a purchase price allocation to these assets in 2014. So as you'll recall, we had a big gain in '14 associated with that acquisition and a lot of that goodwill then was taken out with this new test against the market value. 
And so now just a few thoughts on the results by segment. Atlantic Gulf had another great quarter, up $122 million, all on fee-based revenues. And so very a impressive growth continued there in the Atlantic Gulf. And for the year, for the full year, Atlantic Gulf was actually up $453 million, and a lot of this is coming off of projects like Gulfstar One as well as the Transco expansion projects and again, the Keathley Canyon Connector on our Discovery system, so tremendous growth there and our fee-based revenues. This was offset a little bit by lower NGL margins, of course, but overall, really very impressive performance. You might have noticed as well at the Atlantic Gulf,  we had a little bit of higher cost in the fourth quarter, and most of this was just related to -- we had some repairs on the Leidy Line as well as some additional testing required by the regulators there. And so we continue to work on the Leidy Line there where we had a rupture on that line earlier in the year and so a lot of continued work there that shows up in our O&M expense. 
On the Access, where Central -- or what will now be the Central Low A, we reported fourth quarter '15 adjusted EBITDA of $351 million and that was compared to $325 million, and a lot of this was just driven by continued growth in the business, but we did as well have an increased ownership interest in the Utica East Ohio Midstream joint venture that helps drive some of that as well. The Northeast G&P, flat fourth quarter to '15 to fourth quarter of '14, but a 30% growth year-over-year. So we were at -- in 2014 full year, was $276 million and we were up $80 million to $356 million there in -- here in 2015 and for the full year. So really driven by continued increased service fees at Ohio Valley Midstream, higher overall volumes, and those were offset by some higher operating expenses, including some line repairs that were required earlier in the year as well there. 
Really important note here. We did sign a new gathering agreement with an existing customer during -- here very recently, and we're really excited about this. That's going -- we do -- that does produce a lower rate for the customer, but we've got some incremental volumes that are coming on associated with that agreement as well as some much larger acreage dedications that came with that. So really excited about this new agreement. And we're not counting on any new drilling anticipated here for 2016 on that and with -- even without that new drilling, we expect our revenues to be held flat for 2016 despite the lower rate just because there are some new volumes that come to us as a result of the transaction and some new wells or some new productions being tied in. So a lot of similar story in the Northeast where we continue to tie in production that's already been drilled. We're really not relying in the Northeast. We're really not relying on new drilling rigs out there. Really just relying on tieing in, continued tie-in of production, but the real key for us there will be when we start to see some of the takeaway projects take hold because that clearly is the constraint out here. It's not a matter of rigs running in the area. It's simply a matter of seeing some of these big bottlenecks open up and then us tieing in a lot of this already completed production and seeing that flow force. 
In the fourth quarter -- sorry, on the NGL & Petchem side, really great operating results for NGL & Petchem, from an operating standpoint, but we did have lower unit margins during the period. So really pretty good operating stent, both in Canada and Geismar in terms of volumes, but again, very low unit margins. For the year, just to remind you there, for the year, we were $216 million lower, but this was due to the lack of the insurance proceeds and about $89 million lower commodity margins. So big step down, but again, most of that was just due to the loss of some assumed business interruption proceeds that we booked in 2014. 
In the West, great continued focus on cost management in the area. We were off about $15 million versus fourth quarter of '14, and that was really driven by $27 million lower NGL margins during -- as compared to the fourth quarter of '14. And again, I'll remind you, those NGL margins are now at a 13-year low. But really proud of the team out there and their continued focus on cost management and able to continue to generate very significant EBITDA despite low prices. 
Moving on to Slide 3. This is a really important slide here. We wanted to show you -- you certainly have a lot of questions about Chesapeake and our relationship and a lot of focus by investors on the credit risk related to Chesapeake. And so we really just want to take this opportunity to walk everyone through some facts and some of our perspective as a midstream service provider that plays a critical role in getting the natural gas production from the wellhead to marketable condition and location. So first, I note that we have a very strong relationship with Chesapeake. We appreciate them as a great operator in the nation's very best shale resources. They have some of the very best acreage and large contiguous blocks, and we are very pleased to have the opportunity to serve them as a key customer and one of the best large-scale operators from our perspective. So I tell you, we are constantly impressed with the way this team continue to be able to lower their cost and work out creative solutions with us and other parties and really, thankful for the relationship. They are paying their bills in a timely manner, as usual, and including -- we just recently got paid for the minimum volume commitment related to the Haynesville, and we fully expect them to pay the MVC invoice on the Barnett when it's due. It's not due yet, but we're excited about -- to continue to work with them on that and fully expect that to come through as well just as they paid the Haynesville on time. So from our view, they continue to reduce their costs and operate efficiently and effectively to maintain liquidity. And nevertheless, though, we are mindful of the credit risk that these continued low prices pose for many producers including Chesapeake. 
And so here's how we think about the risks. First of all, we have long-term dedications with strong contractual conveyances of interest in unproduced gas. We like our argument that we hold the current real estate interest in unproduced gas and that our rights or covenants running with the land not subject to the rejection and bankruptcy. We certainly are following current bankruptcy cases like Sabine, where the general question is that issue. But people should understand that the ultimate outcome in individual cases will turn on specific facts and circumstances. Regardless, even if the court were to rule, we don't have such legal rights. Our gathering lines are physically connected to Chesapeake's wellheads and pads, and we provide very critical service conditioning and connecting Chesapeake's production to points where they can then choose the best markets for long-haul transportation alternatives. In exchange for the dedication of production, we invested capital to build gathering lines that are uniquely positioned to serve Chesapeake's wells. So all these systems were built out specifically for their needs and generally, at their direction as -- and to the size and scale that they needed to be able to produce volumes on a projected basis. In most cases, there are not other gathering lines nearby because these are big contiguous areas and these systems were built specifically for their production. And in many cases, our pipelines have been built on populated places such as beneath the city of Fort Worth and it would be very costly for others to replicate our gathering lines. And the rates of return that we generate from these investments and assets are very typical for a midstream provider. Likewise, our gathering lines have been in place for some time and thus, the reserves behind them are now partially produced. To continue to produce such gas, Chesapeake and its creditors have, if it ever came to that, would want -- and need to utilize our gathering lines to deliver gas to the markets. So such gathering lines are just very distinguishable from long-haul transportation service because the intra and interstate pipeline initiate service after the gas is already pulled at marketable points. Producers then have many options to receive cash for their products other than transportation on any one particular interstate pipeline. If it did come to a bankruptcy, a producer can argue that it can reject certain types of contracts, and we believe gathering contracts such as ours are not the type of contract that would be reject. However, but even if a gathering contract were allowed to be rejected, a producer and its creditors will continue to need the gathering service to be able to produce gas and create revenue. If a producer rejects the gathering contract and the bankruptcy, the gatherer will no longer be obligated to provide the gathering service. Furthermore, rejection of a contract is all or nothing. Therefore, the analysis of the risk of any producer's bankruptcy is best analyzed contract-by-contract and really understanding the particulars of the services being provided and how unique those services are that are being provided. As any prudent midstream service provider would do, we have studied each of our Chesapeake contracts and conserved the value of Chesapeake's reserves, our physical connection to their wells and their alternative options for delivering gas to market, and we believe that we understand much better than anyone the real value of our assets, if it ever came to a bankruptcy process. But let me be very clear on this matter. We have great confidence in Chesapeake, in their assets, and more importantly, in their tremendous operating capabilities and management team. Thus far, they have continued to do all the right things in very difficult circumstances, and we look forward to helping them be very successful for years and years to come, and we have great confidence in their ability to do that. We will continue to find win-win solutions that align our interests and to support them where we can in their asset sales. And as you can see in the table on this slide, Williams' scope and scale of gathering in all of the key natural gas basis is insignificant. And there are a significant non-Chesapeake working interest in basins as well that also give us confidence in the continued cash flows from these assets. So overall, let me just tell you, we are very proud of our relationship with Chesapeake, we're very impressed with them and we also don't have our head in the sand, and we are looking very closely to these alternatives and we feel very strong about our position if it ever were to come to a bankruptcy. 
Moving on to Slide 4. This is just an overview here of some of the recent developments and what we see coming soon. First of all, I want to reiterate that the demand side of the natural gas market is really driving our capital investments. And you can just see that as you look at some of these projects. The Transco Leidy expansion just came in, and that first part of that started up in the -- on December 8 and then we continue to bring segments on -- in-service through the month of December and now, here in January, where we are fully completed with all segments and service now for the Leidy Southeast expansion. Great work by the team under some difficult circumstances, but really great performance by the team that managed that project. The Transco Gulf Trace project, this is a project to serve the Cheniere's Sabine pass LNG facility, construction is underway, with a target in-service of first quarter of 2017. We just tell you, it's nice to be able to be doing construction and more friendly environments like Louisiana, and the team did a great job of bringing that project on board as well. The Transco Gulf Connector project, which is a new, long-term contract we just announced for 475 million a day of new expansion service that will also serve Cheniere's Corpus Christi and Freeport LNG facilities, that would be in 2019. 
And then, just a note here quickly on the Marcellus and Utica volumes. The real story going on in the Marcellus and Utica is that we're seeing both growth in available productions. So what do we mean by available production? We mean the production if there were markets available that could actually be flowing, we continue to see that grow behind our systems and we also saw significant price related to [indiscernible] in the quarter. So this bottleneck, if you will, continues to grow in size with available production growing up behind a very constrained outlet and low regional -- lower-than-usual regional demands in the areas. But I think it's important to know that we now have over 33% of the gathered volumes in the area, and this really leaves us with great exposure once the bottlenecks are clear. And I think what's really important to note there is that we are not relying on drilling capital for those volumes. All we need is some of those bottlenecks to open up and we'll have volumes flowing without the need for a lot of additional drilling capital. And so this is very different in most areas of the country where there's a lot of concerns about producers not having the capital to drill. In this area, it's just a matter of the infrastructure being built out in front of it. 
And then finally, our Geismar plant, really proud of the way the team operated the plant, and we exceeded our production expectations for the quarter there and are off to a good start here in 1Q of '15 as well there -- sorry, 1Q of '16 as well. 
Just looking forward some things that are going to drive us looking forward. The Canadian Offgas Processing business, the Horizon project that you've heard us talk about quite a bit. That plant is now the Fort McMurray plant. So that's the plant that actually extracts the liquids out of the Offgas is now rolling and has begun extracting liquids, but that will be a process here over the next 3 weeks or so to get that up to full production. And then finally, we've got to -- some remaining work at Redwater to be able to fractionate all those liquids and we expect that to be coming on in March. So a lot of new revenues that will show up there on WPZ as those volumes hit both the pipeline and the Redwater fractionator. And then I'll remind you that the margin side of that business is left at WMB at the Horizon facility upstream. As well, our Kodiak tieback, this is a tieback to our Devils Tower platform, and that project is being brought online and has been in the testing phase here for the last couple of weeks and is just about to begin and really have some very significant cash flow here in the first quarter. And then the Gunflint tieback, which we expect to come on now in the second quarter, which will be our first big tieback to the Gulfstar One project, and this is -- will also be contributing very substantial cash flow growth with very minimal additional capital investment on our part. We do expect the Gulfstar production to be a little bit higher in the first quarter than we saw in the fourth quarter due to some well workover work that was going on out there. And so we're excited to see some of the benefits of that work that will start to improve things here in the first quarter and beyond. 
Last year, we announced plans to increase the capacity on our Eastern Interstate Pipeline from 10.8 BcF to more than 17 Bcf per day by the end of 2017. And in fact, by 2017, we expect to double the capacity of the Transco system from its 2010 level. So once again, these projects just keep coming and we've got great transparency into our predictable growth and it provides clear evidence that Williams has a truly unique position in terms of our asset footprint, especially in challenging market times. Our backlog of projects remains robust, and the demand side project just keep coming at us with amazing pace and consistency and in particular, along the Transco system. These are fully contracted demand pool projects, and we will continue to high grade these opportunities as we balance constrained funding sources up against continued robust backlog. So our issue is not a matter of backlog. We have plenty of great investment opportunities. Really a matter of getting lower -- better funding sources and low-cost funding sources to supply all these opportunities. So we're in an envious position of having plenty of opportunity and again, just a matter of getting those funded appropriately. 
Moving on to Slide 5. So as we've said before, much of the attention in the industry is focused on producer shut-ins and commodity prices, but we remain focused on serving and capturing the growing demand for natural gas. This focus is especially important in the Northeast where we're working to unlock the tremendous value of the Marcellus and Utica areas by providing market access via the Constitution and Atlantic Gulf projects. Our strategy remains intact and the underlying fundamentals of our business are strong despite reduced producer activities in the supply areas. And just a few weeks ago, we announced our revised business plan to address the realities of our current market environment while continuing to invest in our business. In addition to significantly lower operating expenses in 2016, the revised 2016 plan includes growth capital funding needs of around $2.1 billion, which is about $1 billion or 32% less than our previous plans. The plan includes $1.3 billion for Transco expansions and other Interstate pipeline projects, and the non-Interstate pipeline growth that's embedded here totals about $700 million and this is primarily reflecting additional investments across our gathering and processing systems where capital spending for gathering and processings in 2016 will be limited to really new producer volumes, including mostly wells that are already drilled and completed but that are awaiting 9connecting infrastructure. So as I said earlier, really not depending on a whole lot of drilling here in 2016. We're really just focused on connecting and getting volumes that are already connected flowing. 
Moving on to Slide 6 here. Just to close out, first of all, the fourth quarter results certainly demonstrate the resilience of our fee-based assets, approximately 93% of PZ's gross margin were from fee-based revenues. The continued growth in Atlantic Gulf segment continue to be driven by great expansions on our Transco system as well as our deepwater volumes, and sequential growth in the Marcellus and Utica volumes really was impressive. In fact, total operated volumes in this key region were up 8% as you compare the fourth quarter to the third quarter, while the total volumes in the regions, so not just ours, but looking at the total industry production, actually declined a little less than 1%. So, again, total region declined a little less than 1%, but our volumes were up -- actually up by 8%. So really, continued to grow our market share in this very important region. 
Our 2016 WPZ business plan really did address the realities of our current market environment and continues our investments in growing the demand side of our business, and you certainly -- we continue to high grade our opportunities, and a lot of that capital is going towards really important demand-driven infrastructure projects that serve long-term natural gas needs of local distribution companies, electric power generation, LNG and industrial sources. So just to reiterate, this quarter's results and our continued strong backlog of projects are a direct reflection of our strategy to uniquely position Williams to connect the best natural gas supplies to the best markets regardless of significant market swings and cycles. 
And so as we move to questions, I'd like to highlight what John mentioned in the opening. The Williams' Board of Directors is unanimously committed to completing the transaction with Energy Transfer for the merger agreement executed on September 28, 2015, and delivering the benefits of the transaction to Williams stockholders. Beyond that though, we're only discussing our fourth quarter and year-end results and we ask that you keep your questions focused on our results. We will not take questions related to the pending transaction between Williams and ETE or related matters. And we thank you in advance for your cooperation for that request. And so now, operator, let's please move on to questions."

And so there's probably some room to optimize, if you will, and delay some of that capital until the projects are specifically coming on time. So you could see, we could see a little bit of that slip, but a lot of that is already underway and are ongoing."

So we actually have seen some people taking advantage. We've seen some of these cold-weather surges. But you have to really remember about the demand in the Northeast there, is it's driven by 2 things. First of all, its capacity to get out of the region, and that's pretty fixed. In other words, those pipelines are completely full getting out of the region. And so that doesn't move a whole lot. But what does move is any regional demand based on whether loads in the areas where gas is consumed in the region. And so that will leave, either  driven by cold weather, which we've seen a little bit here in the first quarter/or it'll be driven by very hot weather in the summertime. And those are the 2 things that will drive the variable until some of these projects, new projects, come online, that will be what drives the volume in the Northeast. There's plenty of gas ready to meet that demand as it opens up."

Are you looking at doing other of -- more of those with customers that are not Chesapeake?"

The -- as to the contracts and any negotiations, that was a situation where the rate from a legacy cost of service contract was so high that there was no way the reserves in the area would ever be produced. And so it was a matter of rate being even in excess for the price of gas. And so this was a matter of actually getting the gas flowing and assuring ourselves that gas would continue to flow in exchange for some additional volumes and additional dedication in the area. So whenever we have opportunities like that, that we can bring increment to our gas -- or, sorry, our cash flows as we look on a long-term basis, we certainly will try to take advantage. And there are plenty of win-win opportunities out there to increase our cash flows to get gas flowing that's not flowing today. Obviously, we have to be cognizant of the fact, as I mentioned earlier, that there's only so much gas that's going to get out of the region. And so we want to maximize those revenues on our system because we realized that when an Mcf starts flowing in one place, it likely means that there -- then come up a competitor system, it would come off of our own system. So we certainly are cognizant of that issue strength getting out of the basin."

So it's kind of hard to know until we see a full flow, but we're estimating right at the 1.1 Bcf.

As we take a look forward, I think it's rather well known in the industry that there's a rather large turnaround season ahead of us here in the second quarter. And so on the ethylene side, we think that's going to be favorable to margins during the second quarter, but then as we look at the ethylene industry overall, in North America, this past year, we set an all-time new record for ethylene production. And of course, our ability to export ethylene and ethylene derivatives is somewhat yet limited by begging internally, particularly, in the polyethylene case. And so we would expect that the second half of the year on ethylene reverts back to margins more akin to what we're experiencing today. On the propylene side, likewise, propylene refinery turnarounds are happening right around now. They get those done in expectation of gasoline production for the summer season basically. And so we kind of -- we have a rather stable outlook on propylene at the moment through the rest of the year."

Over the past many months, we've taken many questions related to the merger between Williams and Energy Transfer. The focus of our call today is our fourth quarter results and business outlook, so we're not going to take questions on the pending merger or other related matters. However, before we discuss our fourth quarter and year-end 2015 results, I can provide a brief update on the transaction. 
Williams' Board of Directors has unanimously committed to completing the transaction with Energy Transfer Equity, per the merger agreement executed on September 28, 2015, as expeditiously as possible and delivering the benefits of the transaction to Williams' stockholders. Completion of the pending transaction remains subject to the approval of Williams' stockholders and other customary closing conditions. Integration planning is underway. As previously discussed, in Energy Transfer Corp. registration statement on S-4 filed November 24, 2015 with the SEC, ETE and Williams received a request for additional information and material from the FTC pursuant to the HSR Act review. On February 1, 2016, Energy Transfer Corporation received additional comments from the SEC related to the first amendment of the S-4. Certain requests made by the SEC relate to information that will be included in ETE and Williams' 10-Ks, which the companies expect to file the final week of February 2016, so next week. Therefore, the companies now expect to file a second amendment of the S-4 shortly after filing those 10-Ks. 
With that update, I want to reiterate that we won't be taking questions regarding the pending merger or other related matters. As always, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team for questions you may have. Thank you all in advance for your cooperation. And with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong."

We'll offer our perspective this morning on one of our very important customers, Chesapeake, and a lot of concerns have been raised there. And we'll look at upcoming drivers that will drive 2016 along with our 2016 capital plan, and then finally, some thoughts on the strength of our strategy in this difficult commodity price environment. We're very pleased with the way our business is holding up and as well the kind of opportunities that continue to come at us in our effort to continue to connect these low-priced natural gas supplies into growing demand markets. 
So with that, let's look on Slide 2 here. We recorded another strong quarter, demonstrating our continued project execution, reliable operating performance and the resilience of our business to grow despite sharply lower commodity prices and what turned out to be a very mild start to the winter here in the fourth quarter. Even with the reduced producer activities in the supply areas, we enjoyed continued growth in fee-based revenues, primarily from demand-driven projects and expansions that were brought into service during the year. Our continued focus on a clear strategy, project execution and cost management are evident in our results, and very importantly, despite the pressures impacting the industry, we once again saw the dramatic growth in our fee-based revenues offset the impact of continued lower commodity prices. In fact, our adjusted EBITDA was up 25% over 4Q '14. And our full year adjusted EBITDA was up over 26% despite very low NGL and olefins margins. In fact, I think in present status, across all of our systems, just on our gas gathered volumes, we were up off a very big number in terms of our total gathered volumes. We were up 6% on total gathered volumes for the year despite the lower producers' activities and a lot of very significant curtailments that continued to exist. 
Looking directly at the fourth quarter. The WPZ DCF of $718 million produced a coverage ratio of 0.99x, and of course, this is before we would -- if you were to include the substantial impact of the $209 million IDR waiver, this would lift our coverage up to 1.39x, and of course, this is not insignificant and certainly provides support for funding our 2016 growth capital program.
Highlights for the fourth quarter of '15 to the fourth quarter of '14 comparison. I'll just give you the highlights here. First of all, fee-based revenues were up $139 million or 12%, and that was driven primarily by Atlantic Gulf, with a lot of fee-based assets that came online during the year and as well as growth of Access. Our olefins margins were up $43 million to $71 million, and this was strong operating performance at our Geismar plant, with low per-unit margins due to low olefins prices. So great results on the operating side at Geismar and actually across all of our NGL & Petchem Services for the quarter, but relatively low olefins margins there in the fourth quarter. The proportional EBITDA of equity method investments were up $37 million or 22%, and most of that was coming off of our discovery asset where the Keathley Canyon Connector continues to perform very well. There was a little bit of maintenance during the period, but those volumes remain very strong out there on that system. NGL margins were down $45 million or 52%, and NGL prices now, in the fourth quarter, were at 13-year low and the full year 2015 NGL margin was only $160 million, which represents less than 4% of our consolidated EBITDA during 2015. 
So -- and I did want to make a note here on the impairments. We took some very large impairments in the fourth quarter, and these were largely the result of dramatic decline in the market value of WPZ and some tests required there up against the full market value. And in the fourth quarter -- so that was -- the value of WPZ in the fourth quarter and then the implied market values of the investments and associated goodwill. So looking at the total market value of WPZ, up against the implied market values of our investments and associated goodwill. Of course, as you'll recall, the impaired equity method investments and certain of the impaired goodwill relate primarily to the acquisition of Access Midstream Partners, which we required to book a significant $2.5 billion gain in 2014, and this reflected our purchase price allocation to these assets in 2014. So as you'll recall, we had a big gain in '14 associated with that acquisition and a lot of that goodwill then was taken out with this new test against the market value. 
And so now just a few thoughts on the results by segment. Atlantic Gulf had another great quarter, up $122 million, all on fee-based revenues. And so very impressive growth continued there in the Atlantic Gulf. And for the year, for the full year, Atlantic Gulf was actually up $453 million, and a lot of this is coming off of projects like Gulfstar One as well as the Transco expansion projects and again, the Keathley Canyon Connector on our Discovery system, so tremendous growth there in our fee-based revenues. This was offset a little bit by lower NGL margins, of course, but overall, really very impressive performance. You might have noticed as well at the Atlantic Gulf,  we had a little bit of higher cost in the fourth quarter, and most of this was just related to -- we had some repairs on the Leidy Line as well as some additional testing required by the regulators there. And so we continue to work on the Leidy Line there where we had a rupture on that line earlier in the year and so a lot of continued work there that shows up in our O&M expense. 
On the Access, where Central -- what will now be the Central Low A, we reported fourth quarter '15 adjusted EBITDA of $351 million and that was compared to $325 million, and a lot of this was just driven by continued growth in the business, but we did as well have an increased ownership interest in the Utica East Ohio Midstream joint venture that helps drive some of that as well. The Northeast G&P, flat fourth quarter to '15 to fourth quarter of '14, but a 30% growth year-over-year. So we were at -- in 2014 full year, was $276 million and we were up $80 million to $356 million there in -- here in 2015 and for the full year. So really driven by continued increased service fees at Ohio Valley Midstream, higher overall volumes, and those were offset by some higher operating expenses, including some line repairs that were required earlier in the year as well there. 
Really important note here. We did sign a new gathering agreement with an existing customer during -- here very recently, and we're really excited about this. That's going -- we do -- that does produce a lower rate for the customer, but we've got some incremental volumes that are coming on associated with that agreement as well as some much larger acreage dedications that came with that. So really excited about this new agreement. And we're not counting on any new drilling anticipated here for 2016 on that and with -- even without that new drilling, we expect our revenues to be held flat for 2016 despite the lower rate just because there are some new volumes that come to us as a result of the transaction and some new wells or some new production that's being tied in. So a lot of -- similar story in the Northeast where we continue to tie in production that's already been drilled. We're really not relying in the Northeast. We're really not relying on new drilling rigs out there. Really just relying on tying in, continued tie-in of production, but the real key for us there will be when we start to see some of the takeaway projects take hold because that clearly is the constraint out here. It's not a matter of rigs running in the area. It's simply a matter of seeing some of these big bottlenecks open up and then us tying in a lot of this already completed production and seeing that flow force. 
In the fourth quarter -- sorry, on the NGL & Petchem side, really great operating results for NGL & Petchem, from an operating standpoint, but we did have lower unit margins during the period. So really pretty good operating stent, both in Canada and Geismar in terms of volumes, but again, very low unit margins. For the year, just to remind you there, for the year, we were $216 million lower, but this was due to the lack of the insurance proceeds and about $89 million lower commodity margins. So big step down, but again, most of that was just due to the loss of some assumed business interruption proceeds that we booked in 2014. 
In the West, great continued focus on cost management in the area. We were off about $15 million versus fourth quarter of '14, and that was really driven by $27 million lower NGL margins during -- as compared to the fourth quarter of '14. And again, I'll remind you, those NGL margins are now at a 13-year low. But really proud of the team out there and their continued focus on cost management and able to continue to generate very significant EBITDA despite low prices. 
Moving on to Slide 3. This is a really important slide here. We wanted to show you -- we certainly have a lot of questions about Chesapeake and our relationship and a lot of focus by investors on the credit risk related to Chesapeake. And so we really want to just take this opportunity to walk everyone through some facts and some of our perspective as a midstream service provider that plays a critical role in getting the natural gas production from the wellhead to marketable condition and location. So first, I note that we have a very strong relationship with Chesapeake. We appreciate them as a great operator in the nation's very best shale resources. They have some of the very best acreage in large contiguous blocks, and we are very pleased to have the opportunity to serve them as a key customer and one of the best large-scale operators from our perspective. So I tell you, we are constantly impressed with the way this team continued to be able to lower their cost and work out creative solutions with us and other parties and really thankful for the relationship. They are paying their bills in a timely manner, as usual, and including -- we just recently got paid for the minimum volume commitment related to the Haynesville, and we fully expect them to pay the MVC invoice on the Barnett when it's due. It's not due yet, but we're excited about -- to continue to work with them on that and fully expect that to come through as well just as they paid the Haynesville on time. So from our view, they continue to reduce their costs and operate efficiently and effectively to maintain liquidity. And nevertheless, though, we are mindful of the credit risk that these continued low prices pose for many producers including Chesapeake. 
And so here's how we think about the risks. First of all, we have long-term dedications with strong contractual conveyances of interest in unproduced gas. We like our argument that we hold the current real estate interest in unproduced gas and that our rights or covenants running with the land not subject to the rejection and bankruptcy. We certainly are following current bankruptcy cases like Sabine, where the general question is at issue. But people should understand that the ultimate outcome in individual cases will turn on specific facts and circumstances. Regardless, even if a court were to rule, we don't have such legal rights. Our gathering lines are physically connected to Chesapeake's wellheads and pads, and we provide a very critical service conditioning and connecting Chesapeake's production to points where they can then choose the best markets for long-haul transportation alternatives. In exchange for the dedication of production, we invested capital to build gathering lines that are uniquely positioned to serve Chesapeake's wells. So all these systems were built out specifically for their needs and generally at their direction, as -- and to the size and scale that they needed to be able to produce volumes on a projected basis. In most cases, there are not other gathering lines nearby because these are big contiguous areas and again, these systems were built specifically for their production. And in many cases, our pipelines have been built on populated places such as beneath the city of Fort Worth and it would be very costly for others to replicate our gathering lines. And the rates of return that we generate from these investments and assets are very typical for a midstream provider. Likewise, our gathering lines have been in place for some time and thus, the reserves behind them are now partially produced. To continue to produce such gas, Chesapeake and its creditors, if it ever came to that, would want -- and need to utilize our gathering lines to deliver gas to the markets. So such gathering lines are just very distinguishable from long-haul transportation service because the intra and interstate pipeline initiates service after the gas is already pooled at marketable points. Producers then have many options to receive cash for their products other than transportation on any one particular interstate pipeline. If it did come to a bankruptcy, a producer can argue that it can reject certain types of contracts, and we believe gathering contracts such as ours are not the type of contract that would be reject. However, but even if a gathering contract were allowed to be rejected, a producer and its creditors will continue to need the gathering service to be able to produce gas and create revenue. If a producer rejects the gathering contract in a bankruptcy, the gatherer will no longer be obligated to provide the gathering service. Furthermore, rejection of a contract is all or nothing. Therefore, the analysis of the risk of any producer's bankruptcy is best analyzed contract-by-contract and really understanding the particulars of the services being provided and how unique those services are that are being provided. As any prudent midstream service provider would do, we have studied each of our Chesapeake contracts and considered the value of Chesapeake's reserves, our physical connection to their wells and their alternative options for delivering gas to market, and we believe that we understand much better than anyone the real value of our assets, if it ever came to a bankruptcy process. But let me be very clear on this matter. We have great confidence in Chesapeake, in their assets, and more importantly, in their tremendous operating capabilities and management team. Thus far, they have continued to do all the right things in very difficult circumstances, and we look forward to helping them be very successful for years and years to come, and we have great confidence in their ability to do that. We will continue to find win-win solutions that align our interests and to support them where we can in their asset sales. And as you can see in the table on this slide, Williams' scope and scale of gathering in all of the key natural gas basins is significant. And there are significant non-Chesapeake working interest in basins as well that also give us confidence in the continued cash flows from these assets. So overall, let me just tell you, we are very proud of our relationship with Chesapeake, we're very impressed with them and we also don't have our head in the sand, and we are looking very closely to these alternatives and we feel very strong about our position if it ever were to come to a bankruptcy. 
Moving on to Slide 4. This is just an overview here of some of the recent developments and what we see coming soon. First of all, I want to reiterate that the demand side of the natural gas market is really driving our capital investments. And you can just see that as you look at some of these projects. The Transco Leidy expansion just came in, and that first part of that started up in the -- on December 8 and then we continue to bring segments on -- in-service through the month of December and now, here in January, we are fully completed with all segments and service now for the Leidy Southeast expansion. Great work by the team under some difficult circumstances, but really great performance by the team that managed that project. The Transco Gulf Trace project, this is a project to serve the Cheniere Sabine pass LNG facility, construction is underway, with a target in-service of first quarter of 2017. We just tell you, it's nice to be able to be doing construction in more friendly environments like Louisiana, and the team's doing a great job of bringing that project on board as well. The Transco Gulf Connector project, which is a new, long-term contract we just announced for 475 million a day of new expansion service that will also serve Cheniere's Corpus Christi and Freeport LNG facilities, that would be in 2019. 
And then, just a note here quickly on the Marcellus and Utica volumes. The real story going on in the Marcellus and Utica is that we're seeing both growth in available productions. So what do we mean by available production? We mean the production if there were markets available that could actually be flowing, we continue to see that grow behind our systems and we also saw significant price related to [indiscernible] in the quarter. So this bottleneck, if you will, continues to grow in size with available production growing up behind a very constrained outlet and low regional -- lower-than-usual regional demands in the areas. But I think it's important to know that we now have over 33% of the gathered volumes in the area, and this really leaves us with great exposure once the bottlenecks are cleared. And I think what's really important to note there is that we are not relying on drilling capital for those volumes. All we need is some of those bottlenecks to open up and we'll have volumes flowing without the need for a lot of additional drilling capital. And so this is very different in most areas of the country where there's a lot of concerns about producers not having the capital to drill. In this area, it's just a matter of the infrastructure being built out in front of it. 
And then finally, our Geismar plant, really proud of the way the team operated the plant, and we exceeded our production expectations for the quarter there and are off to a good start here in 1Q of '15 as well there -- sorry, 1Q of '16 as well. 
Just looking forward some things that are going to drive us looking forward. The Canadian Offgas Processing business, the Horizon project that you've heard us talk about quite a bit. That plant is now the Fort McMurray plant. So that's the plant that actually extracts the liquids out of the Offgas is now rolling and it has begun extracting the liquids, but that will be a process here over the next 3 weeks or so to get that up to full production. And then finally, we've got to -- some remaining work at Redwater to be able to fractionate all those liquids and we expect that to be coming on in March. So a lot of new revenues that will show up there on WPZ as those volumes hit both the pipeline and the Redwater fractionator. And then I'll remind you that the margin side of that business is left at WMB at the Horizon facility upstream. As well, our Kodiak tieback, this is a tieback to our Devils Tower platform, and that project is being brought online and has been in the testing phase here for the last couple of weeks and is just about to begin to really add some very significant cash flow here in the first quarter. And then the Gunflint tieback, which we expect to come on now in the second quarter, which will be our first big tieback to the Gulfstar One project, and this is -- will also be contributing very substantial cash flow growth with very minimal additional capital investment on our part. We do expect the Gulfstar production to be a little bit higher in the first quarter than we saw in the fourth quarter due to some well workover work that was going on out there. And so we're excited to see some of the benefits of that work that will start to improve things here into the first quarter and beyond. 
Last year, we announced plans to increase the capacity on our Eastern Interstate Pipelines from 10.8 BcF to more than 17 Bcf per day by the end of 2017. And in fact, by 2017, we expect to double the capacity of the Transco system from its 2010 level. So once again, these projects just keep coming and we've got great transparency into our predictable growth and it provides clear evidence that Williams has a truly unique position in terms of our asset footprint, especially in challenging market times. Our backlog of projects remains robust, and the demand side project just keep coming at us with amazing pace and consistency and in particular, along the Transco system. These are fully contracted demand pool projects, and we will continue to high grade these opportunities as we balance constrained funding sources up against continued robust backlog. So our issue is not a matter of backlog. We have plenty of great investment opportunities. Really a matter of getting lower -- better funding sources and low-cost funding sources to supply all these opportunities. So we're in an envious position of having plenty of opportunity and again, just a matter of getting those funded appropriately. 
Moving on to Slide 5. So as we've said before, much of the attention in the industry is focused on producer shut-ins and commodity prices, but we remain focused on serving and capturing the growing demand for natural gas. This focus is especially important in the Northeast where we're working to unlock the tremendous value of the Marcellus and Utica areas by providing market access via the Constitution and Atlantic Gulf projects. Our strategy remains intact and the underlying fundamentals of our business are strong despite reduced producer activities in the supply areas. And just a few weeks ago, we announced our revised business plan to address the realities of our current market environment while continuing to invest in our business. In addition to significantly lower operating expenses in 2016, the revised 2016 plan includes growth capital funding needs of around $2.1 billion, which is about $1 billion or 32% less than our previous plans. The plan includes $1.3 billion for Transco expansions and other Interstate pipeline projects, and the non-Interstate pipeline growth that's embedded here totals about $700 million and this is primarily reflecting additional investments across our gathering and processing systems where capital spending for gathering and processings in 2016 will be limited to really new producer volumes, including mostly wells that are already drilled and completed but that are awaiting connecting infrastructure. So as I said earlier, really not depending on a whole lot of drilling here in 2016. We're really just focused on connecting and getting volumes that are already connected flowing. 
Moving on to Slide 6 here. Just to close out, first of all, the fourth quarter results certainly demonstrate the resilience of our fee-based assets, approximately 93% of PZ's gross margin were from fee-based revenues. The continued growth in Atlantic Gulf segment continue to be driven by great expansions on our Transco system as well as our deepwater volumes, and sequential growth in the Marcellus and Utica volumes really was impressive. In fact, total operated volumes in this key region were up 8% as you compare the fourth quarter to the third quarter, while the total volumes in the regions, so not just ours, but looking at the total industry production, actually declined a little less than 1%. So, again, total region declined a little less than 1%, but our volumes were up -- actually up by 8%. So really, continued to grow our market share in this very important region. 
Our 2016 WPZ business plan really did address the realities of our current market environment and continues our investments in growing the demand side of our business, and you certainly -- we continue to high grade our opportunities, and a lot of that capital is going towards really important demand-driven infrastructure projects that serve long-term natural gas needs of local distribution companies, electric power generation, LNG and industrial sources. And so just to reiterate, this quarter's results and our continued strong backlog of projects are a direct reflection of our strategy to uniquely position Williams to connect the best natural gas supplies to the best markets regardless of significant market swings and cycles. 
And so as we move to questions, I'd like to highlight what John mentioned in the opening. The Williams' Board of Directors is unanimously committed to completing the transaction with Energy Transfer for the merger agreement executed on September 28, 2015, and delivering the benefits of the transaction to Williams' stockholders. Beyond that though, we're only discussing our fourth quarter and year-end results and we ask that you keep your questions focused on our results. We will not take questions related to the pending transaction between Williams and ETE or related matters. And we thank you in advance for your cooperation for that request. And so now, operator, let's please move on to questions."

And so we're depending on both the producers and the midstream operator's forecast of that and that continues to be a moving target in many basins. So I would say in those areas, those more oil-driven basins could be some movement down I would say in the areas like in the Marcellus and the Utica, we're managing that very closely and trying to optimize the timing of the capital right in line with the opening of new projects to go out of that coming out of the area. And so there's probably some room to optimize, if you will, and delay some of that capital until the projects are specifically coming on time. So you could see -- we could see a little bit of that slip, but a lot of that is already underway and work is ongoing."

So we actually have seen some people taking advantage. We've seen some of these cold-weather surges. But you have to really remember about the demand in the Northeast there, is it's driven by 2 things. First of all, its capacity to get out of the region, and that's pretty fixed. In other words, those pipelines are completely full getting out of the region. And so that doesn't move a whole lot. But what does move is any regional demand based on weather loads in the areas where gas is consumed in the region. And so that will leave it either driven by cold weather, which we've seen a little bit here in the first quarter/or it'll be driven by very hot weather in the summertime. And those are the 2 things that will drive the variable until some of these projects, new projects, come online, that will be what drives the volume in the Northeast. There's plenty of gas ready to meet that demand as it opens up."

The -- as to the contracts and any negotiation, that was a situation where the rate from a legacy cost of service contract was so high that there was no way the reserves in the area would ever be produced. And so it was a matter of rate being even in excess for the price of gas. And so this was a matter of actually getting the gas flowing and assuring ourselves that the gas would continue to flow in exchange for some additional volumes and additional dedication in the area. So whenever we have opportunities like that, that we can bring increment to our gas -- or, sorry, our cash flows as we look on a long-term basis, we certainly will try to take advantage. And there are plenty of win-win opportunities out there to increase our cash flows to get gas flowing that's not flowing today. Obviously, we have to be cognizant of the fact, as I mentioned earlier, that there's only so much gas that's going to get out of the region. And so we want to maximize those revenues on our system because we realize that when an Mcf starts flowing in one place, it likely means that there -- that it didn't come off a competitor system, it would come off of our own system.

And of course, our ability to export ethylene and ethylene derivatives is somewhat yet limited by begging internally, particularly, in the polyethylene case. And so we would expect that the second half of the year on ethylene reverts back to margins more akin to what we're experiencing today.

So anyway, it could come down to a negotiation if there was value to be shared between the parties and a better contract. But our point is just that there isn't any ability to just separate if somebody accepts the contract, they accept the contract in its whole.

We appreciate what a busy morning it is, and so let's move right on to Slide 2 here. First of all, our first quarter '16 results certainly underscore the strong fundamentals of our fee-based business model and we're excited at Williams to play a critical role in getting abundant low-cost North American natural gas in the growing market and delivering volume-driven growth to our stock unitholders. In fact, we're pleased to say that on an adjusted EBITDA, Williams for the first quarter was up 15% over last year and up 16% at WPZ. And this was despite a number of smaller noncash expense items that totaled approximately $17 million that did not adjust out of this calculation. The WPZ DCF performance was up 14% to $739 million in the first quarter, giving us a coverage ratio of 1.02 at WPZ, excluding the benefits of the IDR waiver. 
This quarter is especially noteworthy as it marked the 10th consecutive quarter that we delivered year-over-year increases in what we now refer to as adjusted EBITDA, where its predecessor description, segment profit plus DD&A. Throughout the business, we continue to aggressively manage our call and align our workforce with the reality of low commodity prices and reduce producer activity in the supply basin. And we made additional tough decisions at the end of the first quarter, which included reducing our overall workforce by 10%. But even with some market headwinds, our focus on fee-based revenue has allowed us to produce strong cash flow despite a 16-year low NGL prices. And as we look foreword, it's exciting to see all of the natural gas demand-based projects ramping up as they will be a major part of our growth going forward. We expect continued growth from our portfolio of large scale, demand-driven projects and our fully contracted natural gas transmission business coming on in the balance of '16, '17 and '18. And in this period towards the end, we'll begin to pull on the supply basins that we are all already so well-positioned in today. 
Now we've talked a lot at Williams about the unique position between prolific supply basins and the tremendous demand for markets that we serve, especially along the Transco system. We're not the only ones talking about it. In fact, S&L Financial published a story just this week that encapsulates the great position we're in. The headline is Southeast's growing appetite for natural gas will change market structure. And that probably sounds familiar if you've been following Williams for a while. And as this article points out, more than 50% of the supply in the southeast currently comes from the Gulf, but that the southeast will experience a significant demand increases here in the near future and all the way through 2030 when a whopping 60% [ph] of the power generation will be fueled by natural gas. 
If you look at the geography of this demand for, it's hard to miss the fact that our Transco system words into the heart of this here. And onetime bring this tremendous market demand growth story that the newer term, we said at our analyst the presentation last year that we've already captured more than 1/3 of 22 [ph] Bcf per day of demand increases along the Transco corridor forecasted between 2015 and 2025 by [indiscernible] And to continue meeting this demand, we've announced plans last year to increase the capacity on our Easter interest states from 10.8 Bcf per day to more than 17 Bcf per day by the end of '17. And that by '17, we expect to double the capacity of Transco system from external level. So as you'll see, when we discuss our projects in this presentation, Williams is strategically positioned like no other company in the natural gas sector to meet this tremendous demand pull and experience significant fee-based growth. 
As we move on to discuss the quarterly performance and our operating areas, I want to remind everyone that this is the first quarter in which we've consolidated our legacy access operations in the Marcellus and Utica into our overall reporting for the Northeast gathering and processing, and we've moved the remaining legacy access areas into what we now call the central operating area. 
With that, let me highlight some of the drivers of our solid performance in each of the operating areas this quarter. First of all, once again, the Atlantic-Gulf is delivering strong results as a capture more and more demand fees for providing natural gas transmission capacity on the Atlantic-Gulf system. Adjusted EBITDA was up $64 million to $399 million over the first quarter of 2015, and this came from, really, from 2 primary areas. First of all, we saw $28 million higher fee-based revenues from higher transportation revenues on Transco, and these were associated with various expansion projects that came on during 2015. And the another $28 million higher proportional EBITDA from our Discovery system, and our Discovery system continues to benefit from the great successes that producers like Anadarko and Exxon has had in the Keathley Canyon area and, of course, that feeds into our large Keathley Canyon Connector system that we brought online in 2015 as well. 
We'll touched on this a bit later, but you'll see that the hits keep on coming for the Atlantic-Gulf in terms of successful permitting activity and bring in growth projects online. Additionally, the bulk of our growth for the balance of 2016 will come from the Atlantic-Gulf with 3 [ph] new projects coming online over the next 3 months. 
Our central operating area, which I mentioned now, includes legacy assets operations outside of the Northeast, reported adjusted EBITDA of $226 million for the first quarter of '16, and this was compared with a $218 million for the first quarter of 2015 as we reposition those assets. Revenues were virtually flat year-over-year, while lower expenses drove the improvements. The $226 million represents 100% fee-based businesses with essential infrastructure and large-scale natural gas basins in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma. In 
the NGL & Petchem Services area, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $57 million for the first quarter compared with $7 million for the first quarter of '15, although olefins margins -- olefin margin started off very low in January and February and really rebounded in the month of March, and as crude oil prices improve and many ethylene fractures begin going off-line from maintenance in late March and in April. So we continue to enjoy a nice margins here in the second quarter. 
The increase in the first quarter of 2015 adjusted EBITDA was due primarily to $60 [ph] million higher olefins margins at Geismar with a full quarter of production compared to very intermittent production that we experienced in the first quarter of '15. I would also note that the adjusted EBITDA in this segment for WPZ included $16 million unfavorable foreign exchange activity in the period as well. 
In the Northeast G&P, we reported an adjusted EBITDA of $219 million for the first quarter of '16, and this compared with an adjusted EBITDA of $196 million in 2015. And these results improve primarily due to a $16 million increase in fee-based revenues driven by gathering volumes primarily in the Utica, and $13 million higher proportional EBITDA from an equity method investments, and this was mostly due to our increased ownership in the Utica East Ohio system. 
Price-related shut-ins average $900 million a day for the quarter. This is always something people have a strong interest in, so estimate we had about $900 million a day. That was not $900 million a day everyday, but on average, we saw some worst days and some better days, and that's as producers start production on and off, responding to both load and prices. The shut-ins were seen across the Bradford County areas and Susquehanna area, and a significant revenue impact felt in the OVM area. But I would like to speak to the fact that this really does represent a great growth opportunity for us without any additional capital spending. So the gas is there, the infrastructure is there. And as the debottlenecking continues in this area, we'll see that cash flow come back on. 
One thing to note during the quarter, we -- sorry, just recently, we completed our New York loop that feeds into the millennium pipeline, so this was our segment previously referred to as the laser pipelines that we acquired and we did complete a loop. And this, along with compressor addition at our Dunbar station, should add about $140 million a day of incremental capacity this year that will provide the take rates. There's a number of other small improvements like that going on as people debottlenecked their takeaway opportunities out of this area. 
In the West, our performance this quarter was stable by any measure as we've been focusing on cost control to offset the significant decline in unit NGL margins that fell from $0.34 per gallon in the first quarter of '15 to $0.22 per gallon in the first quarter of '16. Margins did improve dramatically at the very end of the quarter, and we continue to enjoy much better margins here in the second quarter. To be clear, our West group continues to post remarkably steady EBITDA despite the challenging environment for our producing customers in the Rockies and 16-year low NGL prices in the West. Overall, we think our commodity exposure represents significant upside as prices rebound and the Rockies are very well positioned to respond to growing natural gas and ethane demand as well. 
So let me move over the Slide 3 now and talk about our growth projects. And certainly, I'll start this off by noting, there's been quite a bit of media coverage around the state of New York's denial of our 401 water quality permit with the Constitution pipeline. We obviously don't agree with the decision and believe that there is significant amount of politics involved that went into that decision. Some of the resulting media coverage certainly echoes that sentiment. We worked hard to do things right by the environment and we worked hard to cooperate with regulators and landowners, and so we're really disappointed when those efforts, where we really do try to do the right thing, seem to be ignored. The Constitution partners are assessing the path forward and we're committed to building this critical piece of infrastructure. It's certainly important to economic development and jobs in upstate New York, and reliable supply of natural gas is critical if New York is going to continue its transition from coal-fired power generation to the natural gas units. It's also critical if the entire New England region is to benefit from U.S. natural gas as it also transitions away from retired nuclear plants and coal-fired generation. 
However, while the recent headline may have been about Constitution and the state permitting process in New York, we've been making significant progress on a number of projects during the period. First of all, the Transco Garden State project, we did get FERC approval with its $180 [ph] million a day expansion that will serve the local distribution group in New Jersey. Also, the New York Bay project, FERC issued an environmental assessment for this $115 million a day expansion and that is expected to come on in the fourth quarter of '17 as its service date. Moving to the south end for a minute, the Transco Dalton project, which is a major expansion into some natural gas-fired power generation in northern Georgia, FERC issued an environmental assessment for, $448 million a day expansion, and that is also a 2017 in service date. On Northwest pipeline, our Kalama Lateral, the FERC approved -- we did receive a FERC approval for a $320 million and a project to serve a proposed methanol production facility in that area. And moving back to the south on Transco, the Hillabee expansion, which is a expansion in our system that will serve disabled trails pipeline to the South, that project was also approved and construction will bring -- will begin on that soon. In the Gulf is, we reached agreement with Shell and Nixon to provide Deepwater gas gathering services to the Appomattox development. Really excited about that project. The team has done a great job of keeping that project very low risk to us and taking advantage of our rather expansive infrastructure in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. So great work by the team there and a great piece of business, which should pick up there that is very low risk, given the existing investment we already have there. On the Canadian Offgas Processing, the Horizon Offgas project was fully placed in service in March of 2016, and that project has continued to run very well. And so congrats to the team on there for bringing that up online. I would note that despite the fires in the Fort McMurray area, and I'll just saying, we are doing everything we can as Williams to help out the community and our employees in that area from that tragedy, but I would say that the CRL horizon plant remaines online in that area. 
Williams has a strong proven track record of permitting approvals, and we continue to make significant progress across our entire portfolio of projects. One of the reasons we've been successful is that we have been able to work alongside governmental agencies and community partners to support environmental mitigation and call for preservation where we have operations in our building projects. And, in fact, New York is no exception where just last week, Williams was awarded the Lucy G Moses preservation award for our work to restore historic hangars at the Bennett Field on Long Island, which now houses metering and regulating facilities that are part of the Rockaway lateral project. In fact, this award is the highest honor given for historic preservation in New York and provided a win-win solution for both Williams and the National Park Service, which has been trying to -- for years to fund this restoration. 
So all in all, I think the left we just reviewed demonstrates our continued strong execution. I'm putting growth projects into service, and let me touch on a few that are coming soon beyond that. First of all, on Atlantic Sunrise, we're excited that Atlantic Sunrise is targeted to receive its draft EIS from the FERC this month. It's a project that is going to help unlock tremendous value in the Marcellus like never before to serve growing demand markets. And it's on track to receiving its state and federal permits and clearances. And, in fact, really important to note here, it has already received its 401 water quality permit in Pennsylvania. So this project is really, the pipeline part of this project is all-in Pennsylvania, and we have received the water quality permit, same permit that has its held up on Constitution we've already received in Pennsylvania. So we appreciate the great work by both our permitting teams on that as well as the cooperation we got with the state of Pennsylvania. 
In Rock Springs -- sorry, a project we call Rock Springs, which is a new power plant that we're serving. That construction is going to be complete late this month and commissioning will happening very soon after that. This will be in service -- placed into service because of the customers' need being on August 1 of '16. So our construction on this project is actually significantly ahead of schedule of the planned ISP, so congrats to our team on that project, and that as another significant power plant load that we've picked up there in the Maryland area. A Kodiak tieback, this is the fourth third-party tieback to the Devils Tower platform, and it did achieve its first oil on schedule in the first quarter of '16. However, due to some higher pressures in the reservoir, they currently -- the producer has shut that in to accommodate putting in some more robust production facilities to handle this impressive reservoir, and we expect that to restart -- or that restart to expect here in late May. 
On the Gunflint tieback, a really large important project for us, and we expect first Gulfstar One -- this first Gulfstar One tieback to commission in June. The work is actually going on as we speak there during the month of May, and so we'll be turning that back over to the producers year in June for commissioning. This is going to contribute significant cash flow growth as this big tieback for Gulfstar comes online. 
So with that, let's move on to Slide 4. Our pathway to growth in our fee-based cash flows is very clear as it is dependent on a large number of already contracted large-scale projects serving the growing market for natural gas. For 2016, the major projects are already largely constructed with final commissioning activities occurring here in the second quarter as I just mentioned. And so just looking at the changes here, from '15 to '16, first of all, we're going to get the benefit of the full year contribution for projects that came on during '15. You see that list on this slide. You also -- we also then have the Rock Springs project that I just mentioned, Gunflint, Kodiak and the CNRL Horizon project, which is already online contributing here into '16 as well. 
And comparing '16 to '17, further growth is going to come from all these projects being on for a full year plus the Dalton project, which is the very large expansion in the Northern Georgia; the Hillabee project that serves disabled trails; the Gulf Trace project, which is under construction right now; and as well as various G&P expansion, particularly in the Northeast. As we look at '17 versus '18 -- or '18 versus '17, sorry, you would see the full year contribution of those projects we just mentioned as well as partial contribution from the projects listed here. And probably in '18, we would expect as the pool comes from some of these large projects that would come on in '17. Like Atlantic Sunrise, we would then expect a large pull to start to occur in our supply base. And so really excited to see that area that we've worked so hard to position ourselves really come alive into '18 at the natural gas demand starts to affect those areas. Beyond 2018, we certainly would have a long number of projects that we're continuing to develop, and you can see some of these here that are already fully contracted. The Gulf connector project to increase -- sorry, Gulf connector, which is an LNG project, and then another project to increase reliable servers in the New York City area that we're really excited about and will have more news on that in the not-too-distant future, and then our Hillabee Phase II. 
Moving on to Slide 5. Some things up today. Our first quarter result really demonstrate resilience of our strategic focus and natural gas. Approximately 93% of the WPZ's gross margin year-to-date is coming from fee-based revenues, and we expect that number to continue to increase. Significant new assets are supporting strong cash flow growth. And while investments in our growth continued across all these areas that we mentioned today, we certainly are continuing to see growth in the Atlantic-Gulf segment via the Transco expansion and sequential growth in the Marcellus and Utica volumes, which are constrained by market access. But again, we're ready to drive huge growth there because we've already invested in on the major infrastructure in that area. So you should expect to see less and less capital investment in that area, but poised for growth as the demand projects began to unlock the power of that basin. 
So once again, I'd like to make a specific point about the connection between Transco in the Northeast. Everyone familiar with natural gas knows that Transco has always delivered gas from the South to the North. But to really unlock the vast supplies in the Northeast, its flow will have to be reversed in many areas. And this is a point made in the SNL article that I mentioned earlier. Reversing this flow is exactly what we did in 2015 with the Southeast expansion and particularly at our state Transco station 1 80. It's exactly what we're doing today, and it's exactly what our growth projects will continue to exploit over the next few years. And as these projects unlock the tremendous value of America's natural gas resources, they are going to continue to drive volume-driven growth for Williams and our investors. 
So let me wrap up here by saying that Williams is the best-positioned natural gas-focused companies in terms of our strategic balance. Our strategic position between the demand coal business and our significantly advantage presence in key  supply basins will drive continued growth and deliver solid returns despite swings in markets and commodity prices. We've seen the success of our strategy reflected quarter after quarter. And with the significant growth projects we have coming down the pipe, we expect to stay on this very positive trajectory as this clean and abundant resource continues to grow our market share, both here at home and abroad. 
So as we move to questions now, I'll just like to ask you to keep your questions focused on our first quarter 2016 results. We know there's a lot of interest in other topics, but that's what we're prepared to talk about today, so we'd appreciate if you keep your questions focused on that. 
And so, operator, if we can move on to questions, please."

Our exposure in the Northeast is really as a service provider there for the most part, and so we are recovering ethane in there as a service to our customers they. So we enjoy throughput through both our processing and our ethane transportation systems out there. And those came online, I think, in the end of the second quarter last year. So we continue to see improvement from that, but we really don't see too much in the way of margin exposure there, if you will. So most of our revenues, they come from just the transport. The area that we're obviously more exposed to is in the Rockies and where we do have rights to the ethane there. And I'll couple that now with a question on Geismar, which is what if anything goes up? That's the really nice thing about our portfolio, is that we're really exposed from natural gas through to ethylene because we are actually long ethane in our portfolio. So if ethane prices go up, we're actually going to see more margin because we're a little bit -- our length in ethane is bigger we're in full production and, of course, we would be if ethane prices went up. Our length in ethane is bigger than our short on the Geismar side, so it would actually be a net positive to us if we were to see that curve."

And I would tell you that really, the changes that came about -- and I agree with your point, that despite by prices, that's not really necessary to drive them. But what we did see was we saw a dramatic slowdown in the growth in the Northeast. And so all of the efforts that we had around expanding our systems in the Northeast and, to a lesser degree, some in the central area, have slowed down because the number of rigs that have pulled back. And so, as you know, we dramatically reduced our capital budget. And so as we reduced that capital budget, it takes a whole lot less administrative effort to support all of those growth projects and so that's really the areas that we trimmed our -- the growth in the supply base in. And frankly, we have been growing the company at a pretty big clip, just with all of activity going on and $4 billion to $5 billion of growth capital a year. We have been growing the company very quickly, and so it is a good opportunity for us to sit back and reset our staff appropriately to both the slower capital investment rate and less producer activity in the supply bases. And so that's what we've accomplished, but that's a great question. Thank you."

So I think, we'll have a lot of people weighing in on our side of that argument for obvious reasons, and so I think that will happen. But I would say, despite that, there is a number of projects that are continuing to expand and bring incremental volumes out of the area. And as you heard us mention our New York loop on the old laser or pipeline, which is now complete as well as some compressor addition that we're doing to increase capacity on that, that allowed about $140 million a day, and there's a couple of power plants in the region that will also work to add incremental load in the area. And so we think that kind of debottlenecking will continue to go on. And meanwhile, we're ready to really express strongly the facts on the Constitution piece and, hopefully, that will win the day."

We do appreciate what a busy morning it is, and so let's move right on to Slide 2 here. First of all, our first quarter '16 results certainly underscore the strong fundamentals of our fee-based business model and we're excited as Williams to play a critical role in getting abundant low-cost North American natural gas in the growing markets and delivering volume-driven growth to our stock and unitholders. In fact, we're pleased to say that on an adjusted EBITDA at Williams for the first quarter was up 15% over last year and up 16% at WPZ. And this was despite a number of smaller noncash expense items that totaled approximately $17 million that we did not just out -- did not adjust out of this calculation. The WPZ DCF performance was up 14% to $739 million in the first quarter, giving us a coverage ratio of 1.02x at PZ, excluding the benefits of the IDR waiver.
This quarter is especially noteworthy as it marked the 10th consecutive quarter that we've delivered year-over-year increases in what we now refer to as adjusted EBITDA or its predecessor description, segment profit plus DD&A. Throughout the business, we've continued to aggressively manage our cost and align our workforce with the realities of low commodity prices and reduce producer activity in the supply basins. And we made additional tough decisions at the end of the first quarter, which included reducing our overall workforce by 10%. But even with some market headwinds, our focus on fee-based revenue has allowed us to produce strong cash flow despite a 16-year low in NGL prices. 
And as we look forward, it is exciting to see all of the natural gas demand-based projects ramping up as they will be a major part of our growth going forward. We expect continued growth from our portfolio of large scale, demand-driven projects and our fully contracted natural gas transmission business coming on in the balance of '16, '17 and '18. And in this period towards then, we'll begin to pull on the supply basins that we are already so well-positioned in today. 
Now we've talked a lot at Williams about the unique position between prolific supply basins and the tremendous demand for markets that we serve, especially along the Transco system. Well, we're not the only ones talking about it. In fact, SNL Financial published a story just this week that encapsulates the great position we're in. The headline is Southeast's growing appetite for natural gas will change market structure. And that probably sounds familiar if you've been following Williams for a while. And as this article points out, more than 50% of the supply in the southeast currently comes from the Gulf, but that the southeast will experience significant demand increases here in the near future and all the way through 2030 when a whopping 60% of the power generation will be fueled by natural gas. 
And if you look at the geography of this demand pool, it's hard to miss the fact that our Transco system runs through the heart of this here. And to bring this tremendous market demand growth story back to the nearer term, we said at our analyst day presentation last year that we've already captured more than 1/3 of the 22 Bcf per day of demand increases along the Transco corridor forecasted between 2015 and 2025 by Wood Mac, and to continue meeting this demand, we've announced plans last year to increase the capacity on our Eastern interstates from 10.8 Bcf per day to more than 17 Bcf per day by the end of '17. And that by '17, we expect to double the capacity of the Transco system from its 2010 level. 
So as you'll see, when we discuss our projects in this presentation, Williams is strategically positioned like no other company in the natural gas sector to meet this tremendous demand pull and experience significant fee-based growth. 
As we move on to discuss the quarterly performance in our operating areas, I want to remind everyone that this is the first quarter in which we've consolidated our legacy access operations in the Marcellus and Utica into our overall reporting for the Northeast gathering and processing, and we've moved the remaining legacy access areas into what we now call the central operating area. 
With that, let me highlight some of the drivers of our solid performance in each of the operating areas this quarter. First of all, once again, the Atlantic – Gulf is delivering strong results as we capture more and more demand fees for providing natural gas transmission capacity on the Atlantic – Gulf systems. Adjusted EBITDA was up $64 million to $399 million over the first quarter of 2015, and this came from, really, from 2 primary areas. First of all, we saw $28 million higher fee-based revenues from higher transportation revenues on Transco, and these were associated with various expansion projects that came on during 2015. And then in another $28 million higher proportional EBITDA from our Discovery system, and our Discovery system continues to benefit from the great successes that producers like Anadarko and Exxon have had in the Keathley Canyon area and of course, that feeds into our large Keathley Canyon Connector system that we brought online in 2015 as well. 
We'll touch on this a bit later, but you'll see that the hits keep coming for the Atlantic-Gulf in terms of successful permitting activity and bringing growth projects online. Additionally, the bulk of our growth for the balance of 2016 will come from the Atlantic – Gulf with 3 new projects coming online over the next 3 months. 
Our central operating area, which I mentioned now, includes legacy assets operations outside of the Northeast, reported adjusted EBITDA of $226 million for the first quarter of '16, and this was compared with a $218 million for the first quarter of 2015 as we reposition those assets. 
Revenues were virtually flat year-over-year, while lower expenses drove the improvements. The $226 million represents 100% fee-based businesses with essential infrastructure and large-scale natural gas basins in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma.  
In the NGL & Petchem Services area, we report an adjusted EBITDA of $57 million for the first quarter compared with $7 million for the first quarter of '15, although olefins' margins -- olefin margin started off very low in January and February and really rebounded in the month of March, and as crude oil prices improve and many ethylene fractures begin going offline for maintenance in late March and in April. So we continue to enjoy a nice margins here in the second quarter. 
The increase in the first quarter of 2015 adjusted EBITDA was due primarily to $60 million higher olefins margins at Geismar, with a full quarter of production compared to very intermittent production that we experienced in the first quarter of '15. I would also note that the adjusted EBITDA in this segment for PZ included $16 million unfavorable foreign exchange activity in the period as well. 
In the Northeast G&P, we reported an adjusted EBITDA of $219 million for the first quarter of '16, and this compared with an adjusted EBITDA of $196 million in 2015. And these results improve primarily due to a $16 million increase in fee-based revenues driven by gathering volumes primarily in the Utica, and $13 million higher proportional EBITDA from an equity method -- from our equity method investments, and this was mostly due to our increased ownership in the Utica East Ohio system. 
Price-related shut-ins average $900 million a day for the quarter. This is always something people have a strong interest in, so we estimate we had about $900 million a day. That was not $900 million a day everyday, but on average, we saw some worst days and some better days, and that -- as producers turn production on and off, responding to both load and prices. The shut-ins were seen across the Bradford County areas and Susquehanna area, and a significant revenue impact felt in the OVM area. But I would like to speak to the fact that this really does represent a great growth opportunity for us without any additional capital spending. So the gas is there, the infrastructure is there. And as the bottlenecking continues in this area, we'll see that cash flow come back on. 
One thing to note is, during the quarter, we -- sorry, just recently, we completed our New York loop that feeds into the millennium pipeline, so this was our segment previously referred to as the laser pipeline that we acquired and we did complete a loop. And this, along with compressor addition at our Dunbar station, should add about $140 million a day of incremental capacity this year that provide the takeaway. There's a number of other small improvements like that going on as people debottlenecked their takeaway opportunities out of this area. 
In the West, our performance this quarter was stable by any measure as we've been focusing on cost control to offset the significant decline in unit NGL margins that fell from $0.34 per gallon in the first quarter of '15 to $0.22 per gallon in the first quarter of '16. Margins did improve dramatically at the very end of the quarter, and we continue to enjoy much better margins here in the second quarter. To be clear, our West group continues to post remarkably steady EBITDA despite a challenging environment for our producing customers in the Rockies and 16-year low NGL prices in the West. Overall, we think our commodity exposure represents significant upside as prices rebound and the Rockies are very well positioned to respond to growing natural gas and ethane demand as well. 
So let me move over to Slide 3 now and talk about our growth projects. And certainly, I'll start this off by noting, there's been quite a bit of media coverage around the state of New York's denial of our 401 water quality permit with the Constitution Pipeline. We obviously don't agree with the decision and believe that there is significant amount of politics involved that went into that decision. Some of the resulting media coverage certainly echoes that sentiment. We worked hard to do things right by the environment and we worked hard to cooperate with regulators and landowners, and so we're always disappointed when those efforts, where we really do try to do the right thing, seem to be ignored. 
The Constitution partners are assessing the path forward and we're committed to building this critical piece of infrastructure. It's certainly important to economic development and jobs in upstate New York, and reliable supply of natural gas is critical if New York is going to continue its transition from coal-fired power generation to the natural gas use. It's also critical if the entire New England region is to benefit from U.S. natural gas as it also transitions away from retired nuclear plants and coal-fired generation. 
However, while the recent headline may have been about Constitution and the state permitting process in New York, we've been making significant progress on a number of projects during the period. First of all, the Transco Garden State project. We did get FERC approval for this $180 million a day expansion that will serve the local distribution group in New Jersey. Also, the New York Bay Project, FERC issued an environmental assessment for this $115 million a day expansion, and that is expected to come on in the fourth quarter of '17 as its in-service date. 
Moving to the south then, for a minute, the Transco Dalton Project, which is a major expansion into some natural gas-fired power generation in northern Georgia, the FERC issued an environmental assessment for, $448 million a day expansion, and that is also a 2017 in-service date. On Northwest pipeline, our Kalama Lateral, the FERC approved -- we did receive a FERC approval for a $320 million a day project to serve a proposed methanol production facility in that area. And moving back to the south on Transco, the Hillabee Expansion, which is an expansion in our system that will serve disabled trails pipeline to the South, that project was also approved and construction will bring -- will begin on that soon. 
In the Gulf East, we reached agreement with Shell and Nexen to provide Deepwater gas gathering services to the Appomattox development. Really excited about that project. The team has done a great job of keeping that project very low risk to us in taking advantage of our rather expansive infrastructure in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. So great work by the team there and a great piece of business, which should pick up there that is very low risk, given the existing investments we already have there. 
On the Canadian Offgas Processing, the Horizon Offgas project was fully placed in service in March of 2016, and that project has continued to run very well. And so congrats to the team on there for bringing that up online. I would note that despite the fires in the Fort McMurray area, and I'll just say, we are doing everything we can as Williams to help out the community and our employees in that area from that tragedy, but I would say that the CNRL Horizon plant remains online in that area. 
Williams has a strong proven track record of permitting approvals, and we continue to make significant progress across our entire portfolio of projects. One of the reasons we've been successful is that we have been able to work alongside governmental agencies and community partners to support environmental mitigation and call for preservation where we have operations in our building projects. And in fact, New York is no exception, where just last week, Williams was awarded the Lucy G. Moses preservation award for our work to restore historic hangars at the Bennett Field on Long Island, which now houses metering and regulating facilities that are part of the Rockaway Lateral Project. In fact, this award is the highest honor given for historic preservation in New York and provided a win-win solution for both Williams and the National Park Service, which has been trying to -- for years to fund this restoration. 
So all in all, I think the left we've just reviewed demonstrates our continued strong execution, on putting growth projects into service, and let me touch on a few that are coming soon beyond that. 
First of all, on Atlantic Sunrise, the -- we're excited that Atlantic Sunrise is targeted to receive its draft EIS from the FERC this month. It's a project that is going to help unlock tremendous value in the Marcellus like never before to serve growing demand markets. And it's on track for receiving its state and federal permits and clearances. And in fact, really important to note here, it has already received its 401 water quality permit in Pennsylvania. So this project is, really, the pipeline part of this project is all in Pennsylvania, and we have received the water quality permit, same permit that has was held up on Constitution we've already received in Pennsylvania. So we appreciate the great work by both our permitting teams on that as well as the cooperation we got with the state of Pennsylvania. 
In Rock Springs -- sorry, a project we call Rock Springs, which is a new power plant that we're serving. That construction is going to be complete late this month and commissioning will happen very soon after that. This will be in service -- placed into service because of the customers' need being on August 1 of '16. So our construction on this project is actually significantly ahead of schedule of the planned ISD, so congrats to our team on that project, and that as another significant power plant load that we've picked up there in the Maryland area. 
Our Kodiak tieback, this is the fourth third-party tieback to the Devils Tower platform, and it did achieve its first oil on schedule in the first quarter of '16. However, due to some higher pressures in the reservoir, they've currently -- the producer has shut that in to accommodate putting in some more robust production facilities to handle this impressive reservoir, and we expect that to restart -- or that restart to expect here in late May. 
On the Gunflint tieback, a really large important project for us, and we expect first Gulfstar One -- this first Gulfstar One tieback to commission in June. The work is actually going on as we speak there during the month of May, and so we'll be turning that back over to the producers here in June for commissioning. This is going to contribute significant cash flow growth as this big tieback for Gulfstar comes online. 
So with that, let's move on to Slide 4. Our pathway to growth in our fee-based cash flows is very clear as it is dependent on a large number of already contracted large-scale projects serving the growing market for natural gas. For 2016, the major projects are already largely constructed, with final commissioning activities occurring here in the second quarter as I just mentioned. And so just looking at the changes here, from '15 to '16, first of all, we're going to get the benefit of the full year contribution for projects that came on during '15. You see that list on this slide. You also -- we also then have the Rock Springs project that I just mentioned, Gunflint, Kodiak and the CNRL Horizon project, which is already online, contributing here into '16 as well. 
And comparing '16 to '17, further growth is going to come from all these projects being on for a full year plus the Dalton project, which is the very large expansion in the Northern Georgia; the Hillabee project that serves disabled trails; the Gulf Trace project, which is under construction right now; and as well as various G&P expansions, particularly in the Northeast. As we look into '17 versus '18 -- or '18 versus '17, sorry, you would see the full year contribution of those projects we just mentioned as well as partial contribution from the projects listed here. And probably in '18, we would expect as the pool comes from some of these large projects that would come on in '17. 
Like Atlantic Sunrise, we would then expect a large pull to start to occur in our supply base. And so really excited to see that area that we've worked so hard to position ourselves really come alive into '18 as the natural gas demand starts to affect both areas. 
Beyond 2018, we certainly would have a long number of projects that we're continuing to develop, and you can see some of these here that are already fully contracted. The Gulf connector project to increase -- sorry, the Gulf connector, which is an LNG project, and then another project to increase reliable service in the New York City area that we're really excited about and will have more news on that in the not-too-distant future, and then our Hillabee Phase II. 
Moving on to Slide 5. I'm going to sum things up today. Our first quarter result really demonstrate the resilience of our strategic focus on natural gas. Approximately 93% of the WPZ's gross margin year-to-date is coming from fee-based revenues, and we expect that number to continue to increase. Significant new assets are supporting strong cash flow growth. And while investments in our growth continue across all these areas that we've mentioned today, we certainly are continuing to see growth in the Atlantic – Gulf segment via the Transco expansion and sequential growth in the Marcellus and Utica volumes, which are constrained by market access. But again, we're ready to drive huge growth there because we've already invested in all the major infrastructure in that area. So you should expect to see less and less capital investment in that area, but poised for growth as the demand projects begin to unlock the power of that basin. 
So once again, I'd like to make a specific point about the connection between Transco in the Northeast. Everyone familiar with natural gas knows that Transco has always delivered gas from the South to the North. But to really unlock the vast supplies in the Northeast, its flow will have to be reversed in many areas. And this is a point made in the SNL article that I mentioned earlier. Reversing this flow is exactly what we did in 2015 with the Leidy Southeast expansion and particularly at our Transco Station 180. It's exactly what we're doing today, and it's exactly what our growth projects will continue to exploit over the next few years. And as these projects unlock the tremendous value of America's natural gas resources, they're going to continue to drive volume-driven growth for Williams and our investors.
So let me wrap up here by saying that Williams is the best-positioned natural gas-focused company in terms of our strategic balance. Our strategic position between the demand coal business and our significantly advantage presence in key supply basins will drive continued growth and deliver solid returns despite swings in markets and commodity prices. We've seen the success of our strategy reflected quarter after quarter. And with the significant growth projects we have coming down the pipe, we expect to stay on this very positive trajectory as this clean and abundant resource continues to grow market share, both here at home and abroad. 
So as we move to questions now, I'd just like to ask you to keep your questions focused on our first quarter 2016 results. We know there's a lot of interest in other topics, but that's what we're prepared to talk about today, so we'd appreciate if you keep your questions focused on that. 
And so, operator, if we can move on to questions, please."

Our exposure in the Northeast is really as a service provider there for the most part, and so we are recovering ethane in there as a service to our customers there. So we enjoy throughput through both our processing and our ethane transportation systems up there. And those came online, I think, in the end of the second quarter last year. So we continue to see improvement from that, but we really don't see too much in the way of margin exposure there, if you will. So most of our revenues there come from just the transport. The area that we're obviously more exposed to is in the Rockies and where we do have rights to the ethane there. And I'll couple that now with the question on Geismar, which is, what if that thing goes up? That's the really nice thing about our portfolio, is that we're really exposed from natural gas through to ethylene because we are actually long ethane in our portfolio. So if ethane prices go up, we're actually going to see more margin because we're a little bit -- our length in ethane is bigger if we're in full production, and of course, we would be if ethane prices went up. Our length in ethane is bigger than our short on the Geismar side, so it would actually be a net positive to us if we were to see that curve."

And so I am hopeful that science and the facts will win out in that process, and that's certainly what we're counting on. And so I think, this is a little bit unprecedented from our perspective, where we felt like we've dealt with all of the issues in a very meaningful manner and took very extreme measures to meet all the conditions that were requested of us. There are times when you get things requested of you, you just can't live with them because they might be too expensive or something, but that isn't the case here. And we felt like we met all the conditions that were raised to us. So I think as the facts unfold on this, I think they're going to weigh in our favor, and so I think that's how we feel about it. Now it's early in the process, and we're still weighing those odds, certainly. But I would just tell you as a partnership and as the operator, our team have really been very closely involved in watching what we've done and our team has worked extremely hard to do the right thing. We rerouted and rerouted and we've made changes after changes after changes to meet the conditions. And as far as we were concerned, we had asked and asked and asked and then told over and over that we had met all of the things that we have been requested of us. So that's set with the governor for almost -- or right at a year after we had been told that we had met the conditions. And so we'll see. I certainly wouldn't tell you that we know for certain what that looks like, but we do think the facts are very much in our camp on this."

And I would tell you that really, the changes that came about -- and I agree with your point, that despite commodity prices, that's not really necessarily the driver. But what we did see was we saw a dramatic slowdown in the growth in the Northeast. And so all of the efforts that we had around expanding our systems in the Northeast, and to a lesser degree, some in the central area, have slowed down because the number of rigs that have pulled back. And so, and as you know, we dramatically reduced our capital budget. And so as we reduced that capital budget, it takes a whole lot less administrative effort to support all of those growth projects and so that's really the areas that we trimmed our -- the growth in the supply basins. And frankly, we have been growing the company at a pretty big clip, just with all of the activity going on and $4 billion to $5 billion of growth capital year. We had been growing the company very quickly. So it is a good opportunity for us to sit back and reset our staffing appropriately to both a slower capital investment rate and less producer activity in those supply basins. And so that's what we've accomplished. But that's a great question."

First of all, our first quarter '16 results certainly underscore the strong fundamentals of",3658,"Great. Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We do appreciate what a busy morning it is, and so let's move right on to Slide 2 here. First of all, our first quarter '16 results certainly underscore the strong fundamentals of our fee-based business model and we're excited as Williams to play a critical role in getting abundant low-cost North American natural gas in the growing markets and delivering volume-driven growth to our stock and unitholders. In fact, we're pleased to say that on an adjusted EBITDA at Williams for the first quarter was up 15% over last year and up 16% at WPZ. And this was despite a number of smaller noncash expense items that totaled approximately $17 million that we did not just out -- did not adjust out of this calculation. The WPZ DCF performance was up 14% to $739 million in the first quarter, giving us a coverage ratio of 1.02x at PZ, excluding the benefits of the IDR waiver.
This quarter is especially noteworthy as it marked the 10th consecutive quarter that we've delivered year-over-year increases in what we now refer to as adjusted EBITDA or its predecessor description, segment profit plus DD&A. Throughout the business, we've continued to aggressively manage our cost and align our workforce with the realities of low commodity prices and reduce producer activity in the supply basins. And we made additional tough decisions at the end of the first quarter, which included reducing our overall workforce by 10%. But even with some market headwinds, our focus on fee-based revenue has allowed us to produce strong cash flow despite a 16-year low in NGL prices. 
And as we look forward, it is exciting to see all of the natural gas demand-based projects ramping up as they will be a major part of our growth going forward. We expect continued growth from our portfolio of large scale, demand-driven projects and our fully contracted natural gas transmission business coming on in the balance of '16, '17 and '18. And in this period towards then, we'll begin to pull on the supply basins that we are already so well-positioned in today. 
Now we've talked a lot at Williams about the unique position between prolific supply basins and the tremendous demand for markets that we serve, especially along the Transco system. Well, we're not the only ones talking about it. In fact, SNL Financial published a story just this week that encapsulates the great position we're in. The headline is Southeast's growing appetite for natural gas will change market structure. And that probably sounds familiar if you've been following Williams for a while. And as this article points out, more than 50% of the supply in the southeast currently comes from the Gulf, but that the southeast will experience significant demand increases here in the near future and all the way through 2030 when a whopping 60% of the power generation will be fueled by natural gas. 
And if you look at the geography of this demand pool, it's hard to miss the fact that our Transco system runs through the heart of this here. And to bring this tremendous market demand growth story back to the nearer term, we said at our analyst day presentation last year that we've already captured more than 1/3 of the 22 Bcf per day of demand increases along the Transco corridor forecasted between 2015 and 2025 by Wood Mac, and to continue meeting this demand, we've announced plans last year to increase the capacity on our Eastern interstates from 10.8 Bcf per day to more than 17 Bcf per day by the end of '17. And that by '17, we expect to double the capacity of the Transco system from its 2010 level. 
So as you'll see, when we discuss our projects in this presentation, Williams is strategically positioned like no other company in the natural gas sector to meet this tremendous demand pull and experience significant fee-based growth. 
As we move on to discuss the quarterly performance in our operating areas, I want to remind everyone that this is the first quarter in which we've consolidated our legacy access operations in the Marcellus and Utica into our overall reporting for the Northeast gathering and processing, and we've moved the remaining legacy access areas into what we now call the central operating area. 
With that, let me highlight some of the drivers of our solid performance in each of the operating areas this quarter. First of all, once again, the Atlantic Gulf is delivering strong results as we capture more and more demand fees for providing natural gas transmission capacity on the Atlantic – Gulf systems. Adjusted EBITDA was up $64 million to $399 million over the first quarter of 2015, and this came from, really, from 2 primary areas. First of all, we saw $28 million higher fee-based revenues from higher transportation revenues on Transco, and these were associated with various expansion projects that came on during 2015. And then in another $28 million higher proportional EBITDA from our Discovery system, and our Discovery system continues to benefit from the great successes that producers like Anadarko and Exxon have had in the Keathley Canyon area and of course, that feeds into our large Keathley Canyon Connector system that we brought online in 2015 as well. 
We'll touch on this a bit later, but you'll see that the hits keep coming for the Atlantic-Gulf in terms of successful permitting activity and bringing growth projects online. Additionally, the bulk of our growth for the balance of 2016 will come from the Atlantic Gulf with 3 new projects coming online over the next 3 months. 
Our central operating area, which I mentioned now includes legacy assets operations outside of the Northeast, reported adjusted EBITDA of $226 million for the first quarter of '16, and this was compared with a $218 million for the first quarter of 2015 as we reposition those assets. 
Revenues were virtually flat year-over-year, while lower expenses drove the improvements. The $226 million represents 100% fee-based businesses with essential infrastructure in large-scale natural gas basins in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma.  
In the NGL & Petchem Services area, we report an adjusted EBITDA of $57 million for the first quarter compared with $7 million for the first quarter of '15, although olefins' margins -- olefin margin started off very low in January and February and really rebounded in the month of March, and as crude oil prices improve and many ethylene fractures begin going offline for maintenance in late March and in April. So we continue to enjoy a nice margins here in the second quarter. 
The increase in the first quarter of 2015 adjusted EBITDA was due primarily to $60 million higher olefins margins at Geismar, with a full quarter of production compared to very intermittent production that we experienced in the first quarter of '15. I would also note that the adjusted EBITDA in this segment for PZ included $16 million unfavorable foreign exchange activity in the period as well. 
In the Northeast G&P, we reported an adjusted EBITDA of $219 million for the first quarter of '16, and this compared with an adjusted EBITDA of $196 million in 2015. And these results improve primarily due to a $16 million increase in fee-based revenues driven by gathering volumes primarily in the Utica, and $13 million higher proportional EBITDA from an equity method -- from our equity method investments, and this was mostly due to our increased ownership in the Utica East Ohio system. 
Price-related shut-ins average $900 million a day for the quarter. This is always something people have a strong interest in, so we estimate we had about $900 million a day. That was not $900 million a day everyday, but on average, we saw some worst days and some better days, and that -- as producers turn production on and off, responding to both load and prices. The shut-ins were seen across the Bradford County areas and Susquehanna area, and a significant revenue impact felt in the OVM area. But I would like to speak to the fact that this really does represent a great growth opportunity for us without any additional capital spending. So the gas is there, the infrastructure is there. And as the bottlenecking continues in this area, we'll see that cash flow come back on. 
One thing to note is, during the quarter, we -- sorry, just recently, we completed our New York loop that feeds into the millennium pipeline, so this was our segment previously referred to as the laser pipeline that we acquired and we did complete a loop. And this, along with compressor addition at our Dunbar station, should add about $140 million a day of incremental capacity this year that provide the takeaway. There's a number of other small improvements like that going on as people debottlenecked their takeaway opportunities out of this area. 
In the West, our performance this quarter was stable by any measure as we've been focusing on cost control to offset the significant decline in unit NGL margins that fell from $0.34 per gallon in the first quarter of '15 to $0.22 per gallon in the first quarter of '16. Margins did improve dramatically at the very end of the quarter, and we continue to enjoy much better margins here in the second quarter. To be clear, our West group continues to post remarkably steady EBITDA despite a challenging environment for our producing customers in the Rockies and 16-year low NGL prices in the West. Overall, we think our commodity exposure represents significant upside as prices rebound and the Rockies are very well positioned to respond to growing natural gas and ethane demand as well. 
So let me move over to Slide 3 now and talk about our growth projects. And certainly, I'll start this off by noting, there's been quite a bit of media coverage around the state of New York's denial of our 401 water quality permit with the Constitution Pipeline. We obviously don't agree with the decision and believe that there is significant amount of politics involved that went into that decision. Some of the resulting media coverage certainly echoes that sentiment. We worked hard to do things right by the environment and we worked hard to cooperate with regulators and landowners, and so we're always disappointed when those efforts, where we really do try to do the right thing, seem to be ignored. 
The Constitution partners are assessing the path forward and we're committed to building this critical piece of infrastructure. It's certainly important to economic development and jobs in upstate New York, and reliable supply of natural gas is critical if New York is going to continue its transition from coal-fired power generation to the natural gas use. It's also critical if the entire New England region is to benefit from U.S. natural gas as it also transitions away from retired nuclear plants and coal-fired generation. 
However, while the recent headline may have been about Constitution and the state permitting process in New York, we've been making significant progress on a number of projects during the period. First of all, the Transco Garden State project. We did get FERC approval for this $180 million a day expansion that will serve the local distribution group in New Jersey. Also, the New York Bay Project, FERC issued an environmental assessment for this $115 million a day expansion, and that is expected to come on in the fourth quarter of '17 as its in-service date. 
Moving to the south then, for a minute, the Transco Dalton Project, which is a major expansion into some natural gas-fired power generation in northern Georgia, the FERC issued an environmental assessment for $448 million a day expansion, and that is also a 2017 in-service date. On Northwest pipeline, our Kalama Lateral, the FERC approved -- we did receive a FERC approval for a $320 million a day project to serve a proposed methanol production facility in that area. And moving back to the south on Transco, the Hillabee Expansion, which is an expansion in our system that will serve Sabal Trails pipeline to the South, that project was also approved and construction will bring -- will begin on that soon. 
In the Gulf East, we reached agreement with Shell and Nexen to provide Deepwater gas gathering services to the Appomattox development. Really excited about that project. The team has done a great job of keeping that project very low risk to us in taking advantage of our rather expansive infrastructure in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. So great work by the team there and a great piece of business, which should pick up there that is very low risk, given the existing investments we already have there. 
On the Canadian Offgas Processing, the Horizon Offgas project was fully placed in service in March of 2016, and that project has continued to run very well. And so congrats to the team on there for bringing that up online. I would note that despite the fires in the Fort McMurray area, and I'll just say, we are doing everything we can as Williams to help out the community and our employees in that area from that tragedy, but I would say that the CNRL Horizon plant remains online in that area. 
Williams has a strong proven track record of permitting approvals, and we continue to make significant progress across our entire portfolio of projects. One of the reasons we've been successful is that we have been able to work alongside governmental agencies and community partners to support environmental mitigation and cultural preservation where we have operations and are building projects. And in fact, New York is no exception, where just last week, Williams was awarded the Lucy G. Moses preservation award for our work to restore historic hangars at the Floyd Bennett Field on Long Island, which now houses metering and regulating facilities that are part of the Rockaway Lateral Project. In fact, this award is the highest honor given for historic preservation in New York and provided a win-win solution for both Williams and the National Park Service, which has been trying to -- for years to fund this restoration. 
So all in all, I think the list we've just reviewed demonstrates our continued strong execution on putting growth projects into service, and let me touch on a few that are coming soon beyond that. 
First of all, on Atlantic Sunrise, the -- we're excited that Atlantic Sunrise is targeted to receive its draft EIS from the FERC this month. It's a project that is going to help unlock tremendous value in the Marcellus like never before to serve growing demand markets. And it's on track for receiving its state and federal permits and clearances. And in fact, really important to note here, it has already received its 401 water quality permit in Pennsylvania. So this project is, really, the pipeline part of this project is all in Pennsylvania, and we have received the water quality permit, same permit that has us held up on Constitution we've already received in Pennsylvania. So we appreciate the great work by both our permitting teams on that as well as the cooperation we got with the state of Pennsylvania. 
In Rock Springs -- sorry, a project we call Rock Springs, which is a new power plant that we're serving. That construction is going to be complete late this month and commissioning will happen very soon after that. This will be in service -- placed into service because of the customers' need being on August 1 of '16. So our construction on this project is actually significantly ahead of schedule of the planned ISD, so congrats to our team on that project, and that as another significant power plant load that we've picked up there in the Maryland area. 
Our Kodiak tieback, this is the fourth third-party tieback to the Devils Tower platform, and it did achieve its first oil on schedule in the first quarter of '16. However, due to some higher pressures in the reservoir, they've currently -- the producer has shut that in to accommodate putting in some more robust production facilities to handle this impressive reservoir, and we expect that to restart -- or that restart to expect here in late May. 
On the Gunflint tieback, a really large important project for us, and we expect first Gulfstar One -- this first Gulfstar One tieback to commission in June. The work is actually going on as we speak there during the month of May, and so we'll be turning that back over to the producers here in June for commissioning. This is going to contribute significant cash flow growth as this big tieback for Gulfstar comes online. 
So with that, let's move on to Slide 4. Our pathway to growth in our fee-based cash flows is very clear as it is dependent on a large number of already contracted large-scale projects serving the growing market for natural gas. For 2016, the major projects are already largely constructed, with final commissioning activities occurring here in the second quarter as I just mentioned. And so just looking at the changes here, from '15 to '16, first of all, we're going to get the benefit of the full year contribution for projects that came on during '15. You see that list on this slide. You also -- we also then have the Rock Springs project that I just mentioned, Gunflint, Kodiak and the CNRL Horizon project, which is already online, contributing here into '16 as well. 
And comparing '16 to '17, further growth is going to come from all these projects being on for a full year, plus the Dalton project, which is the very large expansion in the Northern Georgia; the Hillabee project that serves Sabal trails; the Gulf Trace project, which is under construction right now; and as well as various G&P expansions, particularly in the Northeast. As we look into '17 versus '18 -- or '18 versus '17, sorry, you would see the full year contribution of those projects we just mentioned as well as partial contribution from the projects listed here. And probably in '18, we would expect as the pull comes from some of these large projects that would come on in '17. 
Like Atlantic Sunrise, we would then expect a large pull to start to occur in our supply base. And so really excited to see that area that we've worked so hard to position ourselves really come alive into '18 as the natural gas demand starts to affect both areas. 
Beyond 2018, we certainly would have a long number of projects that we're continuing to develop, and you can see some of these here that are already fully contracted. The Gulf connector project to increase -- sorry, the Gulf connector, which is an LNG project, and then another project to increase reliable service in the New York City area that we're really excited about and will have more news on that in the not-too-distant future, and then our Hillabee Phase II. 
Moving on to Slide 5. I'm going to sum things up today. Our first quarter result really demonstrates the resilience of our strategic focus on natural gas. Approximately 93% of the WPZ's gross margin year-to-date is coming from fee-based revenues, and we expect that number to continue to increase. Significant new assets are supporting strong cash flow growth. And while investments in our growth continue across all these areas that we've mentioned today, we certainly are continuing to see growth in the Atlantic – Gulf segment via the Transco expansion and sequential growth in the Marcellus and Utica volumes, which are constrained by market access. But again, we're ready to drive huge growth there because we've already invested in all the major infrastructure in that area. So you should expect to see less and less capital investment in that area, but poised for growth as the demand projects begin to unlock the power of that basin. 
So once again, I'd like to make a specific point about the connection between Transco in the Northeast. Everyone familiar with natural gas knows that Transco has always delivered gas from the South to the North. But to really unlock the vast supplies in the Northeast, its flow will have to be reversed in many areas. And this is a point made in the SNL article that I mentioned earlier. Reversing this flow is exactly what we did in 2015 with the Leidy Southeast expansion and particularly at our Transco Station 180. It's exactly what we're doing today, and it's exactly what our growth projects will continue to exploit over the next few years. And as these projects unlock the tremendous value of America's natural gas resources, they're going to continue to drive volume-driven growth for Williams and our investors.
So let me wrap up here by saying that Williams is the best-positioned natural gas-focused company in terms of our strategic balance. Our strategic position between the demand coal business and our significantly advantaged presence in key supply basins will drive continued growth and deliver solid returns despite swings in markets and commodity prices. We've seen the success of our strategy reflected quarter after quarter. And with the significant growth projects we have coming down the pipe, we expect to stay on this very positive trajectory as this clean and abundant resource continues to grow market share, both here at home and abroad. 
So as we move to questions now, I'd just like to ask you to keep your questions focused on our first quarter 2016 results. We know there's a lot of interest in other topics, but that's what we're prepared to talk about today, so we'd appreciate if you keep your questions focused on that. 
And so, operator, if we can move on to questions, please."

Our exposure in the Northeast is really as a service provider there for the most part, and so we are recovering ethane in there as a service to our customers there. So we enjoy throughput through both our processing and our ethane transportation systems up there. And those came online, I think, in the end of the second quarter last year. So we continue to see improvement from that, but we really don't see too much in the way of margin exposure there, if you will. So most of our revenues there come from just the transport. The area that we're obviously more exposed to is in the Rockies and where we do have rights to the ethane there. And I'll couple that now with the question on Geismar, which is, what if ethane thing goes up? That's the really nice thing about our portfolio, is that we're really exposed from natural gas through to ethylene because we are actually long ethane in our portfolio. So if ethane prices go up, we're actually going to see more margin because we're a little bit -- our length in ethane is bigger if we're in full production, and of course, we would be if ethane prices went up. Our length in ethane is bigger than our short on the Geismar side, so it would actually be a net positive to us if we were to see that curve."

And I would tell you that really, the changes that came about -- and I agree with your point, that despite commodity prices, that's not really necessarily the driver. But what we did see was we saw a dramatic slowdown in the growth in the Northeast. And so all of the efforts that we had around expanding our systems in the Northeast, and to a lesser degree, some in the central area, have slowed down because the number of rigs that have pulled back. And so, and as you know, we dramatically reduced our capital budget. And so as we reduced that capital budget, it takes a whole lot less administrative effort to support all of those growth projects and so that's really the areas that we trimmed our -- the growth in the supply basins. And frankly, we have been growing the company at a pretty big clip, just with all of the activity going on and $4 billion to $5 billion of growth capital a year. We had been growing the company very quickly. So it is a good opportunity for us to sit back and reset our staffing appropriately to both a slower capital investment rate and less producer activity in those supply basins. And so that's what we've accomplished. But that's a great question."

And I guess, I would also be expecting that as we contemplate these plants coming on in the future, the world market for ethylene continues to grow at a reasonable pace. And so long as the U.S. remains able to export, which I think Alan just indicated, it would be, and we believe it would be, that these plants will likely feather in more reasonably than you might expect big clumps of ethylene coming on that could have deleterious effects on the market. It will have some impact, but I do believe the plants will come on in a more feathered fashion over this next couple of year period."

We're certainly glad to have you here this morning and we've got quite a bit of information to go through and we do have a tight timeline, so I'll try to move through this pretty quickly and then turn it over to Don for some comments and I'll come back and close. So I'd like to start off today just telling you something I'm very proud of relative to Williams, and really that is how this organization have stuck together and despite a lot of the upstair issues and a lot of distractions have remain very focus on executing our strategy, which our entire teams are very excited about and just couldn't be more proud of the way the organization has really rallied and is absolutely all-in on executing what we think is, by far, the best strategy in the industry. And so this focus that we've had certainly showed up here in the second quarter and we continued to see some great execution on all of these projects that we have coming to fruition and tremendous amount of work going on up and down the system right now, particularly on the Transco system as we expand out of that it meet all the growing demands in there. So I would tell you that as well in addition to the employee base, I would tell you, very thankful for the board and their commitment and very active, engaged board right now, working very hard, overseeing the execution of our plan and strategy and very much appreciate their engagement as well. So the plan for today's call is to walk you through our strong second quarter results and then discuss our execution on key initiatives and growth projects. Don Chapel will discuss the immediate measures that we're implementing to enhance value, strengthen the WPZ credit profile and fund a significant portfolio of really big, large-scale fee-based projects and all while maintaining flexibility to review financial and operational plans. So we're going to -- these measures, you'll see as we go through the DRIP [ph] program for Williams Partners and as you've seen in our earnings release, we're also announcing a dividend reduction at Williams and the new level of our dividend will allow Williams to retain about $1.3 billion annually and that will be reinvested back in the Williams Partners so realy think this is a great answer for bringing us the right cost of capital to go and invest against all these great growth projects that we have as a natural gas market and the demand side continues to expand out. Moving on to Slide 2 here, we'll talk about the quarter. As you'll recall, in the first quarter of the year, we launched several actions to address the realities that we had as we saw a lot slower growth that going on in key supply areas as the demand side is building out, but the production side, really was starting to see some pretty reduced activity even in the best basins here in the nation. So as a result of that, we're really focused on 2 things that we talked about in the first quarter. One was our asset sales and we talked about getting our asset sales done with an excess of $1 billion in asset sales and we also talked about cost reductions. We made great progress on both of those in the quarter. First of all, we expect here in the third quarter to finalize an agreement to sell the Canadian business and the expected proceeds on that in excess of $1 billion, as we told you. And in addition to that, Williams Partners share that sale is expected to be in excess of $800 million. On the cost side, really terrific execution on the team's part here and we went after those cost right at the end of the first quarter. We took some action, we continue to take action across the organization and showing up here pretty dramatically here in the second quarter with a $55 million lower O&M and G&A expenses than we had in the second quarter of 2015. And I will tell you that's even on top of the growth in our business and so we've certainly been adding assets and growing the business and despite that, we were able to bring our cost in. We continue to find opportunities to reduce costs further, so we're really excited about the way the organization has responded and the great progress on this front. And more importantly for our investors, we're pleased to deliver the adjusted EBITDA at WPZ of $1.065 billion and this was about a 6% increase over the second quarter of last year and this is the now the fifth quarter in a row delivering adjusted EBITDA more than $1 billion. And so certainly, despite the challenging market conditions, our business are moving, natural gas continues to expand and we continue to take advantage of that. We also had strong quarterly performance in our strong distributable cash flow at WPZ which came in at $737 million, which was up 5% from same quarter last year. And very importantly, our cash distribution coverage was 1.02 here in the second quarter which is exactly what it was in the first quarter of '16 as well. So I mentioned back in May that Williams has delivered a long string of quarters with year-over-year increases in what we now refer to as adjusted EBITDA. We used to call it segment profit plus DD&A. But if you look to that and compare it into the prior year's quarter, we now have 11 consecutive quarters where we have shown improvement in that. And that, of course, is despite a pretty significant decline in unit commodity margins over this period and of course, that's been driven by our fee-based revenue growth and our ability to continue to control cost in this environment. 
So with that, let me highlight some of the strong performance delivered from the operating areas this quarter. I'd note that all 5 of our areas are showing year-to-date improvement and, however, here, just starting with the quarter, you can see Atlantic Gulf actually came in a little bit lower than the second quarter last year, but I would tell you this is really for good reason and according to plans as we had a month-long shutdown of the Gulfstar facility, which allowed us to get Gunflint tieback in May. That tieback was made, done very safely. We had over 1 million hour -- man-hours of work, making that tie-in. And we had zero reportable incidents on that effort, so great job by the team getting that work done safely. And here, as we look into the [ph] third quarter, we're going to enjoy both the Tubular Bells facility coming back or Tubular Bells coming back on Gulfstar, as well as Gunflint and we also enjoyed Kodiak a bit for the quarter but we'll see that come back here as well. Moving on to the Central and Northeast and West, really going to combine all 3 of these because really kind of the same story. Steady as she goes business and the improvements was primarily driven by the team's ability to go after costs during the period. So continued, very, very well positioned as the natural gas market start to pull on these areas but nice to see the growth at 5%, 8% and 2% better in the Central, Northeast and West, again, driven by, mostly by lower cost and volumes holding up very well despite the pressures on gas prices. So great job on the teams continuing to operate in a low cost and in a safe manner. In the NGL and Petchem area, our second quarter GAAP results were affected by a held-for-sale noncash impairment related to our Canadian assets and we reported a $419 million decrease in segment performance as measured by modified EBITDA. But as we look at the adjusted EBITDA, that actually increased by $47 million or 142%, which reflected the higher fee-based revenues. That was a lot driven by the Horizon project coming on up in Canada, all up in margins and lower operating cost in this segment as well. Guys, we actually saw very strong operational production levels and we did have a little bit lower ethylene prices during the quarter, but our sales volumes, you'll note, we're quite a bit lower -- or lower than our production volumes if you get into the details there and so we did hold back some inventory during the quarter as we expected the ethylene prices to improve in the third quarter due to a number of extended outages on turnarounds from a lot of the competing plants in the Gulf Coast. So we're fortunate enough to call that right and we have seen a price improvement here in the third quarter and of course, that benefit will show up here as we sell off some of that inventory from 2Q and 3Q. 
Moving on to Slide 4. Every quarter, we reveal a list of our key milestones and for me and the leadership team as well, it's an opportunity to highlight how our teams across Williams are executing. And if you're a regular participant in this call, you know we just keep adding milestones quarter-after-quarter, so let's take a quick look at the 2Q list and I would tell you this list, as I said, this keeps expanding in terms of the number of opportunities off of Transco. We did receive FERC approval for the Garden State project and so this is to increase new demand in New Jersey. The New York Bay expansion and that's an expansion right on top of our Rockaway Lateral last year, another expansion on that for $115 [ph] million a day and we did receive FERC approval for that as well as. Virginia Southside, which is serving a major new gas-fired power generation complex there in Virginia and Virginia South side 1 is in services. This is another expansion on that project as well already and we received FERC approval for that during the quarter. The Northeast supply enhancement, really exciting project, really big investment for us and that's a $400 million a day expansion that's going to continue to take on new gas demands up in the very far northern regions of our system. And so we did close a binding open season on that. That project's moving ahead, again a very large investment for us. And then, in addition to that, we have a lot of projects that are ongoing. We have the Gulf trace project that is under construction and construction's going very well on that. That's mostly a Louisiana area project. We also expect here in the very near future FERC approval for the Dalton Lateral, so that's a big lateral that goes from the southern part of Atlanta up to the very northern reaches of Georgia and we expect to begin construction on that in the fourth quarter. So lots of new things going on here in terms of construction across all of these projects and our cost reductions are ahead of plan, as I mentioned earlier. And we're continuing to find even more ways to increase those cost savings. In terms of coming soon, things that will drive us here in the near term, happy to report that our Rock Springs facility, another expansion off of Transco to our power plant in Maryland, that was brought in service in August 1 in actual, but most of that work is done completed back in the second quarter but for the contract, ready to go in service here now August 1 and is in service. On the Gunflint tieback, as I mentioned, that's really will drive our third quarter pretty substantially and so we're excited about that. And so we also have, I would tell you some other drivers here for the third quarter, we'll got a full quarter of Kodiak up and flowing. We also are enjoying the -- some additional incremental volumes that came into some as a result of the [indiscernible] plant outage so we'll see a nice improvement or an influx of volumes in our Mobile Bay system as well for that period. So a lot of great things that are coming together here for the third quarter. 
Moving on to Slide 5. This is just to look now really some of the big investments that we got going on. And you can kind of see by year how those pileup so a lot of what I just mentioned but this kind of what it looks like in terms of cumulative capital that will be in placed in service. And so I think the really big takeaway that investors should have here is this is very clear and identifiable growth in our business that's coming from all these fully contracted projects and so we got a couple of billion dollars this year, a little over $3 billion next year and about 2/3, a little more than 2/3 of that is coming from this big, regulated projects and they are going to really drive growth well beyond 2017. 
So next, I'm going turn it over here to Don to talk about the new program, the new financing plans. But before I do, I just want to remind you, really it is important that our investors understand how critical the expansion of natural gas markets are to our strategy and we are very confident that, that's occurring, certainly all the projects that we've listed on Transco, but we think all those are going to continue to come and are going to come on the back of low price natural gas, and ultimately, all of that demand pool is going to pull out of the great basins that we're exposed to on the supply side. So I would say for the next couple of years, the growth is going to be coming largely from the demand side, but when that demand shows up, the volumes have to flow behind that and we're extremely well positioned to capture that in the back end. So with that I'll turn it over to Don to talk about our new financing plan."

I'll just run through the Slide 6 fairly quickly, hits, number of points included in our press release. Again, these actions were designed to enhance value at both WPZ and WMB and strengthen the credit profile and maintain investment-grade ratings at WPZ, as well as fund the significant portfolio and fee-based growth projects at Williams Partners that totals about $5 billion [ph] in the '16, '17 timeframe with the vast majority of that being as Transco-related. So first, Williams announced that it planned to reinvest $1.7 billion in WPZ through 2017. That reinvestment is funded by retaining cash flow that was previously paid out in the form of a dividend. The dividend reduction totals $1.3 billion annually or 69% reduction. And the new dividend level at $0.80 represents about 3.5% yield in terms of dividend trading here the last couple of days and we think that's a level that will continue to attract investors that are interested in a meaningful dividend. WPZ will maitain its current $0.85 per quarter or a $3.40 annual dividend through 2017 and then expect to resume some level of distribution growth in 2018. As I mentioned, we expect our actions to significantly improve the credit profile, again with $1.3 billion of cash being retained by Williams and reinvested in the WPZ. That is a very strong credit positive that we think the agencies and debt investors will take note of. The estimated growth capital -- let me back up here in a second, excuse me, again, that will reduce the external funding needs for WPZ. It will enable deleveraging at both WMB and WPZ and really targeting having WPZ below 4.5x by 2018, and again, with a commitment to maintain those investment grade ratings at WPZ. Again, I mentioned the $5 billion of growth capital which is $1.9 billion in '16 and about $3.1 billion in 2017 with 68% and 77% in '16 and '17, respectively, related to Transco. So we're delighted to have the ability to grow our Transco franchise anchored with the demand payments with strong counterparties and we think that will add a lot of value over time. WPZ intends to fund the growth by a number of names here. Is Alan mentioned, we plan to sell the Canadian assets during 2016. Plan to sign and announced in the third quarter and close the transaction in the second half of this year with combined proceeds to PZ and MV totaling more than a $1 billion and PZ share more than $800 million. We're establishing a distribution reinvestment program, or DRIP program, that will be available for all common unitholders and we are hopeful we'll get some public participation in that and Williams does plan to reinvest $1.7 billion into WPZ through 2017. Third quarter distribution at Williams receives will be reinvested in WPZ via a private placement transaction because the DRIP program is not going to be available quickly enough. And then the contributions or the reinvestment thereafter will be through the DRIP program. WPZ will also plan to axis of the public equity market to the extent it has a need through its ATM program or other means as well as access to public debt market. Also, as needed. And again, to the extent that we get public participation on the DRIP program, that would reduce the need for ATM or other equity. I'll pause there and turn it back to Alan."

Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We're certainly glad to have you here this morning. And we've got quite a bit of information to go through, and we do have a tight timeline, so I'll try to move through this pretty quickly and then turn it over to Don for some comments, and I'll come back and close. 
So I'd like to start off today just telling you something I'm very proud of relative to Williams, and really, that is how this organization has stuck together and, despite a lot of the upstairs issues and a lot of distractions, has remained very focused on executing our strategy, which our entire team's very excited about. And I just couldn't be more proud of the way the organization has really rallied and is absolutely all-in on executing what we think is, by far, the best strategy in the industry. 
And so this focus that we've had certainly showed up here in the second quarter, and we continue to see some great execution on all these projects that we have coming to fruition and tremendous amount of work going on up and down the system right now, particularly on the Transco system as we expand out that add up to meet all the growing demands there. So I would tell you that as well, in addition to the employee base, I would tell you, very thankful for the board and their commitment. And very active, engaged board right now, working very hard, overseeing the execution of our plan and our strategy, and very much appreciate their engagement as well. 
So the plan for today's call is to walk you through our strong second quarter results and then discuss our execution on key initiatives and growth projects. Don Chappel will discuss the immediate measures that we're implementing to enhance value, strengthen the WPZ credit profile and fund a significant portfolio of really big, large-scale fee-based projects and -- all while maintaining flexibility to review financial and operational plans. So we're going to -- these measures, you'll see as we go through the DRIP program for Williams Partners. And as you've seen in our earnings release, we're also announcing a dividend reduction at Williams, and the new level of our dividend will allow Williams to retain about $1.3 billion annually, and that will be reinvested back in the Williams Partners. So we really think this is a great answer for bringing us the right cost of capital to go and invest against all these great growth projects that we have as the natural gas market and the demand side continues to expand out. 
Moving on to Slide 2 here. We'll talk about the quarter. As you'll recall, in the first quarter of the year, we launched several actions to address the realities that we had as we saw a lot slower growth going on in the key supply areas as the demand side was building out, but the production side really was starting to see some pretty reduced activity, even in the best basins here in the nation. So as a result of that, we're really focused on 2 things that we talked about in the first quarter. One was our asset sales, and we talked about getting our asset sales done with an excess of $1 billion in asset sales. And we also talked about cost reductions. We made great progress on both of those in the quarter. First of all, we expect here in the third quarter now to finalize an agreement to sell the Canadian business, and the expected proceeds on that, in excess of $1 billion, as we told you. And in addition to that, Williams Partners shared that sale is expected to be in excess of $800 million. 
On the cost side, really terrific execution on the team's part here, and we went after those costs right at the end of the first quarter. We took some action. We continue to take action across the organization, and showing up here, pretty dramatically here in the second quarter with a $55 million lower O&M and G&A expenses than we had in the second quarter of 2015. And I will tell you that's even on top of the growth in our business, and so we've certainly been adding assets and growing the business. And despite that, we were able to bring our costs in. We continue to find opportunities to reduce costs further, and so we're really excited about the way the organization has responded and the great progress on this front. 
And more importantly, for our investors, we're pleased to deliver the adjusted EBITDA at WPZ of $1.065 billion, and this was about a 6% increase over the second quarter of last year. And this is the now fifth quarter in a row delivering adjusted EBITDA more than $1 billion. And so certainly, despite the challenging market conditions, our business of moving natural gas continues to expand, and we continue to take advantage of that. 
We also had strong quarterly performance in our distributable cash flow at WPZ, which came in at $737 million, which was up 5% from same quarter last year. And very importantly, our cash distribution coverage was 1.02 here in the second quarter, which is exactly what it was in the first quarter of '16 as well. 
So I mentioned back in May that Williams has delivered a long string of quarters with year-over-year increases in what we now refer to as adjusted EBITDA. We used to call it segment profit plus DD&A. But if you look to that and compare it into the prior year's quarter, we now have 11 consecutive quarters where we've shown improvement in that. And that, of course, is despite a pretty significant decline in unit commodity margins over this period, and of course, that's been driven by our fee-based revenue growth and our ability to continue to control cost in this environment. 
So with that, let me highlight some of the strong performance delivered from the operating areas this quarter. I'd note that all 5 of our areas are showing year-to-date improvement and -- however, here, just starting with the quarter, you can see Atlantic-Gulf actually came in a little bit lower than the second quarter of last year. But I would tell you this is really for good reason and according to plans as we had a month-long shutdown of the Gulfstar facility, which allowed us to get the Gunflint tieback made. That tieback was made -- done very safely. We had over 1 million hour -- man-hours of work making that tie-in. And we had zero reportable incidence on that effort, so great job by the team getting that work done safely. And here, as we look in the third quarter, we're going to enjoy both the Tubular Bells facility coming back or Tubular Bells field coming back on Gulfstar as well as Gunflint. And we also enjoyed Kodiak a bit for the quarter, but we'll see that come back here as well. 
Moving on to the Central and Northeast and West. Really, I'm going to combine all 3 of these because it's really kind of the same story. Steady-as-she-goes business, and the improvements were primarily driven by the team's ability to go after cost during the period. So continued -- very, very well positioned as the natural gas markets start to pull on these areas, but nice to see the growth at 5%, 8% and 2% better in the Central, Northeast and West, again, driven by -- mostly by lower cost and volumes holding up very well despite the pressures on gas prices. So great job of the teams continuing to operate at low cost and in a safe manner. 
In the NGL & Petchem area, our second quarter GAAP results were affected by a held-for-sale noncash impairment related to our Canadian assets, and we reported a $419 million decrease in segment performance as measured by modified EBITDA. But as we look at the adjusted EBITDA, that actually increased by $47 million or 142%, which reflected the higher fee-based revenues. That was a lot driven by the Horizon project coming on up in Canada, olefins margins and lower operating cost in this segment as well. The guys actually saw very strong operational production levels. And we did have a little bit lower ethylene prices during the quarter, but our sales volumes, you'll note, were quite a bit lower -- or lower than our production volumes if you get into the details there. And so we did hold back some inventory during the quarter as we expected the ethylene prices to improve in the third quarter due to a number of extended outages on turnarounds from a lot of the competing plants in the Gulf Coast. And we're fortunate enough to have called that right, and we have seen a price improvement here in the third quarter. And of course, that benefit will show up here as we sell off some of that inventory from 2Q in 3Q. 
Moving on to Slide 4. Every quarter, we review a list of our key milestones, and for me and the leadership team as well, it's an opportunity to highlight how the teams across Williams are executing. And if you're a regular participant on these calls, you know we just keep adding milestones quarter after quarter. So let's take a quick look at the 2Q list, and I would tell you this list, as I said, just this keeps expanding in terms of the number of opportunities off of Transco. We did receive FERC approval for the Garden State project, and so this is to increase new demand in New Jersey. The New York Bay expansion, and that's an expansion right on top of our Rockaway lateral last year, another expansion on that for 115 million a day, and we did receive FERC approval for that as well. Virginia Southside II, which is serving a major new gas-fired power generation complex there in Virginia, and Virginia Southside I is in service. This is another expansion on that project as well already, and we received FERC approval for that during the quarter. The Northeast Supply Enhancement, really exciting project, really big investment for us, and that's a 400 million a day expansion. That's going to continue to take on new gas demands up in the very far northern reaches of our system. And so we did close a binding open season on that, and that project's moving ahead, again, a very large investment for us. 
And then in addition to that, we have a lot of projects that are ongoing. We have the Gulf Trace project. That is under construction, and construction's going very well on that. That's mostly a Louisiana area project. We also expect here in the very near future FERC approval for the Dalton Lateral, so that's a big lateral that goes from the southern part of Atlanta up to the very northern reaches of Georgia. And we expect to begin construction on that in the fourth quarter. 
So lots of new things going on here in terms of construction across all of these projects. And our cost reductions are ahead of plan, as I mentioned earlier, and we're continuing to find even more ways to increase those cost savings. 
In terms of coming soon, things that will drive us here in the near term, happy to report that our Rock Springs facility, another expansion off of Transco to a power plant in Maryland. That was brought in service August 1 at actual, but most of that work was done -- completed back in the second quarter, but for the contract, ready to go in service here now August 1 and is in service. On the Gunflint tieback, as I mentioned, that really will drive our third quarter pretty substantially, and so we're excited about that. And so we also have, I would tell you, some other drivers here for the third quarter. We'll got a full quarter of Kodiak up and flowing. We also are enjoying the -- some additional incremental volumes that came onto our system as a result of the Pascagoula plant outage, and so we'll see a nice improvement or an influx of volumes into our Mobile Bay systems as well for that period. So a lot of great things that are coming together here for the third quarter. 
Moving on to Slide 5. This is just to look now at really the -- some of the big investments that we've got going on. And you can kind of see by year how those pile up, so a lot of what I just mentioned, but this kind of shows what it looks like in terms of cumulative capital that will be placed in service. And so I think the really big takeaway that investors should have here is this is very clear and identifiable growth in our business that's coming from all these fully contracted projects. And so we've got a couple of billion dollars this year, a little over $3 billion next year. And about 2/3, a little more than 2/3 of that is coming from this big regulated projects, and they are going to really drive growth well beyond 2017. 
So next, I'm going to turn it over here to Don to talk about the new program, the new financing plans. But before I do, I just want to remind you, it really is important that our investors understand how critical the expansion of natural gas markets are to our strategy. And we are very confident that that's occurring, certainly, all the projects that we've listed on Transco. But we think those are going to continue to come and are going to come on the backs of low-price natural gas, and ultimately, all of that demand pool is going to pull out of the great basins that we're exposed to on the supply side. So I would say for the next couple of years, the growth is going to be coming largely from the demand side. But when that demand shows up, the volumes have to flow behind that, and we're extremely well positioned to capture that on the back end. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Don to talk about our new financing plan."

It hits a number of the points that were included in our press release. And again, these actions were designed to enhance value at both WPZ and WMB and strengthen the credit profile and maintain investment-grade ratings at WPZ as well as fund a significant portfolio of fee-based growth projects at Williams Partners. It totals about $5 billion in the '16, '17 time frame, with the vast majority of that being Transco-related. 
So first, Williams announced that it planned to reinvest $1.7 billion in WPZ through 2017. That reinvestment is funded by retaining cash flow that was previously paid out in the form of a dividend. The dividend reduction totals $1.3 billion annually, a 69% reduction. And the new dividend level at $0.80 represents about a 3.5% yield in terms of where we've been trading here the last couple of days, and we think that's a level that will continue to attract investors that are interested in a meaningful dividend. WPZ will maintain its current $0.85 per quarter or a $3.40 annual dividend through 2017 and then expect to resume some level of distribution growth in 2018. 
As I mentioned, we expect our actions to significantly improve the credit profile, again, with $1.3 billion of cash being retained by Williams and reinvested into WPZ. That is a very strong credit positive that we think the agencies and debt investors will take note of. 
The estimated growth capital -- let me back up here a second, excuse me. Again, that will reduce the external funding needs for WPZ. It will enable deleveraging at both WMB and WPZ and really targeting having WPZ below 4.5x by 2018, and again, with a commitment to maintain those investment-grade ratings at WPZ. And again, I mentioned the $5 billion of growth capital, which is $1.9 billion in '16 and about $3.1 billion in 2017, with 68% and 77% in '16 and '17, respectively, related to Transco. So we're delighted to have the ability to grow our Transco franchise with -- anchored with demand payments with strong counterparties, and we think that will add a lot of value over time. 
WPZ intends to fund the growth by a number of means here. As Alan mentioned, we plan to sell the Canadian assets during 2016, plan to sign and announce in the third quarter and close the transaction in the second half of this year, with the combined proceeds to PZ and MB totaling more than $1 billion and PZ share being more than $800 million. We're establishing a Distribution Reinvestment Program or DRIP program. That will be available for all common unitholders, and we're hopeful that we get some public participation in that. And Williams does plan to reinvest $1.7 billion into WPZ through 2017. The third quarter distribution that Williams receives will be reinvested in WPZ via a private placement transaction because the DRIP program is not going to be available quickly enough. And then the contributions or the reinvestment thereafter will be through the DRIP program. 
WPZ would also plan to access the public equity market, to the extent it has a need, through its ATM program or other means as well as access to public debt market, also as needed. And again, to the extent that we get public participation on the DRIP program, that would reduce the need for ATM or other equity. 
I'll pause there and turn it back to Alan."

And so just a few things to wrap up here real quick before we go to questions. Certainly, I don't think there's any argument around the industry that we hold the premier natural gas asset base in the nation, and we see that continuing to deliver growing fee-based revenues. The fee-based revenues now is about 93% of WPZ's gross margin, and you're going to continue to see that grow. So we're excited to see that, again, first, on the demand side and then pulling the supply basins along with it. And with the financial measures that we've announced, we'll be driving significant reinvestment at WPZ, and that's going to stabilize the investment-grade ratings and improve the coverage at PZ as well.

I'd say our pipes projects tend to be in the low teens un-levered returns. And we think the cost of capital for those is pretty low, too, from the standpoint if you were to really isolate that business and say what is the perfect cost of capital for that business. So I think you'd be looking at pretty low debt costs there and a pretty attractive equity cost as well. I'd say -- and I think that's exactly the kind of business that investors are pretty enthusiastic about and probably lowers our cost of capital overall. So we think all of those Transco projects are just really right down the sweet spot. So while we could lay off some capital there, it's not desirable, I think, from our perspective. The rest of the returns on some of those investments tend to be fairly high because of their incremental returns on existing asset bases. So again, we'll continue to look at those and see if there's capital that is not earning us sufficient return or otherwise can be deferred or laid off.

And we have trimmed a lot of capital out of the plan, but I think as WPZ investors see the amount of coverage that we have and see the kind of growth that is out before WPZ, with all those big capital investment, I think we'll see some very constructive positioning for the PZ units. And so I think that'll be a positive. But again, I think the kind of returns that we're talking about are powerful, and we'll overcome that over time."

And we've got quite a bit of information to go through, and we do have a tight time line, so I'll try to move through this pretty quickly and then turn it over to Don for some comments, and I'll come back and close. 
So I'd like to start off today just telling you something I'm very proud of relative to Williams. And really, that is how this organization has stuck together and, despite a lot of the upstairs issues and a lot of those distractions, has remained very focused on executing our strategy, which our entire team's very excited about. And I just couldn't be more proud of the way the organization has really rallied and is absolutely all-in on executing what we think is, by far, the best strategy in the industry. 
And so this focus that we've had certainly showed up here in the second quarter. And we continue to see some great execution on all these projects that we have coming to fruition and tremendous amount of work going on up and down the system right now, particularly on the Transco system as we expand out -- that out up to meet all the growing demands there. So I would tell you that as well, just in addition to the employee base, I would tell you, very thankful for the board and their commitment. And very active, engaged board right now, working very hard, overseeing the execution of our plan and our strategy, and very much appreciate their engagement as well. 
So the plan for today's call is to walk you through our strong second quarter results and then discuss our execution on key initiatives and growth projects. Don Chappel will discuss the immediate measures that we're implementing to enhance value, strengthen the WPZ credit profile and fund a significant portfolio of really big, large-scale fee-based projects and -- all while maintaining flexibility to review financial and operational plans. So we're going to -- these measures, you'll see as we go through the DRIP program for Williams Partners. And as you've seen in our earnings release, we're also announcing a dividend reduction at Williams. And the new level of our dividend will allow Williams to retain about $1.3 billion annually, and that will be reinvested back in the Williams Partners. So we really think this is a great answer for bringing us the right cost of capital to go invest against all these great growth projects that we have as the natural gas market and the demand side continues to expand out. 
Moving on to Slide 2 here. We'll talk about the quarter. As you'll recall, in the first quarter of the year, we launched several actions to address the realities that we had as we saw a lot slower growth going on in the key supply areas as the demand side was building out, but the production side really was starting to see some pretty reduced activity, even in the best basins here in the nation. So as a result of that, we're really focused on 2 things that we talked about in the first quarter. One was our asset sales, and we talked about getting our asset sales done with an excess of $1 billion in asset sales. And we also talked about cost reductions. We made great progress on both of those in the quarter. First of all, we expect here in the third quarter now to finalize an agreement to sell the Canadian business, and the expected proceeds on that, in excess of $1 billion, as we told you. And in addition to that, Williams Partners' share of that sale is expected to be in excess of $800 million. 
On the cost side, really terrific execution on the team's part here, and we went after those costs right at the end of the first quarter. We took some action. We continue to take action across the organization, and showing up here, pretty dramatically here in the second quarter with a $55 million lower O&M and G&A expenses than we had in the second quarter of 2015. And I will tell you that's even on top of the growth in our business, and so we've certainly been adding assets and growing the business. And despite that, we were able to bring our costs in. We continue to find opportunities to reduce costs further, and so we're really excited about the way the organization has responded and the great progress on this front. 
And more importantly, for our investors, we're pleased to deliver the adjusted EBITDA at WPZ of $1.065 billion, and this was about a 6% increase over the second quarter of last year. And this is the now fifth quarter in a row delivering adjusted EBITDA of more than $1 billion. And so certainly, despite the challenging market conditions, our business of moving natural gas continues to expand, and we continue to take advantage of that. 
We also had strong quarterly performance in our distributable cash flow at WPZ, which came in at $737 million, which was up 5% from same quarter last year. And very importantly, our cash distribution coverage was 1.02 here in the second quarter, which is exactly what it was in the first quarter of '16 as well. 
So I mentioned back in May that Williams has delivered a long string of quarters with year-over-year increases in what we now refer to as adjusted EBITDA. We used to call it segment profit plus DD&A. But if you look to that and compare it into the prior year's quarter, we now have 11 consecutive quarters where we've shown improvement in that. And that, of course, is despite a pretty significant decline in unit commodity margins over this period, and of course, that's been driven by our fee-based revenue growth and our ability to continue to control cost in this environment. 
So with that, let me highlight some of the strong performance delivered from the operating areas this quarter. I'd note that all 5 of our areas are showing year-to-date improvement and -- however, here, just starting with the quarter, you can see Atlantic-Gulf actually came in a little bit lower than the second quarter of last year. But I would tell you this is really for good reason and according to plans as we had a month-long shutdown of the Gulfstar facility, which allowed us to get the Gunflint tieback made. That tieback was made -- done very safely. We had over 1 million man-hours of work making that tie-in. And we had zero reportable incidents on that effort, so great job by the team getting that work done safely. And here, as we look into the third quarter, we're going to enjoy both the Tubular Bells facility coming back -- or Tubular Bells field coming back on Gulfstar as well as Gunflint. And we also enjoyed Kodiak a bit for the quarter, but we'll see that come back here as well. 
Moving on to the Central and Northeast and West. Really, I'm going to combine all 3 of these because it's really kind of the same story. Steady-as-she-goes business, and the improvements were primarily driven by the team's ability to go after cost during the period. So continued -- very, very well positioned as the natural gas markets start to pull on these areas, but nice to see the growth at 5%, 8% and 2% better in the Central, Northeast and West, again, driven by -- mostly by lower cost and volumes holding up very well despite the pressures on gas prices. So great job of the teams continuing to operate at low cost and in a safe manner. 
In the NGL & Petchem area, our second quarter GAAP results were affected by a held-for-sale noncash impairment related to our Canadian assets, and we reported a $419 million decrease in segment performance as measured by modified EBITDA. But as we look at the adjusted EBITDA, that actually increased by $47 million or 142%, which reflected the higher fee-based revenues. That was a lot driven by the Horizon project coming on up in Canada, olefins margins and lower operating costs in this segment as well. Geismar actually saw very strong operational production levels. And we did have a little bit lower ethylene prices during the quarter, but our sales volumes, you'll note, were quite a bit lower -- or lower than our production volumes if you get into the details there. And so we did hold back some inventory during the quarter as we expected the ethylene prices to improve in the third quarter, due to a number of extended outages on turnarounds from a lot of the competing plants in the Gulf Coast. And we're fortunate enough to have called that right, and we have seen a price improvement here in the third quarter. And of course, that benefit will show up here as we sell off some of that inventory from 2Q in 3Q. 
Moving on to Slide 4. Every quarter, we review a list of our key milestones, and for me and the leadership team as well, it's an opportunity to highlight how the teams across Williams are executing. And if you're a regular participant on these calls, you know we just keep adding milestones quarter after quarter. So let's take a quick look at the 2Q list, and I would tell you this list, as I said, just this keeps expanding in terms of the number of opportunities off of Transco. We did receive FERC approval for the Garden State project, and so this is to increase new demand in New Jersey. The New York Bay expansion, and that's an expansion right on top of our Rockaway lateral last year, another expansion on that for 115 million a day, and we did receive FERC approval for that as well. Virginia Southside II, which is serving a major new gas-fired power generation complex there in Virginia, and Virginia Southside I is in service. This is another expansion on that project as well already, and we received FERC approval for that during the quarter. The Northeast Supply Enhancement, really exciting project, really big investment for us, and that's a 400 million a day expansion. That's going to continue to take on new gas demands up in the very far northern reaches of our system. And so we did close a binding open season on that, and that project's moving ahead, again, a very large investment for us. 
And then in addition to that, we have a lot of projects that are ongoing. We have the Gulf Trace project that is under construction, and construction's going very well on that. That's mostly a Louisiana area project. We also expect here in the very near future FERC approval for the Dalton Lateral, so that's a big lateral that goes from the southern part of Atlanta up to the very northern reaches of Georgia. And we expect to begin construction on that in the fourth quarter. 
So lots of new things going on here in terms of construction across all of these projects. And our cost reductions are ahead of plan, as I mentioned earlier, and we're continuing to find even more ways to increase those cost savings. 
In terms of coming soon, things that will drive us here in the near term. Happy to report that our Rock Springs facility, another expansion off of Transco to a power plant in Maryland. That was brought in service August 1 -- at actual, but most of that work was done, completed back in the second quarter but per the contract, ready to go in service here now August 1 and is in service. On the Gunflint tieback, as I mentioned, that really will drive our third quarter pretty substantially, and so we're excited about that. And so we also have, I would tell you, some other drivers here for the third quarter. We'll get a full quarter of Kodiak up and flowing. We also are enjoying the -- some additional incremental volumes that came onto our system as a result of the Pascagoula plant outage. And so we'll see a nice improvement or an influx of volumes into our Mobile Bay systems as well for that period. So a lot of great things that are coming together here for the third quarter. 
Moving on to Slide 5. This is just a look now at really the -- some of the big investments that we've got going on. And you can kind of see by year how those pile up, so a lot of what I just mentioned, but this kind of shows what it looks like in terms of cumulative capital that will be placed in service. And so I think the really big takeaway that investors should have here is this is very clear and identifiable growth in our business that's coming from all these fully contracted projects. And so we've got a couple of billion dollars this year, a little over $3 billion next year. And about 2/3, a little more than 2/3 of that is coming from these big regulated projects, and they are going to really drive growth well beyond 2017. 
So next, I'm going to turn it over here to Don to talk about the new program, the new financing plans. But before I do, I just want to remind you, it really is important that our investors understand how critical the expansion of natural gas markets are to our strategy. And we are very confident that that's occurring, certainly, all the projects that we've listed on Transco. But we think those are going to continue to come and are going to come on the backs of low-price natural gas, and ultimately, all of that demand pull is going to pull out of the great basins that we're exposed to on the supply side. So I would say for the next couple of years, the growth is going to be coming largely from the demand side. But when that demand shows up, the volumes have to flow behind that, and we're extremely well positioned to capture that on the back end. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Don to talk about our new financing plan."

It hits a number of the points that were included in our press release. And again, these actions were designed to enhance value at both WPZ and WMB and strengthen the credit profile and maintain investment-grade ratings at WPZ as well as fund a significant portfolio of fee-based growth projects at Williams Partners. It totals about $5 billion in the '16, '17 time frame, with the vast majority of that being Transco-related. 
So first, Williams announced that it planned to reinvest $1.7 billion in WPZ through 2017. That reinvestment is funded by retaining cash flow that was previously paid out in the form of a dividend. The dividend reduction totals $1.3 billion annually, a 69% reduction. And the new dividend level at $0.80 represents about a 3.5% yield in terms of where we've been trading here the last couple of days. And we think that's a level that will continue to attract investors that are interested in a meaningful dividend. WPZ will maintain its current $0.85 per quarter or a $3.40 annual dividend through 2017 and then expect to resume some level of distribution growth in 2018. 
As I mentioned, we expect our actions to significantly improve the credit profile, again, with $1.3 billion of cash being retained by Williams and reinvested into WPZ. That is a very strong credit positive that we think the agencies and debt investors will take note of. 
The estimated growth capital -- let me back up here a second, excuse me. Again, that will reduce the external funding needs for WPZ. It will enable deleveraging at both WMB and WPZ and really targeting having WPZ below 4.5x by 2018, and again, with a commitment to maintain those investment-grade ratings at WPZ. And again, I mentioned the $5 billion of growth capital, which is $1.9 billion in '16 and about $3.1 billion in 2017, with 68% and 77% in '16 and '17, respectively, related to Transco. So we're delighted to have the ability to grow our Transco franchise with -- anchored with demand payments with strong counterparties, and we think that will add a lot of value over time. 
WPZ intends to fund the growth by a number of means here. As Alan mentioned, we plan to sell the Canadian assets during 2016, plan to sign and announce in the third quarter and close the transaction in the second half of this year, with the combined proceeds to PZ and MB totaling more than $1 billion and PZ share being more than $800 million. We're establishing a Distribution Reinvestment Program or DRIP program. That will be available for all common unitholders, and we're hopeful that we get some public participation in that. And Williams does plan to reinvest $1.7 billion into WPZ through 2017. The third quarter distribution that Williams receives will be reinvested in WPZ via a private placement transaction because the DRIP program is not going to be available quickly enough. And then the contributions or the reinvestment thereafter will be through the DRIP program. 
WPZ would also plan to access the public equity market, to the extent it has a need, through its ATM program or other means as well as access to public debt market, also as needed. And again, to the extent that we get public participation in the DRIP program, that would reduce the need for ATM or other equity. 
I'll pause there and turn it back to Alan."

And so just a few things to wrap up here real quick before we go to questions. Certainly, I don't think there's any argument around the industry that we hold the premier natural gas asset base in the nation, and we see that continuing to deliver growing fee-based revenues. The fee-based revenues now is about 93% of WPZ's gross margin, and you're going to continue to see that grow. So we're excited to see that, again, first, on the demand side and then pulling the supply basins along with it. With the financial measures that we've announced, we'll be driving significant reinvestment at WPZ, and that's going to stabilize the investment-grade ratings and improve the coverage at PZ as well. And so we certainly are on a path to continue delivering steady, growing results for our investors.

Can we just get some updated thoughts from you guys on this trend and whether or not, at some point, you will have to evaluate the same in order to be competitive with these peers?"

So I think you'd be looking at pretty low debt costs there and a pretty attractive equity cost as well. I'd say -- and I think that's exactly the kind of business that investors are pretty enthusiastic about and probably lowers our cost of capital overall. So we think all of those Transco projects are just really right down the sweet spot. So while we could lay off some capital there, it's not desirable, I think, from our perspective. The rest of the returns on some of those investments tend to be fairly high because their incremental returns on existing asset bases. So again, we'll continue to look at those and see if there's capital that is not earning a sufficient return or otherwise can be deferred or laid off.

Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We're certainly glad to have you here this morning. And we've got quite a bit of information to go through, and we do have a tight time line, so I'll try to move through this pretty quickly and then turn it over to Don for some comments, and I'll come back and close. 
So I'd like to start off today just telling you something I'm very proud of relative to Williams. And really, that is how this organization has stuck together and, despite a lot of the upstairs issues and a lot of those distractions, has remained very focused on executing our strategy, which our entire team's very excited about. And I just couldn't be more proud of the way the organization has really rallied and is absolutely all-in on executing what we think is, by far, the best strategy in the industry. 
And so this focus that we've had certainly showed up here in the second quarter. And we continue to see some great execution on all these projects that we have coming to fruition and tremendous amount of work going on up and down the system right now, particularly on the Transco system as we expand out -- that out up to meet all the growing demands there. So I would tell you that as well, just in addition to the employee base, I would tell you, very thankful for the board and their commitment. And very active, engaged board right now, working very hard, overseeing the execution of our plan and our strategy, and very much appreciate their engagement as well. 
So the plan for today's call is to walk you through our strong second quarter results and then discuss our execution on key initiatives and growth projects. Don Chappel will discuss the immediate measures that we're implementing to enhance value, strengthen the WPZ credit profile and fund a significant portfolio of really big, large-scale fee-based projects and -- all while maintaining flexibility to review financial and operational plans. So we're going to -- these measures, you'll see as we go through the DRIP program for Williams Partners. And as you've seen in our earnings release, we're also announcing a dividend reduction at Williams. And the new level of our dividend will allow Williams to retain about $1.3 billion annually, and that will be reinvested back in the Williams Partners. So we really think this is a great answer for bringing us the right cost of capital to go invest against all these great growth projects that we have as the natural gas market and the demand side continues to expand out. 
Moving on to Slide 2 here. We'll talk about the quarter. As you'll recall, in the first quarter of the year, we launched several actions to address the realities that we had as we saw a lot slower growth going on in the key supply areas as the demand side was building out, but the production side really was starting to see some pretty reduced activity, even in the best basins here in the nation. So as a result of that, we're really focused on 2 things that we talked about in the first quarter. One was our asset sales, and we talked about getting our asset sales done with an excess of $1 billion in asset sales. And we also talked about cost reductions. We made great progress on both of those in the quarter. First of all, we expect here in the third quarter now to finalize an agreement to sell the Canadian business, and the expected proceeds on that, in excess of $1 billion, as we told you. And in addition to that, Williams Partners' share of that sale is expected to be in excess of $800 million. 
On the cost side, really terrific execution on the team's part here, and we went after those costs right at the end of the first quarter. We took some action. We continue to take action across the organization, and showing up here, pretty dramatically here in the second quarter with a $55 million lower O&M and G&A expenses than we had in the second quarter of 2015. And I will tell you that's even on top of the growth in our business, and so we've certainly been adding assets and growing the business. And despite that, we were able to bring our costs in. We continue to find opportunities to reduce costs further, and so we're really excited about the way the organization has responded and the great progress on this front. 
And more importantly, for our investors, we're pleased to deliver the adjusted EBITDA at WPZ of $1.065 billion, and this was about a 6% increase over the second quarter of last year. And this is the now fifth quarter in a row delivering adjusted EBITDA of more than $1 billion. And so certainly, despite the challenging market conditions, our business of moving natural gas continues to expand, and we continue to take advantage of that. 
We also had strong quarterly performance in our distributable cash flow at WPZ, which came in at $737 million, which was up 5% from same quarter last year. And very importantly, our cash distribution coverage was 1.02 here in the second quarter, which is exactly what it was in the first quarter of '16 as well. 
So I mentioned back in May that Williams has delivered a long string of quarters with year-over-year increases in what we now refer to as adjusted EBITDA. We used to call it segment profit plus DD&A. But if you look to that and compare it into the prior year's quarter, we now have 11 consecutive quarters where we've shown improvement in that. And that, of course, is despite a pretty significant decline in unit commodity margins over this period, and of course, that's been driven by our fee-based revenue growth and our ability to continue to control cost in this environment. 
So with that, let me highlight some of the strong performance delivered from the operating areas this quarter. I'd note that all 5 of our areas are showing year-to-date improvement and -- however, here, just starting with the quarter, you can see Atlantic-Gulf actually came in a little bit lower than the second quarter of last year. But I would tell you this is really for good reason and according to plans as we had a month-long shutdown of the Gulfstar facility, which allowed us to get the Gunflint tieback made. That tieback was made -- done very safely. We had over 1 million man-hours of work making that tie-in. And we had zero reportable incidents on that effort, so great job by the team getting that work done safely. And here, as we look into the third quarter, we're going to enjoy both the Tubular Bells facility coming back -- or Tubular Bells field coming back on Gulfstar as well as Gunflint. And we also enjoyed Kodiak a bit for the quarter, but we'll see that come back here as well. 
Moving on to the Central and Northeast and West. Really, I'm going to combine all 3 of these because it's really kind of the same story. Steady-as-she-goes business, and the improvements were primarily driven by the team's ability to go after cost during the period. So continued -- very, very well positioned as the natural gas markets start to pull on these areas, but nice to see the growth at 5%, 8% and 2% better in the Central, Northeast and West, again, driven by -- mostly by lower cost and volumes holding up very well despite the pressures on gas prices. So great job of the teams continuing to operate at low cost and in a safe manner. 
In the NGL & Petchem area, our second quarter GAAP results were affected by a held-for-sale noncash impairment related to our Canadian assets, and we reported a $419 million decrease in segment performance as measured by modified EBITDA. But as we look at the adjusted EBITDA, that actually increased by $47 million or 142%, which reflected the higher fee-based revenues. That was a lot driven by the Horizon project coming on up in Canada, olefins margins and lower operating costs in this segment as well. Geismar actually saw very strong operational production levels. And we did have a little bit lower ethylene prices during the quarter, but our sales volumes, you'll note, were quite a bit lower -- or lower than our production volumes if you get into the details there. And so we did hold back some inventory during the quarter as we expected the ethylene prices to improve in the third quarter, due to a number of extended outages on turnarounds from a lot of the competing plants in the Gulf Coast. And we're fortunate enough to have called that right, and we have seen a price improvement here in the third quarter. And of course, that benefit will show up here as we sell off some of that inventory from 2Q in 3Q. 
Moving on to Slide 4. Every quarter, we review a list of our key milestones, and for me and the leadership team as well, it's an opportunity to highlight how the teams across Williams are executing. And if you're a regular participant on these calls, you know we just keep adding milestones quarter after quarter. So let's take a quick look at the 2Q list, and I would tell you this list, as I said, just this keeps expanding in terms of the number of opportunities off of Transco. We did receive FERC approval for the Garden State project, and so this is to increase new demand in New Jersey. The New York Bay expansion, and that's an expansion right on top of our Rockaway lateral last year, another expansion on that for 115 million a day, and we did receive FERC approval for that as well. Virginia Southside II, which is serving a major new gas-fired power generation complex there in Virginia, and Virginia Southside I is in service. This is another expansion on that project as well already, and we received FERC approval for that during the quarter. The Northeast Supply Enhancement, really exciting project, really big investment for us, and that's a 400 million a day expansion. That's going to continue to take on new gas demands up in the very far northern reaches of our system. And so we did close a binding open season on that, and that project's moving ahead, again, a very large investment for us. 
And then in addition to that, we have a lot of projects that are ongoing. We have the Gulf Trace project that is under construction, and construction's going very well on that. That's mostly a Louisiana area project. We also expect here in the very near future FERC approval for the Dalton Lateral, so that's a big lateral that goes from the southern part of Atlanta up to the very northern reaches of Georgia. And we expect to begin construction on that in the fourth quarter. 
So lots of new things going on here in terms of construction across all of these projects. And our cost reductions are ahead of plan, as I mentioned earlier, and we're continuing to find even more ways to increase those cost savings. 
In terms of coming soon, things that will drive us here in the near term. Happy to report that our Rock Springs facility, another expansion off of Transco to a power plant in Maryland. That was brought in service August 1 -- at actual, but most of that work was done, completed back in the second quarter but per the contract, ready to go in service here now August 1 and is in service. On the Gunflint tieback, as I mentioned, that really will drive our third quarter pretty substantially, and so we're excited about that. And so we also have, I would tell you, some other drivers here for the third quarter. We'll get a full quarter of Kodiak up and flowing. We also are enjoying the -- some additional incremental volumes that came onto our system as a result of the Pascagoula plant outage. And so we'll see a nice improvement or an influx of volumes into our Mobile Bay systems as well for that period. So a lot of great things that are coming together here for the third quarter. 
Moving on to Slide 5. This is just a look now at really the -- some of the big investments that we've got going on. And you can kind of see by year how those pile up, so a lot of what I just mentioned, but this kind of shows what it looks like in terms of cumulative capital that will be placed in service. And so I think the really big takeaway that investors should have here is this is very clear and identifiable growth in our business that's coming from all these fully contracted projects. And so we've got a couple of billion dollars this year, a little over $3 billion next year. And about 2/3, a little more than 2/3 of that is coming from these big regulated projects, and they are going to really drive growth well beyond 2017. 
So next, I'm going to turn it over here to Don to talk about the new program, the new financing plans. But before I do, I just want to remind you, it really is important that our investors understand how critical the expansion of natural gas markets are to our strategy. And we are very confident that that's occurring, certainly, all the projects that we've listed on Transco. But we think those are going to continue to come and are going to come on the backs of low-price natural gas, and ultimately, all of that demand pull is going to pull out of the great basins that we're exposed to on the supply side. So I would say for the next couple of years, the growth is going to be coming largely from the demand side. But when that demand shows up, the volumes have to flow behind that, and we're extremely well positioned to capture that on the back end. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Don to talk about our new financing plan."

It hits a number of the points that were included in our press release. And again, these actions were designed to enhance value at both WPZ and WMB and strengthen the credit profile and maintain investment-grade ratings at WPZ as well as fund a significant portfolio of fee-based growth projects at Williams Partners. It totals about $5 billion in the '16, '17 time frame, with the vast majority of that being Transco-related. 
So first, Williams announced that it planned to reinvest $1.7 billion in WPZ through 2017. That reinvestment is funded by retaining cash flow that was previously paid out in the form of a dividend. The dividend reduction totals $1.3 billion annually, a 69% reduction. And the new dividend level at $0.80 represents about a 3.5% yield in terms of where we've been trading here the last couple of days. And we think that's a level that will continue to attract investors that are interested in a meaningful dividend. WPZ will maintain its current $0.85 per quarter or a $3.40 annual dividend through 2017 and then expect to resume some level of distribution growth in 2018. 
As I mentioned, we expect our actions to significantly improve the credit profile, again, with $1.3 billion of cash being retained by Williams and reinvested into WPZ. That is a very strong credit positive that we think the agencies and debt investors will take note of. 
The estimated growth capital -- let me back up here a second, excuse me. Again, that will reduce the external funding needs for WPZ. It will enable deleveraging at both WMB and WPZ and really targeting having WPZ below 4.5x by 2018, and again, with a commitment to maintain those investment-grade ratings at WPZ. And again, I mentioned the $5 billion of growth capital, which is $1.9 billion in '16 and about $3.1 billion in 2017, with 68% and 77% in '16 and '17, respectively, related to Transco. So we're delighted to have the ability to grow our Transco franchise with -- anchored with demand payments with strong counterparties, and we think that will add a lot of value over time. 
WPZ intends to fund the growth by a number of means here. As Alan mentioned, we plan to sell the Canadian assets during 2016, plan to sign and announce in the third quarter and close the transaction in the second half of this year, with the combined proceeds to PZ and MB totaling more than $1 billion and PZ share being more than $800 million. We're establishing a Distribution Reinvestment Program or DRIP program. That will be available for all common unitholders, and we're hopeful that we get some public participation in that. And Williams does plan to reinvest $1.7 billion into WPZ through 2017. The third quarter distribution that Williams receives will be reinvested in WPZ via a private placement transaction because the DRIP program is not going to be available quickly enough. And then the contributions or the reinvestment thereafter will be through the DRIP program. 
WPZ would also plan to access the public equity market, to the extent it has a need, through its ATM program or other means as well as access to public debt market, also as needed. And again, to the extent that we get public participation in the DRIP program, that would reduce the need for ATM or other equity. 
I'll pause there and turn it back to Alan."

And so just a few things to wrap up here real quick before we go to questions. Certainly, I don't think there's any argument around the industry that we hold the premier natural gas asset base in the nation, and we see that continuing to deliver growing fee-based revenues. The fee-based revenues now is about 93% of WPZ's gross margin, and you're going to continue to see that grow. So we're excited to see that, again, first, on the demand side and then pulling the supply basins along with it. With the financial measures that we've announced, we'll be driving significant reinvestment at WPZ, and that's going to stabilize the investment-grade ratings and improve the coverage at PZ as well. And so we certainly are on a path to continue delivering steady, growing results for our investors.

I'd say -- and I think that's exactly the kind of business that investors are pretty enthusiastic about and probably lowers our cost of capital overall. So we think all of those Transco projects are just really right down the sweet spot. So while we could lay off some capital there, it's not desirable, I think, from our perspective. The rest of the returns on some of those investments tend to be fairly high because their incremental returns on existing asset bases. So again, we'll continue to look at those and see if there's capital that is not earning a sufficient return or otherwise can be deferred or laid off.

As you can see, from this quarter's results, our organization is firi",3022,"Great. Well, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We're glad you've been able to join us this morning and look forward to discussing our third quarter results here this morning. As you can see, from this quarter's results, our organization is firing on all cylinders, and it continues to capture opportunities, as we execute against our proven natural gas focused strategy.
We're very confident about where we stand today and our team is aligned and excited about all the great prospects that we've got in front of us. We've been taking decisive actions to enable steady, predictable growth in our EBITDA by steadily increasing our fee-based revenues, lowering our cost and positioning our portfolio of assets to capture growing natural gas volumes.
We're making progress on many fronts as we work to execute on our strategy to drive predictable, long-term, sustainable growth. We've brought new projects online, renegotiated some win-win contracts with Chesapeake, and expect to close on a new agreement in the Barnett soon. And we also completed the sale of our Canadian assets, and as you are aware, we also now kicked off a process for our Geismar assets is now in full -- that process is now in full swing.
On the cost savings front, since our cost reduction efforts were initiated at the end of the first quarter this year, we've seen approximately $76 million of lower adjusted cost and expenses at WPZ versus the prior year, and that's all while continuing to add additional new projects and grow the business. Specifically, we've seen WPZ's total cost and expenses decline from 55% of 2015 adjusted EBITDA to 47% in 2016 for the first 9 months. So an important metric that we're taking into account there, and continue to push that cost component down to a lower percentage of our overall adjusted EBITDA. We continue to implement steps to further lower our cost by streamlining our organization. And to date, headcount has been reduced by a little over 13% since the beginning of this year.
So today, we'll walk through our results, and provide some perspective on where we are relative to guidance and financial performance. Our results here in the third quarter certainly validate the hard work of our teams across Williams. We'll also give an updated -- sorry, we'll also provide some update on the Atlantic Sunrise project, and highlight some of the key growth drivers that are now in the horizon. So let's move on to Slide 2. Here, as you can see, Williams Partners delivered net income of $326 million, as measured by GAAP and in terms of adjusted EBITDA, every segment of WPZ contributed to the 8% improvement over the third quarter of last year. Our DCF for the quarter was $795 million, which was an increase of 5% over the third quarter of '15.
As we've been doing consistently, we delivered fee-based revenue growth, and we continue to benefit from the aggressive cost reduction activities we've been working on this year. We achieved the coverage ratio of 1.08 at WPZ for the quarter, which excludes the benefit of $150 million IDR waiver that was associated with the sale of our Canadian assets, and as you all know, that sale was finalized, I believe, on September 23. Overall, the quarter's results continue to demonstrate that our strategies is on the mark. So let's just touch briefly on a few of the operating areas, first of all, in the Atlantic-Gulf. The Atlantic-Gulf continues to deliver solid results, as we put projects into service that are capturing more and more the demand on the Transco system. Our adjusted EBITDA came in at $427 million for the quarter compared with $414 million for the third quarter of last year. And for the year, Atlantic-Gulf's adjusted EBITDA increased $53 million, primarily -- sorry, so far year-to-date, primarily due to fee-based revenues from offshore operation and Transco's new expansion projects.
The quarter also benefited from incremental volumes that came into our Mobile Bay system from the Destin Pipeline system, as we were providing service to volumes that were stranded behind Enterprise's  Pascagoula Processing Plant.
We did see increased operating expenses related to pipeline testing activities as we continue to proactively focus on safety and regulatory programs along our Transco pipeline. Obviously, given the tremendous growth on the Transco system, we continue to focus on and ensure the safety and reliability of this critical piece of infrastructure. And so solid results in the Atlantic-Gulf, as we'll see later, lots of things coming down the pipe to prepare for the tremendous growth in the sector of our business.
Moving on now to our Central, Northeast and West, I'd like to cover our nonregulated midstream set of businesses here because we continue to see some common themes emerging across all of these operating areas. First of all, we have grown our adjusted EBITDA versus the prior year for both the quarter, and also year-to-date. As you can see, from the chart on this slide, Central is up about 7%; Northeast, up 3%; and West, up 3% on a quarter-to-quarter comparison.
All 3 of these businesses reported lower operating costs during the quarter. Our leaders and teams are very focused on preserving operational cash flows in today's slower supply growth environment, and we continue to see the benefits of that show up in our results.
A specific note about the Northeast because I know there's always a lot of extra interest in this particular area. We continue to see steady to slightly increasing volumes there, but remains -- but this area remains in significant need of incremental takeaway capacity and market in the area.
We believe that both the local and the national demand growth is going to really unlock the area over the next couple of years. But in the meantime, we're staying very focused on the cost containment, and achieving the best results for our customers.
Getting all of these critical new midstream place as well has us positioned for when this tremendous slow cost resource really comes on in the next couple of years. And we really do believe that the natural gas demand that we're seeing on the Transco system will call on these constraint supplies once the infrastructure that connects that comes online. The unleashing of this resource and expected dramatic growth in the gathering volumes from this area represents tremendous upside beyond the more visible demand side growth that shows up in our CapEx.
On the NGL Petchem side, we saw an increase in adjusted EBITDA, driven by higher olefins margins and strong operational production levels. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased by $51 million to $136 million in the third quarter of '15. And as I mentioned earlier, we also completed the sale of our Canadian assets, and we are off and running in a big way on our process to monetize Geismar. This Geismar facility and the complex there really is a great asset, and we believe it's a good time to be in the market with the asset. There's a lot of very smart players in this segment and the recognition of just how well-placed this sufficient plant is in the Mississippi River market.
So let's move on now to Slide 3. As we've been saying, our natural-gas-focused strategy is proving out and our over year-to-date performance certainly validates that. Year-to-date through third quarter of this year, WPZ delivered $286 million in net income and nearly $2.3 billion in DCF, up 8% over the same period last year, and we also achieved a year-to-date coverage ratio of 1.04 at WPZ here so far in '16.
I'm also pleased to report that we expect to exceed our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance, and also expect to hold coverage above 1.0, as measured for all of 2016 even with the expected seasonal increase in maintenance CapEx that we generally see in the fourth quarter.
As you can see, all of our operating areas are ahead of where they were a year ago, and you can see the results were [ph] focused on increased fee-based revenues, cost reductions and the full production and higher margins coming through at Geismar.
Let's move on to Slide 4. This is a list of a lot of what's going on, and I'm not going to go through each of these items. But really, the important thing is here is this long list of accomplishments that the team continues to execute on, and so this -- what's really impressive about this is all of the activity that we've got going on that's driving our growth for the future. Just to mention a few here, highlight a few. First of all, look at the number of projects that we began construction on in this quarter, and so the Dalton, Hillabee Ph. 1, the New York Bay expansion and Virginia Southside II. Our teams really have pushed through the permitting Gunflint on these projects, and are now really focused on safety constructing these important expansion projects. We also have a number of projects who are already under construction.
Moving down on the list, the Geismar process, as I mentioned earlier, we have 1 step process, and we're really excited about the degree of interest we're seeing there.
And then, finally, on the coming soon down part there, just in addition to all the projects that we've got going on, we are making a move to simplify our organization further here in 2017. We're moving from 5 operating areas to 3 operating areas, which is going to enable some further cost reductions over and above those that we captured here in 2016.
Moving on to Slide 5. Picture now Atlantic Sunrise, lots of questions, of course, coming out of the announcement from FERC that they were pushing back their approval by about 2 months. So Atlantic Sunrise is a very key piece of energy infrastructure that is going to drive, not just jobs in the Northeast and I think with Pennsylvania, but really the overall national economy, as these low costs, very strong gas supplies here in the Northeast are going to enable manufacturing power generation and a lot of new trade around the world, for markets around the world for our low cost natural gas here in the U.S.
So the Atlantic Sunrise system really does have a unique advantage in that it's one of the few of these major projects that takes advantage of the existing Transco infrastructure and by building the segments that we have that's just new pipeline in Pennsylvania, all containment within the state of Pennsylvania, we're going to be able to reach markets in a very significant way all the way into the Southeast markets where there's a lot of growing demand via coal conversion, natural gas power generation, the industrial markets and of course, the LNG facility at co-point there, is an important market for those supplies as well.
So we announced on last Friday that we expect to begin a portion of service during second half of '17 and that we revised the target to full in-service date for mid-2018. I would note that as we have previously that our financial plan for the rest of cash flow by approximately 6 months and we've already adjusted our growth capital guidance to reflect this analysis.
We revised this date because FERC now anticipate the completion date of the FBIS for Atlantic Sunrise, and will be pushed back to December 30 to 2016. This adjustment will allow more time for the agency to complete a general and -- I'm sorry, conformity analysis and review 2 minor route alternatives. Additionally, where focused on expediting the work required to obtain other key permits within the state of Pennsylvania.
To drive a little context on this, the construction schedule on a project as large as Atlantic Sunrise is very tightly sequenced. Even a minor 2-month delay on  1 aspect and have a ripple effect on other components of the project schedule, some of which are dependent upon lining up with a narrow environmental schedule.
So the good news is we've got about 96% of the survey worked done, that means the land owners are cooperating with us in a way the survey work done and we are pushing ahead to get the remaining 4% of that done. So a lot of activity going on to get the survey work done. Of course, if you think about the way these windows were -- the field survey work has to be done in a period where there is no snow on the ground so that does put some risk into our schedule that obviously is in the reason that we pushed some of these back because if we don't get those surveys done before snowfall, and it certainly it looks like that's not going to be the case, then we've get a way to get those final surveys done once we've seen -- sorry, seen things go out there. So that really is what's driving some of that schedule pushback so again, seems like a simple 2 months but it does complicate things in terms of getting those surveys done in a timely enough manner. I will say this about Atlantic Sunrise. This is a situation where the regulatory agencies are being very cautious, given all the environmental opposition and has been focused around pipelines of late, we think that's prudent and I would tell you the Government work has been very steadfast in his support for the project and really all of the critical infrastructure -- energy infrastructure project in Pennsylvania and he continues to be clear in his report through that, through his legislature and other elected officials in the state and we really do appreciate his cooperation as he has a lot of issues to balance, but we certainly support the governor in making sure that the resources are developed in a way that protects of environment and the health of the citizen and we share his commitment and look forward to our continued work to pay debt there which is the regulatory agency in Pennsylvania to meet all these objectives.
So feeling very good about the degree of cooperation and support that we're getting from the state of Pennsylvania, but it's just a matter of people being very cautious in the environments that we're operating. With that, let's move on to Slide 6.
You can see here the key growth drivers for 2017. Of course, the obvious stuff is the full year impact of a lot of these projects that came on midyear. And then a lot of new projects that will be coming on in '17 that you can see listed here. And then, of course, the full year cost-reduction efforts will show up in 2017 as well as likely some additional contributions from the streamlining that I mentioned earlier.
Another consideration, of course, is just the impact that a normal winter would have on the Northeast local market demand for the regional consumption there in the Northeast. And so if you think about that, there's 2 ways for guest to move out of those gathering systems in the Northeast. One is the takeaway capacity, we're certainly anxious to see the latest Brexit expansion come on here towards the end of this year. But in addition to that, we also have the regional consumption and with the very mild winter we have last year, we are hoping to see some incremental demand that would drive gathering volumes in the Northeast as well.
Moving on here to Slide 7. Really excited about the strengthening of our board and what's going on here with in the third quarter as we've added 5 new numbers to the Williams board. And we're in the process of recruiting 2 additional members. The 5 new members are certainly energy industry experts and each brings significant experience and have unique perspectives they're bringing to the table. I can tell you firsthand that the new directors, Steve Burke, Steve Tatian, Peter Rexall, Scott Sheffield and Bill had hit the ground running and are very engaged in helping us maximize shareholder value.
They're working with the rest of the highly qualified and independent board to keep the management team accountable and focused on our execution as that continues to deliver shareholder value. I do want to take a moment here to just recognize 3 members of the board to have chosen not to stand for reelection at our annual meeting in November in order to support our ongoing board refreshment efforts. And that is Joe Cleveland, John Haig, Juanita Henshaw, and really all 3 have given tremendous services to Williams over the years. They've been involved with us and we're extremely grateful for for their leadership, commitment to the company and to our stockholders.
Williams' stockholders can certainly be confident that this independent board is working diligently on their behalf and we, as a management team, are really excited about that. With that, we'll move on to Slide 8.
So today, the premier natural gas asset base in the nation is delivering fee-based revenue that amounts to about 93% of WPZ's gross margins. There's tremendous demand growth occurring and continuing to come down the pipe and Transco is the energy lifeline that physically connects Williams' to that growth.
The team has delivered continuous growth in the third quarter of '16 is no exception. We believe that the natural-gas-focused strategy that we're executing on has exactly where we need to be today and well positioned for a large degree of upside in the future as the natural gas market grows on the back of this very low-cost resource base and we'll really drawing on the Northeast and drive strong growth in our volumes in the Northeast as that occurs.
We're continuing to capture fee-based opportunities. We're reinvesting in Williams Partners and we've taken swift, decisive actions to strengthen the balance sheet, reduced risk and focus on driving shareholder value. So once again, we thank you very much for joining us today, and with that, let's move on to questions."

I'll take the first part of that and I'll turn the second half over there to Don to the financial side of that. In terms of the schedule, I think a couple of key things that are coming through in the change in schedule. First of all, really excited to be announcing that we're going to be able to bring on the mainline portion of that project, which is obviously really important in the Northeast to take gas out of the Northeast down into the southeast markets. So we'll be able to do that in the second half of 2017. So that's pretty exciting. Then there's another section that we likely would be able to the non-which would be the pipeline, the new pipeline itself. That would come on the second and soon as it is constructed, we'll come on second. And then finally, and this is where that final date that we talked about will be the compressor stations that are on the new pipeline, not the existing but brand-new compression stations that will come on the add some incremental volume to the project. And that part come on 6 months after the mid-'18 so as you would call that end of '18 or first part of '19 is going to splitting hairs a little bit there perhaps but that is what our expectations are. But I think very important is the amount of volumes that we can bring on with the first section coming online in the second half of '17 and then later, the pipeline section that would be carrying gas out of Susquehanna County and Bradford County areas and that would be coming on ahead of at that final arrangement would be in our risk financial system would be either buried again in a waiting. And so I think in terms of clarifying that, our team is very focused on bringing this mid-'18 date to reality and -- but please, as always, we put further financial risk onto our plan to allow for all the regulatory uncertainties that all of us in the pipeline industry are facing these days. So with that, I'll turn it over to Don to talk about the financings side."

So we don't have any specifics on that yet in terms of how much that EBITDA would be, but it will allow for some pretty significant flows to the south coming out of the Southeast Pennsylvania, the mainline in Southeast Pennsylvania area there. So there are big interconnects coming off of other pipelines will now have a way south. I think if you think about how the demand would look, all you need to look at is some 6 on Transco versus the southeast market do that differential there and you would see them out of demand available for that capacity. So we're not goingn to pin that down yet because we haven't finalized the negotiations for that but it is, obviously, there's plenty of demand for that service."

Certainly, the big driver for second versus third quarter and 3Q was having both the tubular bells business online and remember, that had 30 days of shut in, in the second quarter as we tied in and we did some of the work for the tie-in of Gunflint in that second quarter. So second quarter is abnormally low due to that big shut in. But here in the third quarter, the load Kodiak, Gunflint and Tubular Bells were all producing and so some improvements are going on out there. In fact, we've completed a mechanical completion on the second phase of the Gunflint capacity out there. So a lot of important work still going on there in terms of enabling further flow. So that was a big driver by then as we did mention the [indiscernible] plant was down and our team went to work very quickly to make some big offshore interconnect in the July timeframe, June and July timeframe that enables us to bring the gas in very quickly. So great work on that team's part in getting that work first getting permitted  and then very quickly bringing it on. So that didn't just fall in our laps, it was great work on the team's part to get that in.

So said another way, it's not going to be finite because we don't know exactly what the other interconnects are capable of delivering into that. Secondly, the pipeline portion what's called the central pan, I think we refer to as not North Central pan coming out of Susquehanna County, that pipeline will be capable of delivering a very large portion of the volumes from the north without the compression during most of the year.

First of all, on the overhead management side, our team is very committed to continue the pressure against the overhead cost out of our business, as well as direct operating expense. When you go in for an area, for instance, like the Northeast and you are rapidly going things it's very hard to really streamline your operations and really focus on cost reduction at the same time you're trying to build up staff, train people and get your operation safe and reliable. So that business, as it gained its scale and as its footprint is very well positioned and how to really take out some cost, likewise, our Central areas has done a tremendous job there because if you think about the pattern of growth and buildout that had gone there for several years, that has slowed down in terms of that pattern of buildout and so the team has, and management team has done a great job of redirecting their focus of the management team on safe and reliable and even more cost-efficient operations. And, of course, out West, that team has taken that on kind of the mantra and are very, very focused on constantly lowering their unit costs. So that's really driving a lot of that in terms of the cost reduction. I do think it's sustainable, on the one hand. On the other hand, I will tell you that as we go into the pipeline operations, a lot of need to make sure that these pipelines are maintained extremely well and I always tell people, I think that's a really terrible place to try to save money is in the place of doing a great job of maintaining your asset safely and particularly in this critical areas along the Transco and Northwest pipeline and Gulfstream route. And so that's an area that I think you've seen a little bit in this quarter, we had a lot of hydro testing and repairs on hydro system and quite frankly, we're not going to shy away from improving those systems there whenever we have an opportunity to do that. So that's the cost side that we'll probably continue be pressures up on the one side, but I think on the cost efficiency site and overall day-to-day cost, we'll continue to have opportunity to pursue that down."

It's very dependent on what outlook markets each of that gathering volume, I would say, some of the big players that have done a great job, and I would include caveat on that group that have done a great job of going out and finding incremental market with their local power generation that's coming on and have really used their scale to go out aggressively and capture some of those markets will be the parties that are advantaged. And so this isn't the first time that we as an industry have seen like this. We saw this in the Rockies back when we had $2.75 basis differentials and it worked itself out over time. People started to think it was never going to come over that barrier and today, we sit there with basis differentials of around 5% if you hop in the West in the Rockies today. So I think we'll eventually get there. But it is a complex question just given all the number of projects that are coming on and the interconnectivity of the pipelines to be able to address that. So I would say, I think, the Southwest markets probably are -- we're going to be picking up, hopefully, the rest expansion here in the very near future, which will be helpful to that area. And then I think Atlantic Sunrise will be the next big area as we unload those gas trapped in zone 6 on Transco with those projects coming online. And I do think that will, to your question, I do think that Atlantic Sunrise coming on will improve the dominion south bases just because you have so much capacity between coming over on the team project that we'll have a chance to move itself as well. That's pretty well trapped out there in that zone 6 area today. So I think it's going to take time for all these projects to come on but I do think that we will see that basis collapse pretty substantially as we get into '18."

Now Transco's a good example of that we're we have lighting limited on capacity here most of the summer. And that just got released. And so that was held back because we had pressure limitations on that pipeline that we need to do some inspection before we return the full pressure. We have than that and so that's -- will be a positive in terms of incremental volumes out of the area. I actually think the biggest driver for incremental volumes out of the area is going to be the local load as we have, hopefully, have a more normal winter in the Northeast. That's actually going to allow for local load to absorb some of that gas. And if that occurs, there will be some incremental IT up on days when we could lower volumes out of the system because we've got good pressures and good load in the area. So I think that's what probably the biggest driver for incremental ID is probably local load on the basin."

And it allows Chesapeake to go out and explore those economically and see what the upside may be.

As you can see, from this quarter's results, our organization is firi",3024,"Great. Well, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We're glad you've been able to join us this morning and look forward to discussing our third quarter results here this morning. As you can see, from this quarter's results, our organization is firing on all cylinders, and it continues to capture opportunities, as we execute against our proven natural gas focused strategy.
We're very confident about where we stand today and our team is aligned and excited about all the great prospects that we've got in front of us. We've been taking decisive actions to enable steady, predictable growth in our EBITDA by steadily increasing our fee-based revenues, lowering our cost and positioning our portfolio of assets to capture growing natural gas volumes.
We're making progress on many fronts as we work to execute on our strategy to drive predictable, long-term, sustainable growth. We've brought new projects online, renegotiated some win-win contracts with Chesapeake, and expect to close on a new agreement in the Barnett soon. And we also completed the sale of our Canadian assets, and as you are aware, we also now kicked off a process for our Geismar assets is now in full -- that process is now in full swing.
On the cost savings front, since our cost reduction efforts were initiated at the end of the first quarter this year, we've seen approximately $76 million of lower adjusted cost and expenses at WPZ versus the prior year, and that's all while continuing to add additional new projects and grow the business. Specifically, we've seen WPZ's total cost and expenses decline from 55% of 2015 adjusted EBITDA to 47% in 2016 for the first 9 months. So an important metric that we're taking into account there, and continue to push that cost component down to a lower percentage of our overall adjusted EBITDA. We continue to implement steps to further lower our cost by streamlining our organization. And to date, headcount has been reduced by a little over 13% since the beginning of this year.
So today, we'll walk through our results, and provide some perspective on where we are relative to guidance and financial performance. Our results here in the third quarter certainly validate the hard work of our teams across Williams. We'll also give an updated -- sorry, we'll also provide some update on the Atlantic Sunrise project, and highlight some of the key growth drivers that are now in the horizon. So let's move on to Slide 2. Here, as you can see, Williams Partners delivered net income of $326 million, as measured by GAAP and in terms of adjusted EBITDA, every segment of WPZ contributed to the 8% improvement over the third quarter of last year. Our DCF for the quarter was $795 million, which was an increase of 5% over the third quarter of '15.
As we've been doing consistently, we delivered fee-based revenue growth, and we continue to benefit from the aggressive cost reduction activities we've been working on this year. We achieved the coverage ratio of 1.08 at WPZ for the quarter, which excludes the benefit of $150 million IDR waiver that was associated with the sale of our Canadian assets, and as you all know, that sale was finalized, I believe, on September 23. Overall, the quarter's results continue to demonstrate that our strategies is on the mark. So let's just touch briefly on a few of the operating areas, first of all, in the Atlantic-Gulf. The Atlantic-Gulf continues to deliver solid results, as we put projects into service that are capturing more and more the demand on the Transco system. Our adjusted EBITDA came in at $427 million for the quarter compared with $414 million for the third quarter of last year. And for the year, Atlantic-Gulf's adjusted EBITDA increased $53 million, primarily -- sorry, so far year-to-date, primarily due to fee-based revenues from offshore operation and Transco's new expansion projects.
The quarter also benefited from incremental volumes that came into our Mobile Bay system from the Destin Pipeline system, as we were providing service to volumes that were stranded behind Enterprise's  Pascagoula Processing Plant.
We did see increased operating expenses related to pipeline testing activities as we continue to proactively focus on safety and regulatory programs along our Transco pipeline. Obviously, given the tremendous growth on the Transco system, we continue to focus on and ensure the safety and reliability of this critical piece of infrastructure. And so solid results in the Atlantic-Gulf, as we'll see later, lots of things coming down the pipe to prepare for the tremendous growth in the sector of our business.
Moving on now to our Central, Northeast and West, I'd like to cover our nonregulated midstream set of businesses here because we continue to see some common themes emerging across all of these operating areas. First of all, we have grown our adjusted EBITDA versus the prior year for both the quarter, and also year-to-date. As you can see, from the chart on this slide, Central is up about 7%; Northeast, up 3%; and West, up 3% on a quarter-to-quarter comparison.
All 3 of these businesses reported lower operating costs during the quarter. Our leaders and teams are very focused on preserving operational cash flows in today's slower supply growth environment, and we continue to see the benefits of that show up in our results.
A specific note about the Northeast because I know there's always a lot of extra interest in this particular area. We continue to see steady to slightly increasing volumes there, but remains -- but this area remains in significant need of incremental takeaway capacity and market in the area.
We believe that both the local and the national demand growth is going to really unlock the area over the next couple of years. But in the meantime, we're staying very focused on the cost containment, and achieving the best results for our customers.
Getting all of these critical new midstream place as well has us positioned for when this tremendous slow cost resource really comes on in the next couple of years. And we really do believe that the natural gas demand that we're seeing on the Transco system will call on these constraint supplies once the infrastructure that connects that comes online. The unleashing of this resource and expected dramatic growth in the gathering volumes from this area represents tremendous upside beyond the more visible demand side growth that shows up in our CapEx.
On the NGL Petchem side, we saw an increase in adjusted EBITDA, driven by higher olefins margins and strong operational production levels. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased by $51 million to $136 million in the third quarter of '15. And as I mentioned earlier, we also completed the sale of our Canadian assets, and we are off and running in a big way on our process to monetize Geismar. This Geismar facility and the complex there really is a great asset, and we believe it's a good time to be in the market with the asset. There's a lot of very smart players in this segment and the recognition of just how well-placed this sufficient plant is in the Mississippi River market.
So let's move on now to Slide 3. As we've been saying, our natural-gas-focused strategy is proving out and our over year-to-date performance certainly validates that. Year-to-date through third quarter of this year, WPZ delivered $286 million in net income and nearly $2.3 billion in DCF, up 8% over the same period last year, and we also achieved a year-to-date coverage ratio of 1.04 at WPZ here so far in '16.
I'm also pleased to report that we expect to exceed our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance, and also expect to hold coverage above 1.0, as measured for all of 2016 even with the expected seasonal increase in maintenance CapEx that we generally see in the fourth quarter.
As you can see, all of our operating areas are ahead of where they were a year ago, and you can see the results were focused on increased fee-based revenues, cost reductions and the full production and higher margins coming through at Geismar.
Let's move on to Slide 4. This is a list of a lot of what's going on, and I'm not going to go through each of these items. But really, the important thing is here is this long list of accomplishments that the team continues to execute on, and so this -- what's really impressive about this is all of the activity that we've got going on that's driving our growth for the future. Just to mention a few here, highlight a few. First of all, look at the number of projects that we began construction on in this quarter, and so the Dalton, Hillabee Ph. 1, the New York Bay expansion and Virginia Southside II. Our teams really have pushed through the permitting Gunflint on these projects, and are now really focused on safety constructing these important expansion projects. We also have a number of projects who are already under construction.
Moving down on the list, the Geismar process, as I mentioned earlier, we have 1 step process, and we're really excited about the degree of interest we're seeing there.
And then, finally, on the coming soon down part there, just in addition to all the projects that we've got going on, we are making a move to simplify our organization further here in 2017. We're moving from 5 operating areas to 3 operating areas, which is going to enable some further cost reductions over and above those that we captured here in 2016.
Moving on to Slide 5. Picture now Atlantic Sunrise, lots of questions, of course, coming out of the announcement from FERC that they were pushing back their approval by about 2 months. So Atlantic Sunrise is a very key piece of energy infrastructure that is going to drive, not just jobs in the Northeast and I think with Pennsylvania, but really the overall national economy, as these low costs, very strong gas supplies here in the Northeast are going to enable manufacturing power generation, and a lot of new trade around the world, for markets around the world for our low cost natural gas here in the U.S.
So the Atlantic Sunrise system really does have a unique advantage in that it's one of the few of these major projects that takes advantage of the existing Transco infrastructure and by building the segment that we have that's just new pipeline in Pennsylvania, all contained within the state of Pennsylvania. We're going to be able to end -- reach markets in a very significant way, all the way into the Southeast markets where there's a lot of growing demand via coal conversions, natural gas power generation, the industrial markets, and of course, the LNG facility at co-point there, is an important market for those supplies as well.
So we announced on last Friday that we expect to begin a portion of service during the second half of '17, and that we've revised the targeted full in-service date for mid-2018. I would note that, as we have previously, that our financial plan further risks the cash flows by approximately 6 months, and we've already adjusted our growth capital guidance to reflect this analysis.
We revised this date because FERC now anticipate the completion date of the FEIS for Atlantic Sunrise, and will be pushed back to December 30 of 2016. This adjustment will allow more time for the agency to complete a general conformity -- sorry, conformity analysis and review 2 minor route alternatives. Additionally, we're focused on expediting the work required to obtain other key permits within the State of Pennsylvania.
To drive a little context more on this, the construction schedule on a project as large as Atlantic Sunrise is very tightly sequenced. Even a minor 2-month delay on one aspect can have a ripple effect on other components of the project schedule, some of which are dependent upon lining up with the narrow environmental schedule.
So the good news is we've got about 96% of the survey work done. That means the land owners are cooperating with us in a way to get the survey work done and we are pushing ahead to get the remaining 4% of that done. So a lot of activity going on to get the survey work done. Of course, if you think about the way these windows were -- the field survey work has to be done in a period where there's not any snow on the ground, and so that does put some risk into our schedule that obviously is the reason that we push some of these back because if we don't get those surveys done before snowfall, and it certainly looks like that's not going to be the case, then we've get a way to get those final surveys done once we've seen -- sorry, seen things fall out there. So that really is what's driving some of that schedule pushback. So again, seems like a simple 2 months, but it does complicate things in terms of getting those surveys done in a timely enough manner. I will say this about Atlantic Sunrise. This is a situation where the regulatory agencies are being very cautious, given all the environmental opposition, and has been focused around pipelines of late. We think that's prudent, and I would tell you that Government work has been very steadfast in his support for the project and really all of the critical -- energy infrastructure project in Pennsylvania, and he continues to be clear in his support through that with his legislature and with other elected officials in the state, and we really do appreciate his cooperation, as he has a lot of issues to balance, but we certainly support the governor in making sure that the resources are developed in a way that protects of environment and the health of the citizen, and we share his commitment and look forward to our continued work to pay debt there, which is the regulatory agency in Pennsylvania to meet all these objectives. So feeling very good about the degree of cooperation and support that we're getting from the state of Pennsylvania, but it's just a matter of people being very cautious in the environment that we're operating. 
With that, let's move on to Slide 6. You can see here the key growth drivers for 2017. Of course, the obvious stuff is the full year impact of a lot of these projects that came on midyear. And then a lot of new projects that will be coming on in '17 that you can see listed here. And then, of course, the full year cost reduction efforts will show up in 2017, as well as likely some additional contributions from the streamlining that I mentioned earlier.
Another consideration, of course, is just the impact that a normal winter would have on the Northeast local market demand for the regional consumption there in the Northeast. And so if you think about that, there's 2 ways for gas to move out of those gathering systems in the Northeast. One is via takeaway capacity. We're certainly anxious to see the latest REX expansion come on here towards the end of this year. But in addition to that, we also have the regional consumption and with the very mild winter we have last year, we are hoping to see some incremental demand that would drive gathering volumes in the Northeast as well.
Moving on here to Slide 7. Really excited about the strengthening of our board and what's going on here with in the third quarter, as we've added 5 new numbers to the Williams board, and we're in the process of recruiting 2 additional members. The 5 new members are certainly energy industry experts, and each brings significant experience, and have unique perspectives they're bringing to the table. I can tell you firsthand that the new directors: Stephen Bergstrom, Steven Chazen, Peter Ragauss, Scott Sheffield and Bill Spence, have hit the ground running, and are very engaged in helping us maximize shareholder value.
They're working with the rest of the highly qualified and independent board to keep the management team accountable, and focused on our execution, as that continues to deliver shareholder value. I do want to take a moment here to just recognize 3 members of the board to have chosen not to stand for reelection at our Annual Meeting in November in order to support our ongoing board refreshment efforts, and that is Joe Cleveland, John Hagg, Juanita Hinshaw, and really, all 3 have given tremendous service to Williams over the years. They've been involved with us, and we're extremely grateful for their leadership, commitment to the company and to our stockholders.
Williams' stockholders can certainly be confident that this independent board is working diligently on behalf, and we, as a management team, are really excited about that. 
With that, we'll move on to Slide 8. So today, the premier natural gas asset base in the nation is delivering fee-based revenue that amounts to about 93% of WPZ's gross margin. There's tremendous demand growth occurring and continuing to come down the pipe, and Transco is the energy lifeline that physically connects Williams to that growth.
The team has delivered continuous growth, and the third quarter of '16 is no exception. We believe that the natural-gas-focused strategy that we're executing on has us exactly where we need to be today and well positioned for a large degree of upside in the future, as the natural gas market grows on the back of this very low-cost resource base, and will really draw on the Northeast and drive strong growth in our volumes in the Northeast as that occurs.
We're continuing to capture fee-based opportunities. We're reinvesting in Williams Partners and we've taken swift, decisive actions to strengthen the balance sheet, reduced risk and focus on driving shareholder value. So once again, we thank you very much for joining us today, and with that, let's move on to questions."

I would say on the sales side, of course, it's going to be a party that we're confident that can close the transaction swiftly and puts the very best value proposition on the table. As to the tolling arrangement, a little more dependent on the personal nature there because having somebody we would be involved with for the long-term, and of course, it would have to be somebody with a strong credit to stand behind the obligations, the tolling agreements. So I would just say, we remain open to both, but we'll have to see what the best value comes through there.

I'll take the first part of that, and I'll turn the second half over there to Don to the financial side of that. In terms of the schedule, I think a couple of key things that are coming through in the change in the schedule. First of all, really excited to be announcing that we're going to be able to bring on the mainline portion of that project, which is obviously really important in the Northeast to take gas out of the Northeast down into the southeast markets. So we'll be able to do that in the second half of 2017. So that's pretty exciting. Then there's another section that we likely would be able to bring on which would be the pipeline, the new pipeline itself that would come on second. And soon as it is constructed, would come on second. And then finally, and this is where that final date that we talked about, would be the compressor stations that are on the new pipeline, not the existing but brand-new compressor stations that would come on to add some incremental volume to the project. And that part would come on 6 months after the mid '18, so as you want to call that, end of '18 or first part of '19 is going to -- splitting hairs a little bit there, perhaps, but that is what our expectations are. But I think very important is the amount of volumes that we can bring on with the first section coming online in the second half of '17, and then later, the pipeline section that would be carrying gas out of Susquehanna County and Bradford County areas and that would be coming on ahead of that final section, which would be in our risk financial segment, would be either very end of '18. And so I think in terms of the -- clarifying that, our team is very focused on bringing this mid-'18 date to reality and -- but we, as always, we put further financial risk into our plan to allow for all the regulatory uncertainties that all of us in the pipeline industry are facing these days. So with that, I'll turn it over to Don to talk about the financing side of it."

We get credit from the agencies, and we continue to delever WPZ and WMB. But nonetheless, the fact that there's less of a bubble in 2017, I think, is helpful in terms of '17's financing plan. But I think, as you pointed out, it does push some of the capital into 2018. As to how we'll finance that, we're not prepared to provide any guidance on that today."

So we don't have any specifics on that yet in terms of how much that EBITDA would be, but it will allow for some pretty significant flows to the south coming out of the Southeast Pennsylvania -- the mainline in Southeast Pennsylvania area there. So other big interconnects coming off of other pipelines will now have a way south. And I think if you think about how that demand would look, all you need to look at is Zone 6 on Transco versus the southeast market. Do that differential there, and you would see the amount of demand that would be available for that capacity. So we're not going to pin that down yet because we haven't finalized the negotiations for that, but it is -- obviously, there's plenty of demand for that service."

As to your specific question about inventory, we came out of the first quarter with about 30 million pounds of inventory. We sold some -- we sold our full production during this past quarter. We held some inventory coming through this quarter, but an expectation that -- we pushed that expectation out into the fourth quarter because we still do have a belief that some of these crackers that had been challenged in the third quarter will remain to be challenged in the fourth, and we may still see some better margins. So we actually, coming through the third quarter, built a little bit of inventory here on hopes that now the fourth quarter's going to give us a little bit of a better return on that."

So second quarter, abnormally low because of that big shut in. But here, in the third quarter, both Kodiak, Gunflint and Tubular Bells were all producing, and so some improvements are going on out there. In fact, we've completed the mechanical completion on the second phase of the Gunflint capacity out there. So a lot of important work still going on out there in terms of enabling further flows. So that was the big driver, but -- and then as we did mention, the Pascagoula plant was down, and our team went to work very quickly to make some big offshore interconnect in -- I think in the July timeframe, June and July timeframe that enabled us to bring that gas in very quickly. So great work on the team's part of getting that work -- first, getting it permitted, and then very quickly bringing it on. So that didn't just fall in our laps. It was great work on the team's part to get that in. We expect that, I think, Enterprise said they expect to start bringing Pascagoula back up in December now, and so we would expect to get a couple of months in now here in the fourth quarter from that. And in terms of impact, I don't think we specifically said how much that was, but you can see some of the impact to our volume. I think, we have about 200 million a day, maybe 210 of volume that's come in to the system from that, just to get an idea of what that's done together in volumes in the Eastern Gulf."

Absolutely no MBC, and what our projected volume and revenue difference was during the period through mid-2019 when the MBCs ended.

So said another way, it's not going to be finite because we don't know exactly what the other interconnects are capable of delivering into that. Secondly, the pipeline portion, what's called the Central Penn, and what we used to refer to as not North Central Penn coming out of Susquehanna County, that pipeline will be capable of delivering a very large portion of the volumes from the north without the compression during most of the year. And so in other words, it's depending on other operating conditions on the pipeline, but it will be a very substantial portion of the available volumes from the north."

First of all, on the overhead management side, our team is very committed to continue to put pressure against the overhead cost out of our business, as well as your direct operating expense. When you go in to an area, for instance, like the Northeast, and you are rapidly growing things, it's very hard to really streamline your operations and really focus on cost reduction, at the same time, you're trying to build up staff, train people and get your operation safe and reliable. And so that business, as its gained its scale and its footprint is very well positioned. And now to really take out some costs, likewise, our Central area has just done a tremendous job there because if you think about the pattern of growth and buildout that had gone there for several years, that has slowed down in terms of that pattern of buildout. And so the team has -- and management team has done a great job of redirecting their focus as a management team on safe and reliable and even more cost-efficient operations. And of course, out West, that team has taken that on kind of as our mantra, and you're very, very focused on constantly lowering their unit cost. So that's really driving a lot of that in terms of the cost reduction. I do think it's sustainable on the one hand. On the other hand, I would tell you that as we go into the pipeline operations, a lot of need to make sure that these pipelines are maintained extremely well. And I always tell people, I think that's a really terrible place to try to save money, is in the place of doing a great job of maintaining your asset safely and particularly in these critical areas along the Transco and Northwest Pipeline and Gulfstream routes. And so that's an area that I think you've seen a little bit in this quarter. We had a lot of hydro testing and repairs on IT system. And quite frankly, we're not going to shy away from improving the systems there whenever we have an opportunity to do that. And so that's the cost side that we'll probably continue to pressures us up on the one side. But I think on the cost efficiency site and overall day-to-day cost, we'll continue to have opportunity to push that down."

It's very dependent on what outlet markets each of that gathering volumes. I would say. Some of the big players that have done a great job, and I would include caveat in that group that have done a great job of going out and finding incremental markets, whether it's local power generation that's coming on and have really used their scale to go out aggressively and capture some of those markets, will be the parties that are advantaged. And so this isn't the first time, we as an industry, have seen something like this. We saw this in the Rockies, back when we had $2.75 basis differential and it worked itself out over time. People started to think it was never going to -- we were never going to come over that barrier, and today, we sit there with basis differentials of around 5% -- or often less in the Rockies today. So I think we'll eventually get there. But it is a complex question, just given all the number of projects that are coming on and the inter-connectivity of the pipelines to be able to address that. So I would say that I think the Southwest markets probably are -- we're going to be picking up, hopefully, the REX expansion here in the very near future, which will be helpful to that area. And then I think Atlantic Sunrise will be the next big add to that area as we unload all that gas trapped up in Zone 6 on Transco, with those projects coming online. And I do think that will, to your question, I do think that Atlantic Sunrise coming on will improve the Dominion South bases, just because you've got so much capacity between coming over on the Tmax project that will have a chance to move south as well. That's pretty well trapped up there in that Zone 6 area today. So I think it's going to take time for all these projects to come on, but I do think that we will see that basis collapse pretty substantially as we get into '18."

And I would tell you, I think the market has been in this situation long enough now up there. It's probably ruled out most of the easy stuff in terms of little IT. Now Transco's a good example of that where we've had Leidy limited on capacity here most of the summer, and that just got released. And so that was held back because we had some pressure limitations on that pipeline that we were -- we needed to do some inspection before we return the full pressure. We've done that, and so that's a big -- will be a positive in terms of incremental volumes out of the area. I actually think the biggest driver for incremental volumes out of the area is going to be the local load, as we have, hopefully, have a more normal winter in the Northeast. That's actually going to allow for local load to absorb some of that gas. And if that occurs, there will be some incremental IT opportunities on days when we could move volumes out of the system because we've got good pressures and good load in the area. So I think that's what -- probably the biggest driver for incremental IT is probably local load in the basin."

So we got dedication of additional formations that we didn't have previously. And it allows Chesapeake to go out and explore those economically and see what the upside may be.

Well, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We're glad you've been able to join us this morning and look forward to discussing our third quarter results here this morning. As you can see, from this quarter's results, our organization is fi",3020,"Great. Well, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We're glad you've been able to join us this morning and look forward to discussing our third quarter results here this morning. 
As you can see, from this quarter's results, our organization is firing on all cylinders, and it continues to capture opportunities, as we execute against our proven natural gas focused strategy. We're very confident about where we stand today and our team is aligned and excited about all the great prospects that we've got in front of us. 
We've been taking decisive actions to enable steady, predictable growth in our EBITDA by steadily increasing our fee-based revenues, lowering our cost and positioning our portfolio of assets to capture growing natural gas volumes.
We're making progress on many fronts as we work to execute on our strategy to drive predictable, long-term, sustainable growth. We've brought new projects online, renegotiated some win-win contracts with Chesapeake, and expect to close on a new agreement in the Barnett soon. And we also completed the sale of our Canadian assets, and as you are aware, we also have now kicked off a process for our Geismar assets that's now in full -- that process is now in full swing.
On the cost savings front, since our cost-reduction efforts were initiated at the end of the first quarter this year, we've seen approximately $76 million of lower adjusted cost and expenses at WPZ versus the prior year, and that's all while continuing to add additional new projects and grow the business. Specifically, we've seen WPZ's total cost and expenses decline from 55% of 2015 adjusted EBITDA to 47% in 2016 for the first 9 months. So an important metric that we're taking into account there, and continue to push that cost component down to a lower percentage of our overall adjusted EBITDA. We continue to implement steps to further lower our cost by streamlining our organization. And to date, headcount has been reduced by a little over 13% since the beginning of this year.
So today, we'll walk through our results, and provide some perspective on where we are relative to guidance and financial performance. Our results here in the third quarter certainly validate the hard work of our teams across Williams. We'll also give an updated -- sorry, we'll also provide some update on the Atlantic Sunrise project, and highlight some of the key growth drivers that are now in the horizon. 
So let's move on to Slide 2. Here, as you can see, Williams Partners delivered net income of $326 million, as measured by GAAP; and in terms of adjusted EBITDA, every segment of WPZ contributed to the 8% improvement over the third quarter of last year. Our DCF for the quarter was $795 million, which was an increase of 5% over the third quarter of '15.
As we've been doing consistently, we delivered fee-based revenue growth, and we continue to benefit from the aggressive cost-reduction activities we've been working on this year. We achieved a coverage ratio of 1.08 at WPZ for the quarter, which excludes the benefit of $150 million IDR waiver that was associated with the sale of our Canadian assets, and as you all know, that sale was finalized, I believe, on September 23. 
Overall, the quarter's results continue to demonstrate that our strategy is on the mark. So let's just touch briefly on a few of the operating areas, first of all, in the Atlantic-Gulf. The Atlantic-Gulf continues to deliver solid results, as we put projects into service that are capturing more and more the demand on the Transco system. Our adjusted EBITDA came in at $427 million for the quarter compared with $414 million for the third quarter of last year. And for the year, Atlantic-Gulf's adjusted EBITDA increased $53 million, primarily -- sorry, so far year-to-date, primarily due to fee-based revenues from offshore operations and Transco's new expansion projects.
The quarter also benefited from incremental volumes that came into our Mobile Bay system from the Destin Pipeline system, as we were providing service to volumes that were stranded behind Enterprise's Pascagoula Processing Plant.
We did see increased operating expenses related to pipeline testing activities as we continue to proactively focus on safety and regulatory programs along our Transco pipeline. Obviously, given the tremendous growth on the Transco system, we continue to focus on and ensure the safety and reliability of this critical piece of infrastructure. And so solid results in the Atlantic-Gulf. As we'll see later, lots of things coming down the pipe to prepare for the tremendous growth in the sector of our business.
Moving on now to our Central, Northeast and West, I'd like to cover our nonregulated midstream set of businesses here because we continue to see some common themes emerging across all of these operating areas. First of all, we have grown our adjusted EBITDA versus the prior year for both the quarter and also year-to-date. As you can see, from the chart on this slide, Central is up about 7%; Northeast, up 3%; and West, up 3% on a quarter-to-quarter comparison.
All 3 of these businesses reported lower operating costs during the quarter. Our leaders and teams are very focused on preserving operational cash flows in today's slower supply growth environment, and we continue to see the benefits of that show up in our results.
A specific note about the Northeast because I know there's always a lot of extra interest in this particular area. We continue to see steady to slightly increasing volumes there, but remains -- but this area remains in significant need of incremental takeaway capacity and market in the area.
We believe that both the local and the national demand growth is going to really unlock the area over the next couple of years. But in the meantime, we're staying very focused on the cost containment and achieving the best results for our customers.
Getting all of this critical new midstream in place as well has us positioned for when this tremendous low-cost resource really comes on in the next couple of years. And we really do believe that the natural gas demand that we're seeing on the Transco system will call on these constrained supplies once the infrastructure that connects that comes online. The unleashing of this resource and expected dramatic growth in the gathering volumes from this area represents tremendous upside beyond the more visible demand side growth that shows up in our CapEx.
On the NGL Petchem side, we saw an increase in adjusted EBITDA, driven by higher olefins margins and strong operational production levels. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased by $51 million to $136 million in the third quarter of '15. And as I mentioned earlier, we also completed the sale of our Canadian assets, and we are off and running in a big way on our process to monetize Geismar. This Geismar facility and the complex there really is a great asset, and we believe it's a good time to be in the market with the asset. There's a lot of very smart players in this segment and a recognition of just how well-placed this sufficient plant is in the Mississippi River market.
So let's move on now to Slide 3. As we've been saying, our natural gas-focused strategy is proving out and our over year-to-date performance certainly validates that. Year-to-date through third quarter of this year, WPZ delivered $286 million in net income and nearly $2.3 billion in DCF, up 8% over the same period last year, and we also achieved a year-to-date coverage ratio of 1.04 at WPZ here so far in '16.
I'm also pleased to report that we expect to exceed our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance, and also expect to hold coverage above 1.0, as measured for all of 2016 even with the expected seasonal increase in maintenance CapEx that we generally see in the fourth quarter.
As you can see, all of our operating areas are ahead of where they were a year ago, and you can see the results of our focus on increased fee-based revenues, cost reductions and the full production and higher margins coming through at Geismar.
Let's move on to Slide 4. This is a list of a lot of what's going on, and I'm not going to go through each of these items. But really, the important thing is here is this long list of accomplishments that the team continues to execute on, and so this -- what's really impressive about this is all of the activity that we've got going on that's driving our growth for the future. 
Just to mention a few here, highlight a few. First of all, look at the number of projects that we began construction on in this quarter, and so the Dalton, Hillabee Ph. 1, the New York Bay expansion and Virginia Southside II. Our teams really have pushed through the permitting gauntlet on these projects, and are now really focused on safely constructing these important expansion projects. We also have a number of projects who are already under construction.
Moving down on the list, the Geismar process, as I mentioned earlier, we have 1-step process, and we're really excited about the degree of interest we're seeing there.
And then, finally, on the coming soon part down there, just in addition to the -- all the projects that we've got going on, we are making a move to simplify our organization further here in 2017. We're moving from 5 operating areas to 3 operating areas, which is going to enable some further cost reductions over and above those that we captured here in 2016.
Moving on to Slide 5. Picture now of Atlantic Sunrise, lots of questions, of course, coming out of the announcement from FERC that they were pushing back their approval by about 2 months. So Atlantic Sunrise is a very key piece of energy infrastructure that is going to drive not just jobs in the Northeast and particularly Pennsylvania, but really the overall national economy, as these low cost, very strong gas supplies here in the Northeast are going to enable manufacturing, power generation and a lot of new trade around the world, for markets around the world for our low-cost natural gas here in the U.S.
So the Atlantic Sunrise system really does have a unique advantage in that it's one of the few of these major projects that takes advantage of the existing Transco infrastructure. And by building the segment that we have that's just new pipeline in Pennsylvania, all contained within the state of Pennsylvania, we're going to be able to end -- reach markets in a very significant way, all the way into the Southeast markets where there's a lot of growing demand via coal conversions, natural gas power generation, the industrial markets and, of course, the LNG facility at co-point there, is an important market for those supplies as well.
So we announced on last Friday that we expect to begin a portion of service during the second half of '17, and that we've revised the targeted full in-service date for mid-2018. I would note that, as we have previously, that our financial plan further risks the cash flows by approximately 6 months, and we've already adjusted our growth capital guidance to reflect this analysis.
We revised these dates because FERC now anticipates the completion date of the FEIS for Atlantic Sunrise will be pushed back to December 30 of 2016. This adjustment will allow more time for the agency to complete a general conformity -- sorry, conformity analysis and review 2 minor route alternatives. Additionally, we're focused on expediting the work required to obtain other key permits within the State of Pennsylvania.
To provide a little more context on this, the construction schedule on a project as large as Atlantic Sunrise is very tightly sequenced. Even a minor 2-month delay on one aspect can have a ripple effect on other components of the project schedule, some of which are dependent upon lining up with the narrow environmental schedule.
So the good news is we've got about 96% of the survey work done. That means the landowners are cooperating with us in a way to get the survey work done and we are pushing ahead to get the remaining 4% of that done. So a lot of activity going on to get the survey work done. Of course, if you think about the way these windows work, the field survey work has to be done in a period where there's not any snow on the ground, and so that does put some risk into our schedule that, obviously, is the reason that we push some of this back. Because if we don't get those surveys done before snowfall, and it certainly looks like that's not going to be the case, then we've got a way to get those final surveys done once we've seen -- sorry, seen things fall out there. So that really is what's driving some of that schedule pushback. So again, seems like a simple 2 months, but it does complicate things in terms of getting those surveys done in a timely enough manner. 
I will say this about Atlantic Sunrise. This is a situation where the regulatory agencies are being very cautious, given all the environmental opposition that has been focused around pipelines of late. We think that's prudent. And I would tell you that Governor Wolf has been very steadfast in his support for the project and really all of the critical energy infrastructure project in Pennsylvania, and he continues to be clear in his support through that with his legislature and with other elected officials in the state, and we really do appreciate his cooperation, as he has a lot of issues to balance. But we certainly support the governor in making sure that the resources are developed in a way that protects the environment and the health of the citizen. And we share his commitment and look forward to our continued work with the PADEP there, which is the regulatory agency in Pennsylvania, to meet all these objectives. So feeling very good about the degree of cooperation and support that we're getting from the state of Pennsylvania, but it's just a matter of people being very cautious in the environment that we're operating. 
With that, let's move on to Slide 6. You can see here the key growth drivers for 2017. Of course, the obvious stuff is the full year impact of a lot of these projects that came on midyear. And then a lot of new projects that will be coming on in '17 that you can see listed here. And then, of course, the full year of cost-reduction efforts will show up in 2017, as well as likely some additional contributions from the streamlining that I mentioned earlier.
Another consideration, of course, is just the impact that a normal winter would have on the Northeast local market demand for the regional consumption there in the Northeast. And so if you think about that, there's 2 ways for gas to move out of those gathering systems in the Northeast. One is via takeaway capacity. We're certainly anxious to see the latest REX expansion come on here towards the end of this year. But in addition to that, we also have the regional consumption and with the very mild winter we have last year, we are hoping to see some incremental demand that would drive gathering volumes in the Northeast as well.
Moving on here to Slide 7. Really excited about the strengthening of our board and what's going on here within the third quarter, as we've added 5 new numbers to the Williams board, and we're in the process of recruiting 2 additional members. The 5 new members are certainly energy industry experts, and each brings significant experience, and have unique perspectives they're bringing to the table. I can tell you firsthand that the new directors: Steve Bergstrom, Steve Chazen, Peter Ragauss, Scott Sheffield and Bill Spence, have hit the ground running, and are very engaged in helping us maximize shareholder value.
They're working with the rest of the highly qualified and independent board to keep the management team accountable and focused on our execution, as that continues to deliver shareholder value. I do want to take a moment here to just recognize 3 members of the board who have chosen to not stand for reelection at our Annual Meeting in November in order to support our ongoing board refreshment efforts, and that is Joe Cleveland, John Hagg, Juanita Hinshaw, and really, all 3 have given tremendous service to Williams over the years they've been involved with us, and we're extremely grateful for their leadership, commitment to the company and to our stockholders.
Williams' stockholders can certainly be confident that this independent board is working diligently on behalf, and we, as a management team, are really excited about that. 
With that, we'll move on to Slide 8. So today, the premier natural gas asset base in the nation is delivering fee-based revenue that amounts to about 93% of WPZ's gross margin. There's tremendous demand growth occurring and continuing to come down the pipe, and Transco is the energy lifeline that physically connects Williams to that growth.
The team has delivered continuous growth, and the third quarter of '16 is no exception. We believe that the natural gas-focused strategy that we're executing on has us exactly where we need to be today and well positioned for a large degree of upside in the future, as the natural gas market grows on the back of this very low-cost resource base, and will really draw on the Northeast and drive strong growth in our volumes in the Northeast as that occurs.
We're continuing to capture fee-based opportunities. We're reinvesting in Williams Partners and we've taken swift, decisive actions to strengthen the balance sheet, reduce risk and focus on driving shareholder value. 
So once again, we thank you very much for joining us today, and with that, let's move on to questions."

I would say on the sales side, of course, it's going to be a party that we're confident that can close the transaction swiftly and puts the very best value proposition on the table. As to the tolling arrangement, a little more dependent on the personal nature there because having somebody we would be involved with for the long-term, and of course, it would have to be somebody with a strong credit to stand behind the obligations of the tolling agreement. So I would just say, we remain open to both, but we'll have to see what the best value comes through there. I will say, really, long, long and large list of parties engaging with us on that, and we're really excited to see the way that asset is positioned in the market right now."

And then the second part, just given that time line, or even if we assume it comes online in mid-2018, I guess the question's just really around the DRIP or more WMB support. Does that change the timing or how long or what degree you would need to keep participating? Or is there any other support you may need in 2018 as you kind of eye-keeping that IG rating at WPZ?"

I'll take the first part of that, and I'll turn the second half over there to Don for the financial side of that. In terms of the schedule, I think a couple of key things that are coming through in the change in the schedule. First of all, really excited to be announcing that we're going to be able to bring on the mainline portion of that project, which is obviously really important in the Northeast to take gas out of the Northeast down into the southeast markets. So we'll be able to do that in the second half of 2017. So that's pretty exciting. Then there's another section that we likely would be able to bring on which would be the pipeline, the new pipeline itself that would come on second and soon as it was constructed, would come on second. And then finally, and this is where that final date that we talked about, would be the compressor stations that are on the new pipeline, not the existing but brand-new compressor stations that would come on to add some incremental volume to the project. And that part would come on 6 months after the mid '18, so whether you would call that end of '18 or first part of '19 is going to -- splitting hairs a little bit there, perhaps, but that is what our expectation are. But I think very important is the amount of volumes that we can bring on with the first section coming online in the second half of '17, and then later, the pipeline section that would be carrying gas out of Susquehanna County and Bradford County areas and that would be coming on ahead of that final section, which would be in our RIST [ph] financial segment, would be either very end of '18. And so I think in terms of the -- clarifying that, our team is very focused on bringing this mid-'18 date to reality and -- but we -- as always, we put further financial risk into our plan to allow for all the regulatory uncertainties that all of us in the pipeline industry are facing these days. So with that, I'll turn it over to Don to talk about the financing side."

We get credit from the agencies, and we continue to delever WPZ and WMB. But nonetheless, the fact that there's less of a bubble in 2017, I think is helpful in terms of '17's financing plan. But I think, as you point out, it does push some of the capital into 2018. As to how we'll finance that, we're not prepared to provide any guidance on that today."

So we don't have any specifics on that yet in terms of how much that EBITDA would be, but it will allow for some pretty significant flows to the south coming out of the Southeast Pennsylvania -- the mainline in Southeast Pennsylvania area there. So other big interconnects coming off of other pipelines will now have a way south. And I think if you think about how that demand would look, all you need to look at is Zone 6 on Transco versus the southeast market and you see that differential there, and you would see the amount of demand that would be available for that capacity. So we're not going to pin that down yet because we haven't finalized the negotiations for that, but it is -- obviously, there's plenty of demand for that service."

We held some inventory coming through this quarter with an expectation that -- we pushed that expectation out into the fourth quarter because we still do have a belief that some of these crackers that had been challenged in the third quarter will remain to be challenged in the fourth, and we may still see some better margins.

Thank you for the question. Certainly, the big driver for second versus third quarter and 3Q was the -- having both the Tubular Bells business online, and remember, that had 30 days of shut in, in the second quarter as we tied in -- as we did some of the work for the tie-in on Gunflint during the second quarter, so second quarter was abnormally low because of that big shut in. But here in the third quarter, both Kodiak, Gunflint and Tubular Bells were all producing, and so some improvements are going on out there. In fact, we've completed the mechanical completion on the second phase of the Gunflint capacity out there. So a lot of important work still going on out there in terms of enabling further flows. So that was the big driver, but then, as we did mention, the Pascagoula plant was down, and our team went to work very quickly to make some big offshore interconnect in -- I think in the July time frame, June and July time frame that enabled us to bring that gas in very quickly. So great work on the team's part of getting that work -- first, getting it permitted, and then very quickly bringing it on. So that didn't just fall in our laps. It was great work on the team's part to get that in. We expect that, I think, Enterprise have said they expect to start bringing Pascagoula back up in December now, and so we would expect to get a couple of months in now here in the fourth quarter from that. And in terms of impact, I don't think we specifically said how much that was, but you can see some of the impact to our volume. I think it was about 200 million a day, maybe 210 million of volume that's come in to the system from that, just to get an idea of what that's done to gathering volumes in the Eastern Gulf."

So said another way, it's not going to be finite because we don't know exactly what the other interconnects are capable of delivering into that. Secondly, the pipeline portion, what's called the Central Penn, and I believe it's referred to as North Central Penn coming out of Susquehanna County, that pipeline will be capable of delivering a very large portion of the volumes from the north without the compression during most of the year. And so in other words, it's depending on other operating conditions on the pipeline, but it will be a very substantial portion of the available volumes from the north."

First of all, on the overhead management side, our team's very committed to continue to put pressure against the overhead cost side of our business, as well as your direct operating expense. When you go in to an area, for instance, like the Northeast, and you are rapidly growing things, it's very hard to really streamline your operations and really focus on cost reduction, at the same time, you're trying to build up staff, train people and get your operation safe and reliable. And so that business, as it's gained its scale and its footprint, is very well positioned and now to really take out some costs, likewise, our Central area has just done a tremendous job there because if you think about the pattern of growth and build-out that had gone there for several years, that has slowed down in terms of that pattern of build-out. And so the team has -- and management team's done a great job of redirecting their focus as a management team on safe and reliable and even more cost-efficient operations. And of course, out West, that team has taken that on kind of as their mantra, and they're very, very focused on constantly lowering their unit cost. So that's really driving a lot of that in terms of the cost reduction. I do think it's sustainable on the one hand. On the other hand, I would tell you that as we go into the pipeline operations, a lot of need to make sure that these pipelines are maintained extremely well. And I always tell people, I think that's a really terrible place to try to save money, is in the place of doing a great job of maintaining your assets safely and particularly in these critical areas along the Transco and Northwest Pipeline and Gulfstream routes. And so that's an area that I think you've seen a little bit in this quarter. We had a lot of hydro testing and repairs on IT [ph] system. And quite frankly, we're not going to shy away from improving the system there whenever we have an opportunity to do that. And so that's the cost side that will probably continue to be pressure us up on the one side. But I think on the cost-efficiency side and overall day-to-day cost, we'll continue to have opportunity to push that down."

It's very dependent on what outlet markets each of that -- those gathering volumes I would say. Some of the big players that have done a great job, and I would include Cabot in that group that have done a great job of going out and finding incremental markets, whether it's local power generation that's coming on and have really used their scale to go out aggressively and capture some of those markets, will be the parties that are advantaged. And so this isn't the first time we as an industry have seen something like this. We saw this in the Rockies, back when we had $2.75 basis differential and it worked itself out over time. People started to think it was never going to -- we were never going to come over that barrier, and today, we sit there with basis differentials of around 5% or often less in the Rockies today. So I think we'll eventually get there. But it is a complex question, just given all the number of projects that are coming on and the inter-connectivity of the pipelines to be able to address that. So I would say that I think the southwest markets probably are -- we're going to be picking up, hopefully, the REX expansion here in the very near future, which will be helpful to that area. And then I think Atlantic Sunrise will be the next big adder to that area as we unload all that gas trapped up in Zone 6 on Transco, with those projects coming online. And I do think -- I do think that will -- to your question, I do think that Atlantic Sunrise coming on will improve the Dominion South bases, just because you've got so much capacity between coming over on the Tmax project that'll have a chance to move south as well. That's pretty well trapped up there in that Zone 6 area today. So I think it's going to take time for all these projects to come on, but I do think that we will see that basis collapse pretty substantially as we get into '18."

Thinking about, as you mentioned, all that gas trapped behind the pipe.

And I would tell you, I think the market has been in this situation long enough now up there. It's probably root out most of the easy stuff in terms of little IT. Now, Transco's a good example of that where we've had Leidy limited on capacity here most of the summer, and that just got released. And so that was held back because we had some pressure limitations on that pipeline that we were -- we needed to do some inspection before we returned to full pressure. We've done that, and so that's a big -- will be a positive in terms of incremental volumes out of the area. I actually think the biggest driver for incremental volumes out of the area is going to be the local load, as we have a -- hopefully, have a more normal winter in the Northeast. That's actually going to allow for local load to absorb some of that gas. And if that occurs, there will be some incremental IT opportunities on days when we could move volumes out of the system because we've got good pressures and good load in the area. So I think that's what you -- probably the biggest driver for incremental IT is probably local load in the basin."

So the Niobrara contract that we have agreement of terms on now and we're working to finalize that into a definitive agreement, the way to think about that is that that'll keep EBITDA near term pretty steady for that gathering and processing system. And what we did in the agreement with Chesapeake is it really aligned both the interest of Chesapeake and Jackalope, which is the JV between Williams and Crestwood, to make sure that it was incenting development of some of the other formations there. So we got dedication of additional formations that we didn't have previously. And it allows Chesapeake to go out and explore those economically and see what the upside may be. So as I said, it'll be pretty consistent for EBITDA in the near term and then there's definitely potential longer term as those new zones get explored, and hopefully, Chesapeake's very successful with that."

Well, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We're glad you've been able to join us this morning and look forward to discussing our third quarter results here this morning. As you can see, from this quarter's results, our organization is fi",3020,"Great. Well, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We're glad you've been able to join us this morning and look forward to discussing our third quarter results here this morning. 
As you can see, from this quarter's results, our organization is firing on all cylinders, and it continues to capture opportunities, as we execute against our proven natural gas focused strategy. We're very confident about where we stand today and our team is aligned and excited about all the great prospects that we've got in front of us. 
We've been taking decisive actions to enable steady, predictable growth in our EBITDA by steadily increasing our fee-based revenues, lowering our cost and positioning our portfolio of assets to capture growing natural gas volumes.
We're making progress on many fronts as we work to execute on our strategy to drive predictable, long-term, sustainable growth. We've brought new projects online, renegotiated some win-win contracts with Chesapeake, and expect to close on a new agreement in the Barnett soon. And we also completed the sale of our Canadian assets, and as you are aware, we also have now kicked off a process for our Geismar assets that's now in full -- that process is now in full swing.
On the cost savings front, since our cost-reduction efforts were initiated at the end of the first quarter this year, we've seen approximately $76 million of lower adjusted cost and expenses at WPZ versus the prior year, and that's all while continuing to add additional new projects and grow the business. Specifically, we've seen WPZ's total cost and expenses decline from 55% of 2015 adjusted EBITDA to 47% in 2016 for the first 9 months. So an important metric that we're taking into account there, and continue to push that cost component down to a lower percentage of our overall adjusted EBITDA. We continue to implement steps to further lower our cost by streamlining our organization. And to date, headcount has been reduced by a little over 13% since the beginning of this year.
So today, we'll walk through our results, and provide some perspective on where we are relative to guidance and financial performance. Our results here in the third quarter certainly validate the hard work of our teams across Williams. We'll also give an updated -- sorry, we'll also provide some update on the Atlantic Sunrise project, and highlight some of the key growth drivers that are now in the horizon. 
So let's move on to Slide 2. Here, as you can see, Williams Partners delivered net income of $326 million, as measured by GAAP; and in terms of adjusted EBITDA, every segment of WPZ contributed to the 8% improvement over the third quarter of last year. Our DCF for the quarter was $795 million, which was an increase of 5% over the third quarter of '15.
As we've been doing consistently, we delivered fee-based revenue growth, and we continue to benefit from the aggressive cost-reduction activities we've been working on this year. We achieved a coverage ratio of 1.08 at WPZ for the quarter, which excludes the benefit of $150 million IDR waiver that was associated with the sale of our Canadian assets, and as you all know, that sale was finalized, I believe, on September 23. 
Overall, the quarter's results continue to demonstrate that our strategy is on the mark. So let's just touch briefly on a few of the operating areas, first of all, in the Atlantic-Gulf. The Atlantic-Gulf continues to deliver solid results, as we put projects into service that are capturing more and more the demand on the Transco system. Our adjusted EBITDA came in at $427 million for the quarter compared with $414 million for the third quarter of last year. And for the year, Atlantic-Gulf's adjusted EBITDA increased $53 million, primarily -- sorry, so far year-to-date, primarily due to fee-based revenues from offshore operations and Transco's new expansion projects.
The quarter also benefited from incremental volumes that came into our Mobile Bay system from the Destin Pipeline system, as we were providing service to volumes that were stranded behind Enterprise's Pascagoula Processing Plant.
We did see increased operating expenses related to pipeline testing activities as we continue to proactively focus on safety and regulatory programs along our Transco pipeline. Obviously, given the tremendous growth on the Transco system, we continue to focus on and ensure the safety and reliability of this critical piece of infrastructure. And so solid results in the Atlantic-Gulf. As we'll see later, lots of things coming down the pipe to prepare for the tremendous growth in the sector of our business.
Moving on now to our Central, Northeast and West, I'd like to cover our nonregulated midstream set of businesses here because we continue to see some common themes emerging across all of these operating areas. First of all, we have grown our adjusted EBITDA versus the prior year for both the quarter and also year-to-date. As you can see, from the chart on this slide, Central is up about 7%; Northeast, up 3%; and West, up 3% on a quarter-to-quarter comparison.
All 3 of these businesses reported lower operating costs during the quarter. Our leaders and teams are very focused on preserving operational cash flows in today's slower supply growth environment, and we continue to see the benefits of that show up in our results.
A specific note about the Northeast because I know there's always a lot of extra interest in this particular area. We continue to see steady to slightly increasing volumes there, but remains -- but this area remains in significant need of incremental takeaway capacity and market in the area.
We believe that both the local and the national demand growth is going to really unlock the area over the next couple of years. But in the meantime, we're staying very focused on the cost containment and achieving the best results for our customers.
Getting all of this critical new midstream in place as well has us positioned for when this tremendous low-cost resource really comes on in the next couple of years. And we really do believe that the natural gas demand that we're seeing on the Transco system will call on these constrained supplies once the infrastructure that connects that comes online. The unleashing of this resource and expected dramatic growth in the gathering volumes from this area represents tremendous upside beyond the more visible demand side growth that shows up in our CapEx.
On the NGL Petchem side, we saw an increase in adjusted EBITDA, driven by higher olefins margins and strong operational production levels. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased by $51 million to $136 million in the third quarter of '15. And as I mentioned earlier, we also completed the sale of our Canadian assets, and we are off and running in a big way on our process to monetize Geismar. This Geismar facility and the complex there really is a great asset, and we believe it's a good time to be in the market with the asset. There's a lot of very smart players in this segment and a recognition of just how well-placed this sufficient plant is in the Mississippi River market.
So let's move on now to Slide 3. As we've been saying, our natural gas-focused strategy is proving out and our over year-to-date performance certainly validates that. Year-to-date through third quarter of this year, WPZ delivered $286 million in net income and nearly $2.3 billion in DCF, up 8% over the same period last year, and we also achieved a year-to-date coverage ratio of 1.04 at WPZ here so far in '16.
I'm also pleased to report that we expect to exceed our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance, and also expect to hold coverage above 1.0, as measured for all of 2016 even with the expected seasonal increase in maintenance CapEx that we generally see in the fourth quarter.
As you can see, all of our operating areas are ahead of where they were a year ago, and you can see the results of our focus on increased fee-based revenues, cost reductions and the full production and higher margins coming through at Geismar.
Let's move on to Slide 4. This is a list of a lot of what's going on, and I'm not going to go through each of these items. But really, the important thing is here is this long list of accomplishments that the team continues to execute on, and so this -- what's really impressive about this is all of the activity that we've got going on that's driving our growth for the future. 
Just to mention a few here, highlight a few. First of all, look at the number of projects that we began construction on in this quarter, and so the Dalton, Hillabee Ph. 1, the New York Bay expansion and Virginia Southside II. Our teams really have pushed through the permitting gauntlet on these projects, and are now really focused on safely constructing these important expansion projects. We also have a number of projects who are already under construction.
Moving down on the list, the Geismar process, as I mentioned earlier, we have 1-step process, and we're really excited about the degree of interest we're seeing there.
And then, finally, on the coming soon part down there, just in addition to the -- all the projects that we've got going on, we are making a move to simplify our organization further here in 2017. We're moving from 5 operating areas to 3 operating areas, which is going to enable some further cost reductions over and above those that we captured here in 2016.
Moving on to Slide 5. Picture now of Atlantic Sunrise, lots of questions, of course, coming out of the announcement from FERC that they were pushing back their approval by about 2 months. So Atlantic Sunrise is a very key piece of energy infrastructure that is going to drive not just jobs in the Northeast and particularly Pennsylvania, but really the overall national economy, as these low cost, very strong gas supplies here in the Northeast are going to enable manufacturing, power generation and a lot of new trade around the world, for markets around the world for our low-cost natural gas here in the U.S.
So the Atlantic Sunrise system really does have a unique advantage in that it's one of the few of these major projects that takes advantage of the existing Transco infrastructure. And by building the segment that we have that's just new pipeline in Pennsylvania, all contained within the state of Pennsylvania, we're going to be able to end -- reach markets in a very significant way, all the way into the Southeast markets where there's a lot of growing demand via coal conversions, natural gas power generation, the industrial markets and, of course, the LNG facility at co-point there, is an important market for those supplies as well.
So we announced on last Friday that we expect to begin a portion of service during the second half of '17, and that we've revised the targeted full in-service date for mid-2018. I would note that, as we have previously, that our financial plan further risks the cash flows by approximately 6 months, and we've already adjusted our growth capital guidance to reflect this analysis.
We revised these dates because FERC now anticipates the completion date of the FEIS for Atlantic Sunrise will be pushed back to December 30 of 2016. This adjustment will allow more time for the agency to complete a general conformity -- sorry, conformity analysis and review 2 minor route alternatives. Additionally, we're focused on expediting the work required to obtain other key permits within the State of Pennsylvania.
To provide a little more context on this, the construction schedule on a project as large as Atlantic Sunrise is very tightly sequenced. Even a minor 2-month delay on one aspect can have a ripple effect on other components of the project schedule, some of which are dependent upon lining up with the narrow environmental schedule.
So the good news is we've got about 96% of the survey work done. That means the landowners are cooperating with us in a way to get the survey work done and we are pushing ahead to get the remaining 4% of that done. So a lot of activity going on to get the survey work done. Of course, if you think about the way these windows work, the field survey work has to be done in a period where there's not any snow on the ground, and so that does put some risk into our schedule that, obviously, is the reason that we push some of this back. Because if we don't get those surveys done before snowfall, and it certainly looks like that's not going to be the case, then we've got a way to get those final surveys done once we've seen -- sorry, seen things fall out there. So that really is what's driving some of that schedule pushback. So again, seems like a simple 2 months, but it does complicate things in terms of getting those surveys done in a timely enough manner. 
I will say this about Atlantic Sunrise. This is a situation where the regulatory agencies are being very cautious, given all the environmental opposition that has been focused around pipelines of late. We think that's prudent. And I would tell you that Governor Wolf has been very steadfast in his support for the project and really all of the critical energy infrastructure project in Pennsylvania, and he continues to be clear in his support through that with his legislature and with other elected officials in the state, and we really do appreciate his cooperation, as he has a lot of issues to balance. But we certainly support the governor in making sure that the resources are developed in a way that protects the environment and the health of the citizen. And we share his commitment and look forward to our continued work with the PADEP there, which is the regulatory agency in Pennsylvania, to meet all these objectives. So feeling very good about the degree of cooperation and support that we're getting from the state of Pennsylvania, but it's just a matter of people being very cautious in the environment that we're operating. 
With that, let's move on to Slide 6. You can see here the key growth drivers for 2017. Of course, the obvious stuff is the full year impact of a lot of these projects that came on midyear. And then a lot of new projects that will be coming on in '17 that you can see listed here. And then, of course, the full year of cost-reduction efforts will show up in 2017, as well as likely some additional contributions from the streamlining that I mentioned earlier.
Another consideration, of course, is just the impact that a normal winter would have on the Northeast local market demand for the regional consumption there in the Northeast. And so if you think about that, there's 2 ways for gas to move out of those gathering systems in the Northeast. One is via takeaway capacity. We're certainly anxious to see the latest REX expansion come on here towards the end of this year. But in addition to that, we also have the regional consumption and with the very mild winter we have last year, we are hoping to see some incremental demand that would drive gathering volumes in the Northeast as well.
Moving on here to Slide 7. Really excited about the strengthening of our board and what's going on here within the third quarter, as we've added 5 new numbers to the Williams board, and we're in the process of recruiting 2 additional members. The 5 new members are certainly energy industry experts, and each brings significant experience, and have unique perspectives they're bringing to the table. I can tell you firsthand that the new directors: Steve Bergstrom, Steve Chazen, Peter Ragauss, Scott Sheffield and Bill Spence, have hit the ground running, and are very engaged in helping us maximize shareholder value.
They're working with the rest of the highly qualified and independent board to keep the management team accountable and focused on our execution, as that continues to deliver shareholder value. I do want to take a moment here to just recognize 3 members of the board who have chosen to not stand for reelection at our Annual Meeting in November in order to support our ongoing board refreshment efforts, and that is Joe Cleveland, John Hagg, Juanita Hinshaw, and really, all 3 have given tremendous service to Williams over the years they've been involved with us, and we're extremely grateful for their leadership, commitment to the company and to our stockholders.
Williams' stockholders can certainly be confident that this independent board is working diligently on behalf, and we, as a management team, are really excited about that. 
With that, we'll move on to Slide 8. So today, the premier natural gas asset base in the nation is delivering fee-based revenue that amounts to about 93% of WPZ's gross margin. There's tremendous demand growth occurring and continuing to come down the pipe, and Transco is the energy lifeline that physically connects Williams to that growth.
The team has delivered continuous growth, and the third quarter of '16 is no exception. We believe that the natural gas-focused strategy that we're executing on has us exactly where we need to be today and well positioned for a large degree of upside in the future, as the natural gas market grows on the back of this very low-cost resource base, and will really draw on the Northeast and drive strong growth in our volumes in the Northeast as that occurs.
We're continuing to capture fee-based opportunities. We're reinvesting in Williams Partners and we've taken swift, decisive actions to strengthen the balance sheet, reduce risk and focus on driving shareholder value. 
So once again, we thank you very much for joining us today, and with that, let's move on to questions."

I would say on the sales side, of course, it's going to be a party that we're confident that can close the transaction swiftly and puts the very best value proposition on the table. As to the tolling arrangement, a little more dependent on the personal nature there because having somebody we would be involved with for the long-term, and of course, it would have to be somebody with a strong credit to stand behind the obligations of the tolling agreement. So I would just say, we remain open to both, but we'll have to see what the best value comes through there. I will say, really, long, long and large list of parties engaging with us on that, and we're really excited to see the way that asset is positioned in the market right now."

I'll take the first part of that, and I'll turn the second half over there to Don for the financial side of that. In terms of the schedule, I think a couple of key things that are coming through in the change in the schedule. First of all, really excited to be announcing that we're going to be able to bring on the mainline portion of that project, which is obviously really important in the Northeast to take gas out of the Northeast down into the southeast markets. So we'll be able to do that in the second half of 2017. So that's pretty exciting. Then there's another section that we likely would be able to bring on which would be the pipeline, the new pipeline itself that would come on second and soon as it was constructed, would come on second. And then finally, and this is where that final date that we talked about, would be the compressor stations that are on the new pipeline, not the existing but brand-new compressor stations that would come on to add some incremental volume to the project. And that part would come on 6 months after the mid '18, so whether you would call that end of '18 or first part of '19 is going to -- splitting hairs a little bit there, perhaps, but that is what our expectation are. But I think very important is the amount of volumes that we can bring on with the first section coming online in the second half of '17, and then later, the pipeline section that would be carrying gas out of Susquehanna County and Bradford County areas and that would be coming on ahead of that final section, which would be in our RIST [ph] financial segment, would be either very end of '18. And so I think in terms of the -- clarifying that, our team is very focused on bringing this mid-'18 date to reality and -- but we -- as always, we put further financial risk into our plan to allow for all the regulatory uncertainties that all of us in the pipeline industry are facing these days. So with that, I'll turn it over to Don to talk about the financing side."

We get credit from the agencies, and we continue to delever WPZ and WMB. But nonetheless, the fact that there's less of a bubble in 2017, I think is helpful in terms of '17's financing plan. But I think, as you point out, it does push some of the capital into 2018. As to how we'll finance that, we're not prepared to provide any guidance on that today."

So we don't have any specifics on that yet in terms of how much that EBITDA would be, but it will allow for some pretty significant flows to the south coming out of the Southeast Pennsylvania -- the mainline in Southeast Pennsylvania area there. So other big interconnects coming off of other pipelines will now have a way south. And I think if you think about how that demand would look, all you need to look at is Zone 6 on Transco versus the southeast market and you see that differential there, and you would see the amount of demand that would be available for that capacity. So we're not going to pin that down yet because we haven't finalized the negotiations for that, but it is -- obviously, there's plenty of demand for that service."

Thank you for the question. Certainly, the big driver for second versus third quarter and 3Q was the -- having both the Tubular Bells business online, and remember, that had 30 days of shut in, in the second quarter as we tied in -- as we did some of the work for the tie-in on Gunflint during the second quarter, so second quarter was abnormally low because of that big shut in. But here in the third quarter, both Kodiak, Gunflint and Tubular Bells were all producing, and so some improvements are going on out there. In fact, we've completed the mechanical completion on the second phase of the Gunflint capacity out there. So a lot of important work still going on out there in terms of enabling further flows. So that was the big driver, but then, as we did mention, the Pascagoula plant was down, and our team went to work very quickly to make some big offshore interconnect in -- I think in the July time frame, June and July time frame that enabled us to bring that gas in very quickly. So great work on the team's part of getting that work -- first, getting it permitted, and then very quickly bringing it on. So that didn't just fall in our laps. It was great work on the team's part to get that in. We expect that, I think, Enterprise have said they expect to start bringing Pascagoula back up in December now, and so we would expect to get a couple of months in now here in the fourth quarter from that. And in terms of impact, I don't think we specifically said how much that was, but you can see some of the impact to our volume. I think it was about 200 million a day, maybe 210 million of volume that's come in to the system from that, just to get an idea of what that's done to gathering volumes in the Eastern Gulf."

So said another way, it's not going to be finite because we don't know exactly what the other interconnects are capable of delivering into that. Secondly, the pipeline portion, what's called the Central Penn, and I believe it's referred to as North Central Penn coming out of Susquehanna County, that pipeline will be capable of delivering a very large portion of the volumes from the north without the compression during most of the year. And so in other words, it's depending on other operating conditions on the pipeline, but it will be a very substantial portion of the available volumes from the north."

First of all, on the overhead management side, our team's very committed to continue to put pressure against the overhead cost side of our business, as well as your direct operating expense. When you go in to an area, for instance, like the Northeast, and you are rapidly growing things, it's very hard to really streamline your operations and really focus on cost reduction, at the same time, you're trying to build up staff, train people and get your operation safe and reliable. And so that business, as it's gained its scale and its footprint, is very well positioned and now to really take out some costs, likewise, our Central area has just done a tremendous job there because if you think about the pattern of growth and build-out that had gone there for several years, that has slowed down in terms of that pattern of build-out. And so the team has -- and management team's done a great job of redirecting their focus as a management team on safe and reliable and even more cost-efficient operations. And of course, out West, that team has taken that on kind of as their mantra, and they're very, very focused on constantly lowering their unit cost. So that's really driving a lot of that in terms of the cost reduction. I do think it's sustainable on the one hand. On the other hand, I would tell you that as we go into the pipeline operations, a lot of need to make sure that these pipelines are maintained extremely well. And I always tell people, I think that's a really terrible place to try to save money, is in the place of doing a great job of maintaining your assets safely and particularly in these critical areas along the Transco and Northwest Pipeline and Gulfstream routes. And so that's an area that I think you've seen a little bit in this quarter. We had a lot of hydro testing and repairs on IT [ph] system. And quite frankly, we're not going to shy away from improving the system there whenever we have an opportunity to do that. And so that's the cost side that will probably continue to be pressure us up on the one side. But I think on the cost-efficiency side and overall day-to-day cost, we'll continue to have opportunity to push that down."

It's very dependent on what outlet markets each of that -- those gathering volumes I would say. Some of the big players that have done a great job, and I would include Cabot in that group that have done a great job of going out and finding incremental markets, whether it's local power generation that's coming on and have really used their scale to go out aggressively and capture some of those markets, will be the parties that are advantaged. And so this isn't the first time we as an industry have seen something like this. We saw this in the Rockies, back when we had $2.75 basis differential and it worked itself out over time. People started to think it was never going to -- we were never going to come over that barrier, and today, we sit there with basis differentials of around 5% or often less in the Rockies today. So I think we'll eventually get there. But it is a complex question, just given all the number of projects that are coming on and the inter-connectivity of the pipelines to be able to address that. So I would say that I think the southwest markets probably are -- we're going to be picking up, hopefully, the REX expansion here in the very near future, which will be helpful to that area. And then I think Atlantic Sunrise will be the next big adder to that area as we unload all that gas trapped up in Zone 6 on Transco, with those projects coming online. And I do think -- I do think that will -- to your question, I do think that Atlantic Sunrise coming on will improve the Dominion South bases, just because you've got so much capacity between coming over on the Tmax project that'll have a chance to move south as well. That's pretty well trapped up there in that Zone 6 area today. So I think it's going to take time for all these projects to come on, but I do think that we will see that basis collapse pretty substantially as we get into '18."

Thinking about, as you mentioned, all that gas trapped behind the pipe. Over the next few quarters, what do you think that means for potential IT opportunities, either backhaul initiatives at better economics or maybe just incremental EBITDA pull-through from walk-up shippers that are trying to R [ph] bases? How do you think that plays out, specifically, for Northeast G&P profitability over the next couple of quarters?"

And I would tell you, I think the market has been in this situation long enough now up there. It's probably root out most of the easy stuff in terms of little IT. Now, Transco's a good example of that where we've had Leidy limited on capacity here most of the summer, and that just got released. And so that was held back because we had some pressure limitations on that pipeline that we were -- we needed to do some inspection before we returned to full pressure. We've done that, and so that's a big -- will be a positive in terms of incremental volumes out of the area. I actually think the biggest driver for incremental volumes out of the area is going to be the local load, as we have a -- hopefully, have a more normal winter in the Northeast. That's actually going to allow for local load to absorb some of that gas. And if that occurs, there will be some incremental IT opportunities on days when we could move volumes out of the system because we've got good pressures and good load in the area. So I think that's what you -- probably the biggest driver for incremental IT is probably local load in the basin."

Thank you, Alan. So the Niobrara contract that we have agreement of terms on now and we're working to finalize that into a definitive agreement, the way to think about that is that that'll keep EBITDA near term pretty steady for that gathering and processing system. And what we did in the agreement with Chesapeake is it really aligned both the interest of Chesapeake and Jackalope, which is the JV between Williams and Crestwood, to make sure that it was incenting development of some of the other formations there. So we got dedication of additional formations that we didn't have previously. And it allows Chesapeake to go out and explore those economically and see what the upside may be. So as I said, it'll be pretty consistent for EBITDA in the near term and then there's definitely potential longer term as those new zones get explored, and hopefully, Chesapeake's very successful with that."
