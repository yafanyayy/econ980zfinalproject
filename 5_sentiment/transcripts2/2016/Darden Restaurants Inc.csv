Let me start by saying how excited I am to have Rick with me this morning as our new Chief Financial Officer. 
Rick's extensive experience and proven track record of results leading finance, operations, IT and strategy during a 25-plus year career at Darden. In addition to his consulting experience with Bain [ph] and Company and the Parthenon [ph] Group make him uniquely qualified for this role. 
Also, want to point out that just as we did last quarter, we reported same restaurant sales on both the fiscal and a comparable calendar basis. This morning, I'll refer to the comparable calendar comps during my remarks. 
We had another solid quarter, with great same restaurant sales and significant operating margin improvements. Our operations-focused philosophy continues to drive strong performance across our brands and regaining significant shares as a result. 
Total sales from continuing operations were $1.85 billion, a 6.7% increase from the third quarter last year. Each of our brands delivered strong same restaurant sales growth during the quarter and we added 7 new restaurants. 
Olive Garden's positive sales and earnings momentum continued during the quarter. Same restaurant sales grew 4.9%, outperforming the industry, excluding Darden, by more than 600 basis points. This was our sixth consecutive quarter same restaurant sales growth at Olive Garden.  In addition, same restaurant traffic was up 3% for the quarter. 
Key drivers of this performance include: an improved guest experience delivered through proper staffing and the simplification of processes and procedures. Culinary innovation that builds on the brand equities and flavor profiles that our loyal guests enjoy most, as seen with our successful flavorful pastas and Create Your Own Tour of Italy promotions. And continuing to meet our guests' needs for convenience, with the national launch of large party catering delivery. 
This is an enhancement of our successful OG To Go platform, which has experienced a 2-year growth rate of over 40%. Year-to-date, OG To Go sales represent 10.5% of our total sales. 
We are confident that our overarching strategy continues to be effective. Our focus on food, service and atmosphere has improve the perceived value of the Olive Garden dining experience. 
We've anchored our lunch and dinner menus with compelling price points. $6.99 at lunch and $9.99 at dinner, which provides everyday affordability. This enables us to deliver promotional value with a wide range of price points. 
Olive Garden's relentless focus on delivering great guest experiences will allow us to further enhance our perceived value. This will continue to be a key -- to be the key to our ongoing strategy as we build on momentum we're experiencing. 
LongHorn Steakhouse sales momentum continue throughout the quarter. Same restaurant sales grew 2.7%, the 12th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry, excluding Darden, by over 400 basis points. Same restaurant traffic was slightly negative. However, our performance is well above the industry average. We pulled back on our price pointed activity and optimized our media spend to be more effective, which contributed to LongHorn's 29% increase in segment profit and helped to offset the incremental expenses associated with the recently completed real estate transactions. 
Additionally, we will continue to invest in menu enhancements and reallocating labor as we further simplify operations and optimize our media spending. 
Finally, LongHorn continues to deliver communication that resonates with our guests through its You Can't Fake Steak advertising campaign, which was recognized in December when Ace Metrix named LongHorn the brand of the year for casual dining for the second year in a row. 
Turning to our specialty restaurants. We saw positive same restaurant sales growth across all 5 brands, led by Bahama Breeze at 6.3% and Seasons 52 at 5.3%. 
Bahama Breeze continues to significantly outperform the casual dining industry as consumers are reacting favorably to operational improvements and culinary innovation. I'm impressed with the progress the leadership team continues to make. 
Additionally, Seasons 52 had another strong quarter, making meaningful improvements in the business as we temporarily slowed new restaurant growth, enabling us to improve our operational execution and evolve our menu. We are encouraged by the positive reaction our guests are showing in the changes were making. We're excited about the momentum we've gained and we started to rebuild our pipeline for new restaurants. 
Yard House, the Capital Grille and AUV had also had strong quarters, although AUV's same restaurant sales were impacted by significant slowdown in Fine Dining within Texas. 
Overall, I'm pleased with our performance this quarter. Our strategy is working and we continue to grow market share, improve margins and return capital to shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rick"

It's great to discuss our business results with you today. 
Darden's third quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.21, an increase of $0.22 or 22% higher than last year. Year-to-date, adjusted EPS growth is over 50%. While Gene referred to the comparable calendar same restaurant sales to better highlight our quarterly sales trends, it was our strong [ph] fiscal same restaurant sales of 6.2% and the continued improvement in core operating performance that drove our earnings growth and more than offset the incremental ongoing real estate expenses this quarter. 
The strong cash generation inherent in our business model enabled significant return of capital to our shareholders. We paid $64 million in dividends this quarter. We also repurchased approximately $140 million of Darden stock. This leaves $360 million remaining under the share repurchase authorization that we announced in December. 
Third quarter reported earnings per share were adjusted by $0.34 of cost associated with the early retirement of debt this quarter and $0.03 of implementation cost associated with our strategic real estate plan. Separately, the ongoing impacts of the real estate transactions are now reflected in the financial results for the entire quarter, reducing pretax earnings by $6 million and earnings per share by $0.03. 
Looking at the specific impacts, we incurred incremental rent and other tax expenses of approximately $32 million. 
Depreciation and amortization was lower by $15 million and interest expense was $111 million lower due to debt reduction of over $1 billion. As a result of this debt reduction, we now have $450 million of outstanding funded debt, with maturities due in 2035 and 2037. 
The company's adjusted EBIT margins increased by 200 basis points this quarter as a result of leveraging positive same restaurant sales, continued progress on our cost reduction initiatives and seafood, beef and natural gas deflation. All of which helped to more than offset the ongoing incremental real estate expenses are detailed a moment ago, most of which is included in restaurant expenses. 
Before discussing our performance by segment, I want to remind you that the fiscal 2016 segment profit now includes the incremental rent and other tax expense associated with the real estate transaction. Whereas fiscal 2015 did not include these costs. Additionally, the benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings are not recognized in  segment profit. 
Olive Garden segment profit of $220.1 million was $18.7 million higher than last year and continued their strong segment profit margins of 21.6%. 
In addition to Olive Garden, all of our segments significantly improved quarterly profit, led by LongHorn Steakhouse's segment profit growth of $19.1 million versus last year, which, as Jim mentioned, is 29% higher than last year and segment profit margin increased almost 400 basis points to 20%. 
Turning to our outlook for fiscal 2016. We are increasing our range for same restaurant sales to 2 -- to 3% to 3.5%. We are also increasing our range for adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to $3.48 to $3.52. Given the strong performance this year, our annual effective tax rate is expected to be at the high-end of our previously communicated range of between 23% and 25%. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we have begun to ramp up the development pipeline for future sites and we anticipate 24 to 28 new restaurant openings. We expect to complete at least 60 Olive Garden remodels with an investment of between $250,000 and $450,000 each. And we'll continue our Bar Refresh Program, completing up to 150 next year. The Bar Refresh investment of approximately $20,000 per restaurant, significantly improves the [indiscernible] of our older Olive Garden Café and bar areas and is a component of our larger remodel package.  We've seen a solid return on the remodel and bar refresh investments to date. 
Additionally, to ensure all of our restaurants are well-maintained, we invest roughly $60,000 per year, per restaurant in annual capital spending. 
Total capital spending for 2017 fiscal is estimated between $310 million and $350 million, of which $110 million to $130 million is related to new unit openings and the remainder, related to remodels, the Bar Refresh Program, maintenance, technology and other spending. 
Additional guidance for our 2017 performance will be shared in next quarter's release and conference call in June. However, I would like to take this time to remind you of the long term framework we have for value creation. 
Over time, we believe our business can deliver total annual shareholder returns of 10% to 15%, which is composed of earnings after-tax growth of 7% to 10%, driven by same restaurant sales growth of 1% to 3%; new restaurant growth of 2% to 3%; and EBIT margin expansion of 10 to 40 basis points, by leveraging sales growth and our significant scale. 
Additionally, given the strong cash generation of our business, and the earnings growth expectations, we anticipate a return of cash to our shareholders in the 3% to 5% range annually, consisting of a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% and share repurchases of $100 million to $200 million. 
We believe the 10% to 15% total shareholder return represents a healthy and attractive investment. 
Finally, I'm excited to be speaking with you this morning. Darden has been a huge part of my life for over 25 years and I'm humbled by the opportunity to serve as the CFO of this dynamic organization. I also want to share with you how I'm approaching this role. 
First and foremost, my diverse experiences working in within the brands, including my time and operations, this may deep understanding of our restaurants and the ability to partner with the leaders in the business. Also my experiences away from Darden, as a management consultant, help me maintain a strategic and external focus to ensure that we are not overly insular. 
In this role, I'll be focused on ensuring we leverage our significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and a disciplined capital allocation approach, ensuring that every dollar we spend will be a dollar worth spending, to deliver on the long term value creation framework I just reviewed with you. This role comes with the pleasure of developing strong relationships with our analysts and investors and I look forward to strengthening that relationship. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Gene"

I think that's what you really would like to hear us talk about this morning. The environment does remain competitive. We believe that the consumer is behaving very well in our restaurants. They continue to use the menu. We continue to see people buying -- purchasing add-ons, both the -- as appetizers, alcoholic beverages and desserts. We see people buying a little bit less on deal than they have in the past. However, we have done a good job, as I've mentioned, in my prepared comments about anchoring our lunch and dinner menus with very attractive price points. The overall environment does feel a little bit promotional at this point in time. And we're watching what everyone's doing. However, we think we're positioned well to continue to take market share. I just think that -- the biggest move that we made in Olive Garden was putting that everyday value back on the menu. And we went a long time with our $9.99 price point at dinner. And I believe that -- anchoring that menu with that price point has allowed us to use a lot of our promotional activity to deliver value in a different way. And value can be delivered with the higher price points and the consumer has been very accepting of that. And I've believe in Olive Garden, the overall experience has improved dramatically. As far as overall peak margins, really don't want to talk about a number that we want to put out there, as what our peak margins are going to be. I mean I think there are so many variables that are inputs into that, what's the commodity environment? What's the pricing environment? We're going to continue to invest into the guest experience and do the things that we need to do to maintain and grow our market share. And we'll continue to focus on removing non-consumer facing costs from our business. And that's something we've been focused on for the last 18 months and we'll continue to be focused on."

And so I think the root of your question is, there is a halo and one of the things that we think and we're trying to bear out in some research, is takeout and OG To Go is exposing Olive Garden to maybe some lapsed consumers. We're using it and then to say,  ""Hey, that was pretty good, I'm going to come back in and try the restaurant."" So I think, basically, I think what you're trying to get across in your question is true, that we are getting some halo for the whole restaurant because of the To Go experience."

I think there's people who were working in our industry because there are -- whether alternatives weren't available to them, I think those other alternatives today are starting to become available. It's going to put a little bit of pressure on wage rate as the industry competes for the best talent to run their businesses. I think at Darden, we have a compelling employment proposition I think that we're -- when I think about it, we're at an advantage here. The other thing to point out is when you look at Darden's footprint, we have a great footprint and operate a lot of restaurants and markets where we still have federal minimum wage in those states. And that's  -- that really offset some of the other mandated wage increases that are happening in some other -- some of the other states. And I'll conclude by just stating that at Darden, we have industry-leading retention. We have some of the best retention and low turnover rates in all of full-service dining. So again, we're positioned well to deal with this. I'd like to say that historically, operating in an environment where you have a little bit of wage inflation at -- with your staff has been good for sales, long term.

We've done that through focusing on some basics, as I've talked about. The management and the board will continue to evaluate all the alternatives for the business over time. We've laid out our long term strategic framework. We believe the portfolio we have today is a great portfolio to achieve that. We've also made at our strategic initiatives, which we've all of our lot around scale and we've laid out and related out in a presentation in our investor presentation how that scale is really benefiting us from a G&A standpoint. And so as we look at what we're doing with the portfolio right now and our strategy, we believe moving forward with what we're doing in the past that we're on is the right path. As far as sustainability of the path that we're on, I can go back to a couple of things. I'd go back to continuing to use scale. We are in the infancy of really taking advantage of our data and insights. I think that we are -- we're doing a lot of that today. I can't talk too much about it because it is a competitive advantage for us. And I also think that we're doing some really great things from a strategic's planning standpoint that are giving us an advantage in the marketplace. We'll continue to stay focused on running great restaurants. I believe that's the key differentiator at the end of the day. This is getting to be $100 billion category, although we like to see it grow faster than it's grown, there's still a lot of market share available to be taken, if we continue to outperform and out execute the competitive set. And that's what we're focused on. And we've -- again, as far as momentum, we've kind of laid out with the long term strategic framework, what we think this business is capable of and we believe providing our shareholders of 10% to 15% total shareholder return is a compelling investment in today's environment."

And I think historically -- in the last couple of years, we drifted the target in LongHorn down to a consumer that is more trying to be more like an Olive Garden consumer. And I think that we've done a lot of price points at 2 for $29, $12 steaks. I believe LongHorn's a bit of a more premium offer and we need to focus on that. So right now, we're out there doing our 18 months Bone and Rib value [ph] and we're out there promoting a 10-ounce filet, which is the first time in 6, 7 years we've been out there with a 10-ounce filet. And consumer satisfaction is improving dramatically. At the end of the day, what we're doing in LongHorn today is we're removing some consumers, some guests from the guest base that we are confident that we won't make any money on. And they are a consumer that was spending -- buying a low end stay, coming in with a $5 coupon and that was all happening while we had a 45 minute wait outside the restaurant, waiting -- people waiting to get in to pay full price for a more of a higher end experience and casual dining steak. And so we believe that we're transitioning the positioning slightly. And we believe this is the right place to be. It's a place that I'm personally a lot more comfortable with LongHorn and where LongHorn should be. We're going to invest in quality. We're going to invest in staffing and most importantly, we're going to invest as we do continue to simplify the LongHorn operation. It has become too complex over time."

Let me start by saying how excited I am to have Rick with me this morning as our new Chief Financial Officer. Rick's extensive experience and proven track record of results leading finance, operations, IT and strategy during a 25-plus year career at Darden, in addition to his consulting experience with Bain & Company and The Parthenon Group, make him uniquely qualified for this role. 
Also, I want to point out that, just as we did last quarter, we reported same-restaurant sales on both a fiscal and a comparable calendar basis. This morning, I'll refer to the comparable calendar comps during my remarks. 
We had another solid quarter, with great same-restaurant sales and significant operating margin improvements. Our operations-focused philosophy continues to drive strong performance across our brands and regaining significant shares as a result. 
Total sales from continuing operations were $1.85 billion, a 6.7% increase from the third quarter last year. Each of our brands delivered strong same-restaurant sales growth during the quarter, and we added 7 net new restaurants. Olive Garden's positive sales and earnings momentum continued during the quarter. same-restaurant sales grew 4.9%, outperforming the industry, excluding Darden, by more than 600 basis points. This was our sixth consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth at Olive Garden.  In addition, same-restaurant traffic was up 3% for the quarter. 
Key drivers of this performance include: an improved guest experience delivered through proper staffing and the simplification of processes and procedures; culinary innovation that builds on the brand equities and flavor profiles that our loyal guests enjoy most, as seen with our successful FlavorFilled Pastas and Create Your Own Tour of Italy promotions; and continuing to meet our guests' needs for convenience, with the national launch of large party catering delivery. This is an enhancement of our successful OG To Go platform, which has experienced a 2-year growth rate of over 40%. Year-to-date, OG To Go sales represent 10.5% of our total sales.
We're confident that our overarching strategy continues to be effective. Our focus on food, service and atmosphere has improved the perceived value of the Olive Garden dining experience. We've anchored our lunch and dinner menus with compelling price points: $6.99 at lunch and $9.99 at dinner, which provides everyday affordability. This enables us to deliver promotional value with a wide range of price points. Olive Garden's relentless focus on delivering great guest experiences will allow us to further enhance our perceived value. This will continue to be a key -- to be the key to our ongoing strategy as we build on the momentum we're experiencing. 
LongHorn Steakhouse's sales momentum continued throughout the quarter. Same-restaurant sales grew 2.7%, the 12th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry, excluding Darden, by over 400 basis points. Same-restaurant traffic was slightly negative. However, our performance is well above the industry average. We pulled back on our price-pointed activity and optimized our media spend to be more effective, which contributed to LongHorn's 29% increase in segment profit and helped to offset the incremental expenses associated with the recently completed real estate transactions. 
Additionally, we will continue to invest in menu enhancements and reallocating labor as we further simplify operations and optimize our media spending. Finally, LongHorn continues to deliver communication that resonates with our guests through its You Can't Fake Steak advertising campaign, which was recognized in December when Ace Metrix named LongHorn the Brand of the Year for Casual Dining for the second year in a row. 
Turning to our specialty restaurants. We saw positive same-restaurant sales growth across all 5 brands, led by Bahama Breeze at 6.3% and Seasons 52 at 5.3%. Bahama Breeze continues to significantly outperform the casual dining industry as consumers are reacting favorably to operational improvements and culinary innovation. I'm impressed with the progress the leadership team continues to make. 
Additionally, Seasons 52 had another strong quarter, making meaningful improvements to the business as we've temporarily slowed new restaurant growth, enabling us to improve our operational execution and evolve our menu. We are encouraged by the positive reaction our guests are showing in the changes we're making. We're excited about the momentum we've gained and we've started to rebuild our pipeline for new restaurants. 
Yard House, the Capital Grille and Eddie V's also had strong quarters, although Eddie V's same-restaurant sales were impacted by a significant slowdown in fine dining within Texas.
Overall, I'm pleased with our performance this quarter. Our strategy is working and we continue to grow market share, improve margins and return capital to shareholders. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Rick."
336160,327437338,957389,"Darden Restaurants, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 05, 2016",2016-04-05,"Earnings Calls","Darden Restaurants, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. It's great to discuss our business results with you today.

It's great to discuss our business results with you today. 
Darden's third quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.21, an increase of $0.22 or 22% higher than last year. Year-to-date, adjusted EPS growth is over 50%. While Gene referred to the comparable calendar same-restaurant sales to better highlight our quarterly sales trends, it was our strong fiscal same-restaurant sales of 6.2% and the continued improvement in core operating performance that drove our earnings growth and more than offset the incremental ongoing real estate expenses this quarter. 
The strong cash generation inherent in our business model enabled significant return of capital to our shareholders. We paid $64 million in dividends this quarter. We also repurchased approximately $140 million of Darden stock. This leaves $360 million remaining under the share repurchase authorization that we announced in December. 
Third quarter reported earnings per share were adjusted by $0.34 of costs associated with the early retirement of debt this quarter and $0.03 of implementation costs associated with our strategic real estate plan. Separately, the ongoing impacts of the real estate transactions are now reflected in the financial results for the entire quarter, reducing pretax earnings by $6 million and earnings per share by $0.03. 
Looking at the specific impacts, we incurred incremental rent and other tax expenses of approximately $32 million. 
Depreciation and amortization was lower by $15 million and interest expense was 1 -- $11 million lower due to debt reduction of over $1 billion. As a result of this debt reduction, we now have $450 million of outstanding funded debt, with maturities due in 2035 and 2037. 
The company's adjusted EBIT margins increased by 200 basis points this quarter as a result of leveraging positive same-restaurant sales, continued progress on our cost reduction initiatives and seafood, beef and natural gas deflation. All of which helped to more than offset the ongoing incremental real estate expenses I detailed a moment ago, most of which is included in restaurant expenses. 
Before discussing our performance by segment, I want to remind you that the fiscal 2016 segment profit now includes the incremental rent and other tax expense associated with the real estate transactions, whereas fiscal 2015 did not include these costs. Additionally, the benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings are not recognized in  segment profit. 
Olive Garden segment profit of $220.1 million was $18.7 million higher than last year and continued their strong segment profit margins of 21.6%. In addition to Olive Garden, all of our segments significantly improved quarterly profit, led by LongHorn Steakhouse's segment profit growth of $19.1 million versus last year, which, as Gene mentioned, is 29% higher than last year, and segment profit margin increased almost 400 basis points to 20%. 
Turning to our outlook for fiscal 2016. We are increasing our range for same-restaurant sales to 2 -- to 3% to 3.5%. We are also increasing our range for adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to $3.48 to $3.52. Given the strong performance this year, our annual effective tax rate is expected to be at the high end of our previously communicated range of between 23% and 25%. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we have begun to ramp up the development pipeline for future sites and we anticipate 24 to 28 new restaurant openings. We expect to complete at least 60 Olive Garden remodels with an investment of between $250,000 and $450,000 each. And we'll continue our bar refresh program, completing up to 150 next year. The bar refresh investment of approximately $20,000 per restaurant, significantly improves the utilization of our older Olive Garden Cafe and bar areas, and is a component of our larger remodel package. We've seen a solid return on the remodel and bar refresh investments to date. 
Additionally, to ensure all of our restaurants are well-maintained, we invest roughly $60,000 per year per restaurant in annual capital spending. Total capital spending for 2017, fiscal, is estimated between $310 million and $350 million, of which $110 million to $130 million is related to new unit openings, and the remainder related to remodels, the bar refresh program, maintenance, technology and other spending. 
Additional guidance for our 2017 performance will be shared in next quarter's release and conference call in June. However, I would like to take this time to remind you of the long-term framework we have for value creation. Over time, we believe our business can deliver total annual shareholder returns of 10% to 15%, which is composed of earnings after-tax growth of 7% to 10%, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 1% to 3%; new restaurant growth of 2% to 3%; and EBIT margin expansion of 10 to 40 basis points, by leveraging sales growth and our significant scale. 
Additionally, given the strong cash generation of our business, and the earnings growth expectations, we anticipate a return of cash to our shareholders in the 3% to 5% range annually, consisting of a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% and share repurchases of $100 million to $200 million. We believe the 10% to 15% total shareholder return represents a healthy and attractive investment. 
Finally, I'm excited to be speaking with you this morning. Darden has been a huge part of my life for over 25 years and I'm humbled by the opportunity to serve as the CFO of this dynamic organization. I also want to share with you how I'm approaching this role. First and foremost, my diverse experiences working within the brands, including my time in operations, gives me a deep understanding of our restaurants and the ability to partner with the leaders in the business. Also, my experiences away from Darden as a management consultant help me maintain a strategic and external focus to ensure that we are not overly insular. 
In this role, I'll be focused on ensuring we leverage our significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and a disciplined capital allocation approach, ensuring that every dollar we spend will be a dollar worth spending, to deliver on the long-term value creation framework I just reviewed with you. This role comes with the pleasure of developing strong relationships with our analysts and investors, and I look forward to strengthening that relationship. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Gene."

I think that's what you really would like to hear us talk about this morning. The environment does remain competitive. We believe that the consumer is behaving very well in our restaurants. They continue to use the whole menu. We continue to see people buying -- purchasing add-ons, both the -- as appetizers, alcoholic beverages and desserts. We see people buying a little bit less on deal than they have in the past. However, we have done a good job, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, about anchoring our lunch and dinner menus with very attractive price points. The overall environment does feel a little bit promotional at this point in time, and we're watching what everyone's doing. However, we think we're positioned well to continue to take market share. I just think that -- the biggest move that we made in Olive Garden was putting that everyday value back on the menu. And we went a long time without a $9.99 price point at dinner. And I believe that -- anchoring that menu with that price point has allowed us to use a lot of our promotional activity to deliver value in a different way. And value can be delivered with the higher price points and the consumer has been very accepting of that. And I believe, in Olive Garden, the overall experience has improved dramatically. As far as overall peak margins, I really don't want to talk about a number that we want to put out there as what our peak margins are going to be. I mean, I think there are so many variables that are input into that, what's the commodity environment, what's the pricing environment. We're going to continue to invest into the guest experience and do the things that we need to do to maintain and grow our market share. And we'll continue to focus on removing nonconsumer-facing costs from our business. And that's something we've been focused on for the last 18 months and we'll continue to be focused on."

And I don't want to -- I don't think we should discount the importance of ensuring that we're properly staffed. Our teams are properly motivated. Dave and his team have done an exceptional job of simplifying the operation, reducing the size of the menu and the processes and procedures. I think the overall experience inside Olive Garden today is significantly better than it was 12 to 24 months ago. I think we're getting a lot of momentum from that. The tablets obviously are helping. As I said, in the last quarter, we're getting -- we're closing out checks 7 minutes quicker than we have in the past. And so we're excited about some of the basic operations. And one of the things that we're focused on now is trying to keep things simple. And we talked a lot about simple is hard and doing simple things every single day is really, really hard. But that's what's giving us the biggest lift in Olive Garden. Our teams are doing a great job creating great dining experiences and we're not having to rely on promotional activity to drive the business. We're winning every single day at the 9 square feet.

And I think that we're -- when I think about it, we're at an advantage here. The other thing to point out is when you look at Darden's footprint, we have a great footprint and operate a lot of restaurants in markets where we still have federal minimum wage in those states. And that's -- that really offset some of the other mandated wage increases that are happening in some other -- some of the other states. And I'll conclude by just stating that, at Darden, we have industry-leading retention. We have some of the best retention and low turnover rates in all of full-service dining. So again, we're positioned well to deal with this. I'd like to say that, historically, operating in an environment where you have a little bit of wage inflation at -- with your staff has been good for sales long term.

TV, for Olive Garden, is still the best medium for us to spend our money. We can see sales move week-to-week based on how many TRPs we're spending, and so we are transitioning some dollars from TV over to digital and other -- and social and some other things. But TV is always going to play a big part of the Olive Garden story until something dramatic changes with the consumer. Our target audience is still fairly easy to reach through television. And one of the things that we've done a lot better in the last 24 months is really hone in on that target and spend against that target appropriately, and so Dave and the team have done a great job of ensuring every dollar we invest is moving forward. Where we are making meaningful progress on advertising spending is in LongHorn, where, I believe, we became very inefficient over time and trying to act like a bigger brand than we really were. And so we've been able to save significant dollars in that budget as we move to spot television and supporting our restaurants that aren't media efficient with other means of support. And that's been very effective for us, and we'll continue to do that."

In regards to remodels for next year, the 60 number is what we expect to be doing next year. We're getting great returns on those remodels. We also anticipate continuing to invest in our restaurants, including remodels the year -- in future years. But as I've mentioned in my prepared remarks, we also invest over 60 -- around $60,000 a year per restaurant to make sure that our restaurants continue to look fresh. The 35 that we have done have -- as I said, have done great for us. We expect to continue that result, and we'll continue to remodel as we find the right restaurants to remodel. But one thing I'll say is in the past, remodels were one size fits all, and we believe that we need to look at every restaurant individually to ensure that we spend the right amount of money in each restaurant and think of the remodel as more of an evolution versus a revolution. So we don't think we have to do all 200 to 300 of them at one time."

We've also laid out our strategic initiatives, which revolve a lot around scale, and we've laid out -- and we laid it out in a presentation, in our investor presentation, how that scale's really benefiting us from a G&A standpoint. And so as we look at what we're doing with the portfolio right now and our strategy, we believe moving forward with what we're doing and the path that we're on is the right path. As far as sustainability of the path that we're on -- and I go back to a couple of things. I go back to continuing to use scale. We're in the infancy of really taking advantage of our data and insights. I think that we are -- we're doing a lot with that today. I can't talk too much about it because it is a competitive advantage for us. And I also think that we're doing some really great things from a strategic's planning standpoint that are giving us an advantage in the marketplace. We'll continue to stay focused on running great restaurants. I believe that's the key differentiator at the end of the day. This is getting to be $100 billion category. Although we'd like to see it grow faster than it's grown, there's still a lot of market share available to be taken if we continue to outperform and out-execute the competitive set, and that's what we're focused on.

And consumer satisfaction is improving dramatically. At the end of the day, what we're doing in LongHorn today is we're removing some consumers, some guests from the guest base that we're confident that we won't make any money on. And they were consumer that was spending -- buying a low-end steak, coming in with a $5 coupon, and that was all happening while we had a 45-minute wait outside the restaurant, waiting -- people waiting to get in to pay full price for a -- more of a higher-end experience in casual dining steak. And so we believe that we're transitioning the positioning slightly, and we believe this is the right place to be.

Let me start by saying how excited I am to have Rick with me this morning as our new Chief Financial Officer. Rick's extensive experience and proven track record of results leading finance, operations, IT and strategy during a 25-plus year career at Darden, in addition to his consulting experience with Bain & Company and The Parthenon Group, make him uniquely qualified for this role. 
Also, I want to point out that, just as we did last quarter, we reported same-restaurant sales on both a fiscal and a comparable calendar basis. This morning, I'll refer to the comparable calendar comps during my remarks. 
We had another solid quarter, with great same-restaurant sales and significant operating margin improvements. Our operations-focused philosophy continues to drive strong performance across our brands and we're gaining significant share as a result. 
Total sales from continuing operations were $1.85 billion, a 6.7% increase from the third quarter last year. Each of our brands delivered strong same-restaurant sales growth during the quarter, and we added 7 net new restaurants. Olive Garden's positive sales and earnings momentum continued during the quarter. Same-restaurant sales grew 4.9%, outperforming the industry, excluding Darden, by more than 600 basis points. This was our sixth consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth at Olive Garden.  In addition, same-restaurant traffic was up 3% for the quarter. 
Key drivers of this performance include: an improved guest experience delivered through proper staffing and the simplification of processes and procedures; culinary innovation that builds on the brand equities and flavor profiles that our loyal guests enjoy most, as seen with our successful FlavorFilled Pastas and Create Your Own Tour of Italy promotions; and continuing to meet our guests' needs for convenience, with the national launch of large party catering delivery. This is an enhancement of our successful OG To Go platform, which has experienced a 2-year growth rate of over 40%. Year-to-date, OG To Go sales represent 10.5% of our total sales.
We're confident that our overarching strategy continues to be effective. Our focus on food, service and atmosphere has improved the perceived value of the Olive Garden dining experience. We've anchored our lunch and dinner menus with compelling price points: $6.99 at lunch and $9.99 at dinner, which provides everyday affordability. This enables us to deliver promotional value with a wide range of price points. Olive Garden's relentless focus on delivering great guest experiences will allow us to further enhance our perceived value. This will continue to be a key -- to be the key to our ongoing strategy as we build on the momentum we're experiencing. 
LongHorn Steakhouse's sales momentum continued throughout the quarter. Same-restaurant sales grew 2.7%, the 12th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry, excluding Darden, by over 400 basis points. Same-restaurant traffic was slightly negative. However, our performance was well above the industry average. We pulled back on our price-pointed activity and optimized our media spend to be more effective, which contributed to LongHorn's 29% increase in segment profit and helped to offset the incremental expenses associated with the recently completed real estate transactions. 
Additionally, we will continue to invest in menu enhancements and reallocating labor as we further simplify operations and optimize our media spending. Finally, LongHorn continues to deliver communication that resonates with our guests through its You Can't Fake Steak advertising campaign, which was recognized in December when Ace Metrix named LongHorn the Brand of the Year for Casual Dining for the second year in a row. 
Turning to our specialty restaurants. We saw positive same-restaurant sales growth across all 5 brands, led by Bahama Breeze at 6.3% and Seasons 52 at 5.3%. Bahama Breeze continues to significantly outperform the casual dining industry as consumers are reacting favorably to operational improvements and culinary innovation. I'm impressed with the progress the leadership team continues to make. 
Additionally, Seasons 52 had another strong quarter, making meaningful improvements to the business as we've temporarily slowed new restaurant growth, enabling us to improve our operational execution and evolve our menu. We are encouraged by the positive reaction our guests are showing to the changes we're making. We're excited about the momentum we've gained and we've started to rebuild our pipeline for new restaurants. 
Yard House, the Capital Grille and Eddie V's also had strong quarters, although Eddie V's same-restaurant sales were impacted by a significant slowdown in fine dining within Texas.
Overall, I'm pleased with our performance this quarter. Our strategy is working and we continue to grow market share, improve margins and return capital to shareholders. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Rick."

It's great to discuss our business results with you today.

It's great to discuss our business results with you today. 
Darden's third quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.21, an increase of $0.22 or 22% higher than last year. Year-to-date, adjusted EPS growth is over 50%. While Gene referred to the comparable calendar same-restaurant sales to better highlight our quarterly sales trends, it was our strong fiscal same-restaurant sales of 6.2% and the continued improvement in core operating performance that drove our earnings growth and more than offset the incremental ongoing real estate expenses this quarter. 
The strong cash generation inherent in our business model enabled significant return of capital to our shareholders. We paid $64 million in dividends this quarter. We also repurchased approximately $140 million of Darden stock. This leaves $360 million remaining under the share repurchase authorization that we announced in December. 
Third quarter reported earnings per share were adjusted by $0.34 of costs associated with the early retirement of debt this quarter and $0.03 of implementation costs associated with our strategic real estate plan. Separately, the ongoing impacts of the real estate transactions are now reflected in the financial results for the entire quarter, reducing pretax earnings by $6 million and earnings per share by $0.03. 
Looking at the specific impacts, we incurred incremental rent and other tax expenses of approximately $32 million. 
Depreciation and amortization was lower by $15 million and interest expense was 1 -- $11 million lower due to debt reduction of over $1 billion. As a result of this debt reduction, we now have $450 million of outstanding funded debt, with maturities due in 2035 and 2037. 
The company's adjusted EBIT margins increased by 200 basis points this quarter as a result of leveraging positive same-restaurant sales, continued progress on our cost-reduction initiatives and seafood, beef and natural gas deflation. All of which helped to more than offset the ongoing incremental real estate expenses I detailed a moment ago, most of which is included in restaurant expenses. 
Before discussing our performance by segment, I want to remind you that the fiscal 2016 segment profit now includes the incremental rent and other tax expense associated with the real estate transactions, whereas fiscal 2015 did not include these costs. Additionally, the benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings are not recognized in segment profit. 
Olive Garden segment profit of $220.1 million was $18.7 million higher than last year and continued their strong segment profit margins of 21.6%. In addition to Olive Garden, all of our segments significantly improved quarterly profit, led by LongHorn Steakhouse's segment profit growth of $19.1 million versus last year, which, as Gene mentioned, is 29% higher than last year, and segment profit margin increased almost 400 basis points to 20%. 
Turning to our outlook for fiscal 2016. We are increasing our range for same-restaurant sales to 2 -- to 3% to 3.5%. We are also increasing our range for adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to $3.48 to $3.52. Given the strong performance this year, our annual effective tax rate is expected to be at the high end of our previously communicated range of between 23% and 25%. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we have begun to ramp up the development pipeline for future sites and we anticipate 24 to 28 new restaurant openings. We expect to complete at least 60 Olive Garden remodels with an investment of between $250,000 and $450,000 each. And we'll continue our bar refresh program, completing up to 150 next year. The bar refresh investment of approximately $20,000 per restaurant, significantly improves the utilization of our older Olive Garden Cafe and bar areas and is a component of our larger remodel package. We've seen a solid return on the remodel and bar refresh investments to date. 
Additionally, to ensure all of our restaurants are well maintained, we invest roughly $60,000 per year per restaurant in annual capital spending. Total capital spending for 2017, fiscal, is estimated between $310 million and $350 million, of which $110 million to $130 million is related to new unit openings, and the remainder related to remodels, the bar refresh program, maintenance, technology and other spending. 
Additional guidance for our 2017 performance will be shared in next quarter's release and conference call in June. However, I would like to take this time to remind you of the long-term framework we have for value creation. Over time, we believe our business can deliver total annual shareholder returns of 10% to 15%, which is composed of earnings after-tax growth of 7% to 10%, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 1% to 3%; new restaurant growth of 2% to 3%; and EBIT margin expansion of 10 to 40 basis points, by leveraging sales growth and our significant scale. 
Additionally, given the strong cash generation of our business and the earnings growth expectations, we anticipate a return of cash to our shareholders in the 3% to 5% range annually, consisting of a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% and share repurchases of $100 million to $200 million. We believe the 10% to 15% total shareholder return represents a healthy and attractive investment. 
Finally, I'm excited to be speaking with you this morning. Darden has been a huge part of my life for over 25 years and I'm humbled by the opportunity to serve as the CFO of this dynamic organization. I also want to share with you how I'm approaching this role. First and foremost, my diverse experiences working within the brands, including my time in operations, gives me a deep understanding of our restaurants and the ability to partner with the leaders in the business. Also, my experiences away from Darden as a management consultant help me maintain a strategic and external focus to ensure that we are not overly insular. 
In this role, I'll be focused on ensuring we leverage our significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and a disciplined capital allocation approach, ensuring that every dollar we spend will be a dollar worth spending, to deliver on the long-term value creation framework I just reviewed with you. This role comes with the pleasure of developing strong relationships with our analysts and investors, and I look forward to strengthening that relationship. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Gene."

I think that's what you really would like to hear us talk about this morning. The environment does remain competitive. We believe that the consumer is behaving very well in our restaurants. They continue to use the whole menu. We continue to see people buying -- purchasing add-ons, both the -- as appetizers, alcoholic beverages and desserts. We see people buying a little bit less on deal than they have in the past. However, we have done a good job, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, about anchoring our lunch and dinner menus with very attractive price points. The overall environment does feel a little bit promotional at this point in time, and we're watching what everyone's doing. However, we think we're positioned well to continue to take market share. I just think that the biggest move that we made in Olive Garden was putting that everyday value back on the menu. And we went a long time without a $9.99 price point at dinner. And I believe that -- anchoring that menu with that price point has allowed us to use a lot of our promotional activity to deliver value in a different way. And value can be delivered with the higher price points and the consumer has been very accepting of that. And I believe, in Olive Garden, the overall experience has improved dramatically. As far as overall peak margins, I really don't want to talk about a number that we want to put out there as what our peak margins are going to be. I mean, I think there are so many variables that are inputs into that, what's the commodity environment, what's the pricing environment.

And the scores are really, really strong. The consumer is very, very happy with the product. It's unique, and we believe that this is a huge opportunity over time as we continue to build awareness. As we think about this, our consumer today has very, very low awareness of us doing this catering delivery.

As I said in the last quarter, we're getting -- we're closing out checks 7 minutes quicker than we have in the past. And so we're excited about some of the basic operations.

And I think that we're -- when I think about it, we're at an advantage here. The other thing to point out is when you look at Darden's footprint, we have a great footprint and operate a lot of restaurants in markets where we still have federal minimum wage in those states. And that's -- that really offset some of the other mandated wage increases that are happening in some other -- some of the other states. And I'll conclude by just stating that, at Darden, we have industry-leading retention. We have some of the best retention and low turnover rates in all of full-service dining.

I'd like to say that, historically, operating in an environment where you have a little bit of wage inflation at -- with your staff has been good for sales long term.

We can see sales move week-to-week based on how many TRPs we're spending, and so we are transitioning some dollars from TV over to digital and other -- and social and some other things. But TV is always going to play a big part of the Olive Garden story until something dramatic changes with the consumer. Our target audience is still fairly easy to reach through television. And one of the things that we've done a lot better in the last 24 months is really hone in on that target and spend against that target appropriately, and so Dave and the team have done a great job of ensuring every dollar we invest is moving forward. Where we are making meaningful progress on advertising spending is in LongHorn, where, I believe, we became very inefficient over time and trying to act like a bigger brand than we really were. And so we've been able to save significant dollars in that budget as we move to spot television and supporting our restaurants that aren't media efficient with other means of support. And that's been very effective for us, and we'll continue to do that."

The 35 that we have done have -- as I said, have done great for us. We expect to continue that result, and we'll continue to remodel as we find the right restaurants to remodel. But one thing I'll say is, in the past, remodels were one size fits all, and we believe that we need to look at every restaurant individually to ensure that we spend the right amount of money in each restaurant and think of the remodel as more of an evolution versus a revolution.

We'll continue to stay focused on running great restaurants. I believe that's the key differentiator at the end of the day. This is getting to be a $100 billion category. Although we'd like to see it grow faster than it's grown, there's still a lot of market share available to be taken if we continue to outperform and out-execute the competitive set, and that's what we're focused on.

So right now, we're out there doing our 18-ounce bone-in ribeye, and we're out there promoting a 10-ounce filet, which is the first time in 6, 7 years we've been out there with a 10-ounce filet. And consumer satisfaction is improving dramatically. At the end of the day, what we're doing in LongHorn today is we're removing some consumers, some guests from the guest base that we're confident that we weren't making any money on. And they were a consumer that was spending -- buying a low-end steak, coming in with a $5 coupon, and that was all happening while we had a 45-minute wait outside the restaurant, waiting -- people waiting to get in to pay full price for a -- more of a higher-end experience in casual dining steak. And so we believe that we're transitioning the positioning slightly, and we believe this is the right place to be.

And therefore, this is -- this has been really, really well thought out. The beauty of the catering delivery is it's -- we ask for 24-hour advance notice, and we're actually able to increase our productivity because we're able to plan ahead and we're able to use some of our downside -- downtime in our cycles to help prepare for the catering delivery. So that's really been a real enhancement from a productivity standpoint. We believe that we can continue to handle the increase in volume, especially if it comes in catering delivery because that usually goes out our door before lunch or before dinner, which is ideal. So growth in that business really, really increases our overall productivity."

We had a strong quarter with each of our brand significantly outperforming the industry benchmarks as we continue to focus on improving our execution. Same-restaurant sales grew 2.6% with positive same-restaurant sales in each of our brands. 
It was a volatile quarter as results of multiple holiday and calendar shifts, including Easter, Memorial Day and spring break vacations, which we believe negatively impacted comps across the industry. 
Olive Garden had another great quarter and concluded a year in which we serve more than 220 million guests. The Olive Garden brand is extremely relevant, the business is strong and our strategy continues to deliver results as evidenced by our ongoing momentum. 
In Q4, same-restaurant sales grew 2.4%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by more than 440 basis points in both sales and traffic. This was our seventh consecutive quarter same-restaurant sales growth and fourth consecutive quarter of positive same-restaurant guest counts. 
3 key drivers of this performance include: First, further simplification of our operational processes and procedures, leading to improved execution in our restaurants; second, culinary innovation that builds on the brand equities and flavor profiles that our loyal guests enjoy most as seen with our successful Italian pot pies, Mediterranean fresh and lasagna lover promotions; and finally, continued growth of our successful OG To Go platform. 
To Go sales were up 19% year-over-year with a 2-year growth rate over 40%. For the year, OG To Go sales represented 10.8% of total sales, an increase of 140 basis points versus last year. Additionally, we have the best Mother's Day in Olive Garden history, which further demonstrates the brand's relevance and its broader appeal as a destination for family celebrating time together. 
Olive Garden remains laser-focused on driving frequency of our loyal guests, while delivering great experiences and our guests are responding positively. Our innovation pipeline is strong and we still have meaningful operations improvements to capture. 
LongHorn Steakhouse maintained its solid top line momentum and once again delivered strong profit growth. Same-restaurant sales grew 2.2% to 13 consecutive quarters of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by more than 400 basis points and same-restaurant traffic was well above the industry average. 
We will continue to invest in food quality to enhance the overall perceived value of the dining experience and have multiple in-restaurant test underway. 
Additionally, LongHorn continues to simplify operations to strengthen in-restaurant execution and delivered great guest experiences. This focus on operational excellence is augmented by compelling, nonprice pointed promotions like our big bold stakes and LongHorn favorites that reinforce our steak expertise. 
Looking at our specialty restaurants. All 5 businesses continue to deliver solid results that include a positive same-restaurant sales growth at each, led by Seasons 52 at 5% and Bahama Breeze at 4.7%. 
Seasons 52 had another strong quarter. We continue to execute our strategy at a very high level and are impressed with what the team has been able to achieve throughout the year. Seasons 52 is an on-trend concept, giving guests the opportunity to enjoy handcrafted cuisine that is healthful without sacrificing the taste or style. We look forward to building on the momentum we have created as we rebuild the pipeline for value-creating new restaurants. 
Yard House represents a significant growth opportunity for us. And during the quarter, we named Mike Night our president. I'm excited to have Mike lead the Yard House team and he is supported by an extremely strong team. Mike did a tremendous job leading Bahama Breeze, delivering same-restaurant sales growth of 3.5% annually over the past 3 years, and I'm confident he will build on the momentum at Yard House. 
All of our specialty restaurants continue to perform well and are differentiated and well positioned to grow market share into the future. Overall, I'm pleased with the results we achieve this quarter. 
And now, I'll turn it over to Rick to discuss those in more detail."
336160,342398633,1003610,"Darden Restaurants, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 30, 2016",2016-06-30,"Earnings Calls","Darden Restaurants, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Darden's fourth quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.10, both on a reported and adjusted basis. They were 8.9% higher than last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per shar",947,"Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Darden's fourth quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.10, both on a reported and adjusted basis. They were 8.9% higher than last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share. As a reminder, last year was a 14-week fiscal quarter. The 8.9% growth assumes a 13-week quarter last year. 
Additionally, this quarter we paid out over $63 million in dividends and repurchased approximately $45 million in Darden stock. Key drivers of this quarter's growth included: Positive same-restaurant sales of 1.7% on a fiscal basis; continued progress achieving our cost-savings initiatives throughout the P&L; favorable commodities environment resulting in approximately 1% deflation in food and beverage expense; and depreciation and interest expense savings related to the real estate transactions. 
These results were partially offset by 170 basis points of incremental rent and other taxes related to the real estate transaction. Excluding the additional rent expense and other taxes, restaurant expenses would have been favorable by approximately 200 -- 20 basis points. And while our adjusted tax rate was in line with the expectations we shared last quarter, tax expense as a percent of sales was 80 basis points unfavorable to last year driven by tax timing. 
Turning to segment performance. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 segment profit includes the incremental rent and other tax expense associated with the real estate transactions, whereas fiscal 2015 did not include these costs. 
In total, these costs were $30 million for the quarter. The benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings, which were $27 million, are not recognized in segment profit. 
Olive Garden's segment profit margin of 19.3% was 100 basis points lower than last year for the quarter as additional rent drove 230 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. 
Excluding the incremental rent, Olive Garden segment profit margin was 130 basis points higher than last year. LongHorn Steakhouse grew segment profit margin by 120 basis points for the quarter to 19%. Excluding the incremental rent, segment profit increased 250 basis points at LongHorn. 
Our fine dining and other business segment profit margins were essentially flat on a year-over-year basis at 20.1% and 18.9%, respectively, with our other business segment impacted by additional rents. We are pleased with the progress each of our segments has made improving profitability. They're leveraging their sales growth and continuing to improve the guest experience while taking advantage of Darden's scale and working closely with our support teams to identify and capture cost savings. 
Finally, as we announced this morning, our board declared a $0.56 per share quarterly dividend, a 12% increase from last quarter's dividend. We were able to spin-off our real estate into a separate, publicly-traded company and still increase our quarterly dividend above our pre-spend quarterly dividend and our spinoff of real estate assets to Four Corners created additional growth for our shareholders as the current combined dividend of the 2 companies is now 23% higher than the Darden dividend before spinoff of Four Corners this past November. 
Fiscal 2016 was a year of significant progress at Darden. We achieved 4.4% total sales growth on a 52-week basis; 3.3% same-restaurant sales growth; and 38% growth in adjusted diluted net earnings per share. 
In addition to meaningful sales and adjusted earnings per share growth, we profitably grew our market share, exceeding the industry benchmark for same-restaurant sales by over 400 basis points, increased adjusted operating margins by over 200 basis points, leverage our scale, further optimizing our supply chain and managing costs, resulting in $95 million in annual cost-savings, which exceeded our initial targets and returned more than $450 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Importantly, we also executed our real estate strategy by completing a tax-free spin-off of select real estate assets and restaurant assets into a new public company, Four Corners Property Trust. This transaction advanced our commitment to deliver value to our shareholders while improving our capital structure and reducing debt. Using proceeds from this transaction and from the sale-leasebacks of our restaurant support center and 64 restaurants, plus cash on hand, we paid down $1 billion in debt during the quarter -- during the year. This reduction in debt significantly improved our leverage, resulting in a return to investment grade credit status from all 3 credit rating agencies. 
Overall, we're excited we're executing a value-creating business model to generate significant and durable cash flow that will fund growth and return capital to shareholders. 
Now looking forward to fiscal 2017. We anticipate total sales growth of 1.7% to 2.7%, which includes same-restaurant sales growth of 1% to 2% and 24 to 28 new units. Capital spending of between $310 million to $350 million, cost-savings of approximately $30 million, total inflation between 1.5% and 2%, and a net -- and annual effective tax rate between 26% and 27% and approximately 128.5 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in earnings per diluted share between $3.80 and $3.90. 
We anticipate first quarter earnings per share to have the highest growth on a percentage basis as we expect commodities deflation in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 while we forecast commodities inflation in subsequent quarters. 
As a reminder, in December, we shared our framework for value creation, including a 7% to 10% earnings after-tax growth and a 10% to 15% of total shareholder returns calculated as EPS growth plus dividend yield. The metrics for our fiscal 2017 outlook are within the long-term targets we shared this past December with the exception of new restaurant growth. We are working diligently to build the pipeline of new restaurants for future growth. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Gene."

As I think about fiscal 2016, I'm extremely proud of the progress we made in pursuit of our mission, which is to be financially successful through great people, consistently delivering outstanding food, drinks and service, an inviting atmosphere, making every guest loyal. Our results reinforce that our strategy is working as our restaurants and team members continue to build guest loyalty by relentlessly focusing on our back-to-basics operating philosophy, which is rooted in culinary division and execution, attentive service, engaging atmospheres and integrated marketing. 
Finally, we continue to leverage our 4 competitive advantages that we see as keys to unlocking sales growth and expanding margins. They are the significant scale of our company, the breadth and depth of our data and consumer insights, our commitment to rigorous, strategic planning and our results-oriented people culture. It's that last competitive advantage, our people, that truly sets our company apart. Together, we've accomplished a great deal over the past 2 years and we've done it by getting a little better each day. It may sound simple, but it's hard to consistently deliver a outstanding guest experiences day in and day out. 
It only happens because of our 150,000 outstanding team members across our company. 
So let me close by thanking each of them. We know we got a lot more work to do but I'm confident our team is up to the challenge.

That will have no impact on our organization. Let me talk about labor. Labor is something that we continue to focus on, but we're focusing on it in a different way. And we're focusing it on a really -- when we think about menu development, how our menus are constructed and how that leads to processes and procedures in the kitchen. And we just -- we continue to focus on simplification on -- in all aspects of what I would call the production process or the manufacturing process of producing our menu items. Our teams are doing a great job of simplifying the processes and thinking about how products that we have are adding to the menu or we have in the menu impact the production process. And so we've taken products off the menu that are complex. We've simplified processes and procedures, which has allowed us to improve the overall productivity in the back of the house. Obviously, the front of the house is an area where it's kind of off-limits. We have our beliefs in what it takes to execute out front and we're focus on back of the house. We've also got a lot of energy around making sure that we have the appropriate labor in the restaurant at the right times. One of the things that we do with our P&L reviews at the end of each quarter is we sit down and we really look at, ""what's the productivity of our restaurants before we have guests in there and then after we don't have guest in there."" And we've been able to take a lot of hours out by making some adjustments there. So we feel like we're improving the guest experience, we're working on productivity, with -- in the back of the house with the design of our menus and process and procedures. I'll close by saying and may be preempt some other questions in labor is that, labor market is tight. It continues to be tight in a lot of -- in specific markets, which is driving a little bit more inflation. But as I've said many times on this call, I'd prefer to operate in an environment where labor is tight. I think that will lead to demand into the future."

And so, obviously in an Olive Garden, we serve a lot of different guests to get the 5,000 guesting a week, and each guest is looking for something different. But whenever we find something that the consumer really believes has got value, that's where the consumer goes and so that's not all with the lowest price point or then thing that's discounted the most. We still see a lot of guests in LongHorn just gravitate towards a great filet because it's a great value. We saw a high preference in Olive Garden with seafood lasagna, which caught us a little bit by surprise, but it was the best value in the offering that we had. And so I believe the guest continues to look for value and the value equation is not always just what's in the numerator. When you think about -- when we think about our brands, all the way from Olive Garden to Capital Grille, obviously, price plays a lot more importance in creating that value in Olive Garden, where in Capital Grille, it's more about how we make you feel that creates the value in that experience. And so we think about it in go along that line in between Olive Garden and Capital Grille. We're looking for that real value differentiator that will drive traffic. And sometimes, it's affordability and price and sometimes, it's more some of the other attributes and we keep pulling on all of the attributes not just one. And we continue to make improvements in quality, we continue to make improvements in service. That's why we focus so much on execution. We believe at the end of the day, we got to execute at that we call the non [ph] square feet. At that table in every one of our restaurants, one table at a time, that really drives the most value to the consumer. Overall, their behavior continues to be the same period is still see them using the full menu. We've got good interesting appetizers they're buying them.

LongHorn and every one of our brands had a record Mother's Day and the days around Mother's Day as we really focused and then we think that drove a lot of the activity in the month. We are -- we really like focusing on these days both from a communications standpoint but from also from an operational standpoint.

If we don't win there, all the other things are -- I don't want to say they're meaningless, but they're close.

When you turn the development pipeline on -- off, it's pretty difficult to turn it back on and so we're in the process of turning the development pipeline back on the it's easier and your results come quicker and your Casual Dining brands, your Olive Garden's, your LongHorn's. Our specialty brands, it's a longer lead time from a development standpoint. And so we would look for the smaller brands to actually pick up and makeup that differential in the GAAP. We need Yard House to grow at 8% to 10%. We need Seasons to grow at 5% to 8% into the future. We're very pleased with what's going on with breeze. We need them to -- we're making some commitments there. I would just say, this is just a function of the lead time of the specialty brands and the kind of property that we need. We're working diligently. We've got the whole development function working on getting us in, making sure that we're in a range in fiscal '18."

So we're still taking market share from a guest comp standpoint. And I think that's in itself very impressive when you look at the rest of the competitive set. We're continuing to make improvements that are going to take quality improvements, that are going to take time to show through to the guest. We've done some things when the price of beef was increasing, that I think hurt the business. But both by changing and we're going back to them tomorrow. It doesn't mean a guess is going to come the next day, it's my to take time for our guests to come to an expense -- and have a different expense and grow the business. And so when I'll look at this business -- and this is the 1 that I'm personally most familiar with, this is a business that has been underperforming from a profitability standpoint and has been on a little differently over the years and then I think it should've been run and now we're running it back. This has never been a great -- a business that needed a lot of high -- a high guest count to achieve its profitability. These are small boxes that are designed to put out a strong, profitable return and then when that business -- building gets full, you build another building 4 miles down the road. And you look at the -- and you look at how this business set up in Atlanta where we have 45 restaurants. There's no one -- in dining, casual dining that comes close to having the kind of penetration we have with a strategy that we put in place in there. And so we are back to building smaller restaurants and focused on ensuring that we're getting the right profitability from those units. We are going to make strategic choices to improve the overall quality of the expense. It's going to take time for those things to get into the consumer for the consumer to see those and then start and improving their frequency. We're reaching other guests that we weren't reaching because of our advertising and how we're talking about the brand. And so I'm really confident, directionally with where we're going and this business is contributing now at a much more -- at a level that's, I think appropriate where it has under contributed, even though it was growing sales all these quarters, it wasn't making any money."

When you're talking about the number of guests that we serve, improving that by 1% or 2% has a significant impact on improving our same-restaurant sales. And so when we think about just consistently delivering a better experience, I think that's a #1 opportunity for us. We still got room to improve on production and menu simplification. Some of the recipes they -- are still complex and Dave and the team are thinking about it every day. How do I make that less complex to be able to deliver that to the consumer? There's labor productivity opportunities. We still -- in a system the size of Olive Garden, we can see in our own data, we have opportunities for certain restaurants to improve productivity. Sometimes, and what the team has done a really good job was, they just haven't gone to the lower volume restaurants. Some of the time, the opportunity that -- was opportunity we have is in the higher volume restaurants and so they're developing ways to analyze and really discern, ""Where are my real opportunities to improve productivity?"" There's some controllable cost and management of controllable costs that still, we have people that don't perform at the same level of other. So this execution will opportunity there. And then lastly, we still think we can execute To Go better. And we think that that's a huge opportunity for us, as well as we're doing, we believe there's an opportunity to improve that even further."

We had a strong quarter with each of our brand significantly outperforming the industry benchmarks as we continue to focus on improving our execution. Same-restaurant sales grew 2.6% with positive same-restaurant sales at each of our brands. It was a volatile quarter as a result of multiple holiday and calendar shifts, including Easter, Memorial Day and spring break vacations, which we believe negatively impacted comps across the industry. 
Olive Garden had another great quarter and concluded a year in which we served more than 220 million guests. The Olive Garden brand is extremely relevant, the business is strong and our strategy continues to deliver results as evidenced by our ongoing momentum. In Q4, same-restaurant sales grew 2.4%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by more than 440 basis points in both sales and traffic. This was our seventh consecutive quarter same-restaurant sales growth and fourth consecutive quarter of positive same-restaurant guest counts. 
Three key drivers of this performance include: first, further simplification of our operational processes and procedures, leading to improved execution in our restaurants; second, culinary innovation that builds on the brand equities and flavor profiles that our loyal guests enjoy most, as seen with our successful Italian pot pies, Mediterranean fresh and lasagna lover promotions; and finally, continued growth of our successful OG To Go platform. To Go sales were up 19% year-over-year with a 2-year growth rate over 40%. For the year, OG To Go sales represented 10.8% of total sales, an increase of 140 basis points versus last year. Additionally, we had the best Mother's Day in Olive Garden history, which further demonstrates the brand's relevance and its broad appeal as a destination for family celebrating time together. 
Olive Garden remains laser-focused on driving frequency of our loyal guests, while delivering great experiences, and our guests are responding positively. Our innovation pipeline is strong and we still have meaningful operations improvements to capture. 
LongHorn Steakhouse maintained its solid top line momentum and once again delivered strong profit growth. Same-restaurant sales grew 2.2%, the 13th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by more than 400 basis points. And same-restaurant traffic was well above the industry average. We will continue to invest in food quality to enhance the overall perceived value of the dining experience and have multiple in-restaurant tests underway. 
Additionally, LongHorn continues to simplify operations to strengthen in-restaurant execution and deliver great guest experiences. This focus on operational excellence is augmented by compelling, non-price-pointed promotions, like our big bold steaks and LongHorn favorites that reinforce our steak expertise. 
Looking at our specialty restaurants. All 5 businesses continued to deliver solid results that included positive same-restaurant sales growth at each, led by Seasons 52 at 5% and Bahama Breeze at 4.7%. 
Seasons 52 had another strong quarter. We continue to execute our strategy at a very high level and are impressed with what the team has been able to achieve throughout the year. Seasons 52 is an on-trend concept, giving guests the opportunity to enjoy handcrafted cuisine that is healthful without sacrificing the taste or style. We look forward to building on the momentum we have created as we rebuild the pipeline for value-creating new restaurants. 
Yard House represents a significant growth opportunity for us. And during the quarter, we named Mike Kneidinger president. I'm excited to have Mike lead the Yard House team, and he is supported by an extremely strong team. Mike did a tremendous job leading Bahama Breeze, delivering same-restaurant sales growth of 3.5% annually over the past 3 years, and I'm confident he will build on the momentum at Yard House. 
All of our specialty restaurants continue to perform well and are differentiated and well positioned to grow market share into the future. Overall, I'm pleased with the results we achieved this quarter. 
And now I'll turn it over to Rick to discuss those in more detail."
336160,342398633,1003712,"Darden Restaurants, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 30, 2016",2016-06-30,"Earnings Calls","Darden Restaurants, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Darden's fourth quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.10, both on a reported and adjusted basis. They were 8.9% higher than last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per shar",953,"Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Darden's fourth quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.10, both on a reported and adjusted basis. They were 8.9% higher than last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share. As a reminder, last year was a 14-week fiscal quarter. The 8.9% growth assumes a 13-week quarter last year. Additionally, this quarter we paid out over $63 million in dividends and repurchased approximately $45 million in Darden stock. 
Key drivers of this quarter's growth included: positive same-restaurant sales of 1.7% on a fiscal basis, continued progress achieving our cost-savings initiatives throughout the P&L, a favorable commodities environment resulting in approximately 1% deflation in food and beverage expense, and depreciation and interest expense savings related to the real estate transactions. These results were partially offset by 170 basis points of incremental rent and other taxes related to the real estate transactions. Excluding the additional rent expense and other taxes, restaurant expenses would have been favorable by approximately 20 basis points. And while our adjusted tax rate was in line with the expectations we shared last quarter, tax expense as a percent of sales was 80 basis points unfavorable to last year, driven by tax timing. 
Turning to segment performance. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 segment profit includes the incremental rent and other tax expense associated with the real estate transactions, whereas fiscal 2015 did not include these costs. In total, these costs were $30 million for the quarter. The benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings, which were $27 million, are not recognized in segment profit. 
Olive Garden's segment profit margin of 19.3% was 100 basis points lower than last year for the quarter as additional rent drove 230 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding the incremental rent, Olive Garden segment profit margin was 130 basis points higher than last year. 
LongHorn Steakhouse grew segment profit margin by 120 basis points for the quarter to 19%. Excluding the incremental rent, segment profit increased 250 basis points at LongHorn. Our Fine Dining and Other Business segment profit margins were essentially flat on a year-over-year basis at 20.1% and 18.9%, respectively, with our Other Business segment impacted by additional rents. 
We are pleased with the progress each of our segments has made improving profitability. They are leveraging their sales growth and continuing to improve the guest experience, while taking advantage of Darden's scale and working closely with our support teams to identify and capture cost savings. 
Finally, as we announced this morning, our board declared a $0.56 per share quarterly dividend, a 12% increase from last quarter's dividend. We were able to spin off our real estate into a separate, publicly traded company and still increase our quarterly dividend above our pre-spin quarterly dividend. And our spin-off of real estate assets to Four Corners created additional growth for our shareholders, as the current combined dividend of the 2 companies is now 23% higher than the Darden dividend before the spin-off of Four Corners this past November. 
Fiscal 2016 was a year of significant progress at Darden. We achieved 4.4% total sales growth on a 52-week basis; 3.3% same-restaurant sales growth; and 38% growth in adjusted diluted net earnings per share. In addition to meaningful sales and adjusted earnings per share growth, we profitably grew our market share, exceeding the industry benchmark for same-restaurant sales by over 400 basis points; increased adjusted operating margins by over 200 basis points; leveraged our scale, further optimizing our supply chain and managing costs, resulting in $95 million in annual cost-savings, which exceeded our initial targets; and returned more than $450 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Importantly, we also executed our real estate strategy by completing a tax-free spin-off of select real estate assets and restaurant assets into a new public company, Four Corners Property Trust. This transaction advanced our commitment to deliver value to our shareholders while improving our capital structure and reducing debt. 
Using proceeds from this transaction and from the sale leasebacks of our restaurant support center and 64 restaurants plus cash on hand, we paid down $1 billion in debt during the quarter -- during the year. This reduction in debt significantly improved our leverage, resulting in a return to investment-grade credit status from all 3 credit rating agencies. Overall, we're excited -- we're executing a value-creating business model to generate significant and durable cash flow that will fund growth and return capital to shareholders. 
Now looking forward to fiscal 2017. We anticipate total sales growth of 1.7% to 2.7%, which includes: same-restaurant sales growth of 1% to 2% and 24 to 28 new units, capital spending of between $310 million to $350 million, cost savings of approximately $30 million, total inflation between 1.5% and 2%, and a net -- and an annual effective tax rate between 26% and 27%, and approximately 128.5 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in earnings per diluted share between $3.80 and $3.90. 
We anticipate first quarter earnings per share to have the highest growth on a percentage basis as we expect commodities deflation in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, while we forecast commodities inflation in subsequent quarters. 
As a reminder, in December, we shared our framework for value creation, including a 7% to 10% earnings after-tax growth and a 10% to 15% of total shareholder returns calculated as EPS growth plus dividend yield. The metrics for our fiscal 2017 outlook are within the long-term targets we shared this past December, with the exception of new restaurant growth. We are working diligently to build the pipeline of new restaurants for future growth. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Gene."

Our results reinforce that our strategy is working as our restaurants and team members continue to build guest loyalty by relentlessly focusing on our back-to-basics operating philosophy, which is rooted in culinary innovation and execution, attentive service, engaging atmospheres and integrated marketing. 
Finally, we continue to leverage our 4 competitive advantages that we see as keys to unlocking sales growth and expanding margins. They are the significant scale of our company, the breadth and depth of our data and consumer insights, our commitment to rigorous, strategic planning and our results-oriented people culture. It's that last competitive advantage, our people, that truly sets our company apart. Together, we've accomplished a great deal over the past 2 years, and we've done it by getting a little better each day. It may sound simple, but it's hard to consistently deliver a outstanding guest experiences day in and day out. It only happens because of our 150,000 outstanding team members across our company.

And we just -- we continue to focus on simplification on -- in all aspects of what I would call the production process or the manufacturing process of producing our menu items. Our teams are doing a great job of simplifying the processes and thinking about how products that we have are adding to the menu or we have on the menu impact the production process. And so we've taken products off the menu that are complex. We've simplified processes and procedures, which has allowed us to improve the overall productivity in the back of the house. Obviously, the front of the house is an area where it's kind of off-limits. We have our beliefs in what it takes to execute out front, and we're focused on back of the house. We've also got a lot of energy around making sure that we have the appropriate labor in the restaurant at the right times. One of the things that we do with our P&L reviews at the end of each quarter is we sit down and we really look at, what's the productivity of our restaurants before we have guests in there and then after we don't have guests in there. And we've been able to take a lot of hours out by making some adjustments there. So we feel like we're improving the guest experience. We're working on productivity with -- in the back of the house with the design of our menus and processes and procedures. I'll close by saying and maybe preempt some other questions on labor is that, labor market is tight, and it continues to be tight in a lot of -- in specific markets, which is driving a little bit more inflation. But as I've said many times on this call, I'd prefer to operate in an environment where labor is tight. I think that will lead to demand into the future."

And affordability is only one component of that value, but it's not really enough to drive sustainable traffic growth. And so obviously, in an Olive Garden, we serve a lot of different guests to get the 5,000 guests a week and each guest is looking for something different. But whenever we find something that the consumer really believes has got value, that's where the consumer goes. And so -- and that's not always the lowest price point or the thing that's discounted the most. We still see a lot of guests in LongHorn just gravitate towards a great filet because it's a great value. We saw a high preference in Olive Garden with seafood lasagna, which caught us a little bit by surprise, but it was the best value in the offering that we had. And so I believe the guest continues to look for value, and the value equation is not always just what's in the numerator. When you think about -- when we think about our brands, all the way from Olive Garden to Capital Grille, obviously, price plays a lot more importance in creating that value in an Olive Garden. Where in Capital Grille, it's much more about how we make you feel that creates the value in that experience. And so we think about it and go along that line in between Olive Garden and Capital Grille. We're looking for that real value differentiator that will drive traffic. And sometimes, it's affordability and price; and sometimes, it's more some of the other attributes. And we keep pulling on all the attributes, not just one. And we continue to make improvements in quality, we continue to make improvements in service. That's why we focus so much on execution. We believe at the end of the day, we got to execute at that we call the 9 square feet, at that table in every one of our restaurants, one table at a time. That really drives the most value to the consumer. Overall, their behavior continues to be the same. We see them still using the full menu. We've got good interesting appetizers, they're buying them. If we've got good, interesting desserts, they're buying them. And so it's compelling for us to keep coming up with great culinary innovation that make people want to buy our products."

We've been able to deliver it in different ways, whether it's through a traditional to-go experience, whether it's through an online ordering experience, whether it's through bulk. And now with this delivery and catering that we're doing, we're just giving the consumer another access point to act -- to get what they want, which is something that's convenient, that's high quality and a great value.

Okay, my question's with -- as far as the gap to your KNAPP peers, you accelerated and even widened that toward the end of the quarter in what appears to be the month of May. I know obviously, you're calendar. KNAPP has a different period somewhat, so maybe it's not a perfect science. But both brands seem to have accelerated in the back half of your fiscal quarter. I wondered if you could elaborate on maybe some of the promotional activity or something that you saw competitively that really lit it up in the back half of the quarter. And my follow-up question would be, you did comment that the commodity environment suggests that the EPS in the first half of fiscal '17 would probably drive greater earnings growth. Is that the same for the same-store sales front as far as what we saw in the month of May? Are we carrying faster, greater momentum? I'm looking at the compares.

It's pretty flat throughout the year. It's based on what we know right now. And as far as May goes, I -- you are correct. We did accelerate against the industry in May. I think that we focused a lot on Mother's Day, in and around Mother's Day, which gave us a great boost. As I said, Olive Garden had a record Mother's Day. LongHorn had a -- every one of our brands had a record Mother's Day and the days around Mother's Day, as we really focused in them. We think that drove a lot of the activity in the month. We are -- we really like focusing on these days, both from a communications standpoint but from also from an operational standpoint. When you look at a Mother's Day in both OG and LongHorn, it's just about how many guests you can get through and execute perfectly throughout the day. And so I think we were active, both digitally and other promotional activity, and we executed extremely well. We also got a big bump in catering and delivery for Mother's Day in OG, which was a strong bump. So I think it's -- it was -- our teams did a great job. We capitalized on the volume when the volume was there."

This has been a leader in what we've been doing. We think we're exposing more guests to Olive Garden. It's been a terrific sales driver. We've done great culinary innovation. We've hit some really big products. Our pot pies were a big hit. Our culinary tour was a big -- our Create Your Own Tour of Italy has been a big hit. Ziosk has been a sales driver. So it's been a good lever that we don't think that we've fully hit our full stride with that. We've still got some room there. And then remodels have been a solid sales driver, outperforming the base by almost 4% in traffic, between 3% and 4% traffic. So I feel like there's multiple levers, but I want to wrap that back around with our maniacal focus on trying to execute better at the restaurant. We, as a team, and me, especially, believe that is the key driver of winning in this business. It's that interaction between a server and the guest. If we don't win there, all the other things aren't as -- I don't want to say they're meaningless, but they're close. We've got to execute at a very high level.

And we think we have the innovation to do that, and so we'll continue to focus on that. But back to a statement I made earlier. I'm just -- we're just as focused on other components of value than we are just on price. And Dave and the team are really working on other ways to provide value for the guests. So let me give you an example of that. The one thing about an Olive Garden where we see the value perceptions go down is how long the people have to wait to come into our restaurant. So what can we do while they're on a wait to improve that process? If we're starting to play with and test a few things. And if we do it correctly, we actually improve the overall value experience without changing anything else on the menu or pricing. And so we've got to continue to focus on the other components of value, where we talk about other components in the numerator and just not focus on what's on the denominator or the value equation. And so we do need to work at certain price points, but we do need to execute some of those other variables."

So we're still taking market share from a guest comp standpoint. And I think that's, in itself, very impressive when you look at the rest of the competitive set. We're continuing to make improvements that are going to take quality improvements, that are going to take time to show through to the guest. We've done some things when the price of beef was increasing, that I think hurt the business. But just by changing and we're going back to them tomorrow, doesn't mean a guest is going to come the next day. It's going to take time for our guests to come through and experience -- have a different experience and grow the business. And so when I look at this business -- and this is the one that I'm personally the most familiar with. This is a business that has been underperforming from a profitability standpoint and has been run a little differently over the years than, I think, it should've been run, and now we're running it back. This has never been a great -- a business that needed a lot of -- high guest counts to achieve its profitability. These are small boxes that are designed to put out a strong, profitable return, and then when that business -- building gets full, you build another building 4 miles down the road. And you look at the -- you look at how this business is really set up in Atlanta, where we have 45 restaurants, there's no one -- in dining, casual dining that comes close to having the kind of penetration we have with the strategy that we put in place there. And so we are back to building smaller restaurants and focused on ensuring that we're getting the right profitability from those units. We are going to make strategic choices to improve the overall quality of the expense. It's going to take time for those things to get into the consumer, for the consumer to see those and then start improving their frequency. We're reaching other guests that we weren't reaching because of our advertising and how we're talking about the brand. And so I'm really confident, directionally with where we're going and this business is contributing now at a much more -- at a level that's, I think, appropriate, where it has under contributed. Even though it was growing sales all these quarters, it wasn't making any money."

When you're talking about the number of guests that we serve, improving that by 1% or 2% has a significant impact on improving our same-restaurant sales. And so we think about just consistently delivering a better experience, I think the #1 opportunity for us. We still got room to improve on production and menu simplification. Some of the recipes they -- are still complex, and Dave and the team are thinking about it every day. How do I make that less complex to be able to deliver that to the consumer? There's labor productivity opportunities. We still -- in a system the size of Olive Garden, we can see in our own data, we have opportunities for certain restaurants to improve productivity. Sometimes -- and what the team has done a really good job was, they just haven't gone to the lower-volume restaurants. Some of the time, the opportunity that -- the most opportunity we have is in our higher-volume restaurants. And so they're developing ways to analyze and really discern, where are my real opportunities to improve productivity? There's some controllable costs and management of controllable costs that still -- we have people that don't perform at the same level of others, so there's executional opportunity there. And then lastly, we still think we can execute To Go better. And we think it's that -- that's a huge opportunity for us.

I mean, is this a kind of a rising-tide, lifts-all-boats type of equation, where we're giving guests something that they be looking for? And so broadly, this was going to work. Or is there something specific to Darden? And where do you think those eating occasions are coming from? Is it all coming from eating at home? Or how do you think this plays out over time?"

Where we believe that Olive Garden is better situated is the kind of food that we serve. And so if you're a bar and grill, it's not like you can put 20 hamburgers in a container and send the rolls home and have them put everything together and still have a quality product. But we can send home pans of lasagna, pans of chicken parmesan. I think that style of food that we serve really lends itself to this trend that's taking place. And so I think we're -- Olive Garden, we're better situated. We're seeing To Go sales increase in LongHorn. But we don't believe -- we need to go with what the consumer wants here. But we don't believe we have a platform to really -- in LongHorn, with the style of food, to be able to push that to 20% of our overall business, where we think that it's something Olive Garden has a real capability. Third-party delivery is something that's going to need to evolve. It's going to effect the overall industry, and there are a lot of big names out there trying to figure out how they're going to -- how they're going to come up with a solution to solve this problem. And I would say, that's a stay-tuned. Because there's just a lot of activity there with the big one. But there's a lot of dollars for our company, and I won't mention any names, if they can come up with a solution to -- for us and for our casual dining and all of dining, there's some money to be made there."

We get a lot of data from our guests, many more of them are filling up the surveys, so we learn a lot more. And it actually improves the biggest pain point that a guest has, is paying at the table. So we believe that we're still early stages of getting all of the benefits from the Ziosk device that we can get as we build on other things from that device. Again, nothing in the back of the house that would be saved from that. We're thinking about looking at loyalty and how do we use loyalty with Ziosk.

We had a strong quarter with each of our brands significantly outperforming the industry benchmarks as we continue to focus on improving our execution. Same-restaurant sales grew 2.6% with positive same-restaurant sales at each of our brands. It was a volatile quarter as a result of multiple holiday and calendar shifts, including Easter, Memorial Day and spring break vacations, which we believe negatively impacted comps across the industry. 
Olive Garden had another great quarter and concluded a year in which we served more than 220 million guests. The Olive Garden brand is extremely relevant, the business is strong and our strategy continues to deliver results as evidenced by our ongoing momentum. In Q4, same-restaurant sales grew 2.4%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by more than 440 basis points in both sales and traffic. This was our seventh consecutive quarter same-restaurant sales growth and fourth consecutive quarter of positive same-restaurant guest counts. 
Three key drivers of this performance include: first, further simplification of our operational processes and procedures, leading to improved execution in our restaurants; second, culinary innovation that builds on the brand equities and flavor profiles that our loyal guests enjoy most, as seen with our successful Italian pot pies, Mediterranean fresh and lasagna lover promotions; and finally, continued growth of our successful OG To Go platform. To Go sales were up 19% year-over-year with a 2-year growth rate over 40%. For the year, OG To Go sales represented 10.8% of total sales, an increase of 140 basis points versus last year. Additionally, we had the best Mother's Day in Olive Garden history, which further demonstrates the brand's relevance and its broad appeal as a destination for family celebrating time together. 
Olive Garden remains laser-focused on driving frequency of our loyal guests, while delivering great experiences, and our guests are responding positively. Our innovation pipeline is strong and we still have meaningful operations improvements to capture. 
LongHorn Steakhouse maintained its solid top line momentum and once again delivered strong profit growth. Same-restaurant sales grew 2.2%, the 13th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by more than 400 basis points. And same-restaurant traffic was well above the industry average. We will continue to invest in food quality to enhance the overall perceived value of the dining experience and have multiple in-restaurant tests underway. 
Additionally, LongHorn continues to simplify operations to strengthen in-restaurant execution and deliver great guest experiences. This focus on operational excellence is augmented by compelling, non-price-pointed promotions, like our big bold steaks and LongHorn favorites that reinforce our steak expertise. 
Looking at our specialty restaurants. All 5 businesses continued to deliver solid results that included positive same-restaurant sales growth at each, led by Seasons 52 at 5% and Bahama Breeze at 4.7%. 
Seasons 52 had another strong quarter. We continue to execute our strategy at a very high level and are impressed with what the team has been able to achieve throughout the year. Seasons 52 is an on-trend concept, giving guests the opportunity to enjoy handcrafted cuisine that is healthful without sacrificing the taste or style. We look forward to building on the momentum we have created as we rebuild the pipeline for value-creating new restaurants. 
Yard House represents a significant growth opportunity for us. And during the quarter, we named Mike Kneidinger president. I'm excited to have Mike lead the Yard House team, and he is supported by an extremely strong team. Mike did a tremendous job leading Bahama Breeze, delivering same-restaurant sales growth of 3.5% annually over the past 3 years, and I'm confident he will build on the momentum at Yard House. 
All of our specialty restaurants continue to perform well and are differentiated and well positioned to grow market share into the future. Overall, I'm pleased with the results we achieved this quarter. 
And now I'll turn it over to Rick to discuss those in more detail."
336160,342398633,1003755,"Darden Restaurants, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 30, 2016",2016-06-30,"Earnings Calls","Darden Restaurants, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Darden's fourth quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.10, both on a reported and adjusted basis. They were 8.9% higher than last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per shar",953,"Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Darden's fourth quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.10, both on a reported and adjusted basis. They were 8.9% higher than last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share. As a reminder, last year was a 14-week fiscal quarter. The 8.9% growth assumes a 13-week quarter last year. Additionally, this quarter we paid out over $63 million in dividends and repurchased approximately $45 million in Darden stock. 
Key drivers of this quarter's growth included: positive same-restaurant sales of 1.7% on a fiscal basis, continued progress achieving our cost-savings initiatives throughout the P&L, a favorable commodities environment resulting in approximately 1% deflation in food and beverage expense, and depreciation and interest expense savings related to the real estate transactions. These results were partially offset by 170 basis points of incremental rent and other taxes related to the real estate transactions. Excluding the additional rent expense and other taxes, restaurant expenses would have been favorable by approximately 20 basis points. And while our adjusted tax rate was in line with the expectations we shared last quarter, tax expense as a percent of sales was 80 basis points unfavorable to last year, driven by tax timing. 
Turning to segment performance. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 segment profit includes the incremental rent and other tax expense associated with the real estate transactions, whereas fiscal 2015 did not include these costs. In total, these costs were $30 million for the quarter. The benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings, which were $27 million, are not recognized in segment profit. 
Olive Garden's segment profit margin of 19.3% was 100 basis points lower than last year for the quarter as additional rent drove 230 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding the incremental rent, Olive Garden segment profit margin was 130 basis points higher than last year. 
LongHorn Steakhouse grew segment profit margin by 120 basis points for the quarter to 19%. Excluding the incremental rent, segment profit increased 250 basis points at LongHorn. Our Fine Dining and Other Business segment profit margins were essentially flat on a year-over-year basis at 20.1% and 18.9%, respectively, with our Other Business segment impacted by additional rents. 
We are pleased with the progress each of our segments has made improving profitability. They are leveraging their sales growth and continuing to improve the guest experience, while taking advantage of Darden's scale and working closely with our support teams to identify and capture cost savings. 
Finally, as we announced this morning, our board declared a $0.56 per share quarterly dividend, a 12% increase from last quarter's dividend. We were able to spin off our real estate into a separate, publicly traded company and still increase our quarterly dividend above our pre-spin quarterly dividend. And our spin-off of real estate assets to Four Corners created additional growth for our shareholders, as the current combined dividend of the 2 companies is now 23% higher than the Darden dividend before the spin-off of Four Corners this past November. 
Fiscal 2016 was a year of significant progress at Darden. We achieved 4.4% total sales growth on a 52-week basis; 3.3% same-restaurant sales growth; and 38% growth in adjusted diluted net earnings per share. In addition to meaningful sales and adjusted earnings per share growth, we profitably grew our market share, exceeding the industry benchmark for same-restaurant sales by over 400 basis points; increased adjusted operating margins by over 200 basis points; leveraged our scale, further optimizing our supply chain and managing costs, resulting in $95 million in annual cost-savings, which exceeded our initial targets; and returned more than $450 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Importantly, we also executed our real estate strategy by completing a tax-free spin-off of select real estate assets and restaurant assets into a new public company, Four Corners Property Trust. This transaction advanced our commitment to deliver value to our shareholders while improving our capital structure and reducing debt. 
Using proceeds from this transaction and from the sale leasebacks of our restaurant support center and 64 restaurants plus cash on hand, we paid down $1 billion in debt during the quarter -- during the year. This reduction in debt significantly improved our leverage, resulting in a return to investment-grade credit status from all 3 credit rating agencies. Overall, we're excited -- we're executing a value-creating business model to generate significant and durable cash flow that will fund growth and return capital to shareholders. 
Now looking forward to fiscal 2017. We anticipate total sales growth of 1.7% to 2.7%, which includes: same-restaurant sales growth of 1% to 2% and 24 to 28 new units, capital spending of between $310 million to $350 million, cost savings of approximately $30 million, total inflation between 1.5% and 2%, and a net -- and an annual effective tax rate between 26% and 27%, and approximately 128.5 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in earnings per diluted share between $3.80 and $3.90. 
We anticipate first quarter earnings per share to have the highest growth on a percentage basis as we expect commodities deflation in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, while we forecast commodities inflation in subsequent quarters. 
As a reminder, in December, we shared our framework for value creation, including a 7% to 10% earnings after-tax growth and a 10% to 15% of total shareholder returns calculated as EPS growth plus dividend yield. The metrics for our fiscal 2017 outlook are within the long-term targets we shared this past December, with the exception of new restaurant growth. We are working diligently to build the pipeline of new restaurants for future growth. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Gene."

Our results reinforce that our strategy is working as our restaurants and team members continue to build guest loyalty by relentlessly focusing on our back-to-basics operating philosophy, which is rooted in culinary innovation and execution, attentive service, engaging atmospheres and integrated marketing. 
Finally, we continue to leverage our 4 competitive advantages that we see as keys to unlocking sales growth and expanding margins. They are the significant scale of our company, the breadth and depth of our data and consumer insights, our commitment to rigorous, strategic planning and our results-oriented people culture. It's that last competitive advantage, our people, that truly sets our company apart. Together, we've accomplished a great deal over the past 2 years, and we've done it by getting a little better each day. It may sound simple, but it's hard to consistently deliver outstanding guest experiences day in and day out. It only happens because of our 150,000 outstanding team members across our company.

That will have no impact on our organization. Let me talk about labor. Labor is something that we continue to focus on, but we're focusing on it in a different way. And we're focusing it on a really -- when we think about menu development, how our menus are constructed and how that leads the processes and procedures in the kitchen. And we just -- we continue to focus on simplification on -- in all aspects of what I would call the production process or the manufacturing process of producing our menu items. Our teams are doing a great job of simplifying the processes and thinking about how products that we have are adding to the menu or we have on the menu impact the production process. And so we've taken products off the menu that are complex. We've simplified processes and procedures, which has allowed us to improve the overall productivity in the back of the house. Obviously, the front of the house is an area where it's kind of off-limits. We have our beliefs in what it takes to execute out front, and we're focused on back of the house. We've also got a lot of energy around making sure that we have the appropriate labor in the restaurant at the right times. One of the things that we do with our P&L reviews at the end of each quarter is we sit down and we really look at, what's the productivity of our restaurants before we have guests in there and then after we don't have guests in there. And we've been able to take a lot of hours out by making some adjustments there. So we feel like we're improving the guest experience. We're working on productivity with -- in the back of the house with the design of our menus and processes and procedures. I'll close by saying and maybe preempt some other questions on labor is that, labor market is tight, and it continues to be tight in a lot of -- in specific markets, which is driving a little bit more inflation. But as I've said many times on this call, I'd prefer to operate in an environment where labor is tight. I think that will lead to demand into the future."

And affordability is only one component of that value, but it's not really enough to drive sustainable traffic growth. And so obviously, in an Olive Garden, we serve a lot of different guests to get the 5,000 guests a week and each guest is looking for something different. But whenever we find something that the consumer really believes has got value, that's where the consumer goes. And so -- and that's not always the lowest price point or the thing that's discounted the most. We still see a lot of guests in LongHorn just gravitate towards a great filet because it's a great value. We saw a high preference in Olive Garden with seafood lasagna, which caught us a little bit by surprise, but it was the best value in the offering that we had. And so I believe the guest continues to look for value, and the value equation is not always just what's in the numerator. When you think about -- when we think about our brands, all the way from Olive Garden to Capital Grille, obviously, price plays a lot more importance in creating that value in an Olive Garden. Where in Capital Grille, it's much more about how we make you feel that creates the value in that experience. And so we think about it and go along that line in between Olive Garden and Capital Grille. We're looking for that real value differentiator that will drive traffic. And sometimes, it's affordability and price; and sometimes, it's more some of the other attributes. And we keep pulling on all the attributes, not just one. And we continue to make improvements in quality, we continue to make improvements in service. That's why we focus so much on execution. We believe at the end of the day, we got to execute at what we call the 9 square feet, at that table in every one of our restaurants, one table at a time. That really drives the most value to the consumer. Overall, their behavior continues to be the same. We see them still using the full menu. We've got good interesting appetizers, they're buying them. If we've got good, interesting desserts, they're buying them. And so it's compelling for us to keep coming up with great culinary innovation that make people want to buy our products."

LongHorn had a -- every one of our brands had a record Mother's Day and the days around Mother's Day, as we really focused in them. We think that drove a lot of the activity in the month. We are -- we really have liked focusing on these days, both from a communications standpoint but from also from an operational standpoint.

We're looking at an industry that's down closer to almost 2% or high 1s percent. We're working off that number. And so we're looking at a meaningful outperformance with minimal price as we continue to try to improve the value offerings in our businesses. We need to continue to invest. There's a lot of talk about how promotional the environment is right now. But the facts are, the industry is still charging the guest 2-plus percent more than they did last year for the experience. And we believe that '17, with what we know right now, is a year to invest, continue to invest back into the guest experience to continue to grow market share. And if we believe -- if the overall industry was to improve, then I think we think we would improve also. But based on the current trends and what's happened in the last couple of years, we think this is the right way to head into fiscal '17."

I think you have to go to the P&L and look at how much more money that we're making. What we're doing right now is, we, through our data and insights, we identified there were certain guests in the LongHorn system that we were losing money on. And it was obvious to us. And Rick's team did an outstanding job, and we backed off trying to attract those guests into the restaurant and saying, ""If we can't make money on the guest taking up a table on a Saturday night, we're not going to push to bring them in."" So there are few guests that are slipping out that were in our base last year, but they weren't profitable. I'm incredibly impressed with the margin improvement and the progress that we're making with LongHorn. The team's done an outstanding job, and I'm not as concerned about where we are from a traffic standpoint. This model is starting to get back to work the way the model was designed to work many, many years ago.

So what can we do while they're on a wait to improve that process? If we're starting to play with and test a few things. And if we do it correctly, we actually improve the overall value experience without changing anything else on the menu or pricing. And so we've got to continue to focus on the other components of value, where we talk about other components in the numerator and just not focus on what's on the denominator or the value equation.

Because it seems like the less-profitable customers are leaving but you're not getting -- you're not bringing in some of these more-profitable customers that I thought you had in mind would sort of fill the gap.

When we think about LongHorn, first -- let's start -- we're still, from a guest count basis, still 200 basis points above the industry. So we're still taking market share from a guest count standpoint. And I think that's, in itself, very impressive when you look at the rest of the competitive set. We're continuing to make improvements that are going to take quality improvements, that are going to take time to show through to the guest. We've done some things when the price of beef was increasing, that I think hurt the business. But just by changing and we're going back to them tomorrow, doesn't mean a guest is going to come the next day. It's going to take time for our guests to come through and experience -- have a different experience and grow the business. And so when I look at this business -- and this is the one that I'm personally the most familiar with. This is a business that has been underperforming from a profitability standpoint and has been run a little differently over the years than, I think, it should've been run, and now we're running it back. This has never been a great -- a business that needed a lot of -- high guest counts to achieve its profitability. These are small boxes that are designed to put out a strong, profitable return, and then when that business -- building gets full, you build another building 4 miles down the road. And you look at the -- you look at how this business is really set up in Atlanta, where we have 45 restaurants, there's no one -- in dining, casual dining -- that comes close to having the kind of penetration we have with the strategy that we put in place there. And so we are back to building smaller restaurants and focused on ensuring that we're getting the right profitability from those units. We are going to make strategic choices to improve the overall quality of the experience. It's going to take time for those things to get into the consumer, for the consumer to see those and then start improving their frequency. We're reaching other guests that we weren't reaching because of our advertising and how we're talking about the brand. And so I'm really confident, directionally with where we're going and this business is contributing now at a much more -- at a level that's, I think, appropriate, where it has under contributed. Even though it was growing sales all these quarters, it wasn't making any money."

But first, I think that we still break down too many times in Olive Garden, where the -- where somewhere in the service experience, we have a deficiency, whether it's the timing wasn't right, the server didn't get to the table at the right time, the food didn't come out right. When you're talking about the number of guests that we serve, improving that by 1% or 2% has a significant impact on improving our same-restaurant sales. And so we think about just consistently delivering a better experience, I think that's the #1 opportunity for us. We still got room to improve on production and menu simplification. Some of the recipes they -- are still complex, and Dave and the team are thinking about it every day. How do I make that less complex to be able to deliver that to the consumer? There's labor productivity opportunities. We still -- in a system the size of Olive Garden, we can see in our own data, we have opportunities for certain restaurants to improve productivity. Sometimes -- and what the team has done a really great job was, they just haven't gone to the lower-volume restaurants. Some of the time, the opportunity that -- the most opportunity we have is in our higher-volume restaurants. And so they're developing ways to analyze and really discern, where are my real opportunities to improve productivity? There's some controllable costs and management of controllable costs that still -- we have people that don't perform at the same level of others, so there's executional opportunity there. And then lastly, we still think we can execute To Go better. And we think it's that -- that's a huge opportunity for us. As well as we're doing, we believe there's an opportunity to improve that even further."

But we don't believe we have a platform to really -- in LongHorn, with the style of food, to be able to push that to 20% of our overall business, where we think that it's something Olive Garden has a real capability.

With me today is Gene Lee, Darden's CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO. 
As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed earlier today, and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements, and a reconciliation of these measurements is included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2017 first quarter earnings on October 4, before the market opens, followed by a conference call. 
This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks about quarterly performance and brand highlights. Rick will then provide more detail on our financial results from the fourth quarter and share our outlook for fiscal 2017, and Gene will have some closing remarks before we open the call for your questions. 
Before we begin, I want to point out that just as we did last quarter, we reported same-restaurant sales on both a fiscal and comparable calendar basis. This morning, we will refer to the comparable calendar comps during our remarks, unless otherwise noted. Additionally, sales and earnings comparisons versus last year will exclude the impact of the 53rd week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, unless otherwise noted. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Gene."

We had a strong quarter with each of our brands significantly outperforming the industry benchmarks as we continue to focus on improving our execution. Same-restaurant sales grew 2.6% with positive same-restaurant sales at each of our brands. It was a volatile quarter as a result of multiple holiday and calendar shifts, including Easter, Memorial Day and spring break vacations, which we believe negatively impacted comps across the industry. 
Olive Garden had another great quarter and concluded a year in which we served more than 220 million guests. The Olive Garden brand is extremely relevant, the business is strong and our strategy continues to deliver results as evidenced by our ongoing momentum. In Q4, same-restaurant sales grew 2.4%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by more than 440 basis points in both sales and traffic. This was our seventh consecutive quarter same-restaurant sales growth and fourth consecutive quarter of positive same-restaurant guest counts. 
Three key drivers of this performance include: first, further simplification of our operational processes and procedures, leading to improved execution in our restaurants; second, culinary innovation that builds on the brand equities and flavor profiles that our loyal guests enjoy most, as seen with our successful Italian pot pies, Mediterranean fresh and lasagna lover promotions; and finally, continued growth of our successful OG To Go platform. To Go sales were up 19% year-over-year with a 2-year growth rate over 40%. For the year, OG To Go sales represented 10.8% of total sales, an increase of 140 basis points versus last year. Additionally, we had the best Mother's Day in Olive Garden history, which further demonstrates the brand's relevance and its broad appeal as a destination for family celebrating time together. 
Olive Garden remains laser-focused on driving frequency of our loyal guests, while delivering great experiences, and our guests are responding positively. Our innovation pipeline is strong and we still have meaningful operations improvements to capture. 
LongHorn Steakhouse maintained its solid top line momentum and once again delivered strong profit growth. Same-restaurant sales grew 2.2%, the 13th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by more than 400 basis points. And same-restaurant traffic was well above the industry average. We will continue to invest in food quality to enhance the overall perceived value of the dining experience and have multiple in-restaurant tests underway. 
Additionally, LongHorn continues to simplify operations to strengthen in-restaurant execution and deliver great guest experiences. This focus on operational excellence is augmented by compelling, non-price-pointed promotions, like our big bold steaks and LongHorn favorites that reinforce our steak expertise. 
Looking at our specialty restaurants. All 5 businesses continued to deliver solid results that included positive same-restaurant sales growth at each, led by Seasons 52 at 5% and Bahama Breeze at 4.7%. 
Seasons 52 had another strong quarter. We continue to execute our strategy at a very high level and are impressed with what the team has been able to achieve throughout the year. Seasons 52 is an on-trend concept, giving guests the opportunity to enjoy handcrafted cuisine that is healthful without sacrificing the taste or style. We look forward to building on the momentum we have created as we rebuild the pipeline for value-creating new restaurants. 
Yard House represents a significant growth opportunity for us. And during the quarter, we named Mike Kneidinger president. I'm excited to have Mike lead the Yard House team, and he is supported by an extremely strong team. Mike did a tremendous job leading Bahama Breeze, delivering same-restaurant sales growth of 3.5% annually over the past 3 years, and I'm confident he will build on the momentum at Yard House. 
All of our specialty restaurants continue to perform well and are differentiated and well positioned to grow market share into the future. Overall, I'm pleased with the results we achieved this quarter. 
And now I'll turn it over to Rick to discuss those in more detail."
336160,342398633,1003863,"Darden Restaurants, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 30, 2016",2016-06-30,"Earnings Calls","Darden Restaurants, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Darden's fourth quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.10, both on a reported and adjusted basis. They were 8.9% higher than last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per shar",953,"Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Darden's fourth quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.10, both on a reported and adjusted basis. They were 8.9% higher than last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share. As a reminder, last year was a 14-week fiscal quarter. The 8.9% growth assumes a 13-week quarter last year. Additionally, this quarter we paid out over $63 million in dividends and repurchased approximately $45 million in Darden stock. 
Key drivers of this quarter's growth included: positive same-restaurant sales of 1.7% on a fiscal basis, continued progress achieving our cost-savings initiatives throughout the P&L, a favorable commodities environment resulting in approximately 1% deflation in food and beverage expense, and depreciation and interest expense savings related to the real estate transactions. These results were partially offset by 170 basis points of incremental rent and other taxes related to the real estate transactions. Excluding the additional rent expense and other taxes, restaurant expenses would have been favorable by approximately 20 basis points. And while our adjusted tax rate was in line with the expectations we shared last quarter, tax expense as a percent of sales was 80 basis points unfavorable to last year, driven by tax timing. 
Turning to segment performance. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 segment profit includes the incremental rent and other tax expense associated with the real estate transactions, whereas fiscal 2015 did not include these costs. In total, these costs were $30 million for the quarter. The benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings, which were $27 million, are not recognized in segment profit. 
Olive Garden's segment profit margin of 19.3% was 100 basis points lower than last year for the quarter as additional rent drove 230 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding the incremental rent, Olive Garden segment profit margin was 130 basis points higher than last year. 
LongHorn Steakhouse grew segment profit margin by 120 basis points for the quarter to 19%. Excluding the incremental rent, segment profit increased 250 basis points at LongHorn. Our Fine Dining and Other Business segment profit margins were essentially flat on a year-over-year basis at 20.1% and 18.9%, respectively, with our Other Business segment impacted by additional rents. 
We are pleased with the progress each of our segments has made improving profitability. They are leveraging their sales growth and continuing to improve the guest experience, while taking advantage of Darden's scale and working closely with our support teams to identify and capture cost savings. 
Finally, as we announced this morning, our board declared a $0.56 per share quarterly dividend, a 12% increase from last quarter's dividend. We were able to spin off our real estate into a separate, publicly traded company and still increase our quarterly dividend above our pre-spin quarterly dividend. And our spin-off of real estate assets to Four Corners created additional growth for our shareholders, as the current combined dividend of the 2 companies is now 23% higher than the Darden dividend before the spin-off of Four Corners this past November. 
Fiscal 2016 was a year of significant progress at Darden. We achieved 4.4% total sales growth on a 52-week basis; 3.3% same-restaurant sales growth; and 38% growth in adjusted diluted net earnings per share. In addition to meaningful sales and adjusted earnings per share growth, we profitably grew our market share, exceeding the industry benchmark for same-restaurant sales by over 400 basis points; increased adjusted operating margins by over 200 basis points; leveraged our scale, further optimizing our supply chain and managing costs, resulting in $95 million in annual cost-savings, which exceeded our initial targets; and returned more than $450 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Importantly, we also executed our real estate strategy by completing a tax-free spin-off of select real estate assets and restaurant assets into a new public company, Four Corners Property Trust. This transaction advanced our commitment to deliver value to our shareholders while improving our capital structure and reducing debt. 
Using proceeds from this transaction and from the sale leasebacks of our restaurant support center and 64 restaurants plus cash on hand, we paid down $1 billion in debt during the quarter -- during the year. This reduction in debt significantly improved our leverage, resulting in a return to investment-grade credit status from all 3 credit rating agencies. Overall, we're excited -- we're executing a value-creating business model to generate significant and durable cash flow that will fund growth and return capital to shareholders. 
Now looking forward to fiscal 2017. We anticipate total sales growth of 1.7% to 2.7%, which includes: same-restaurant sales growth of 1% to 2% and 24 to 28 new units, capital spending of between $310 million to $350 million, cost savings of approximately $30 million, total inflation between 1.5% and 2%, and a net -- and an annual effective tax rate between 26% and 27%, and approximately 128.5 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in earnings per diluted share between $3.80 and $3.90. 
We anticipate first quarter earnings per share to have the highest growth on a percentage basis as we expect commodities deflation in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, while we forecast commodities inflation in subsequent quarters. 
As a reminder, in December, we shared our framework for value creation, including a 7% to 10% earnings after-tax growth and a 10% to 15% of total shareholder returns calculated as EPS growth plus dividend yield. The metrics for our fiscal 2017 outlook are within the long-term targets we shared this past December, with the exception of new restaurant growth. We are working diligently to build the pipeline of new restaurants for future growth. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Gene."

As I think about fiscal 2016, I'm extremely proud of the progress we made in pursuit of our mission, which is to be financially successful through great people, consistently delivering outstanding food, drinks and service in an inviting atmosphere, making every guest loyal. Our results reinforce that our strategy is working as our restaurants and team members continue to build guest loyalty by relentlessly focusing on our back-to-basics operating philosophy, which is rooted in culinary innovation and execution, attentive service, engaging atmospheres and integrated marketing. 
Finally, we continue to leverage our 4 competitive advantages that we see as keys to unlocking sales growth and expanding margins. They are the significant scale of our company, the breadth and depth of our data and consumer insights, our commitment to rigorous, strategic planning and our results-oriented people culture. It's that last competitive advantage, our people, that truly sets our company apart. Together, we've accomplished a great deal over the past 2 years, and we've done it by getting a little better each day. It may sound simple, but it's hard to consistently deliver outstanding guest experiences day in and day out. It only happens because of our 150,000 outstanding team members across our company. 
So let me close by thanking each of them. We know we got a lot more work to do, but I'm confident our team is up to the challenge.

And we just -- we continue to focus on simplification on -- in all aspects of what I would call the production process or the manufacturing process of producing our menu items. Our teams are doing a great job of simplifying the processes and thinking about how products that we have are adding to the menu or we have on the menu impact the production process. And so we've taken products off the menu that are complex. We've simplified processes and procedures, which has allowed us to improve the overall productivity in the back of the house. Obviously, the front of the house is an area where it's kind of off-limits. We have our beliefs in what it takes to execute out front, and we're focused on back of the house. We've also got a lot of energy around making sure that we have the appropriate labor in the restaurant at the right times. One of the things that we do with our P&L reviews at the end of each quarter is we sit down and we really look at, what's the productivity of our restaurants before we have guests in there and then after we don't have guests in there. And we've been able to take a lot of hours out by making some adjustments there. So we feel like we're improving the guest experience. We're working on productivity with -- in the back of the house with the design of our menus and processes and procedures. I'll close by saying and maybe preempt some other questions on labor is that, labor market is tight, and it continues to be tight in a lot of -- in specific markets, which is driving a little bit more inflation. But as I've said many times on this call, I'd prefer to operate in an environment where labor is tight. I think that will lead to demand into the future."

And affordability is only one component of that value, but it's not really enough to drive sustainable traffic growth. And so obviously, in an Olive Garden, we serve a lot of different guests to get the 5,000 guests a week and each guest is looking for something different. But whenever we find something that the consumer really believes has got value, that's where the consumer goes. And so -- and that's not always the lowest price point or the thing that's discounted the most. We still see a lot of guests in LongHorn just gravitate towards a great filet because it's a great value. We saw a high preference in Olive Garden with seafood lasagna, which caught us a little bit by surprise, but it was the best value in the offering that we had. And so I believe the guest continues to look for value, and the value equation is not always just what's in the numerator. When you think about -- when we think about our brands, all the way from Olive Garden to Capital Grille, obviously, price plays a lot more importance in creating that value in an Olive Garden. Where in Capital Grille, it's much more about how we make you feel that creates the value in that experience. And so we think about it and go along that line in between Olive Garden and Capital Grille. We're looking for that real value differentiator that will drive traffic. And sometimes, it's affordability and price; and sometimes, it's more some of the other attributes. And we keep pulling on all the attributes, not just one. And we continue to make improvements in quality, we continue to make improvements in service. That's why we focus so much on execution. We believe at the end of the day, we got to execute at what we call the 9 square feet, at that table in every one of our restaurants, one table at a time. That really drives the most value to the consumer. Overall, their behavior continues to be the same. We see them still using the full menu. We've got good interesting appetizers, they're buying them. If we've got good, interesting desserts, they're buying them. And so it's compelling for us to keep coming up with great culinary innovation that make people want to buy our products."

Okay, my question's with -- as far as the gap to your KNAPP peers, you accelerated and even widened that toward the end of the quarter in what appears to be the month of May. I know obviously, you're calendar. KNAPP has a different period somewhat, so maybe it's not a perfect science. But both brands seem to have accelerated in the back half of your fiscal quarter. I wondered if you could elaborate on maybe some of the promotional activity or something that you saw competitively that really lit it up in the back half of the quarter. And my follow-up question would be, you did comment that the commodity environment suggests that the EPS in the first half of fiscal '17 would probably drive greater earnings growth. Is that the same for the same-store sales front as far as what we saw in the month of May? Are we carrying faster, greater momentum? I'm looking at the compares. It would suggest, probably, that the first half also will be a comp stronger period than the back half?"

It's pretty flat throughout the year. It's based on what we know right now. And as far as May goes, I -- you are correct. We did accelerate against the industry in May. I think that we focused a lot on Mother's Day, in and around Mother's Day, which gave us a great boost. As I said, Olive Garden had a record Mother's Day. LongHorn had a -- every one of our brands had a record Mother's Day and the days around Mother's Day, as we really focused in them. We think that drove a lot of the activity in the month. We are -- we really have liked focusing on these days, both from a communications standpoint but from also from an operational standpoint. When you look at a Mother's Day in both OG and LongHorn, it's just about how many guests you can get through and execute perfectly throughout the day. And so I think we were active, both digitally and other promotional activity, and we executed extremely well. We also got a big bump in catering and delivery for Mother's Day in OG, which was a strong bump. So I think it's -- it was -- our teams did a great job. We capitalized on the volume when the volume was there."

So I think that's been the #1 sales driver. And as I said in my comments, we think we still have meaningful improvement to make there. Second, we think To Go has been a great sales driver. This has been a leader in what we've been doing. We think we're exposing more guests to Olive Garden. It's been a terrific sales driver. We've done great culinary innovation. We've hit some really big products. Our pot pies were a big hit. Our culinary tour was a big -- our Create Your Own Tour of Italy has been a big hit. Ziosk has been a sales driver. So it's been a good lever that we don't think that we've fully hit our full stride with that. We've still got some room there. And then remodels have been a solid sales driver, outperforming the base by almost 4% in traffic, between 3% and 4% traffic. So I feel like there's multiple levers, but I want to wrap that back around with our maniacal focus on trying to execute better at the restaurant. We, as a team, and me, especially, believe that is the key driver of winning in this business. It's that interaction between a server and the guest. If we don't win there, all the other things aren't as -- I don't want to say they're meaningless, but they're close. We've got to execute at a very high level.

There's a lot of talk about how promotional the environment is right now. But the facts are, the industry is still charging the guest 2-plus percent more than they did last year for the experience.

I'm incredibly impressed with the margin improvement and the progress that we're making with LongHorn.

And we think we have the innovation to do that, and so we'll continue to focus on that. But back to a statement I made earlier. I'm just -- we're just as focused on other components of value than we are just on price. And Dave and the team are really working on other ways to provide value for the guests. So let me give you an example of that. The one thing about an Olive Garden where we see the value perceptions go down is how long the people have to wait to come into our restaurant. So what can we do while they're on a wait to improve that process? If we're starting to play with and test a few things. And if we do it correctly, we actually improve the overall value experience without changing anything else on the menu or pricing. And so we've got to continue to focus on the other components of value, where we talk about other components in the numerator and just not focus on what's on the denominator or the value equation. And so we do need to work at certain price points, but we do need to execute some of those other variables."

We're continuing to make improvements that are going to take quality improvements, that are going to take time to show through to the guest. We've done some things when the price of beef was increasing, that I think hurt the business. But just by changing and we're going back to them tomorrow, doesn't mean a guest is going to come the next day. It's going to take time for our guests to come through and experience -- have a different experience and grow the business. And so when I look at this business -- and this is the one that I'm personally the most familiar with. This is a business that has been underperforming from a profitability standpoint and has been run a little differently over the years than, I think, it should've been run, and now we're running it back. This has never been a great -- a business that needed a lot of -- high guest counts to achieve its profitability. These are small boxes that are designed to put out a strong, profitable return, and then when that business -- building gets full, you build another building 4 miles down the road. And you look at the -- you look at how this business is really set up in Atlanta, where we have 45 restaurants, there's no one -- in dining, casual dining -- that comes close to having the kind of penetration we have with the strategy that we put in place there. And so we are back to building smaller restaurants and focused on ensuring that we're getting the right profitability from those units. We are going to make strategic choices to improve the overall quality of the experience. It's going to take time for those things to get into the consumer, for the consumer to see those and then start improving their frequency. We're reaching other guests that we weren't reaching because of our advertising and how we're talking about the brand. And so I'm really confident, directionally with where we're going and this business is contributing now at a much more -- at a level that's, I think, appropriate, where it has under contributed.

When you're talking about the number of guests that we serve, improving that by 1% or 2% has a significant impact on improving our same-restaurant sales. And so we think about just consistently delivering a better experience, I think that's the #1 opportunity for us. We still got room to improve on production and menu simplification. Some of the recipes they -- are still complex, and Dave and the team are thinking about it every day. How do I make that less complex to be able to deliver that to the consumer? There's labor productivity opportunities. We still -- in a system the size of Olive Garden, we can see in our own data, we have opportunities for certain restaurants to improve productivity. Sometimes -- and what the team has done a really great job was, they just haven't gone to the lower-volume restaurants. Some of the time, the opportunity that -- the most opportunity we have is in our higher-volume restaurants. And so they're developing ways to analyze and really discern, where are my real opportunities to improve productivity? There's some controllable costs and management of controllable costs that still -- we have people that don't perform at the same level of others, so there's executional opportunity there. And then lastly, we still think we can execute To Go better. And we think it's that -- that's a huge opportunity for us.

And I would say, that's a stay-tuned. Because there's just a lot of activity there with the big one. But there's a lot of dollars for our company, and I won't mention any names, if they can come up with a solution to -- for us and for our casual dining and all of dining, there's some money to be made there."

We remain confident that we have the right strategies in place, both in the operating businesses and at the Darden level, and we continue to significantly increase market share as we execute against them. 
All of Darden's positive momentum continued during the quarter. Same-restaurant sales grew 2%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 410 basis points. This was our eighth consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth at Olive Garden. 
The primary drivers of this performance include: 1, our ongoing focus on flawless execution inside the restaurants. Our teams are working hard to get better everyday, which is reflected by the fact that our overall guest satisfaction scores rose to an all-time high during the quarter. 
Two, the strong performance of OG To Go. To Go sales grew 20% compared to the same period last year and more than 50% on a 3-year basis. And 3, culinary innovation. During the quarter, we introduced dishes that build on brand equities and flavor profiles that our loyal guests enjoy most, including pepperoni fettuccine and Italian [ph]. 
Additionally, we continued to interact with our guest in a variety of ways. During the summer, we surprised and delighted many guests by setting up our never ending family table in multiple states across the country. It debuted the high line in New York City where we serve 6,000 guests in 4 hours. This type of nontraditional marketing is popular with millennials and leverages Olive Garden's strong emotional connection. 
The Olive Garden business is strong, and we remain laser-focused on delivering exceptional experience for our guests. 
LongHorn Steakhouse maintained its top line momentum and delivered significant profit growth during the quarter. Same-restaurant sales grew 0.6%, the 14th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 270 basis points. 
We continue to focus on strengthening our in-restaurant execution to improve the guest experience. One way we're doing this is through operation simplification, which enables our team members the better focus on delivering a quality experience for our guests. 
Another way we're strengthening in-restaurant execution is through enhanced training for our culinary team members because we know perfectly grilled steaks are critical to a great steakhouse experience. This came to light during quarter through our steak masters challenge, a highly engaging training program and 2-month competition that began with 6,000 culinary team members and ended with a grill master, Alex Alvarado, being crowned the stake master champion. 
The team at LongHorn is focused on the right priorities and our research shows that we're making meaningful progress on multiple fronts. 
Turning to our specialty restaurants. All 5 of our businesses continue to perform well and increase share, and each one is well positioned for growth as we build out our pipeline. The Bahama Breeze team delivered another strong quarter. Same-restaurant sales were up 3.9% as guests continue to respond positively to the enhancements we are making to create an immersive experience that feels like a tropical getaway. 
Seasons 52 performed well as same-restaurant sales up 0.7%. We continue to be a leader in culinary innovation and the restaurant of choice for guest, who are conscientious of what they eat but are not willing to compromise taste. Same-restaurant sales were flat at Yard House. I really like what the team is working on as [ph] gets further immersed in the business. 
And finally, the capital [ph] at same-restaurant sales down 1.2 and 1.7, respectively, wrapping on 7.2 and 5.1 same-restaurant sales growth last year. Not only do we anticipate this was going to be a difficult for both brands, Texas continues to be a tough market for our Fine Dining brands. However, if you normalize for Memorial Day, which was observed in Q1 of this year [ph] Q4 of fiscal 2015, the Capital Grille would have been positive. 
Now I'll turn it over to Rick to discuss our results in more detail."
336160,383736818,1052667,"Darden Restaurants, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 04, 2016",2016-10-04,"Earnings Calls","Darden Restaurants, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Darden's first quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.88, an increase of 29.4% from last year's adjusted earnings per share. We returned more than $0.25 billion of capital t",977,"Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Darden's first quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.88, an increase of 29.4% from last year's adjusted earnings per share. 
We returned more than $0.25 billion of capital to our shareholders in the form of more than $70 million in dividends and approximately $196 million in share repurchases. And as we announced this morning, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program for up to $500 million of Darden's outstanding common stock. This plan does not have an experience in the and it replaced the previous plan. 
For clarity, we repurchased an additional $4 million worth of shares in the first week of the second quarter, which was still under the prior authorization, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $200 million. 
As a reminder, while our long-term framework reflects share repurchases of $100 million to $200 million per year, the actual amount of shares we repurchased in any given year could be higher or lower than that range, just like any of the elements in our framework. 
Looking at key drivers of our earnings performance for the first quarter, we had sales leverage from our positive same-restaurant sales of 1.3%; a favorable commodities environment resulting in approximately 1.5% deflation in food and beverage expense; continued progress leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings throughout the P&L; and approximately 170 basis points of incremental restaurant rent expense and other taxes resulting from real estate transactions last year. Excluding these costs, the restaurant expense line would have been approximately 10 basis points favorable to last year. In addition, below the restaurant level EBITDA line, we had depreciation and interest expense savings related to the real estate transactions; a planned gain of approximately $8 million, primarily related to the sale and closure of 1 Bahama Breeze restaurant. This transitional occurred in the first month of the fiscal quarter and was contemplated in the full fiscal 2017 earnings outlook we provided in June. 
And legal expenses that were unfavorable to our expectations by approximately $3 million, along with $2 million of support center rent expense and other taxes related to the sale leaseback. Excluding these expenses, SG&A as a percent of total sales would have been 40 basis points favorable to last year's adjusted G&A expense. 
Turning to segment performance. As a reminder, due to the real estate transactions last year, segment profit for the quarter include incremental rent and other tax expense of $29 million. The benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings are not recognized in segment profit. 
Olive Garden segment profit margin of 19.4% was 90 basis points lower than last year for the quarter as additional rent drove 230 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding the incremental rent, Olive Garden segment profit margin was 140 [ph] basis points higher than last year. LongHorn Steakhouse continues to strengthen its business model, improving segment profit margin by 70 basis points this quarter to 15.6%, even with a headwind of 150 basis points related to additional rents expenses. 
Excluding the incremental rent, segment profit margin increased 220 basis points at LongHorn. Segment profit margin declined 90 basis points to 14.8% in our Fine Dining segment. Although margins were lowered to the negative same-restaurant sales in the quarter, they were flat when excluding incremental rent expense and preopening costs, primarily related to 2 new Capital Grille openings in the quarter. 
Our Other Business segment profit margins were down 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis. As additional rents drove 60 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding the incremental rent, segment profit margin at our Other Business was 50 basis points higher than last year. 
Turning to our annual outlook. We increased our fiscal 2017 annual earnings per share range to be between $3.87 to $3.97 from our previous $3.80 to $3.90. This reflects an updated diluted average share count for the year of approximately 126 million shares, primarily as a result of higher-than-anticipated share repurchases in the first quarter as we took advantage of volatility in our stock price. 
All other aspects of our fiscal 2017 outlook remain unchanged, including our same-restaurant sales growth outlook of between 1% and 2%. And while we don't provide specific quarterly guidance, I do want to remind you of a few timing related factors that impact our quarter-to-quarter performance and comparisons to the prior year, specifically in the second quarter. 
First, in November, we will [ph] the completion of our real estate transaction last year. As such, we will incur approximately 2/3 of the incremental quarterly rent and depreciation impact we've been experiencing. However, we will have essentially a full quarters of interest savings relative to last year as most of the debt reduction related to our real estate transactions didn't occur until early in last year's third quarter. 
Additionally, the G&A expense in the second quarter of last year was abnormally low due to favorable legal settlement of approximately $13 million that we do not expect to recur. 
Finally, this favorable settlement was partially offset by approximately $8 million in asset impairments in the second quarter of last year, which is reported on the impairments line of our financial statements. 
As Gene mentioned, we are confident we have the right strategies in place. This is clearly evident in our sales outperformance versus the industry, while our teams continue to better manage their businesses and leverage Darden's scale to improve profitability. 
We continue to believe the ardent represents an attractive investment given our strong cash flow generation, our investment-grade credit rating with a compelling dividend yield, which is 3.65% based on yesterday's closing price; and as we laid out in our long-term framework, our expectations for 10% to 15% total shareholder return overtime. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Gene for some closing remarks."

And I was informed that I may have a problem with my microphone as I opened, so I want to summarize my opening comments before I close. Overall, I'm very pleased with our overall performance and the progress we have made against and strategic initiatives in the quarter.

Same-restaurant sales grew 1.3%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 340 basis points; and earnings per share were $0.88, an increase of 29.4% from last year's adjusted diluted net earnings. 
So overall, Q1 was a good quarter for us. Our strategies are working. We continue to grow share, improve margins and make meaningful investments in our business while returning capital to shareholders. It was also an important time of the year for us as we held our annual leadership conferences for each business. 
These conferences allow us to get in front of every general manager and managing partner across our 1,539 restaurants to align our plans for the year and generate a lot of excitement. 
For me personally, aside from being in our restaurants day to day, it's one of the things I enjoy most about my job. It's a great chance to engage with our leaders and listen to those closest to the action. It also confirm for me that our results during the people culture is truly what sets us apart. 
Our restaurant teams and our restaurant support center staff are the best in the business, and I take great pride in the fact that our team member turnover continues to be flat year-over-year, which reflects our compelling employment proposition. So I'll close by saying, thank you to our team members for their heart of everything we'll do.

I think restaurants today have to stay -- they have to stay relevant and they need to continue to invest in the experience. And I believe that this quarter of outperformance has less to do with what we did this quarter, but more to do we've done over the last 2 years to improve the overall experience in Olive Garden. And we've been on this plan now for almost 3 years since Dave George has been involved and everything cumulatively adding -- is adding up to our competitive advantage that we have in Olive Garden, which is value. And I think our advertising is relevant. I think most importantly, we're running better restaurants today than we were in the past and as you all know, this is a momentum business, and I think this business has that momentum right now. When I look at may be what you call weaknesses in the Other Business, somewhat I want to use that word, our business has performed well. We have big gaps in the marketplace. And I think LongHorn had a really good quarter. When we look at LongHorn, we'll give you segment earnings now, when you to look at that number, the overall performance of that business is up. We needed that business to contribute more from an earnings standpoint. We're getting that, and I'm pleased with it had.

We're not giving up check average as we shift incentives from freestanding inserts to digital. Digital is a much more cost-effective way to reach your consumer.

All of Darden's positive momentum continued during the quarter. Same-restaurant sales grew 2%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 410 basis points. This was our eighth consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth at Olive Garden. 
The primary drivers of this performance include: one, our ongoing focus on flawless execution inside the restaurants. Our teams are working hard to get better everyday, which is reflected by the fact that our overall guest satisfaction scores rose to an all-time high during the quarter. 
Two, the strong performance of OG To Go. To Go sales grew 20% compared to the same period last year and more than 50% on a 3-year basis. 
And three, culinary innovation. During the quarter, we introduced dishes that built on brand equities and flavor profiles that our loyal guests enjoy most, including pepperoni fettuccine and Italian pot pies. 
Additionally, we continued to interact with our guests in a variety of ways. During the summer, we surprised and delighted many guests by setting up our never-ending family table in multiple states across the country. It debuted at The High Line in New York City where we served 6,000 guests in 4 hours. This type of nontraditional marketing is popular with millennials and leverages Olive Garden's strong emotional connection. 
The Olive Garden business is strong, and we remain laser focused on delivering exceptional experience for our guests. 
LongHorn Steakhouse maintained its top line momentum and delivered significant profit growth during the quarter. Same-restaurant sales grew 0.6%, the 14th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 270 basis points. 
We continue to focus on strengthening our in-restaurant execution to improve the guest experience. One way we're doing this is through operation simplification, which enables our team members to better focus on delivering a quality experience for our guests. 
Another way we're strengthening in-restaurant execution is through enhanced training for our culinary team members because we know perfectly grilled steaks are critical to a great steakhouse experience. This came to light during the quarter through our Steak Masters challenge, a highly engaging training program and 2-month competition that began with 6,000 culinary team members and ended with the grill master, Alex Alvarado, being crowned the Steak Master champion. 
The team at LongHorn is focused on the right priorities, and our research shows that we're making meaningful progress on multiple fronts. 
Turning to our Specialty Restaurants. All 5 of our businesses continue to perform well and increase share, and each one is well positioned for growth as we build out our pipeline. The Bahama Breeze team delivered another strong quarter. Same-restaurant sales were up 3.9% as guests continued to respond positively to the enhancements we're making to create an immersive experience that feels like a tropical getaway. 
Seasons 52 performed well, with same-restaurant sales up 0.7%. We continued to be a leader in culinary innovation and the restaurant of choice for guests who are conscientious about what they eat but are not willing to compromise taste. Same-restaurant sales were flat at Yard House. I really like what the team is working on, as Mike Kneidinger gets further immersed in the business. 
And finally, The Capital Grille and Eddie V's same-restaurant sales were down 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively, wrapping on 7.2% and 5.1% same-restaurant sales growth last year. Not only did we anticipate this was going to be a difficult wrap for both brands, Texas continues to be a tough market for our Fine Dining brands. However, if you normalize for Memorial Day, which was observed in Q1 of this year but Q4 of fiscal 2015, The Capital Grille would have been positive. 
Now I'll turn it over to Rick to discuss our results in more detail."
336160,383736818,1052702,"Darden Restaurants, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 04, 2016",2016-10-04,"Earnings Calls","Darden Restaurants, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Darden's first quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.88, an increase of 29.4% from last year's adjusted earnings per share. We returned more than $0.25 billion of capital t",975,"Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Darden's first quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.88, an increase of 29.4% from last year's adjusted earnings per share. 
We returned more than $0.25 billion of capital to our shareholders in the form of more than $70 million in dividends and approximately $196 million in share repurchases. And as we announced this morning, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program for up to $500 million of Darden's outstanding common stock. This plan does not have an expiration date, and it replaces the previous plan. 
For clarity, we repurchased an additional $4 million worth of shares in the first week of the second quarter, which were still under the prior authorization, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $200 million. 
As a reminder, while our long-term framework reflects share repurchases of $100 million to $200 million per year, the actual amount of shares we repurchase in any given year could be higher or lower than that range, just like any of the elements in our framework. 
Looking at key drivers of our earnings performance for the first quarter, we had sales leverage from our positive same-restaurant sales of 1.3%; a favorable commodities environment resulting in approximately 1.5% deflation in food and beverage expense; continued progress leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings throughout the P&L; and approximately 170 basis points of incremental restaurant rent expense and other taxes resulting from real estate transactions last year. Excluding these costs, the restaurant expense line would have been approximately 10 basis points favorable to last year. In addition, below the restaurant-level EBITDA line, we had depreciation and interest expense savings related to the real estate transactions; a planned gain of approximately $8 million, primarily related to the sale and closure of 1 Bahama Breeze restaurant. This transaction occurred in the first month of the fiscal quarter and was contemplated in the full fiscal 2017 earnings outlook we provided in June. 
And legal expenses that were unfavorable to our expectations by approximately $3 million, along with $2 million of support center rent expense and other taxes related to the sale leaseback. Excluding these expenses, G&A as a percent of total sales would have been 40 basis points favorable to last year's adjusted G&A expense. 
Turning to segment performance. As a reminder, due to the real estate transactions last year, segment profit for the quarter include incremental rent and other tax expense of $29 million. The benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings are not recognized in segment profit. 
Olive Garden segment profit margin of 19.4% was 90 basis points lower than last year for the quarter as additional rent drove 230 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding incremental rent, Olive Garden segment profit margin was 140 [ph] basis points higher than last year. LongHorn Steakhouse continued to strengthen its business model, improving segment profit margin by 70 basis points this quarter to 15.6%, even with a headwind of 150 basis points related to additional rents expenses. Excluding the incremental rent, segment profit margin increased 220 basis points at LongHorn. 
Segment profit margin declined 90 basis points to 14.8% in our Fine Dining segment. Although margins were lower due to negative same-restaurant sales in the quarter, they were flat when excluding incremental rent expense and preopening costs, primarily related to 2 new Capital Grille openings in the quarter. 
Our Other Business segment profit margins were down 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis, as additional rent drove 60 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding incremental rent, segment profit margin at our Other Business was 50 basis points higher than last year. 
Turning to our annual outlook. We increased our fiscal 2017 annual earnings per share range to be between $3.87 to $3.97 from our previous $3.80 to $3.90. This reflects an updated diluted average share count for the year of approximately 126 million shares, primarily as a result of higher-than-anticipated share repurchases in the first quarter as we took advantage of volatility in our stock price. 
All other aspects of our fiscal 2017 outlook remain unchanged, including our same-restaurant sales growth outlook of between 1% and 2%. And while we don't provide specific quarterly guidance, I do want to remind you of a few timing-related factors that impact our quarter-to-quarter performance and comparisons to the prior year, specifically in the second quarter. 
First, in November, we will lap the completion of our real estate transactions last year. As such, we will incur approximately 2/3 of the incremental quarterly rent and depreciation impact we've been experiencing. However, we will have essentially a full quarters [ph] of interest savings relative to last year as most of the debt reduction related to our real estate transactions didn't occur until early in last year's third quarter. 
Additionally, the G&A expense in the second quarter of last year was abnormally low due to a favorable legal settlement of approximately $13 million that we do not expect to reoccur. 
Finally, this favorable settlement was partially offset by approximately $8 million in asset impairments in the second quarter of last year, which is reported on the impairments line of our financial statements. 
As Gene mentioned, we are confident we have the right strategies in place. This is clearly evident in our sales outperformance versus the industry, while our teams continue to better manage their businesses and leverage Darden's scale to improve profitability. 
We continue to believe Darden represents an attractive investment given: our strong cash flow generation; our investment-grade credit rating with a compelling dividend yield, which is 3.65% based on yesterday's closing price; and as we laid out in our long-term framework, our expectations for 10% to 15% total shareholder return over time. 
And with that, I will turn it back over to Gene for some closing remarks."

And I was informed that I may have had a problem with my microphone as I opened, so I'm going to summarize my opening comments before I close. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance and the progress we made against our strategic initiatives in the quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.7 billion, an increase of 1.6%. Same-restaurant sales grew 1.3%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 340 basis points; and earnings per share were $0.88, an increase of 29.4% from last year's adjusted diluted net earnings. 
So overall, Q1 was a good quarter for us. Our strategies are working. We continue to grow share, improve margins and make meaningful investments in our business while returning capital to shareholders. It was also an important time of the year for us as we held our annual leadership conferences for each business. These conferences allow us to get in front of every general manager and managing partner across our 1,539 restaurants to align our plans for the year and generate a lot of excitement. 
For me personally, aside from being in our restaurants day to day, it's one of the things I enjoy most about my job. It's a great chance to engage with our leaders and listen to those closest to the action. It also confirmed for me that our results-oriented people culture is truly what sets us apart. 
Our restaurant teams and our restaurant support center staff are the best in the business, and I take great pride in the fact that our team member turnover continues to be flat year-over-year, which reflects our compelling employment proposition. So I'll close by saying thank you to our team members who are at the heart of everything we'll do. 
And now we'll open it up for questions."

I think the consumer environment is -- it continues to be difficult. I think there's a lot of choices the consumer has with their discretionary income, and I think that restaurants are competing against a lot of those other choices, not just restaurants. I think restaurants today have to stay -- they have to stay relevant and they need to continue to invest in the experience. And I believe that this quarter of outperformance has less to do with what we did this quarter, but more to do with what we've done over the last 2 years to improve the overall experience in Olive Garden. And we've been on this plan now for almost 3 years since Dave George has been involved, and everything cumulatively adding -- is adding up to our competitive advantage that we have in Olive Garden, which is value. And I think our advertising is relevant. I think most importantly, we're running better restaurants today than we were in the past. And as you all know, this is a momentum business, and I think this business has that momentum right now. When I look at maybe -- what you would call weaknesses in the Other Business -- I'm not sure I want to use that word, I think our business has performed well. We had big gaps in the marketplace. And I think LongHorn had a really good quarter. When we look at LongHorn, we'll give you segment earnings now, when you look at that number, the overall performance of that business is up. We needed that business to contribute more from an earnings standpoint. We're getting that, and I'm pleased with that. And when I -- when you look at -- to give you a little bit of color just based on geographic, Texas is still -- continues to be an area where we struggle. Obviously, Olive Garden continues to hold its own in Texas, but the momentum is split in there, too."

As part of that, we've increased our digital spending in conjunction with our promotional strategy, which is really less broadscale discounting while using more targeted incentives to create value. And you can see the results of that as you look at our check average over time. We're not giving up check average as we shift incentives from freestanding inserts to digital. Digital is a much more cost-effective way to reach your consumer. And so as you take the value away from these price points and promotions, which were deep in LongHorn over the years, and you shift it to more of a targeted digital incentive, we think that that's a much better way to go after this, and you can -- and I think we can see it in our financial performance.

We are -- we believe that it's important to move as many people as we possibly can over to online ordering. We've talked about the importance of that because the average check is much higher when someone orders online, and we can prompt them through that order. But secondarily, from an operations standpoint, it's really important to not have -- if we can move people off the phone taking orders to serving guests in the restaurant, that's really helpful. And when you think about we have a To Go specialist 1, 2 or 3 and they're on the phone taking an order and there's a guest in front of them, the priority becomes the guest in front of them, not the person on the phone.

I would just urge you to go back and look at the benchmarks and see that there's still a 2% to 2.5% gap between -- or the -- let me phrase it this way: The consumer is paying 2.5% more this year than they did last year, and that's been true for 7 years. For me, we haven't really seen a real promotional environment since the Great Recession. There was 18-month period there where we saw a lot of promotional activity when check average was actually less than guest counts.

The good news is these specialty brands are higher sales volumes than an average Darden restaurant. So even if we open 1 or 2, it's like opening 3 or 4 LongHorns.

keep going, cultivate our results-oriented people culture to enable growth. We remain confident that we have the right strategies in place, both in the operating businesses and at the Darden level, and we continue to significantly increase market share as we execute against them. 
Olive Garden's positive momentum continued during the quarter. Same-restaurant sales grew 2%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 410 basis points. This was our eighth consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth at Olive Garden. 
The primary drivers of this performance include: one, our ongoing focus on flawless execution inside the restaurants. Our teams are working hard to get better every day, which is reflected by the fact that our overall guest satisfaction scores rose to an all-time high during the quarter. 
Two, the strong performance of OG To Go. To Go sales grew 20% compared to the same period last year and more than 50% on a 3-year basis. 
And three, culinary innovation. During the quarter, we introduced dishes that built on brand equities and flavor profiles that our loyal guests enjoy most, including pepperoni fettuccine and Italian pot pies. 
Additionally, we continued to interact with our guests in a variety of ways. During the summer, we surprised and delighted many guests by setting up our never-ending family table in multiple states across the country. It debuted at The High Line in New York City where we served 6,000 guests in 4 hours. This type of nontraditional marketing is popular with millennials and leverages Olive Garden's strong emotional connection. 
The Olive Garden business is strong, and we remain laser focused on delivering exceptional experience for our guests. 
LongHorn Steakhouse maintained its top line momentum and delivered significant profit growth during the quarter. Same-restaurant sales grew 0.6%, the 14th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 270 basis points. 
We continue to focus on strengthening our in-restaurant execution to improve the guest experience. One way we're doing this is through operation simplification, which enables our team members to better focus on delivering a quality experience for our guests. 
Another way we're strengthening in-restaurant execution is through enhanced training for our culinary team members because we know perfectly grilled steaks are critical to a great steakhouse experience. This came to light during the quarter through our Steak Masters challenge, a highly engaging training program and 2-month competition that began with 6,000 culinary team members and ended with the grill master, Alex Alvarado, being crowned the Steak Master champion. 
The team at LongHorn is focused on the right priorities, and our research shows that we're making meaningful progress on multiple fronts. 
Turning to our Specialty Restaurants. All 5 of our businesses continue to perform well and increase share, and each one is well positioned for growth as we build out our pipeline. The Bahama Breeze team delivered another strong quarter. Same-restaurant sales were up 3.9% as guests continued to respond positively to the enhancements we're making to create an immersive experience that feels like a tropical getaway. 
Seasons 52 performed well, with same-restaurant sales up 0.7%. We continue to be a leader in culinary innovation and the restaurant of choice for guests who are conscientious about what they eat but are not willing to compromise taste. Same-restaurant sales were flat at Yard House. I really like what the team is working on, as Mike Kneidinger gets further immersed in the business. 
And finally, The Capital Grille and Eddie V's same-restaurant sales were down 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively, wrapping on 7.2% and 5.1% same-restaurant sales growth last year. Not only did we anticipate this was going to be a difficult wrap for both brands, Texas continues to be a tough market for our Fine Dining brands. However, if you normalize for Memorial Day, which was observed in Q1 of this year but Q4 of fiscal 2015, The Capital Grille would have been positive. 
Now I'll turn it over to Rick to discuss our results in more detail."
336160,383736818,1052805,"Darden Restaurants, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 04, 2016",2016-10-04,"Earnings Calls","Darden Restaurants, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Darden's first quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.88, an increase of 29.4% from last year's adjusted earnings per share. We returned more than $0.25 billion of capital t",973,"Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Darden's first quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.88, an increase of 29.4% from last year's adjusted earnings per share. 
We returned more than $0.25 billion of capital to our shareholders in the form of more than $70 million in dividends and approximately $196 million in share repurchases. And as we announced this morning, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program for up to $500 million of Darden's outstanding common stock. This plan does not have an expiration date, and it replaces the previous plan. 
For clarity, we repurchased an additional $4 million worth of shares in the first week of the second quarter, which were still under the prior authorization, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $200 million. 
As a reminder, while our long-term framework reflects share repurchases of $100 million to $200 million per year, the actual amount of shares we repurchase in any given year could be higher or lower than that range, just like any of the elements in our framework. 
Looking at key drivers of our earnings performance for the first quarter. We had sales leverage from our positive same-restaurant sales of 1.3%; a favorable commodities environment resulting in approximately 1.5% deflation in food and beverage expense; continued progress leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings throughout the P&L; and approximately 170 basis points of incremental restaurant rent expense and other taxes resulting from real estate transactions last year. Excluding these costs, the restaurant expense line would have been approximately 10 basis points favorable to last year. In addition, below the restaurant-level EBITDA line, we had depreciation and interest expense savings related to the real estate transactions; a planned gain of approximately $8 million, primarily related to the sale and closure of 1 Bahama Breeze restaurant. This transaction occurred in the first month of the fiscal quarter and was contemplated in the full fiscal 2017 earnings outlook we provided in June. 
And legal expenses that were unfavorable to our expectations by approximately $3 million, along with $2 million of support center rent expense and other taxes related to the sale leaseback. Excluding these expenses, G&A as a percent of total sales would have been 40 basis points favorable to last year's adjusted G&A expense. 
Turning to segment performance. As a reminder, due to the real estate transactions last year, segment profit for the quarter includes incremental rent and other tax expense of $29 million. The benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings are not recognized in segment profit. 
Olive Garden's segment profit margin of 19.4% was 90 basis points lower than last year for the quarter as additional rent drove 230 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding incremental rent, Olive Garden's segment profit margin was 140 basis points higher than last year. LongHorn Steakhouse continued to strengthen its business model, improving segment profit margin by 70 basis points this quarter to 15.6%, even with a headwind of 150 basis points related to additional rents expenses. Excluding the incremental rent, segment profit margin increased 220 basis points at LongHorn. 
Segment profit margin declined 90 basis points to 14.8% in our Fine Dining segment. Although margins were lower due to negative same-restaurant sales in the quarter, they were flat when excluding incremental rent expense and preopening costs, primarily related to 2 new Capital Grille openings in the quarter. 
Our Other Business segment profit margins were down 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis, as additional rent drove 60 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding incremental rent, segment profit margin at our Other Business was 50 basis points higher than last year. 
Turning to our annual outlook. We increased our fiscal 2017 annual earnings per share range to be between $3.87 to $3.97 from our previous $3.80 to $3.90. This reflects an updated diluted average share count for the year of approximately 126 million shares, primarily as a result of higher-than-anticipated share repurchases in the first quarter as we took advantage of volatility in our stock price. 
All other aspects of our fiscal 2017 outlook remain unchanged, including our same-restaurant sales growth outlook of between 1% and 2%. And while we don't provide specific quarterly guidance, I do want to remind you of a few timing-related factors that impact our quarter-to-quarter performance and comparisons to the prior year, specifically in the second quarter. 
First, in November, we will lap the completion of our real estate transactions last year. As such, we will incur approximately 2/3 of the incremental quarterly rent and depreciation impact we've been experiencing. However, we will have essentially a full quarter's of interest savings relative to last year as most of the debt reduction related to our real estate transactions didn't occur until early in last year's third quarter. 
Additionally, the G&A expense in the second quarter of last year was abnormally low due to a favorable legal settlement of approximately $13 million that we do not expect to reoccur. 
Finally, this favorable settlement was partially offset by approximately $8 million in asset impairments in the second quarter of last year, which is reported on the impairments line of our financial statements. 
As Gene mentioned, we are confident we have the right strategies in place. This is clearly evident in our sales outperformance versus the industry, while our teams continue to better manage their businesses and leverage Darden's scale to improve profitability. 
We continue to believe Darden represents an attractive investment given: our strong cash flow generation; our investment-grade credit rating with a compelling dividend yield, which is 3.65% based on yesterday's closing price; and as we laid out in our long-term framework, our expectations for 10% to 15% total shareholder return over time. 
And with that, I will turn it back over to Gene for some closing remarks."

And I was informed that I may have had a problem with my microphone as I opened, so I'm going to summarize my opening comments before I close. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance and the progress we made against our strategic initiatives in the quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.7 billion, an increase of 1.6%. Same-restaurant sales grew 1.3%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 340 basis points; and earnings per share were $0.88, an increase of 29.4% from last year's adjusted diluted net earnings. 
So overall, Q1 was a good quarter for us. Our strategies are working. We continue to grow share, improve margins and make meaningful investments in our business while returning capital to shareholders. It was also an important time of the year for us as we held our annual leadership conferences for each business. These conferences allow us to get in front of every general manager and managing partner across our 1,539 restaurants to align our plans for the year and generate a lot of excitement. 
For me personally, aside from being in our restaurants day to day, it's one of the things I enjoy most about my job. It's a great chance to engage with our leaders and listen to those closest to the action. It also confirmed for me that our results-oriented people culture is truly what sets us apart. 
Our restaurant teams and our restaurant support center staff are the best in the business, and I take great pride in the fact that our team member turnover continues to be flat year-over-year, which reflects our compelling employment proposition. So I'll close by saying thank you to our team members who are at the heart of everything we'll do. 
And now we'll open it up for questions."

I think the consumer environment is -- it continues to be difficult. I think there's a lot of choices the consumer has with their discretionary income, and I think that restaurants are competing against a lot of those other choices, not just restaurants. I think restaurants today have to stay -- they have to stay relevant and they need to continue to invest in the experience. And I believe that this quarter of outperformance has less to do with what we did this quarter, but more to do with what we've done over the last 2 years to improve the overall experience in Olive Garden. And we've been on this plan now for almost 3 years since Dave George has been involved, and everything cumulatively adding -- is adding up to our competitive advantage that we have in Olive Garden, which is value. And I think our advertising is relevant. I think most importantly, we're running better restaurants today than we were in the past. And as you all know, this is a momentum business, and I think this business has that momentum right now. When I look at maybe what you would call weaknesses in the Other Business -- I'm not sure I want to use that word, I think our business has performed well. We had big gaps in the marketplace. And I think LongHorn had a really good quarter. When we look at LongHorn, we'll give you segment earnings now, when you look at that number, the overall performance of that business is up. We needed that business to contribute more from an earnings standpoint. We're getting that, and I'm pleased with that. And when I -- when you look at -- to give you a little bit of color just based on geographic, Texas is still -- continues to be an area where we struggle. Obviously, Olive Garden continues to hold its own in Texas, but the momentum is split in [ph] there, too."

As part of that, we've increased our digital spending in conjunction with our promotional strategy, which is really less broadscale discounting while using more targeted incentives to create value. And you can see the results of that as you look at our check average over time. We're not giving up check average as we shift incentives from freestanding inserts to digital. Digital is a much more cost-effective way to reach your consumer. And so as you take the value away from these price-pointed promotions, which were deep in LongHorn over the years, and you shift it to more of a targeted digital incentive, we think that that's a much better way to go after this, and you can -- and I think we can see it in our financial performance. I would also just say, I mean, the landscape on advertising and marketing is changing dramatically and we are constantly trying to find new ways and using our data scientists to analyze what is going on and what is the most cost-effective way to deliver the appropriate value to the right guest at the right time.

We are -- we believe that it's important to move as many people as we possibly can over to online ordering. We've talked about the importance of that because the average check is much higher when someone orders online, and we can prompt them through that order. But secondarily, from an operations standpoint, it's really important to not have -- if we can move people off the phone taking orders to serving guests in the restaurant, that's really helpful. And when you think about we have a To Go specialist 1, 2 or 3 and they're on the phone taking an order and there's a guest in front of them, the priority becomes the guest in front of them, not the person on the phone.

So what we talked about in our long-term framework on new units was we expect to be below that long-term framework early and start ramping up for that. The good news is these specialty brands are higher sales volumes than an average Darden restaurant. So even if we open 1 or 2, it's like opening 3 or 4 LongHorns.

keep going, cultivate our results-oriented people culture to enable growth. We remain confident that we have the right strategies in place, both in the operating businesses and at the Darden level, and we continue to significantly increase market share as we execute against them. 
Olive Garden's positive momentum continued during the quarter. Same-restaurant sales grew 2%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 410 basis points. This was our eighth consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth at Olive Garden. 
The primary drivers of this performance include: one, our ongoing focus on flawless execution inside the restaurants. Our teams are working hard to get better every day, which is reflected by the fact that our overall guest satisfaction scores rose to an all-time high during the quarter. 
Two, the strong performance of OG To Go. To Go sales grew 20% compared to the same period last year and more than 50% on a 3-year basis. 
And three, culinary innovation. During the quarter, we introduced dishes that built on brand equities and flavor profiles that our loyal guests enjoy most, including pepperoni fettuccine and Italian pot pies. 
Additionally, we continued to interact with our guests in a variety of ways. During the summer, we surprised and delighted many guests by setting up our never-ending family table in multiple states across the country. It debuted at The High Line in New York City where we served 6,000 guests in 4 hours. This type of nontraditional marketing is popular with millennials and leverages Olive Garden's strong emotional connection. 
The Olive Garden business is strong, and we remain laser focused on delivering exceptional experience for our guests. 
LongHorn Steakhouse maintained its top line momentum and delivered significant profit growth during the quarter. Same-restaurant sales grew 0.6%, the 14th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 270 basis points. 
We continue to focus on strengthening our in-restaurant execution to improve the guest experience. One way we're doing this is through operation simplification, which enables our team members to better focus on delivering a quality experience for our guests. 
Another way we're strengthening in-restaurant execution is through enhanced training for our culinary team members because we know perfectly grilled steaks are critical to a great steakhouse experience. This came to light during the quarter through our Steak Masters challenge, a highly engaging training program and 2-month competition that began with 6,000 culinary team members and ended with the grill master, Alex Alvarado, being crowned the Steak Master champion. 
The team at LongHorn is focused on the right priorities, and our research shows that we're making meaningful progress on multiple fronts. 
Turning to our Specialty Restaurants. All 5 of our businesses continue to perform well and increase share, and each one is well positioned for growth as we build out our pipeline. The Bahama Breeze team delivered another strong quarter. Same-restaurant sales were up 3.9% as guests continued to respond positively to the enhancements we're making to create an immersive experience that feels like a tropical getaway. 
Seasons 52 performed well, with same-restaurant sales up 0.7%. We continue to be a leader in culinary innovation and the restaurant of choice for guests who are conscientious about what they eat but are not willing to compromise taste. Same-restaurant sales were flat at Yard House. I really like what the team is working on, as Mike Kneidinger gets further immersed in the business. 
And finally, The Capital Grille and Eddie V's same-restaurant sales were down 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively, wrapping on 7.2% and 5.1% same-restaurant sales growth last year. Not only did we anticipate this was going to be a difficult wrap for both brands, Texas continues to be a tough market for our Fine Dining brands. However, if you normalize for Memorial Day, which was observed in Q1 of this year but Q4 of fiscal 2015, The Capital Grille would have been positive. 
Now I'll turn it over to Rick to discuss our results in more detail."
336160,383736818,1053126,"Darden Restaurants, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 04, 2016",2016-10-04,"Earnings Calls","Darden Restaurants, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Darden's first quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.88, an increase of 29.4% from last year's adjusted earnings per share. We returned more than $0.25 billion of capital t",973,"Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Darden's first quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.88, an increase of 29.4% from last year's adjusted earnings per share. 
We returned more than $0.25 billion of capital to our shareholders in the form of more than $70 million in dividends and approximately $196 million in share repurchases. And as we announced this morning, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program for up to $500 million of Darden's outstanding common stock. This plan does not have an expiration date, and it replaces the previous plan. 
For clarity, we repurchased an additional $4 million worth of shares in the first week of the second quarter, which were still under the prior authorization, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $200 million. 
As a reminder, while our long-term framework reflects share repurchases of $100 million to $200 million per year, the actual amount of shares we repurchase in any given year could be higher or lower than that range, just like any of the elements in our framework. 
Looking at key drivers of our earnings performance for the first quarter. We had sales leverage from our positive same-restaurant sales of 1.3%; a favorable commodities environment resulting in approximately 1.5% deflation in food and beverage expense; continued progress leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings throughout the P&L; and approximately 170 basis points of incremental restaurant rent expense and other taxes resulting from real estate transactions last year. Excluding these costs, the restaurant expense line would have been approximately 10 basis points favorable to last year. In addition, below the restaurant-level EBITDA line, we had depreciation and interest expense savings related to the real estate transactions; a planned gain of approximately $8 million, primarily related to the sale and closure of 1 Bahama Breeze restaurant. This transaction occurred in the first month of the fiscal quarter and was contemplated in the full fiscal 2017 earnings outlook we provided in June. 
And legal expenses that were unfavorable to our expectations by approximately $3 million, along with $2 million of support center rent expense and other taxes related to the sale leaseback. Excluding these expenses, G&A as a percent of total sales would have been 40 basis points favorable to last year's adjusted G&A expense. 
Turning to segment performance. As a reminder, due to the real estate transactions last year, segment profit for the quarter includes incremental rent and other tax expense of $29 million. The benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings are not recognized in segment profit. 
Olive Garden's segment profit margin of 19.4% was 90 basis points lower than last year for the quarter as additional rent drove 230 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding incremental rent, Olive Garden's segment profit margin was 140 basis points higher than last year. LongHorn Steakhouse continued to strengthen its business model, improving segment profit margin by 70 basis points this quarter to 15.6%, even with a headwind of 150 basis points related to additional rents expenses. Excluding the incremental rent, segment profit margin increased 220 basis points at LongHorn. 
Segment profit margin declined 90 basis points to 14.8% in our Fine Dining segment. Although margins were lower due to negative same-restaurant sales in the quarter, they were flat when excluding incremental rent expense and preopening costs, primarily related to 2 new Capital Grille openings in the quarter. 
Our Other Business segment profit margins were down 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis, as additional rent drove 60 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding incremental rent, segment profit margin at our Other Business was 50 basis points higher than last year. 
Turning to our annual outlook. We increased our fiscal 2017 annual earnings per share range to be between $3.87 to $3.97 from our previous $3.80 to $3.90. This reflects an updated diluted average share count for the year of approximately 126 million shares, primarily as a result of higher-than-anticipated share repurchases in the first quarter as we took advantage of volatility in our stock price. 
All other aspects of our fiscal 2017 outlook remain unchanged, including our same-restaurant sales growth outlook of between 1% and 2%. And while we don't provide specific quarterly guidance, I do want to remind you of a few timing-related factors that impact our quarter-to-quarter performance and comparisons to the prior year, specifically in the second quarter. 
First, in November, we will lap the completion of our real estate transactions last year. As such, we will incur approximately 2/3 of the incremental quarterly rent and depreciation impact we've been experiencing. However, we will have essentially a full quarter's of interest savings relative to last year as most of the debt reduction related to our real estate transactions didn't occur until early in last year's third quarter. 
Additionally, the G&A expense in the second quarter of last year was abnormally low due to a favorable legal settlement of approximately $13 million that we do not expect to reoccur. 
Finally, this favorable settlement was partially offset by approximately $8 million in asset impairments in the second quarter of last year, which is reported on the impairments line of our financial statements. 
As Gene mentioned, we are confident we have the right strategies in place. This is clearly evident in our sales outperformance versus the industry, while our teams continue to better manage their businesses and leverage Darden's scale to improve profitability. 
We continue to believe Darden represents an attractive investment given: our strong cash flow generation; our investment-grade credit rating with a compelling dividend yield, which is 3.65% based on yesterday's closing price; and as we laid out in our long-term framework, our expectations for 10% to 15% total shareholder return over time. 
And with that, I will turn it back over to Gene for some closing remarks."

And I was informed that I may have had a problem with my microphone as I opened, so I'm going to summarize my opening comments before I close. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance and the progress we made against our strategic initiatives in the quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.7 billion, an increase of 1.6%. Same-restaurant sales grew 1.3%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 340 basis points; and earnings per share were $0.88, an increase of 29.4% from last year's adjusted diluted net earnings. 
So overall, Q1 was a good quarter for us. Our strategies are working. We continue to grow share, improve margins and make meaningful investments in our business while returning capital to shareholders. It was also an important time of the year for us as we held our annual leadership conferences for each business. These conferences allow us to get in front of every general manager and managing partner across our 1,539 restaurants to align our plans for the year and generate a lot of excitement. 
For me personally, aside from being in our restaurants day to day, it's one of the things I enjoy most about my job. It's a great chance to engage with our leaders and listen to those closest to the action. It also confirmed for me that our results-oriented people culture is truly what sets us apart. 
Our restaurant teams and our restaurant support center staff are the best in the business, and I take great pride in the fact that our team member turnover continues to be flat year-over-year, which reflects our compelling employment proposition. So I'll close by saying thank you to our team members who are at the heart of everything we'll do. 
And now we'll open it up for questions."

I think the consumer environment is -- it continues to be difficult. I think there's a lot of choices the consumer has with their discretionary income, and I think that restaurants are competing against a lot of those other choices, not just restaurants. I think restaurants today have to stay -- they have to stay relevant and they need to continue to invest in the experience. And I believe that this quarter of outperformance has less to do with what we did this quarter, but more to do with what we've done over the last 2 years to improve the overall experience in Olive Garden. And we've been on this plan now for almost 3 years since Dave George has been involved, and everything cumulatively adding -- is adding up to our competitive advantage that we have in Olive Garden, which is value. And I think our advertising is relevant. I think most importantly, we're running better restaurants today than we were in the past. And as you all know, this is a momentum business, and I think this business has that momentum right now. When I look at maybe what you would call weaknesses in the Other Business -- I'm not sure I want to use that word, I think our business has performed well. We had big gaps in the marketplace. And I think LongHorn had a really good quarter. When we look at LongHorn, we'll give you segment earnings now, when you look at that number, the overall performance of that business is up. We needed that business to contribute more from an earnings standpoint. We're getting that, and I'm pleased with that. And when I -- when you look at -- to give you a little bit of color just based on geographic, Texas is still -- continues to be an area where we struggle. Obviously, Olive Garden continues to hold its own in Texas, but the momentum is split in [ph] there, too."

As part of that, we've increased our digital spending in conjunction with our promotional strategy, which is really less broadscale discounting while using more targeted incentives to create value. And you can see the results of that as you look at our check average over time. We're not giving up check average as we shift incentives from freestanding inserts to digital. Digital is a much more cost-effective way to reach your consumer. And so as you take the value away from these price-pointed promotions, which were deep in LongHorn over the years, and you shift it to more of a targeted digital incentive, we think that that's a much better way to go after this, and you can -- and I think we can see it in our financial performance.

We are -- we believe that it's important to move as many people as we possibly can over to online ordering. We've talked about the importance of that because the average check is much higher when someone orders online, and we can prompt them through that order. But secondarily, from an operations standpoint, it's really important to not have -- if we can move people off the phone taking orders to serving guests in the restaurant, that's really helpful. And when you think about we have a To Go specialist 1, 2 or 3 and they're on the phone taking an order and there's a guest in front of them, the priority becomes the guest in front of them, not the person on the phone.

The good news is these specialty brands are higher sales volumes than an average Darden restaurant. So even if we open 1 or 2, it's like opening 3 or 4 LongHorns. So again, we expect to be at the low end this year on our -- or below the low end of our long-term framework for new units.

We appreciate you joining us today as we get ready to head into the holidays. We'll keep our remarks brief so we can get to your questions. We had another good quarter. Total sales from continuing operations",764,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today as we get ready to head into the holidays. We'll keep our remarks brief so we can get to your questions. 
We had another good quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.64 billion, an increase of 2.1%. Same-restaurant sales grew 1.7%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 450 basis points. And diluted net earnings per share were $0.64, an increase of 18.5% from last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share. 
Our intense focus on food, service and atmosphere drove our performance once again this quarter. Additionally, at the Darden level, we continue to concentrate on our 4 competitive advantages: one, leveraging our significant scale to create cost advantages; two, using our extensive data and insights to better understand our guests and to effectively communicate with them; three, ensuring our brands systematically go through our rigorous strategic planning process; and four, cultivating our results-oriented people culture to enable growth. Our approach continues to be effective, and we believe we still have opportunity to improve in all aspects of our business. 
All of Darden's strong momentum continued during the quarter. Same-restaurant sales grew 2.6%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 540 basis points. This was our ninth consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth at Olive Garden. 
Looking at the key drivers of this performance, it was really 3 things. First, the operations team, led by Dan Kiernan, continued to improve restaurant-level execution. We're committed to improving the service experience and still have more opportunity on that front. However, we did achieve all-time high scores for both overall guest satisfaction as well as server attentiveness during the quarter. 
Next, we continue to see solid growth in our OG To Go platform. To Go sales grew 21% compared to the same period last year and more than 50% on a 3-year basis. During the quarter, we added the Create Your Own Pasta station to our To Go catering menu, enhancing the convenience of To Go by providing a customizable off-premise dining experience. The exciting thing about To Go is that our operations excellence team continues to learn more and more about how to meet our guests' growing needs for convenience. And finally, our promotional and core menu strategies continue to work together to create value for our guests. During the quarter, we had 2 strong value promotions. Buy 1 Take 1, which capitalizes on the consumers' need for convenience by allowing them to buy 1 entrée and take a second entrée home to prepare later; and Never Ending Pasta Bowl. Both of these leverage brand equities and were supported by integrated marketing highlighted by our Olive Garden highly anticipated Pasta Pass. In honor of the 21st anniversary of the Never Ending Pasta Bowl, we made 21,000 Pasta Passes available, and all of them were claimed online in less than 1 second. The passion demonstrated by our guests who got a Pasta Pass and the disappointment by those who did not reinforced the strength and relevance of the Olive Garden brand. 
LongHorn Steakhouse's same-restaurant sales grew by 0.1%, the 15th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 290 basis points. Our focus at LongHorn remains on improving the guest experience. We are doing this primarily by making strategic investments in quality and simplifying operations to improve restaurant execution, and we're seeing positive results. Our research shows strong improvement in LongHorn's ability to provide value through high-quality food and service. And that's important because value is the #1 driver of guest intent to return. Additionally, LongHorn has refined a new restaurant opening process. We're very pleased with the results we've seen in the new restaurants opened over the past 9 months, and it gives us greater confidence about future openings. The team at LongHorn is engaged and focused on the right priorities. We are making long-term strategic choices to position the brand to compete effectively in the future. 
I want to close by acknowledging that the holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams as they create memorable experiences for our guests. On behalf of our management team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank our team members for all you do to help our guests celebrate this time of year with family and friends and for making our company successful. We continue to get better every day, and I'm excited about the new calendar year ahead. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rick to discuss our results in more detail."

As Gene mentioned, we had another good quarter with diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.64, an increase of 18.5% from last year's adjusted earnings per share. Included in this $0.6",682,"Thank you, Gene, and happy holidays, everyone. As Gene mentioned, we had another good quarter with diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.64, an increase of 18.5% from last year's adjusted earnings per share. Included in this $0.64 is $0.01 of unfavorability from market-based compensation due to the significant appreciation in the stock market that was not perfectly hedged. This market-based comp impact is reflected in 3 parts of our P&L: restaurant labor, G&A and income taxes. So I will provide more detail in our margin analysis. 
We continue to return cash to shareholders this quarter, paying out approximately $70 million in dividends and repurchasing roughly 300,000 shares of stock totaling around $19 million. 
Turning to our margin analysis. We had sales leverage from our positive same-restaurant sales of 1.7%. We also continue to realize cost savings throughout the P&L and are on track to meet our $30 million of net cost savings in fiscal 2017. 
Now in addition to these sales leverage and cost saves I just talked about, we also had favorable food and beverage expenses due to commodities deflation of approximately 1.3%; 20 basis points of unfavorability in restaurant labor, of which 10 points was related to the market-based compensation expense; unfavorable restaurant expenses of 130 basis points, all related to the incremental rent expense and other taxes resulting from real estate transactions last year. G&A was unfavorable as we lap the $13 million favorable legal settlement in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, and we had roughly 20 basis points of unfavorability related to market-based compensation this quarter. Excluding these impacts, G&A would have been favorable 60 basis points to last year. Depreciation and interest were favorable, as expected, related to the real estate transactions. The impairment line was favorable due to impairments last year of 3 restaurants, totaling approximately $7.7 million. And finally, we still expect our annual effective tax rate to range between 26% and 27% for fiscal 2017. However, this quarter's rate was lower than the annual expectation due to tax favorability related to the market-based compensation impact. 
Turning to segment performance. As a reminder, due to the real estate transactions last year, segment profit includes incremental rent and other tax expense of $21 million for the quarter. The benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings are not recognized in segment profit. Going forward, we do not expect incremental impacts in future quarters as it is now more than 12 months since the spin-off of Four Corners. 
Olive Garden's segment profit of 16.8% was 80 basis points lower than last year for the quarter as additional rent drove 170 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding this incremental rent, Olive Garden's segment profit margin was 90 basis points higher than last year. 
LongHorn Steakhouse segment profit of 14.4% was 60 basis points lower than last year for the quarter, with additional rent expense driving 120 basis points of unfavorability. Adjusting for the incremental rent, segment profit margin increased 60 basis points for LongHorn. 
Segment profit margin of 18.2% was flat to last year in our Fine Dining segment, while our Other Business segment profit grew margin 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis, even with additional rent headwinds of 50 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding this incremental rent, segment profit at our Other Business would have been 110 basis points higher than last year. 
Finally, as we reported this morning, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2017 outlook for earnings per diluted share of $3.87 to $3.97 and our same-restaurant sales growth outlook of between 1% to 2%. Additionally, our total ad inflation estimate of between 1.5% to 2% remains the same. However, this inflation expectation now assumes commodity costs are flat to last year and that labor inflation is approximately 3.5%. I am proud of the work that our teams continue to do to strengthen our performance and drive shareholder value. This continued progress gives us confidence in our expectations for the remainder of our fiscal year. 
And with that, we'll open up the call for questions."

You also had a major hurricane in that period, which affected brands differently. And so we look from October and November, there was just, I think, a point just in Halloween switching there. Veterans Day messed around a little bit with sales in November moving from midweek to the weekend. And so I think that created a lot of noise in the quarter. I wouldn't get too hung up on the month-to-month there. As far as the overall -- when you look at the overall indexes, I think you had a -- you were asking about, is it really the bottom 25% that's dragging that down?

I would say that, right now, I think holidays are slight negative in the quarter, but my counsel to everybody listening would be weather is going to be what weather is going to be and that really has no impact long term on the momentum or the overall value of our company. And if it snows on a Saturday, it snows on a Saturday, but it's not going to snow next year on a Saturday. And so I'm not getting all worried about things that we can't control. And I'm trying to get the organization just to stay focused on creating great dining experiences. And I believe if we do that and keep our 150,000 team members focused on that, we'll continue to grow our business."

I think people just -- I think we're competing in -- and we've got to -- in the industry and mostly -- I mean, our focus at Darden is to find a way to create a reason for people to come to want to spend money with us. And I think we have to continue to innovate from a culinary standpoint. We've got to do a better job from a service standpoint, and we got to create environments that people want to come to. Because they have more choices. I think if you read a lot of Malcolm's -- as he talks about the reallocation nation, I think there's a lot of truth to how he's describing the situation in the industry. And people are feeling better. And when they feel better, they're spending on bigger home good items. So that's having an impact.

And so I would say it's more of a strategy of kind of pivoting away from these promotional periods where you have -- you're selling $11.99 promotional steak and you have other digital incentives out there, which you need to have out there to be competitive. We determined that there were a percentage of the guests that we were serving, we were not making money on. And we decided that we were going to try to move away from that. And I would urge everybody that's out there listening and thinking about LongHorn, is look what we've done to the overall business model over the last 18 months and what LongHorn's profitability has become. This brand, obviously, the one that I am most familiar with because I ran it for a lot of years, is a high-quality -- is a simple high-quality business. And that's the way we're going to win. And we're making the right strategic choices. I believe in it. These decisions that we're making are going to take years to pay out. But as I look at the landscape, and I look at the landscape of all of casual dining, I think there's a niche over time that LongHorn can compete in and compete extremely effectively in. And it's not going down. It's not going down and competing with the more value players. It's actually carving its -- a niche out a little bit above what I would call traditional casual dining. Our research is incredibly encouraging, and I'm not hung up right now on what day-to-day same-restaurant sales are. I believe in the research. I believe that we've got the business model back. The business is still too complicated. And we've got to simplify it so we can continue to remove some labor from the operation so that we can invest in great steaks and get them cooked right for our guests."

We can be developing our own network that can handle the one-off deliveries. We think what we're doing today on catering is kind of our own network. Then it's all the way to could you actually build a kitchen and a warehouse district and deliver in a major city out of that? So I see that disruption in a very long perspective. I mean, you got a lot of choices along that continuum. And so all I'd say is that we are aware of what the choices are, and we think a lot about the Amazon effect, as we call it around here. What would Amazon do? And so that's where we kind of get to, ""Is there someone going to develop a kitchen in one place and just deliver food from that kitchen?""

We'll keep our remarks brief so we can get to your questions. 
We had another good quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.64 billion, an increase of 2.1%. Same-restaurant sales grew 1.7%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 450 basis points. And diluted net earnings per share were $0.64, an increase of 18.5% from last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share. 
Our intense focus on food, service and atmosphere drove our performance once again this quarter. Additionally, at the Darden level, we continue to concentrate on our 4 competitive advantages: one, leveraging our significant scale to create cost advantages; two, using our extensive data and insights to better understand our guests and to effectively communicate with them; three, ensuring our brands systematically go through our rigorous strategic planning process; and four, cultivating our results-oriented people culture to enable growth. Our approach continues to be effective, and we believe we still have opportunity to improve in all aspects of our business. 
All of Darden's strong momentum continued during the quarter. Same-restaurant sales grew 2.6%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 540 basis points. This was our ninth consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth at Olive Garden. 
Looking at the key drivers of this performance, it was really 3 things. First, the operations team, led by Dan Kiernan, continued to improve restaurant-level execution. We're committed to improving the service experience and still have more opportunity on that front. However, we did achieve all-time high scores for both overall guest satisfaction as well as server attentiveness during the quarter. 
Next, we continue to see solid growth in our OG To Go platform. To Go sales grew 21% compared to the same period last year and more than 50% on a 3-year basis. During the quarter, we added the Create Your Own Pasta station to our To Go catering menu, enhancing the convenience of To Go by providing a customizable off-premise dining experience. The exciting thing about To Go is that our operations excellence team continues to learn more and more about how to meet our guests' growing needs for convenience. And finally, our promotional and core menu strategies continue to work together to create value for our guests. During the quarter, we had 2 strong value promotions. Buy 1 Take 1, which capitalizes on the consumers' need for convenience by allowing them to buy 1 entrée and take a second entrée home to prepare later; and Never Ending Pasta Bowl. Both of these leverage brand equities and were supported by integrated marketing highlighted by our Olive Garden highly anticipated Pasta Pass. In honor of the 21st anniversary of the Never Ending Pasta Bowl, we made 21,000 Pasta Passes available, and all of them were claimed online in less than 1 second. The passion demonstrated by our guests who got a Pasta Pass and the disappointment by those who did not reinforced the strength and relevance of the Olive Garden brand. 
LongHorn Steakhouse's same-restaurant sales grew by 0.1%, the 15th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 290 basis points. Our focus at LongHorn remains on improving the guest experience. We are doing this primarily by making strategic investments in quality and simplifying operations to improve restaurant execution, and we're seeing positive results. Our research shows strong improvement in LongHorn's ability to provide value through high-quality food and service. And that's important because value is the #1 driver of guest intent to return. Additionally, LongHorn has refined a new restaurant opening process. We're very pleased with the results we've seen in the new restaurants opened over the past 9 months, and it gives us greater confidence about future openings. The team at LongHorn is engaged and focused on the right priorities. We are making long-term strategic choices to position the brand to compete effectively in the future. 
I want to close by acknowledging that the holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams as they create memorable experiences for our guests. On behalf of our management team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank our team members for all you do to help our guests celebrate this time of year with family and friends and for making our company successful. We continue to get better every day, and I'm excited about the new calendar year ahead. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rick to discuss our results in more detail."

As Gene mentioned, we had another good quarter with diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.64, an increase of 18.5% from last year's adjusted earnings per share. Included in this $0.6",682,"Thank you, Gene, and happy holidays, everyone. As Gene mentioned, we had another good quarter with diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.64, an increase of 18.5% from last year's adjusted earnings per share. Included in this $0.64 is $0.01 of unfavorability from market-based compensation due to the significant appreciation in the stock market that was not perfectly hedged. This market-based comp impact is reflected in 3 parts of our P&L: restaurant labor, G&A and income taxes. So I will provide more detail in our margin analysis. 
We continue to return cash to shareholders this quarter, paying out approximately $70 million in dividends and repurchasing roughly 300,000 shares of stock totaling around $19 million. 
Turning to our margin analysis. We had sales leverage from our positive same-restaurant sales of 1.7%. We also continue to realize cost savings throughout the P&L and are on track to meet our $30 million of net cost savings in fiscal 2017. 
Now in addition to these sales leverage and cost saves I just talked about, we also had favorable food and beverage expenses due to commodities deflation of approximately 1.3%; 20 basis points of unfavorability in restaurant labor, of which 10 points was related to the market-based compensation expense; unfavorable restaurant expenses of 130 basis points, all related to the incremental rent expense and other taxes resulting from real estate transactions last year. G&A was unfavorable as we lap the $13 million favorable legal settlement in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, and we had roughly 20 basis points of unfavorability related to market-based compensation this quarter. Excluding these impacts, G&A would have been favorable 60 basis points to last year. Depreciation and interest were favorable, as expected, related to the real estate transactions. The impairment line was favorable due to impairments last year of 3 restaurants, totaling approximately $7.7 million. And finally, we still expect our annual effective tax rate to range between 26% and 27% for fiscal 2017. However, this quarter's rate was lower than the annual expectation due to tax favorability related to the market-based compensation impact. 
Turning to segment performance. As a reminder, due to the real estate transactions last year, segment profit includes incremental rent and other tax expense of $21 million for the quarter. The benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings are not recognized in segment profit. Going forward, we do not expect incremental impacts in future quarters as it is now more than 12 months since the spin-off of Four Corners. 
Olive Garden's segment profit of 16.8% was 80 basis points lower than last year for the quarter as additional rent drove 170 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding this incremental rent, Olive Garden's segment profit margin was 90 basis points higher than last year. 
LongHorn Steakhouse segment profit of 14.4% was 60 basis points lower than last year for the quarter, with additional rent expense driving 120 basis points of unfavorability. Adjusting for the incremental rent, segment profit margin increased 60 basis points for LongHorn. 
Segment profit margin of 18.2% was flat to last year in our Fine Dining segment, while our Other Business segment profit grew margin 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis, even with additional rent headwinds of 50 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding this incremental rent, segment profit at our Other Business would have been 110 basis points higher than last year. 
Finally, as we reported this morning, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2017 outlook for earnings per diluted share of $3.87 to $3.97 and our same-restaurant sales growth outlook of between 1% to 2%. Additionally, our total ad inflation estimate of between 1.5% to 2% remains the same. However, this inflation expectation now assumes commodity costs are flat to last year and that labor inflation is approximately 3.5%. I am proud of the work that our teams continue to do to strengthen our performance and drive shareholder value. This continued progress gives us confidence in our expectations for the remainder of our fiscal year. 
And with that, we'll open up the call for questions."

Now I think when you look at KNAPP throughout the quarter, there's a lot of noise in that number. We had some holiday shifts. You also had a major hurricane in that period, which affected brands differently. And so we look from October and November, there was just, I think, a point just in Halloween switching there. Veterans Day messed around a little bit with sales in November moving from midweek to the weekend. And so I think that created a lot of noise in the quarter. I wouldn't get too hung up on the month-to-month there. As far as the overall -- when you look at the overall indexes, I think you had a -- you were asking about, is it really the bottom 25% that's dragging that down? And I think there's something to that. I mean, I -- we obviously don't have visibility into everybody that's in that index and what the distribution looks like, but I keep coming back to when -- what I believe are the really well-positioned concepts that are out there that are executing at a high level. They continue to grow market share. And so that's what pivots us back to -- we just really got to be focused on what we can control and we work off that core operating philosophy of food, service and atmosphere. And if we're not focused on 1 of those 3 things, other than our competitive advantages at the Darden level, then we're not working on the right stuff.

But as we move forward and we start building our pipeline, we expect to move closer to the middle or the high end of that range. We also continue to invest in our restaurants. As we've talked about with Olive Garden and remodels, we're adding capacity in some of these remodels. We'll continue to find ways to invest appropriate capital to grow our business, whether that's adding more restaurants than we have in our long-term framework or getting to the top end of that range or adding more remodels. The other thing is we still expect all of our restaurant brands to grow. So we believe in all of our brands. Every brand in our portfolio has growth opportunities for them, and so we'll continue to see openings in all of our brands."

You look at our lunch menu today, there's really only 4 price points on the front of it: $6.99, $7.99, $8.99, $9.99. And so values -- every time I go for lunch, I'm just -- I can't believe the value that you can get there, you can get at Olive Garden for lunch. I think it's fantastic.

I think people just -- I think we're competing and we've got to -- in the industry and mostly -- I mean, my focus at Darden is to find a way to create a reason for people to want to come spend money with us. And I think we have to continue to innovate from a culinary standpoint. We've got to do a better job from a service standpoint, and we got to create environments that people want to come to.

I say we've gone to medium-type price points, but it's not like we're out there advertising porterhouses. We're out there kind of in the middle. We were doing a lot of $10.99, $11.99 steak promotions that we thought we had to pivot away from. I think we're only into one of those now a year. And so I would say it's more of a strategy of kind of pivoting away from these promotional periods where you have -- you're selling a $11.99 promotional steak and you had other digital incentives out there, which you need to have out there to be competitive. We determined that there were a percentage of the guests that we were serving, we were not making money on, and we decided that we were going to try to move away from that. And I would urge everybody that's out there listening and thinking about LongHorn, is look what we've done to the overall business model over the last 18 months and what LongHorn's profitability has become. This brand, obviously, the one that I am most familiar with because I ran it for a lot of years, is a high-quality -- is a simple high-quality business, and that's the way we're going to win. And we're making the right strategic choices. I believe in it. These decisions that we're making are going to take years to pay out. But as I look at the landscape, and I look at the landscape of all of casual dining, I think there's a niche over time that LongHorn can compete in and compete extremely effectively in. And it's not going down. It's not going down and competing with the more value players. It's actually carving its -- carving a niche out a little bit above what I would call traditional casual dining. Our research is incredibly encouraging, and I am not hung up right now on what day-to-day same-restaurant sales are. I believe in the research. I believe that we've got the business model back. The business is still too complicated and we've got to simplify it so we can continue to remove some labor from the operation so that we can invest in great steaks and get them cooked right for our guests."

So I'm just wondering, bigger picture, longer term, as you're thinking about reinforcing that value, it doesn't seem like service in that model really is going to play as large of a role maybe as it plays in Olive Garden.

And we are -- by slowing down and really focusing on some basics, we have -- we're making great, great improvements. And I think one area where -- since Todd's been involved, is he's been really focused on food quality and getting the food back to where he thinks it needs to be. We both agree that we may have not paid enough attention to service, and LongHorn, for years, had a unique service style that the consumer talked about. And I think that we've lost a little bit of that. And I think we're going to get back to a bit more balanced operational message, where we're going to continue to focus on food, but we want to elevate the service experience inside of LongHorn.

Then it's all the way to could you actually build a kitchen and a warehouse district and deliver in a major city out of that? So I see that disruption in a very long perspective. I mean, you got a lot of choices along that continuum. And so all I'd say is that we're aware of what the choices are, and we think a lot about the Amazon effect, as we call it around here. What would Amazon do? And so that's where we kind of get to, ""Is someone going to develop a kitchen in one place and just deliver food from that kitchen?"" So that would probably be the most disruptive. So I guess the answer to your question is, yes, we're thinking about it. We don't have any plans in the future, but we're fully aware of this disruption and where it could go."

We appreciate you joining us today as we get ready to head into the holidays. We'll keep our remarks brief so we can get to your questions. We had another good quarter.

We'll keep our remarks brief so we can get to your questions. 
We had another good quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.64 billion, an increase of 2.1%. Same-restaurant sales grew 1.7%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 450 basis points. And diluted net earnings per share were $0.64, an increase of 18.5% from last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share. 
Our intense focus on food, service and atmosphere drove our performance once again this quarter. Additionally, at the Darden level, we continue to concentrate on our 4 competitive advantages: one, leveraging our significant scale to create cost advantages; two, using our extensive data and insights to better understand our guests and to effectively communicate with them; three, ensuring our brand to systematically go through our rigorous strategic planning process; and four, cultivating our results-oriented people culture to enable growth. Our approach continues to be effective, and we believe we still have opportunity to [ph] improve in all aspects of our business. 
Olive Garden's strong momentum continued during the quarter. Same-restaurant sales grew 2.6%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 540 basis points. This was our ninth consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth at Olive Garden. 
Looking at the key drivers of this performance, it was really 3 things. First, the operations team, led by Dan Kiernan, continued to improve restaurant-level execution. We're committed to improving the service experience and still have more opportunity on that front. However, we did achieve all-time high scores for both overall guest satisfaction as well as server attentiveness during the quarter. 
Next, we continue to see solid growth in our OG To Go platform. To-go sales grew 21% compared to the same period last year and more than 50% on a 3-year basis. During the quarter, we added the Create Your Own Pasta station to our to-go catering menu, enhancing the convenience of to-go by providing a customizable off-premise dining experience. 
The exciting thing about to-go is that our operations excellence team continues to learn more and more about how to meet our guests' growing needs for convenience. 
And finally, our promotional and core menu strategies continue to work together to create value for our guest. During the quarter, we had 2 strong value promotions. Buy One Take One, which capitalizes on the consumers' need for convenience by allowing them to buy 1 entrée and take a second entrée home to prepare later; and Never Ending Pasta Bowl. 
Both of these leverage brand equities and were supported by integrated marketing highlighted by Olive Garden's highly anticipated Pasta Pass. In honor of the 21st anniversary of the Never Ending Pasta Bowl, we made 21,000 Pasta Passes available, and all of them were claimed online in less than 1 second. The passion demonstrated by our guests who got a Pasta Pass and the disappointment by those who did not reinforced the strength and relevance of the Olive Garden brand. 
LongHorn Steakhouse's same-restaurant sales grew by 0.1%, the 15th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 290 basis points. Our focus at LongHorn remains on improving the guest experience. We're doing this primarily by making strategic investments in quality and simplifying operations to improve restaurant execution, and we're seeing positive results. Our research shows strong improvement in LongHorn's ability to provide value through high-quality food and service. And that's important because value is the #1 driver of guest intent to return. 
Additionally, LongHorn has refined their new restaurant opening process. We're very pleased with the results we've seen in the new restaurants opened over the past 9 months, and it gives us greater confidence about future openings. The team at LongHorn is engaged and focused on the right priorities. We're making long-term strategic choices to position the brand to compete effectively in the future. 
I want to close by acknowledging that the holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams as they create memorable experiences for our guests. On behalf of our management team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank our team members for all you do to help our guests celebrate this time of year with family and friends and for making our company successful. We continue to get better every day, and I'm excited about the new calendar year ahead. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rick to discuss our results in more detail."

As Gene mentioned, we had another good quarter with diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.64, an increase of 18.5% from last year's adjusted earnings per share. Included in this $0.6",682,"Thank you, Gene, and happy holidays, everyone. As Gene mentioned, we had another good quarter with diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.64, an increase of 18.5% from last year's adjusted earnings per share. Included in this $0.64 is $0.01 of unfavorability from market-based compensation due to the significant appreciation in the stock market that was not perfectly hedged. This market-based comp impact is reflected in 3 parts of our P&L: restaurant labor, G&A and income taxes. So I will provide more detail in our margin analysis. 
We continued to return cash to shareholders this quarter, paying out approximately $70 million in dividends and repurchasing roughly 300,000 shares of stock, totaling around $19 million. 
Turning for our margin analysis. We had sales leverage from our positive same-restaurant sales of 1.7%. We also continue to realize cost savings throughout the P&L and are on track to meet our $30 million of net cost savings in fiscal 2017. 
Now in addition to these sales leverage and cost saves I just talked about, we also had favorable food and beverage expenses due to commodities deflation of approximately 1.3%; 20 basis points of unfavorability in restaurant labor, of which 10 points was related to the market-based compensation expense; unfavorable restaurant expenses of 130 basis points, all related to the incremental rent expense and other taxes resulting from real estate transactions last year. 
G&A was unfavorable as we lapped the $13 million favorable legal settlement in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, and we had roughly 20 basis points of unfavorability related to market-based compensation this quarter. Excluding these impacts, G&A would have been favorable 60 basis points to last year. 
Depreciation and interest were favorable, as expected, related to the real estate transactions. The impairment line was favorable due to impairments last year of 3 restaurants, totaling approximately $7.7 million. 
And finally, we still expect our annual effective tax rate to range between 26% and 27% for fiscal 2017. However, this quarter's rate was lower than the annual expectation due to tax favorability related to the market-based compensation impacts. 
Turning to segment performance. As a reminder, due to the real estate transactions last year, segment profit includes incremental rent and other tax expense of $21 million for the quarter. The benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings are not recognized in segment profit. Going forward, we do not expect incremental impacts in future quarters as it is now more than 12 months since the spinoff of Four Corners. 
Olive Garden segment profit of 16.8% was 80 basis points lower than last year for the quarter as additional rent drove 170 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding this incremental rent, Olive Garden's segment profit margin was 90 basis points higher than last year. 
LongHorn Steakhouse segment profit of 14.4% was 60 basis points lower than last year for the quarter with additional rent expense driving 120 basis points of unfavorability. Adjusting for the incremental rent, segment profit margin increased 60 basis points for LongHorn. 
Segment profit margin of 18.2% was flat to last year in our Fine Dining segment, while our Other Business segment profit grew margin 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis, even with additional rent headwinds of 50 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding this incremental rent, segment profit at our Other Business would have been 110 basis points higher than last year. 
Finally, as we reported this morning, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2017 outlook for earnings per diluted share of $3.87 to $3.97 and our same-restaurant sales growth outlook of between 1% to 2%. Additionally, our total add [ph] inflation estimate of between 1.5% to 2% remains the same. However, this inflation expectation now assumes commodity costs are flat to last year and that labor inflation is approximately 3.5%. 
I am proud of the work our teams continue to do to strengthen our performance and drive shareholder value. This continued progress gives us confidence in our expectations for the remainder of our fiscal year. 
And with that, we'll open up the call for questions."

Now I think when you look at KNAPP throughout the quarter, there's a lot of noise in that number. We had some holiday shifts. You also had a major hurricane in that period, which affected brands differently. So we look from October and November, there was just, I think, 1 point just in Halloween switching there. Veterans Day messed around a little bit with sales in November moving from midweek to the weekend. And so I think that created a lot of noise in the quarter. I wouldn't get too hung up on the month-to-month there. As far as the overall -- when you look at the overall indexes, I think you had a -- you were asking about, is it really the bottom 25% that's dragging that down. And I think there's something to that. I mean, I -- we obviously don't have visibility into everybody that's in that index and what the distribution looks like, but I keep coming back to when -- what I believe are the really well-positioned concepts that are out there that are executing at a high level.

So it's a -- we had a lot of momentum in the quarter last year. We also had a lot of calendar noise. We had the 52, 53. I mean, we -- and there was other things going on. I would say that, right now, I think holidays are a slight negative in the quarter, but my counsel to everybody listening would be weather is going to be what weather is going to be, and that really has no impact long term on the momentum or the overall value of our company. And if it snows on a Saturday, it snows on a Saturday, but it's not going to snow next year on a Saturday. And so I'm not getting all worried about things that we can't control. And I'm trying to get the organization just to stay focused on creating great dining experiences. And I believe if we do that and keep our 150,000 team members focused on that, we'll continue to grow our business."

I was wondering if maybe you could kind of prioritize for us these different headwinds in terms of how you think they're impacting the industry, whether it's the food at home, food away from home divergence that we hear more and more about or the shift from brick-and-mortar to online or political uncertainty, value bundle fatigue.

I think people just -- I think we're competing, and we've got to -- in the industry and mostly -- I mean, my focus at Darden is to find a way to create a reason for people to want to come spend money with us. And I think we have to continue to innovate from a culinary standpoint. We've got to do a better job from a service standpoint, and we got to create environments that people want to come to. Because they have more choices. I think if you read a lot of Malcolm's -- as he talks about the reallocation nation, I think there's a lot of truth to how he's describing the situation in the industry. And people are feeling better. And when they feel better, they're spending on bigger home good items. So that's having an impact.

When you look at our Create Your Own Lunch duo, which pivoted us away from having to rely totally on soup, salad and breadsticks, that to me has been the biggest innovation in Olive Garden and has really just changed the whole complexion of lunch.

We determined that there were a percentage of the guests that we were serving, we were not making money on, and we decided that we were going to try to move away from that. And I would urge everybody that's out there listening and thinking about LongHorn is look what we've done to the overall business model over the last 18 months and what LongHorn's profitability has become. This brand, obviously, the one that I am most familiar with because I ran it for a lot of years, is a high-quality -- is a simple high-quality business, and that's the way we're going to win. And we're making the right strategic choices. I believe in it. These decisions that we're making are going to take years to pay out. But as I look at the landscape -- and I look at the landscape of all of casual dining, I think there's a niche over time that LongHorn can compete in and be extremely effective in. And it's not going down. It's not going down and competing with the more value players. It's actually carving its -- carving a niche out a little bit above what I would call traditional casual dining. Our research is incredibly encouraging, and I am not hung up right now on what day-to-day same-restaurant sales are. I believe in the research. I believe that we've got the business model back. The business is still too complicated, and we've got to simplify it so we can continue to remove some labor from the operation so that we can invest in great steaks and get them cooked right for our guests."

We can be developing our own network that can handle the one-off deliveries. We think what we're doing today around catering is kind of our own network. Then it's all the way to could you actually build a kitchen in a warehouse district and deliver in a major city out of that? So I see that disruption in a very long perspective. I mean, you got a lot of choices along that continuum. And so all I'd say is that we're aware of what the choices are, and we think a lot about the Amazon effect as we call it around here. What would Amazon do? And so that's where we kind of get to, ""Is someone going to develop a kitchen in one place and just deliver food from that kitchen?""

We'll keep our remarks brief so we can get to your questions. 
We had another good quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.64 billion, an increase of 2.1%. Same-restaurant sales grew 1.7%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 450 basis points. And diluted net earnings per share were $0.64, an increase of 18.5% from last year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share. 
Our intense focus on food, service and atmosphere drove our performance once again this quarter. Additionally, at the Darden level, we continue to concentrate on our 4 competitive advantages: one, leveraging our significant scale to create cost advantages; two, using our extensive data and insights to better understand our guests and to effectively communicate with them; three, ensuring our brand to systematically go through our rigorous strategic planning process; and four, cultivating our results-oriented people culture to enable growth. Our approach continues to be effective, and we believe we still have opportunity to [ph] improve in all aspects of our business. 
Olive Garden's strong momentum continued during the quarter. Same-restaurant sales grew 2.6%, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 540 basis points. This was our ninth consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth at Olive Garden. 
Looking at the key drivers of this performance, it was really 3 things. First, the operations team, led by Dan Kiernan, continued to improve restaurant-level execution. We're committed to improving the service experience and still have more opportunity on that front. However, we did achieve all-time high scores for both overall guest satisfaction as well as server attentiveness during the quarter. 
Next, we continue to see solid growth in our OG To Go platform. To-go sales grew 21% compared to the same period last year and more than 50% on a 3-year basis. During the quarter, we added the Create Your Own Pasta station to our to-go catering menu, enhancing the convenience of to-go by providing a customizable off-premise dining experience. 
The exciting thing about to-go is that our operations excellence team continues to learn more and more about how to meet our guests' growing needs for convenience. 
And finally, our promotional and core menu strategies continue to work together to create value for our guest. During the quarter, we had 2 strong value promotions. Buy One Take One, which capitalizes on the consumers' need for convenience by allowing them to buy 1 entrée and take a second entrée home to prepare later; and Never Ending Pasta Bowl. 
Both of these leverage brand equities and were supported by integrated marketing highlighted by Olive Garden's highly anticipated Pasta Pass. In honor of the 21st anniversary of the Never Ending Pasta Bowl, we made 21,000 Pasta Passes available, and all of them were claimed online in less than 1 second. The passion demonstrated by our guests who got a Pasta Pass and the disappointment by those who did not reinforced the strength and relevance of the Olive Garden brand. 
LongHorn Steakhouse's same-restaurant sales grew by 0.1%, the 15th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, by 290 basis points. Our focus at LongHorn remains on improving the guest experience. We're doing this primarily by making strategic investments in quality and simplifying operations to improve restaurant execution, and we're seeing positive results. Our research shows strong improvement in LongHorn's ability to provide value through high-quality food and service. And that's important because value is the #1 driver of guest intent to return. 
Additionally, LongHorn has refined their new restaurant opening process. We're very pleased with the results we've seen in the new restaurants opened over the past 9 months, and it gives us greater confidence about future openings. The team at LongHorn is engaged and focused on the right priorities. We're making long-term strategic choices to position the brand to compete effectively in the future. 
I want to close by acknowledging that the holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams as they create memorable experiences for our guests. On behalf of our management team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank our team members for all you do to help our guests celebrate this time of year with family and friends and for making our company successful. We continue to get better every day, and I'm excited about the new calendar year ahead. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rick to discuss our results in more detail."

As Gene mentioned, we had another good quarter with diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.64, an increase of 18.5% from last year's adjusted earnings per share. Included in this $0.6",682,"Thank you, Gene, and happy holidays, everyone. As Gene mentioned, we had another good quarter with diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.64, an increase of 18.5% from last year's adjusted earnings per share. Included in this $0.64 is $0.01 of unfavorability from market-based compensation due to the significant appreciation in the stock market that was not perfectly hedged. This market-based comp impact is reflected in 3 parts of our P&L: restaurant labor, G&A and income taxes. So I will provide more detail in our margin analysis. 
We continued to return cash to shareholders this quarter, paying out approximately $70 million in dividends and repurchasing roughly 300,000 shares of stock, totaling around $19 million. 
Turning for our margin analysis. We had sales leverage from our positive same-restaurant sales of 1.7%. We also continue to realize cost savings throughout the P&L and are on track to meet our $30 million of net cost savings in fiscal 2017. 
Now in addition to these sales leverage and cost saves I just talked about, we also had favorable food and beverage expenses due to commodities deflation of approximately 1.3%; 20 basis points of unfavorability in restaurant labor, of which 10 points was related to the market-based compensation expense; unfavorable restaurant expenses of 130 basis points, all related to the incremental rent expense and other taxes resulting from real estate transactions last year. 
G&A was unfavorable as we lapped the $13 million favorable legal settlement in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, and we had roughly 20 basis points of unfavorability related to market-based compensation this quarter. Excluding these impacts, G&A would have been favorable 60 basis points to last year. 
Depreciation and interest were favorable, as expected, related to the real estate transactions. The impairment line was favorable due to impairments last year of 3 restaurants, totaling approximately $7.7 million. 
And finally, we still expect our annual effective tax rate to range between 26% and 27% for fiscal 2017. However, this quarter's rate was lower than the annual expectation due to tax favorability related to the market-based compensation impacts. 
Turning to segment performance. As a reminder, due to the real estate transactions last year, segment profit includes incremental rent and other tax expense of $21 million for the quarter. The benefits of lower depreciation and interest savings are not recognized in segment profit. Going forward, we do not expect incremental impacts in future quarters as it is now more than 12 months since the spinoff of Four Corners. 
Olive Garden segment profit of 16.8% was 80 basis points lower than last year for the quarter as additional rent drove 170 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding this incremental rent, Olive Garden's segment profit margin was 90 basis points higher than last year. 
LongHorn Steakhouse segment profit of 14.4% was 60 basis points lower than last year for the quarter with additional rent expense driving 120 basis points of unfavorability. Adjusting for the incremental rent, segment profit margin increased 60 basis points for LongHorn. 
Segment profit margin of 18.2% was flat to last year in our Fine Dining segment, while our Other Business segment profit grew margin 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis, even with additional rent headwinds of 50 basis points of margin unfavorability versus last year. Excluding this incremental rent, segment profit at our Other Business would have been 110 basis points higher than last year. 
Finally, as we reported this morning, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2017 outlook for earnings per diluted share of $3.87 to $3.97 and our same-restaurant sales growth outlook of between 1% to 2%. Additionally, our total add [ph] inflation estimate of between 1.5% to 2% remains the same. However, this inflation expectation now assumes commodity costs are flat to last year and that labor inflation is approximately 3.5%. 
I am proud of the work our teams continue to do to strengthen our performance and drive shareholder value. This continued progress gives us confidence in our expectations for the remainder of our fiscal year. 
And with that, we'll open up the call for questions."

Now I think when you look at KNAPP throughout the quarter, there's a lot of noise in that number. We had some holiday shifts. You also had a major hurricane in that period, which affected brands differently. So we look from October and November, there was just, I think, 1 point just in Halloween switching there. Veterans Day messed around a little bit with sales in November moving from midweek to the weekend. And so I think that created a lot of noise in the quarter. I wouldn't get too hung up on the month-to-month there. As far as the overall -- when you look at the overall indexes, I think you had a -- you were asking about, is it really the bottom 25% that's dragging that down. And I think there's something to that. I mean, I -- we obviously don't have visibility into everybody that's in that index and what the distribution looks like, but I keep coming back to when -- what I believe are the really well-positioned concepts that are out there that are executing at a high level. They continue to grow market share. And so that's what pivots us back to -- we just really got to be focused on what we can control and we work off that core operating philosophy of food, service and atmosphere. And if we're not focused on 1 of those 3 things, other than our competitive advantages at the Darden level, then we're not working on the right stuff.

You look at our lunch menu today, there's really only 4 price points on the front of it: $6.99, $7.99, $8.99, $9.99. And so values -- every time I go for lunch, I'm just -- I can't believe the value that you can get there -- you can get at Olive Garden for lunch. I think it's fantastic.

I say we've gone to medium-type price points, but it's not like we're out there advertising porterhouses. We're out there kind of in the middle. We were doing a lot of $10.99, $11.99 steak promotions that we thought we had to pivot away from. I think we're only into one of those now a year. And so I would say it's more of a strategy of kind of pivoting away from these promotional periods where you have -- you're selling a $11.99 promotional steak and you had other digital incentives out there, which you need to have out there to be competitive. We determined that there were a percentage of the guests that we were serving, we were not making money on, and we decided that we were going to try to move away from that. And I would urge everybody that's out there listening and thinking about LongHorn is look what we've done to the overall business model over the last 18 months and what LongHorn's profitability has become. This brand, obviously, the one that I am most familiar with because I ran it for a lot of years, is a high-quality -- is a simple high-quality business, and that's the way we're going to win. And we're making the right strategic choices. I believe in it. These decisions that we're making are going to take years to pay out. But as I look at the landscape -- and I look at the landscape of all of casual dining, I think there's a niche over time that LongHorn can compete in and be extremely effective in. And it's not going down. It's not going down and competing with the more value players. It's actually carving its -- carving a niche out a little bit above what I would call traditional casual dining. Our research is incredibly encouraging, and I am not hung up right now on what day-to-day same-restaurant sales are. I believe in the research. I believe that we've got the business model back. The business is still too complicated, and we've got to simplify it so we can continue to remove some labor from the operation so that we can invest in great steaks and get them cooked right for our guests."

And we are -- by slowing down and really focusing on some basics, we have -- we're making great, great improvements. And I think one area where -- since Todd's been involved, is he's been really focused on food quality and getting the food back to where he thinks it needs to be. We both agree that we may have not paid enough attention to service, and LongHorn, for years, had a unique service style that the consumer talked about. And I think that we've lost a little bit of that. And I think we're going to get back to a bit more balanced operational message, where we're going to continue to focus on food, but we want to elevate the service experience inside of LongHorn.

So that would probably be the most disruptive. So I guess the answer to your question is, yes, we're thinking about it. We don't have any plans in the future, but we're fully aware of this disruption and where it could go."

But I'm looking at G&A down roughly $10 million in the second quarter from the first quarter. Is the absolute dollar level that we're seeing in the second quarter, is that the right run rate to think about?
