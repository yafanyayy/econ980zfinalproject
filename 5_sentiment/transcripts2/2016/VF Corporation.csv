I'd like to remind everyone that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectation and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with SEC. 
I'd also like to remind everyone that, unless otherwise noted, amounts on -- that our participants refer to in today's call will predominantly be in currency-neutral terms. By our definition, which we detailed in our press release issued at 6:55 a.m. this morning, currency-neutral amounts exclude both the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and the impact of currency rate changes on foreign-currency-denominated transactions. The amounts you'll hear refers to reported amounts, which are in accordance to U.S. GAAP and includes translation and transactional impacts of foreign currency exchange rates. We've chosen this currency-neutral amounts as a lead number in our discussions because we feel more accurately represents the true operational performance, underlying results of our business and brands. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to currency-neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial information included with the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items. 
Joining us on this call will be VF's Chairman and CEO, Eric Wiseman; President and COO, Steve Rendle; our CFO, Scott Roe; and VF Executive Karl Heinz Salzburger and Scott Baxter.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to recap the year recently completed and our outlook for 2016. 2015 was a strong year for VF's businesses around the world. You will recall that our original outlook for the year call",891,"Thank you, Lance. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to recap the year recently completed and our outlook for 2016. 2015 was a strong year for VF's businesses around the world. You will recall that our original outlook for the year call for currency-neutral revenue growth of 8% and earnings growth of 12%. And through the first 9 months, we tracked ahead of that goal with top line growth of 9% and earnings up 15%. Then during our call in October, we spoke about a more cautious approach to the balance of the year, including a softer consumer environment. And appropriately, we adjusted our outlook for the year. Our fundamental assumptions proved to be accurate. However, the consumer softness accelerated and was compounded by the warmest fourth quarter on record. As the quarter developed, we took immediate action to leverage the many strengths of our business model and pulled many operational levers to minimize the impact, manage the inventories and maintain brand integrity during a difficult retail period. 
Our fourth quarter results did not materialize as we originally planned. However, our responsiveness and operational agility allowed us to finish out the year in a way that's consistent with our 2017 goals. Currency-neutral revenue was up 6% and EPS was up 12%. And when you normalize for the 53rd week over the past 2 years, both 2015 and 2014 averaged 7% revenue growth and 13% EPS growth. So while we were 1 point shy on the top line, we were right on for the bottom line against our 2017 plans for these 2 years. 
As we close out 2015, I have a renewed sense of resolve and respect for how nimble and capable our company really is, and I have complete confidence in our ability to drive future growth and shareholder returns. 
As consumers' priorities continue to change, we're right there with them, strategically analyzing their shopping behavior, their preferences and where they with our brands. Whether that's in our stores or online or through our wholesale partners, they are demanding more from the products they buy, more engagement, more authenticity from the brands they choose to develop relationships with and the ability to show up whenever and however they choose to shop. I'm confident that VF is uniquely positioned to win in this environment. 
So what's in store for 2016? We expect the retail and currency environments to remain challenging, mostly in the first half, as last year's overhang works through the system before conditions normalize in our most meaningful quarters of the year. Throughout 2016, we will seize the opportunity to stay on the offense, and we will remain focused on the things that keep us healthy in 2016 and beyond such as: we're making outsized investments in product innovation to drive newness and excitement into the marketplace; we're building even stronger relationships with our consumers; we're strengthening our operational capabilities and delivering appropriate financial performance while positioning VF for sustainable, profitable growth over the long term. Our team will go deeper into the details in a moment. But translating all of that into our 2016 financial outlook, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth and 11% EPS growth. Given our incomplete visibility into the year, especially around our cold-weather-related products, we believe this is a sensible reflection on the current and going-forward environment. 
As I think more about our future, I think about VF's strengths and how they've enabled us to develop a respected track record of success with brands that we've added to our portfolio. Strategically, we described ourselves as active portfolio managers. And while we can't be specific, I can tell you that in 2016, we're taking in a specially focused and proactive look towards the composition of our portfolio to ensure that we are optimally positioned to maximize growth and returns to our shareholders. We are actively exploring the segments of the business we want to expand our portfolio in, and we're exploring where you might want less exposure. We will certainly talk more about this in the future and keep you posted as those plans unfold. 
As you know, we have a long history of returning cash to our shareholders. In 2016, we'll continue this commitment because a softer retail -- a softer environment shouldn't mean shareholders have to sit on the sidelines. We've got a healthy increase in our share buyback to about $1 billion. And with our dividend payout, we expect to return $1.5 billion in total this year. 
Now allow me to pre-answer one of your almost-certain questions with respect to potential portfolio composition, share buyback, an and conversation not an or conversation, meaning there's no impact to our ability to pursue acquisitions that are right for VF. 
In closing, our business model remains solid and intact. Nothing is fundamentally different with our story. We're committed to our strategy, and it's working. VF is well equipped to navigate through these near-term challenges, and our strength and discipline lead us to maintain our commitment to retaining shareholder value. I am extremely proud of the work our team is doing, and I'm excited about what lies ahead. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve, Karl Heinz and Scott Baxter to take us through our coalition and brand results and then over to Scott Roe to review our financial performance. Steve?"

Outdoor & Action Sports currency-neutral revenue was up 1% in the fourth quarter with a mid-single-digit increase in D2C, offset by a decline in wholesale. As you know, we're up against a 53rd week at the end of 2014. So normalizing for that over both periods, the coalition was up 5% in the quarter. Clearly contributing to these results was the warmest fourth quarter on record, yet I'm proud to say that we came through relatively strong given the challenges. 
Taking a look at VF's 3 largest brands. Fourth quarter revenue for The North Face was down 2% with low single-digit growth in D2C, offset by a mid-single-digit decline in wholesale. Excluding FX and a 53rd week, revenue in the quarter was up 1% over last year. Revenue in the Americas region was down at a low single-digit rate, the result directly related to warm weather. And while heavier outerwear styles did not perform to expectations, we did see success with shelves and midweight styles, validating our strategy to provide more adaptable, multi-season products. Thermoball is a great example of this and a franchise that continued its strong growth. Thermoball has been the best-selling outerwear franchise in the U.S. market across all brands over the past 2 years. This was bolstered by a new product-specific ad campaign launched in November. We also relaunched our Pinnacle Summit Series collection globally, offering best mountaineering product and pushing the limits of product innovation and technology. Beyond outerwear, we saw great performance in our running and training apparel, driven by Mountain Athletics growing more than 40%. Our continued efforts to connect even more deeply with consumers through inspired exploration, including physical, emotional and creative pursuits, has never been more strategic. Our Never Stop Exploring brand campaign, which we launched in Q4, was our first expansive view of exploration and our first truly global brand effort. And with over 1 billion impressions, we're really pleased with the results and confident it connected with and inspired adventurers everywhere. As we look ahead, The North Face will continue to encourage consumers to explore, train and live, and we have a good pipeline of innovative product that will help them do just that. Now to Karl Heinz."

With low teen D2C growth being offset by decline in the wholesale business. We saw strength in our Thermoball and Mountain Athletics collection during the quarter as well as our Ultra footwear line. We also launched a new store concept on Regency in London, which allows athletes to train together in weekly sessions. We've seen great response so far. For the full year, The North Face in Europe grew faster than the overall outdoor apparel market. It was challenged by unseasonably warm weather in November and December. And even so, our own DTC business grew 25%. 
Across the year, we put a lot of focus on elevating our brand position in the market by carefully managing inventories. We also made meaningful steps in terms of segmenting the European marketplace from a merchandising perspective. We feel well positioned for accelerated growth in 2016. In Asia, fourth quarter revenue increased at the low single-digit rate, driven by slight growth in D2C and a relatively flat wholesale business. During the quarter, we launched a FuseForm product for the first time with great response. We also hosted the TNF outdoor festival in Shanghai Century Park, which had more than 4,000 visitors during the course of the weekend. To wrap up the North Face."

And while we're off our long-term growth target this year, our fourth quarter performance does give me confidence that this brand is built to perform in many environments, as strong and opportunistically as many competitive advantages in play. Given the current environment, as we look at 2016, we see the year ahead as an opportunity to evolve and amplify The North Face brand both on a strategic and tactical level. We've realigned our global category management model to better focus on individual consumer usage cases. This enables us to deliver even stronger product and brand experiences to connect and inspire new and existing consumers in ways never done before. 
For the full year, we expect The North Face to grow revenue at mid-single-digit rate, so similar to 2015. This early outlook based on fourth quarter results and our fall selling process is an accurate reflection of what we see ahead. 
Turning to Vans. Global revenue was up 8% in the fourth quarter with a low double-digit increase in D2C and a low single-digit increase in the wholesale business. Excluding FX and the 53rd week, the fourth quarter was up 13%. In the Americas, the fourth quarter was up in a mid-single-digit rate, again impacted by the 53rd week, with double-digit D2C growth and a slight decline in wholesale. On a product front, we continue to see success with our strategic move toward providing a complete 4-season offering. As evidence, our all-weather Mountain Edition footwear styles were all top sellers, and we've already seen significant sell-in for 2016 for these styles as well. We're also seeing success with our Modern Edition weatherized apparel, further extending our brand beyond footwear. And our collaborations, including one with Vans and The North Face, reinforcing our commitment to blending Street style and performance and innovative products and really showing the consumer the strength of the VF portfolio. True to our Off The Wall culture, we continue to redefine new ways to connect with our consumers. During the fourth quarter, our propeller skateboarding film saw great success and was one of iTunes' top 10 documentaries of the year, not to mention Transworld Skateboarding's film of the year. Vans was also recently named the #1 sneaker brand on Instagram, our young consumers' #1 social platform. This a great wins for the brand and great testament to keeping our core consumer at the center of everything we do."

During the quarter, we had several strong collaborations worth highlighting. Our second collaboration with Disney was really well received by consumers across footwear, apparel and accessories. The Vans TNF products sold out in a number of places across Europe, and the Vans Pendleton Collection helped elevate our weatherized offering with great success. In our core Classics collection, we have seen higher-than-normal inventory levels. And even though we are performing better than our competition in this category, we do anticipate a more challenging sales environment in 2016 as this product works through the channel. The good news is that our brand's health metrics have never been as strong, and our other product categories are selling through extremely well. 
In Asia, Vans grew more than 20%, driven by almost 40% D2C growth and a high teen increase in our wholesale business. Our House of Vans brand experience proved to be incredible for both the brand and our consumers. We took this experience on tour to 14 cities throughout the year and connected with thousands of fans. We also launched our Monkey Rules campaign for the Chinese New Year, and the response shows that this is a winner."

Also, Vans will celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2016. We definitely have unique products and experiences planned to keep consumers engaged and connected as we celebrate our authentic heritage. 
Regionally in 2016, we're expecting continued strength with double-digit growth in both the Americas and Asia businesses, which represent about 75% of the total. However, due to the factors K spoke about, revenues could be down slightly in Europe. Our 26 [ph] growth expectation globally looks to be up in the high single-digit range. 
Now onto Timberland, where global revenues were up 1% on a currency-neutral basis, with slight growth in D2C, partially offset by relatively flat wholesale sales. Excluding FX and the 53rd week, fourth quarter revenue was up 5%. Similar to The North Face, Timberland was impacted by warm weather in the quarter, too. In the Americas, revenues was down at a low single-digit rate. And of course, we're comping against the 53rd week, so normalized rates are higher. Strategically, we continue to see great response to our efforts to evolve the perception of our outdoor lifestyle positioning. 
Looking at product. Boots were a strong performer during the quarter led by both classics and women's silhouettes. In fact, boots were strong across men's, women's and kids. And beyond just boots, we're continuing to gain traction in some of our more casual styles such as our men's Britton Hill collection, which had a tremendous sell-through in our D2C channel. And in fact, the advertised style completely sold out. So clearly, great momentum there. 
We've also made significant progress in the women's business, especially in North America, and created a new generation of brand loyalists who love the style, fit and craftsmanship of the Amston and the Glancy. Early days, but super promising and much more appealing. 
On the marketing front, we continue to connect with the outdoor lifestyle consumer. During the quarter, our Made for the Modern Trail campaign came to life across print, digital and social media, driving awareness for our Black Forest collection. All in, our consumer impressions were up 50% at 1.25 billion over last year. The Pro Boondock and Powertrain collections saw nice growth in the quarter, and it's clear that we're meeting consumers' needs for footwear that helps them get the job done. The Pro platform continues to be a great living laboratory for learning, testing and introducing new comfort and durability innovations that are very easily translated back into our casual lifestyle product."

This 360-degree effort enable us to integrate classic and digital marketing efforts. It also allowed us to team up with our wholesale partners, giving us very visible and unit consumer touch points. 
Turning to Asia. Revenues were up -- revenues were down slightly, impacted by software traffic in Hong Kong and Singapore specifically. And despite unusually warm weather for the region, we were encouraged by the strength of our lightweight outerwear, which grew double digits. On the footwear side, we saw positive results with boots leading the way, growing at high teen rate.

At Wrangler, our mass business showed solid growth with a mid-single-digit increase in revenues. This was more than offset by declines in the brand's Western Specialty business, where the region's challenged by the contraction in oil and gas exploration are hardest hit. 
From a product perspective, we're successfully expanding the Advanced Comfort line into casuals and warmer-weather product. Additionally, we're working to address the needs of everyday consumers as the outdoor and active categories converge with outdoor-inspired casual solutions and versatile fabrics and functional design aesthetics. 
We also had a very strong launch of our Cool Vantage product in our Western platform. We do expect the positive momentum that Wrangler realized in 2015 to continue into 2016 as we introduce new products with innovative fabrics that satisfy unmet consumer needs.

Starting at the top, revenue was down 1% on a currency-neutral basis. Or if you normalize for the 53rd week, it was up 3%. This included relative strength in our Outdoor & Action Sports, Jeanswear, international and direct-to-consumer businesses. 
Gross margin came in at 49% on a constant -- on a currency-neutral basis, equal to last year. Reported gross margin was down 70 basis points to 48.3. And to walk you through the puts and takes, benefits from changes in mix and favorable product costs were more than offset by foreign currency headwinds and aggressive efforts to manage inventory among our brands with greatest exposure to cold weather. As you would expect, we responded quickly with respect to inventory, an effort that enabled us to finish the quarter with levels up just under 9%. For context, nearly half of that 9% increase is related specifically to cold weather-related product, and it's important to note that the composition of this inventory is good. It's core product that's already slated for our fall '16 line. So while inventory levels will remain a bit higher than we'd like for the first half of 2016, we expect them to normalize in the second half of the year. 
Earlier, Steve gave a quick overview of our Contemporary Brands coalition. Suffice it to say that it was a disappointing year for our business, one in which we fell short of our expectations. As a result, the fair values of 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss brands were determined to be below their respective carrying values. Therefore, we have recorded a $144 million pretax noncash impairment charge in the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets of these brands. After tax, this was a $97 million charge or $0.23 of diluted EPS. 
Adjusted SG&A, that is excluding the impairment charge, was down 40 basis points in the quarter, demonstrating our disciplined approach to offsetting continued investments in D2C, demand creation and innovation with operating leverage and expense control. Excluding the impairment charge, adjusted operating income was down 6% and adjusted operating margin was 15.8% compared with 16.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014. On a reported basis, operating income was 11.6% compared to 5.1% last year. 
And finally, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.95 compared to $0.98 in the same period of 2015. Adjusted currency-neutral EPS was up 5%. And if you exclude FX and the 53rd week, fourth quarter adjusted EPS was up 12%. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share was $0.72, up significantly over last year's fourth quarter. 
Turning now to the full year. 2015 revenue grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis. Excluding the 53rd week, revenue increased 7%. Highlights included 9% growth in both our Outdoor & Action Sports and international businesses and 7% growth in our direct-to-consumer business, which comped positively for the full year. Apples to apples, Outdoor & Action Sports and D2C were up 11% year-over-year. 
We also benefited from improved performance in our Jeanswear coalition, which, although it carries lower gross margins than VF's average, it's still our most profitable coalition. Gross margin was down 0.5 point to 48.3%. To walk you through the full year factors, our mix benefit was present but slightly less than that about 50 basis points we typically see due to improved Jeanswear performance and softer-than-expected D2C results. And while we did see expected tailwind, the expected tailwind from lower product cost, our aggressive management of inventory offset this benefit. So that leaves us with FX, which negatively impacted our gross margin by 80 basis points. 
SG&A for the year, as a percentage of total revenue, was down 10 basis points due to the same discipline we exhibited in the fourth quarter. That is offsetting investments in our fastest-growing businesses and strategic priorities by maintaining strong cost controls across other areas in the organization. Excluding the impairment charge, adjusted currency-neutral operating income was unchanged at $1.8 billion [ph] and an operating margin was 14.6% in 2015 compared with 14.9% in the prior year. Taking into account the 70 basis point foreign currency hit, we achieved an operating margin of 15.3% in spite of top line pressure. On a reported basis, full year operating income was $1.7 billion in 2015 and operating margin was 13.4% compared with 11.7% in 2014. 
So that brings us to a full year adjusted EPS, which was $3.08, in line with 2014's result. On a currency-neutral basis, EPS was up 12%. 
Now at the end of year 3 of our 5-year plan, we've averaged 13% EPS growth annually, which is right in line with our long term guidance. On a GAAP basis, full year EPS was up 20% to $2.85. 
We ended the year with a strong balance sheet and a capital structure that continues to afford us great flexibility. In 2015, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations and returned nearly $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Turning now to 2016. While we do expect some challenges to continue in the near term, we remain as confident as ever in our ability to deliver long-term profitable growth and returns to our shareholders. And here's why. Our portfolio of brands with its diversity of consumer, geography and channel is supported by a deep arsenal of P&L levers, including strategic investments, focused operational discipline and a world-class supply chain, all of which deliver superior cash flow. Working in concert, these strengths will allow us the flexibility necessary to emerge even stronger coming out of 2016. We expect revenue in 2016 to grow at a mid-single-digit percentage rate, including about a 1% impact from a stronger U.S. dollar. On both a reported and currency-neutral basis, our plans include growth in every region as well as in our wholesale and D2C channels. By coalition, revenue for Outdoor & Action Sports is expected to increase at a high single-digit rate with similar increases for Vans and Timberland and mid single-digit growth for The North Face brand. In Jeanswear, we expect the momentum to continue with mid-single-digit revenue growth. And rounded out, we're expecting low single-digit growth for Imagewear, a slight decline in Sportswear and mid-single-digit decline in Contemporary Brands business. We expect momentum in the international and direct-to-consumer business to continue in 2016. International revenue is expected to be up at a high single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis or mid-single digits on a reported basis. By region, in Europe, we expect mid-single-digit increase in currency-neutral revenues, up low single-digit reported. In our Asia Pacific region, currency-neutral revenue should be up a low double-digit percentage rate or up high single-digit reported. And in our Americas non-U.S. business, we're expecting revenue to grow a low teen percentage rate on a currency-neutral basis or up low single digits reported. Our D2C business should accelerate in 2016 with revenues expected to be up at a low double-digit currency-neutral rate with about a 1 point of negative impact due to changes in FX. Through the year, we expect to increase our total store count to about 1,600 doors compared with 1,520 at the end of 2015. Comp sales growth are expected to grow at a mid-single-digit rate, including growth of more than 20% in e-commerce. 
On now to gross margin. We expect 2016 gross margin rate to improve by 50 basis points to reach 48.8% or 49.5% on a currency-neutral basis. 
To click down into the drivers, we estimate a combination of product cost and pricing benefits to be equally offset by 70 basis points of FX headwinds. That leaves 50 basis points of mix benefit to flow through as Outdoor & Action Sports, international and D2C continue to drive gross margin expansion. 
In terms of SG&A, we will continue to make strategic investments in our brands with respect to product innovation and demand creation as well as investing in our growing D2C business. In addition to store openings, we continue to make significant investments in our e-commerce capabilities, specifically bringing additional brands onto the common VF platform. These investments, along with continued pressure from foreign currency rate changes, should result in a modest increase in our SG&A ratio in 2016. 
This brings us to operating margin, which we anticipate to reach 14.4% in 2016, net of an anticipated 70 basis points of foreign currency impact. 
Moving to the bottom line. We expect currency-neutral EPS to be up 11% in 2016 or up 5% reported compared to the adjusted EPS of $3.08 in 2015. 
And as you think about the cadence of revenue and earnings, there's a few things to keep in mind. In the first quarter of 2016, we expect currency-neutral revenue to be about flat with the first quarter of 2015. With respect to earnings, recall that in the first quarter of 2015, we recorded a onetime $17 million gain related to the sale of a VF outlet store. Additionally, we expect the first quarter will see the most difficult FX comparison of the year with an estimated 120 basis point negative hit to gross margin. Therefore, we anticipate currency-neutral EPS to be about flat or down low double digits as reported. In the second quarter 2016, revenue should increase at a low single-digit percentage rate with a low single-digit decline in currency-neutral EPS or high single-digit as reported. Recall that last year second quarter benefited from a significantly lower tax rate related to the settlement of prior year's tax audits. Currency-neutral revenue growth in the second half of 2016 should increase at a high single-digit percentage rate with the strongest performance coming in the fourth quarter. We expect second half EPS to increase at a mid to high teen percentage rate. 
Our outlook for cash from operations remains very strong as we expect to generate $1.3 billion in 2016. And finally, our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders has never been more evident. In 2016, we expect our share buyback to reach about $1 billion, which is a meaningful increase over the prior year. And to echo what Eric said earlier, this increase is in response to cash flow generation and our commitment to shareholders, not an indication that we are changing our capital allocation priorities. In fact, our first priority remains acquisition. And as previously mentioned, our intention is to take a much more proactive approach to our portfolio composition this year. So share buyback, combined with our annual dividend, should return $1.5 billion of cash to our shareholders in 2016. That's a 15% increase in shareholder returns over 2015. 
In closing, I'd like to underscore that we are very proud of what we've accomplished in 2015. All global companies operate in a constantly changing environment. We've demonstrated time and time again our ability to effectively manage our business under a variety of conditions. This speaks to the agility of the VF model. We are highly confident that the power of our portfolio, along with numerous flexible levers, will enable us to drive revenue growth and profitability, mitigate risk, and most importantly, create value for our shareholders. 
And with that, we'll turn it back over to the operator and open it up for your questions."

I'll start trying to tackle your questions. So where was the biggest -- well, what caused the big miss? And you're right, we haven't had change like that to our expectations happen before to that degree of magnitude. As you know, from looking at all the retailers who are reporting, there was a significant slowdown in consumer spending from what everyone expected in the fourth quarter. So that hit everybody in all categories. It particularly hit cold-weather apparel and footwear, and that's a big piece of our business. So we were unusually impacted by it. And we came out of it with only 9% more inventory. And the implications of that were we understand the kind of inventory was probably not the right thing to do, so we aggressively got rid of it, and that affected our earnings. That was a big driver of the earnings miss, was the investment we made to end the year with only 9% more inventory than last year. So it was that combination that got to the EPS miss that we had. We think that was a smarter choice than getting close to our guided EPS and ending the year with significant excess inventory. The -- how we're looking at next year? Scott guided -- gave pretty clear guidance to how we're seeing the first half, which suggests that there is an inventory overhang out there. Some vendors have it. We have a little bit of it. Scott mentioned that about half of 9% was in outdoor and cold-weather products. So that's going to slow things down here in the first half. And then as we approach the second half, we're cautious in our outlook for next winter's weather and consumer behavior, more cautious than we have been in the past. We have -- the early part of that season book, and that's reflected in our guidance, and we're coming up against really easy numbers for us to beat, unless maybe it's going to be 80 degrees in New York next winter. I don't know. But unless -- if -- I think the odds are that the winter weather will be a little kinder around the world to us. So with a cautious outlook and really easy numbers to lap, that's where -- why we are more confident about the growth in the second half and we're off the growth rates we've had -- what we've said during the call, we've been averaging 7% a year for the last couple of years, and we're calling it mid-single digits until we see how this plays out. I think your last question was anything post-August that we learned about the consumers, and I don't know that we have. There were interesting product categories that slowed down. And most of the material impact for us was weather-related. It really hit our cold-weather brand. I'm looking down the table to see if anybody has more insight than I do on that, but I don't think there's any macro trends that we're seeing other than consumer spending is a little soft. And we think that will continue -- our expectations for 2016 assumes that, that continues to the first half of the year."

We've talked to you all about how we are pivoting this brand to be more competitive in a 4-quarter-type business model, and I think some of the results that you saw this year absolutely show that we're doing that. Our Thermoball franchise, which is a fantastic 3-season outerwear franchise, continues to grow. Performance apparel with our Mountain Athletics Group, up 40%. Our equipment category growing double digits. Relaunch of our premier Summit Series collection and multisport footwear growing double digits. We are pivoting to be more responsive and more capable to navigate these kinds of extreme weather conditions.

These risks and uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC. 
I'd also like to remind everyone that, unless otherwise noted, amounts on -- that our participants refer to on today's call will predominantly be in currency-neutral terms. By our definition, which is detailed in our press release issued at 6:55 a.m. Eastern this morning, currency-neutral amounts exclude both the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and the impact of currency rate changes on foreign-currency-denominated transactions. The amounts you'll hear refers to reported amounts, which are in accordance to U.S. GAAP and includes translation and transactional impacts of foreign currency exchange rates. 
We've chosen this currency-neutral amounts as a lead number in our discussions because we feel it more accurately represents the true operational performance and underlying results of our businesses and brands. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to currency-neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial information included with the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to recap the year recently completed and our outlook for 2016. 2015 was a strong year for VF's businesses around the world. You will recall that our original outlook for the year call",895,"Thank you, Lance. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to recap the year recently completed and our outlook for 2016. 2015 was a strong year for VF's businesses around the world. You will recall that our original outlook for the year call for currency-neutral revenue growth of 8% and earnings growth of 12%. And through the first 9 months, we tracked ahead of that goal with top line growth of 9% and earnings, up 15%. Then during our call in October, we spoke about a more cautious approach to the balance of the year, including a softer consumer environment and appropriately, we adjusted our outlook for the year. 
Our fundamental assumptions proved to be accurate. However, the consumer softness accelerated and was compounded by the warmest fourth quarter on record. As the quarter developed, we took immediate action to leverage the many strengths of our business model and pulled many operational levers to minimize the impact, manage the inventories and maintain brand integrity during a difficult retail period. 
Our fourth quarter results did not materialize as we originally planned. However, our responsiveness and operational agility allowed us to finish out the year in a way that's consistent with our 2017 goals. Currency-neutral revenue was up 6% and EPS was up 12%. And when you normalize for the 53rd week over the past 2 years, both 2015 and 2014 averaged 7% revenue growth and 13% EPS growth. So while we were 1 point shy on the top line, we were right on for the bottom line against our 2017 plans for these 2 years. As we close out 2015, I have a renewed sense of resolve and respect for how nimble and capable our company really is, and I have complete confidence in our ability to drive future growth and shareholder returns. 
As consumers' priorities continue to change, we're right there with them, strategically analyzing their shopping behavior, their preferences and the way they interact with our brands. Whether that's in our stores or online or through our wholesale partners, they're demanding more from the products they buy, more engagement and more authenticity from the brands they choose to develop relationships with and the ability to show up whenever and however they choose to shop. I'm confident that VF is uniquely positioned to win in this environment. 
So what's in store for 2016? We expect the retail and currency environments to remain challenging, mostly in the first half, as last year's overhang works through the system before conditions then normalize in our most meaningful quarters of the year. Throughout 2016, we will seize the opportunity to stay on the offense, and we will remain focused on the things that keep us healthy in 2016 and beyond such as: We're making outsized investments in product innovation to drive newness and excitement into the marketplace. We're building even stronger relationships with our consumers. We're strengthening our operational capabilities and delivering appropriate financial performance while positioning VF for sustainable, profitable growth over the long term. Our team will go deeper into the details in a moment. But translating all of that into our 2016 financial outlook, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth and 11% EPS growth. Given our incomplete visibility into the year, especially around our cold-weather-related products, we believe this is a sensible reflection on the current and going-forward environment. 
As I think more about our future, I think about VF's strengths and how they've enabled us to develop a respected track record of success with brands that we've added to our portfolio. Strategically, we described ourselves as active portfolio managers. And while I can't be specific, I can tell you that in 2016, we're taking in a specially focused and proactive look towards the composition of our portfolio to ensure that we are optimally positioned to maximize growth and returns to our shareholders. We are actively exploring the segments of the business we want to expand our portfolio in, and we're exploring where we might want less exposure. We will certainly talk more about this in the future and keep you posted as those plans unfold. 
As you know, we have a long history of returning cash to our shareholders. In 2016, we'll continue this commitment because a softer retail -- a softer environment shouldn't mean shareholders have to sit on the sidelines. We've got a healthy increase in our share buyback to about $1 billion. And with our dividend payout, we expect to return $1.5 billion in total this year. 
Now allow me to pre-answer one of your almost-certain questions. With respect to potential portfolio composition, share buyback is an and conversation, not an or conversation, meaning there's no impact to our ability to pursue acquisitions that are right for VF. 
In closing, our business model remains solid and intact. Nothing is fundamentally different with our story. We're committed to our strategy, and it's working. VF is well equipped to navigate through these near-term challenges, and our strength and discipline lead us to maintain our commitment to retaining shareholder value. I am extremely proud of the work our team is doing, and I'm excited about what lies ahead. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve, Karl Heinz and Scott Baxter to take us through our coalition and brand results, and then over to Scott Roe to review our financial performance. Steve?"

Outdoor & Action Sports currency-neutral revenue was up 1% in the fourth quarter with a mid-single-digit increase in D2C, offset by a decline in wholesale. As you know, we're up against a 53rd week at the end of 2014. So normalizing for that over both periods, the coalition was up 5% in the quarter. Clearly contributing to these results was the warmest fourth quarter on record, yet I'm proud to say that we came through relatively strong given the challenges. 
Taking a look at VF's 3 largest brands. Fourth quarter revenue for The North Face was down 2% with low single-digit growth in D2C, offset by a mid-single-digit decline in wholesale. Excluding FX and a 53rd week, revenue in the quarter was up 1% over last year. Revenue in the Americas region was down at a low single-digit rate, the result directly related to warm weather. And while heavier outerwear styles did not perform to expectations, we did see success with shells and midweight styles validating our strategy to provide more adaptable, multi-season product. 
Thermoball is a great example of this and a franchise that continued its strong growth. Thermoball is the best-selling outerwear franchise in the U.S. market across all brands over the past 2 years. This was bolstered by a new product-specific ad campaign launched in November. We also relaunched our pinnacle Summit Series collection globally, offering best mountaineering product and pushing the limits of product innovation and technology. Beyond outerwear, we saw great performance in our running and training apparel, driven by Mountain Athletics growing more than 40%. 
Our continued efforts to connect even more deeply with consumers through inspired exploration, including physical, emotional and creative pursuits, has never been more strategic. Our Never Stop Exploring brand campaign, which we launched in Q4, was our first expansive view of exploration and our first truly global brand effort. And with over 1 billion impressions, we're really pleased with the results and confident it connected with and inspired adventurers everywhere. As we look ahead, The North Face will continue to encourage consumers to explore, train and live, and we have a great pipeline of innovative product that will help them do just that. Now to Karl Heinz."

The North Face European business was down at a mid-single-digit rate, with low teen D2C growth being offset by decline in the wholesale business. We saw strength in our Thermoball and Mountain Athletics collection during the quarter as well as our Ultra footwear line. We also launched a new store concept on Regent Street in London, which allows athletes to train together in weekly sessions. We have seen great response so far. 
For the full year, The North Face in Europe grew faster than the overall outdoor apparel market. It was challenged by unseasonably warm weather in November and December and even so, our own DTC business grew 25%. 
Across the year, we put a lot of focus on elevating our brand position in the market by carefully managing inventories. We also made meaningful steps in terms of segmenting the European marketplace from a merchandising perspective. We feel well positioned for accelerated growth in 2016. 
In Asia, fourth quarter revenue increased at a low single-digit rate, driven by slight growth in D2C and a relatively flat wholesale business. During the quarter, we launched a FuseForm product for the first time with great response. We also hosted the TNF outdoor festival in Shanghai Century Park, which had more than 4,000 visitors during the course of the weekend."

Revenues for the year were up 5% globally in 2015 to $2.3 billion, or up 6%, excluding FX and a 53rd week. And while we're off our long-term growth target this year, our fourth quarter performance does give me confidence that this brand is built to perform in many environments, is strong and opportunistically, has many competitive advantages in play. 
Given the current environment, as we look at 2016, we see the year ahead as an opportunity to evolve and amplify The North Face brand, both on a strategic and tactical level. We've realigned our global category management model to better focus on individual consumer usage occasions. This enables us to deliver even stronger product and brand experiences to connect and inspire new and existing consumers in ways never done before. 
For the full year, we expect The North Face to grow revenue at a mid-single-digit rate, so similar to 2015. This early outlook, based on fourth quarter results and our fall selling process, is an accurate reflection of what we see ahead. 
Turning to Vans. Global revenue was up 8% in the fourth quarter with a low double-digit increase in D2C and a low single-digit increase in the wholesale business. Excluding FX and a 53rd week, the fourth quarter was up 13%. In the Americas, the fourth quarter was up at a mid-single-digit rate, again impacted by the 53rd week, with double-digit D2C growth and a slight decline in wholesale. 
On a product front, we continue to see success with our strategic move toward providing a complete 4-season offering. As evidence, our all-weather Mountain Edition footwear styles were all top sellers, and we've already seen significant sell-in for 2016 for these styles as well. We're also seeing success with our Mountain Edition weatherized apparel, further extending our brand beyond footwear. And our collaborations, including one with Vans and The North Face, are reinforcing our commitment to blending street style and performance in innovative products and really showing the consumer the strength of the VF portfolio. 
True to our off-the-wall culture, we continue to redefine new ways to connect with our consumers. During the fourth quarter, our PROPELLER skateboarding film saw great success and was one of iTunes' top 10 documentaries of the year, not to mention Transworld Skateboarding's film of the year. Vans was also recently named the #1 sneaker brand on Instagram, our young consumers' #1 social platform. These are great wins for the brand and great testament to keeping our core consumer at the center of everything we do."

During the quarter, we had several strong collaborations worth highlighting. Our second collaboration with Disney was really well received by consumers across footwear, apparel and accessories. The Vans TNF products sold out in a number of places across Europe, and the Vans Pendleton collection helped elevate our weatherized offering with great success. In our core Classics collection, we have seen higher-than-normal inventory levels. And even though we are performing better than our competition in this category, we do anticipate a more challenging sales environment in 2016 as this product works through the channel. The good news is that our brand health metrics have never been as strong, and our other product categories are selling through extremely well. 
In Asia, Vans grew more than 20%, driven by almost 40% D2C growth and a high teen increase in our wholesale business. Our House of Vans brand experience proved to be incredible for both the brand and our consumers. We took this experience on tour to 14 cities throughout the year and connected with thousands of fans. We also launched our Monkey Rules campaign for the Chinese New Year, and the response shows that this is a winner."

Looking at 2016, we'll be focused on continuing to expand the brand's relevance, updating classic silhouettes and introducing new styles and collections for the ever-changing global consumer. 
Also, Vans will celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2016. We definitely have unique products and experiences planned to keep consumers engaged and connected as we celebrate our authentic heritage. 
Regionally in 2016, we're expecting continued strength with double-digit growth in both the Americas and Asia businesses, which represent about 75% of the total. However, due to the factors KH spoke about, revenues could be down slightly in Europe. Our 26% growth expectation for Vans globally looks to be up in the high single-digit range. 
Now on to Timberland, where global revenues were up 1% on a currency-neutral basis, with slight growth in D2C, partially offset by relatively flat wholesale sales. Excluding FX and the 53rd week, fourth quarter revenue was up 5%. Similar to The North Face, Timberland was impacted by warm weather in the quarter, too. In the Americas, revenues was down at a low single-digit rate. And of course, we're comping against the 53rd week, so normalized rates are higher. Strategically, we continue to see great response to our efforts to evolve the perception of our outdoor lifestyle positioning. 
Looking at product. Boots were a strong performer during the quarter, led by both classics and women's silhouettes. In fact, boots were strong across men's, women's and kids. And beyond just boots, we're continuing to gain traction in some of our more casual styles, such as our men's Britton Hill collection, which had a tremendous sell-through in our D2C channel. And in fact, the advertised style completely sold out. So clearly, great momentum there. 
We've also made significant progress in the women's business, especially in North America, and created a new generation of brand loyalists who love the style, fit and craftsmanship of the Amston and the Glancy. Early days, but super promising and much more coming. 
On the marketing front, we continue to connect with the outdoor lifestyler consumer. During the quarter, our Made for the Modern Trail campaign came to life across print, digital and social media, driving awareness for our Black Forest collection. All in, our consumer impressions were up 50% at 1.25 billion over last year.

In women's, our classic boots also saw strong results. On the marketing side, our Black Forest campaign was our most successful promotion in this region ever. This 360-degree effort enabled us to integrate classic and digital marketing efforts. It also allowed us to team up with our wholesale partners, giving us very visible and unique consumer touch points. 
Turning to Asia. Revenues were up -- revenues were down slightly, impacted by softer traffic in Hong Kong and Singapore, specifically. And despite unusually warm weather for the region, we were encouraged by the strength of our lightweight outerwear, which grew double digits. 
On the footwear side, we saw positive results with boots leading the way, growing at high teen rate. And similar to Europe, our Black Forest campaign was very successful, driving high levels of interest in the brand."

Excluding FX and the 53rd week, Jeanswear was up 6% in the fourth quarter. In the Americas region, Jeanswear revenue was flat in the quarter. A low single-digit increase in Lee revenue was offset by a low single-digit decline in Wrangler revenue. At Wrangler, our mass business showed solid growth with a mid-single-digit increase in revenues. This was more than offset by declines in the brand's Western Specialty business, where the region's challenge by the contraction in oil and gas exploration are hardest hit. 
From a product perspective, we're successfully expanding the Advanced Comfort line into casuals and warmer-weather product. Additionally, we're working to address the needs of every day consumers as the outdoor and active categories converge with outdoor-inspired casual solutions and versatile fabrics and functional design aesthetics. 
We also had a very strong launch of our Cool Vantage product in our Western platform. We do expect the positive momentum that Wrangler realized in 2015 to continue into 2016 as we introduce new products with innovative fabrics that satisfy unmet consumer needs. 
On to Lee. We once again saw growth in this business during the quarter with the America's growing in the low single digits. We're seeing strong response for both male and female consumers to our new performance fabrications and are excited to introduce even more advanced fabrication offerings in the coming year, including improved breathability and comfort innovations. We have also made great strides as we work to enhance our presence in department stores, clubs and e-commerce. And we are pleased to have grown nicely in 2015. In 2016, we will build on this momentum as we continue to expand our distribution footprint and introduce new product assortments.

Lee's European business marks its 11th consecutive quarter of revenue growth with the business up at a mid-single-digit rate. New products, including the skinny and boot cut jeans for women and the Malone jeans for men drove our growth in the quarter. 
In Asia, despite uncertain economic conditions, our Lee business had another solid quarter, with revenue up at the low double-digit rate and very strong profit growth. We're truly becoming a leader in the premium denim segment in Asia, driven by our innovations, such as our Jade Fusion line and meaningful consumer activations throughout the region. And it's not just consumers who have responded well to this product. We learned that Lee's Jade Fusion has been nominated for an Edison Award, which honors the best innovations as voted by industry peers.

On today's call, you've heard recurrent themes, including things we can't impact, like record warm weather, strengthening of the U.S. dollar, the 53rd week of 2014 and a softer retail environment. You've also heard us refer to things we can impact, like operational and fiscal discipline; executing strategic initiatives; and ultimately, how our strengths and agility give us the unique ability to deliver consistent shareholder returns in an uneven environment. 
With both sides of this coin in play, let's review our fourth quarter results, and I'll do my best to filter through the noise to illustrate an apples-to-apples story that tells the true performance of VF's model. 
Starting at the top, revenue was down 1% on a currency-neutral basis. Or if you normalize for the 53rd week, it was up 3%. This included relative strength in our Outdoor & Action Sports, Jeanswear, international and direct-to-consumer businesses. 
Gross margin came in at 49% on a constant -- on a currency-neutral basis, equal to last year. Reported gross margin was down 70 basis points to 48.3%. And to walk you through the puts and takes, benefits from changes in mix and favorable product costs were more than offset by foreign currency headwinds and aggressive efforts to manage inventory among our brands with greatest exposure to cold weather. As you would expect, we responded quickly with respect to inventory, an effort that enabled us to finish the quarter with levels up just under 9%. For context, nearly half of that 9% increase is related specifically to cold weather-related product, and it's important to note that the composition of this inventory is good. It's core product that's already slated for our fall '16 line. So while inventory levels will remain a bit higher than we'd like for the first half of 2016, we expect them to normalize in the second half of the year. 
Earlier, Steve gave a quick overview of our Contemporary Brands coalition. Suffice it to say that it was a disappointing year for our business, one in which we fell short of our expectations. As a result, the fair values of 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss brands were determined to be below their respective carrying values. Therefore, we have recorded a $144 million pretax noncash impairment charge in the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets of these brands. After tax, this was a $97 million charge or $0.23 of diluted EPS. 
Adjusted SG&A, that is excluding the impairment charge, was down 40 basis points in the quarter, demonstrating our disciplined approach to offsetting continued investments in D2C, demand creation and innovation, with operating leverage and expense control. Excluding the impairment charge, adjusted operating income was down 6% and adjusted operating margin was 15.8% compared with 16.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014. On a reported basis, operating income was 11.6% compared to 5.1% last year. 
And finally, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.95 compared to $0.98 in the same period of 2015. Adjusted currency-neutral EPS was up 5%. And if you exclude FX and the 53rd week, fourth quarter adjusted EPS was up 12%. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share was $0.72, up significantly over last year's fourth quarter. 
Turning now to the full year. 2015 revenue grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis. Excluding the 53rd week, revenue increased 7%. Highlights included 9% growth in both our Outdoor & Action Sports and international businesses and 7% growth in our direct-to-consumer business, which comped positively for the full year. Apples to apples, Outdoor & Action Sports and D2C were up 11% year-over-year. We also benefited from improved performance in our Jeanswear coalition, which, although it carries lower gross margins than VF's average, it's still our most profitable coalition. 
Gross margin was down 0.5 point to 48.3%. To walk you through the full year factors, our mix benefit was present but slightly less than that about 50 basis points we typically see due to improved Jeanswear performance and softer-than-expected D2C results. And while we did see expected tailwind, the expected tailwind from lower product cost, our aggressive management of inventory offset this benefit. So that leaves us with FX, which negatively impacted our gross margin by 80 basis points. 
SG&A for the year, as a percentage of total revenue, was down 10 basis points due to the same discipline we exhibited in the fourth quarter. That is offsetting investments in our fastest-growing businesses and strategic priorities by maintaining strong cost controls across other areas in the organization. Excluding the impairment charge, adjusted currency-neutral operating income was unchanged at $1.8 billion and operating margin was 14.6% in 2015 compared with 14.9% in the prior year. Taking into account the 70 basis point foreign currency hit, we achieved an operating margin of 15.3% in spite of top line pressure. On a reported basis, full year operating income was $1.7 billion in 2015, and operating margin was 13.4% compared with 11.7% in 2014. 
So that brings us to full year adjusted EPS, which was $3.08, in line with 2014's result. On a currency-neutral basis, EPS was up 12%. Now at the end of year 3 of our 5-year plan, we've averaged 13% EPS growth annually, which is right in line with our long term guidance. On a GAAP basis, full year EPS was up 20% to $2.85. 
We ended the year with a strong balance sheet and a capital structure that continues to afford us great flexibility. In 2015, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations and returned nearly $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Turning now to 2016. While we do expect some challenges to continue in the near term, we remain as confident as ever in our ability to deliver long-term profitable growth and returns to our shareholders. And here's why. Our portfolio of brands, with its diversity of consumer, geography and channel, is supported by a deep arsenal of P&L levers, including strategic investments, focused operational discipline and a world-class supply chain, all of which deliver superior cash flow. Working in concert, these strengths will allow us the flexibility necessary to emerge even stronger coming out of 2016. We expect revenue in 2016 to grow at a mid-single-digit percentage rate, including about a 1% impact from a stronger U.S. dollar. On both a reported and currency-neutral basis, our plans include growth in every region as well as in our wholesale and D2C channels. 
By coalition, revenue for Outdoor & Action Sports is expected to increase at a high single-digit rate, with similar increases for Vans and Timberland and mid-single-digit growth for The North Face brand. In Jeanswear, we expect the momentum to continue with mid-single-digit revenue growth. And to round it out, we're expecting low single-digit growth for Imagewear, a slight decline in Sportswear and mid-single-digit decline in Contemporary Brands business. We expect momentum in the international and direct-to-consumer business to continue in 2016. International revenue is expected to be up at a high single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis or mid-single digits on a reported basis. 
By region, in Europe, we expect mid-single-digit increase in currency-neutral revenues, up low single-digit reported. In our Asia Pacific region, currency-neutral revenue should be up a low double-digit percentage rate or up high single-digit reported. And in our Americas non-U.S. business, we're expecting revenue to grow at a low-teen percentage rate on a currency-neutral basis or up low single digits reported. 
Our D2C business should accelerate in 2016 with revenues expected to be up at a low double-digit currency-neutral rate with about 1 point of negative impact due to changes in FX. Through the year, we expect to increase our total store count to about 1,600 doors compared with 1,520 at the end of 2015. Comp sales growth are expected to grow at a mid-single-digit rate, including growth of more than 20% in e-commerce. 
On now to gross margin. We expect 2016 gross margin rate to improve by 50 basis points to reach 48.8% or 49.5% on a currency-neutral basis. To click down into the drivers, we estimate a combination of product cost and pricing benefits to be equally offset by 70 basis points of FX headwinds. That leaves 50 basis points of mix benefit to flow through as Outdoor & Action Sports, international and D2C continue to drive gross margin expansion. 
In terms of SG&A, we will continue to make strategic investments in our brands with respect to product innovation and demand creation as well as investing in our growing D2C business. In addition to store openings, we continue to make significant investments in our e-commerce capabilities, specifically bringing additional brands onto the common VF platform. These investments, along with continued pressure from foreign currency rate changes, should result in a modest increase in our SG&A ratio in 2016. This brings us to operating margin, which we anticipate to reach 14.4% in 2016, net of an anticipated 70 basis points of foreign currency impact. 
Moving to the bottom line. We expect currency-neutral EPS to be up 11% in 2016, or up 5% reported, compared to the adjusted EPS of $3.08 in 2015. 
And as you think about the cadence of revenue and earnings, there's a few things to keep in mind. In the first quarter of 2016, we expect currency-neutral revenue to be about flat with the first quarter of 2015. With respect to earnings, recall that in the first quarter of 2015, we recorded a onetime $17 million gain related to the sale of a VF outlet store. Additionally, we expect that the first quarter will see the most difficult FX comparison of the year with an estimated 120 basis point negative hit to gross margin. Therefore, we anticipate currency-neutral EPS to be about flat or down low double digits as reported. 
In the second quarter of 2016, revenue should increase at a low single-digit percentage rate with a low single-digit decline in currency-neutral EPS or high single-digit as reported. Recall that last year's second quarter benefited from a significantly lower tax rate related to the settlement of prior year's tax audits. Currency-neutral revenue growth in the second half of 2016 should increase at a high single-digit percentage rate with the strongest performance coming in the fourth quarter. We expect second half EPS to increase at a mid- to high teen percentage rate. 
Our outlook for cash from operations remains very strong as we expect to generate $1.3 billion in 2016. And finally, our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders has never been more evident. In 2016, we expect our share buyback to reach about $1 billion, which is a meaningful increase over the prior year. 
And to echo what Eric said earlier, this increase is in response to cash flow generation and our commitment to shareholders, not an indication that we are changing our capital allocation priorities. In fact, our first priority remains acquisition. And as previously mentioned, our intention is to take a much more proactive approach to our portfolio composition this year. So share buyback, combined with our annual dividend, should return $1.5 billion of cash to our shareholders in 2016. That's a 15% increase in shareholder returns over 2015. 
In closing, I'd like to underscore that we are very proud of what we've accomplished in 2015. All global companies operate in a constantly changing environment. We've demonstrated time and time again our ability to effectively manage our business under a variety of conditions. This speaks to the agility of the VF model. We are highly confident that the power of our portfolio, along with numerous flexible levers, will enable us to drive revenue growth and profitability, mitigate risk, and most importantly, create value for our shareholders. 
And with that, we'll turn it back over to the operator and open it up for your questions."

I'll start trying to tackle your questions. So where was the biggest -- well, what caused the big miss? And you're right, we haven't had change like that to our expectations happen before to that degree of magnitude. As you know, from looking at all the retailers who are reporting, there was a significant slowdown in consumer spending from what everyone expected in the fourth quarter. So that hit everybody in all categories. It particularly hit cold-weather apparel and footwear, and that's a big piece of our business. So we were unusually impacted by it. And we came out of it with only 9% more inventory. And the implications of that were we understand the kind of inventory was probably not the right thing to do, so we aggressively got rid of it, and that affected our earnings. That was a big driver of the earnings miss, was the investment we made to end the year with only 9% more inventory than last year. So it was that combination that got to the EPS miss that we had. We think that was a smarter choice than getting close to our guided EPS and ending the year with significant excess inventory. The -- how we're looking at next year? Scott guided -- gave pretty clear guidance to how we're seeing the first half, which suggests that there is an inventory overhang out there. Some vendors have it. We have a little bit of it. Scott mentioned that about half of 9% was in outdoor and cold-weather products. So that's going to slow things down here in the first half. And then as we approach the second half, we're cautious in our outlook for next winter's weather and consumer behavior, more cautious than we have been in the past. We have -- the early part of that season booked, and that's reflected in our guidance, and we're coming up against really easy numbers for us to beat, unless maybe it's going to be 80 degrees in New York next winter, I don't know. But unless -- if -- I think the odds are that the winter weather will be a little kinder around the world to us. So with a cautious outlook and really easy numbers to lap, that's where -- why we are more confident about the growth in the second half and we're off the growth rates we've had. As we've said during the call, we've been averaging 7% a year for the last couple of years, and we're calling it mid-single digits until we see how this plays out. I think your last question was anything post-August that we learned about the consumers? And I don't know that we have. There were interesting product categories that slowed down. And most of the material impact for us was weather-related. We really hit our cold-weather brand. I'm looking on the table to see if anybody has more insight than I do on that, but I don't think there's any macro trends that we're seeing other than consumer spending is a little soft. And we think that will continue -- our expectations for 2016 assumes that, that continues through the first half of the year."

All in all, I think also snow came, and it got cold in Europe a little bit later, but it came. So inventories are pretty normalized now, so that is good news. The second part of the question -- what was the second part?"

We've chosen these currency-neutral amounts as a lead number in our discussions because we feel it more accurately represents the true operational performance and underlying results of our businesses and brands. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to currency-neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial information included with the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to recap the year recently completed and our outlook for 2016. 2015 was a strong year for VF's businesses around the world. You will recall that our original outlook for the year call",893,"Thank you, Lance. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to recap the year recently completed and our outlook for 2016. 2015 was a strong year for VF's businesses around the world. You will recall that our original outlook for the year call for currency-neutral revenue growth of 8% and earnings growth of 12%. And through the first 9 months, we tracked ahead of that goal with top line growth of 9% and earnings, up 15%. Then during our call in October, we spoke about a more cautious approach to the balance of the year, including a softer consumer environment and appropriately, we adjusted our outlook for the year. 
Our fundamental assumptions proved to be accurate. However, the consumer softness accelerated and was compounded by the warmest fourth quarter on record. As the quarter developed, we took immediate action to leverage the many strengths of our business model and pulled many operational levers to minimize the impact, manage the inventories and maintain brand integrity during a difficult retail period. 
Our fourth quarter results did not materialize as we originally planned. However, our responsiveness and operational agility allowed us to finish out the year in a way that's consistent with our 2017 goals. Currency-neutral revenue was up 6% and EPS was up 12%. And when you normalize for the 53rd week over the past 2 years, both 2015 and 2014 averaged 7% revenue growth and 13% EPS growth. So while we were 1 point shy on the top line, we were right on for the bottom line against our 2017 plans for these 2 years. As we close out 2015, I have a renewed sense of resolve and respect for how nimble and capable our company really is, and I have complete confidence in our ability to drive future growth and shareholder returns. 
As consumers' priorities continue to change, we're right there with them, strategically analyzing their shopping behavior, their preferences and the way they interact with our brands. Whether that's in our stores or online or through our wholesale partners, they're demanding more from the products they buy, more engagement and more authenticity from the brands they choose to develop relationships with and the ability to show up whenever and however they choose to shop. I'm confident that VF is uniquely positioned to win in this environment. 
So what's in store for 2016? We expect the retail and currency environments to remain challenging, mostly in the first half, as last year's overhang works through the system before conditions normalize in our most meaningful quarters of the year. Throughout 2016, we will seize the opportunity to stay on the offense, and we will remain focused on the things that keep us healthy in 2016 and beyond such as: We're making outsized investments in product innovation to drive newness and excitement into the marketplace. We're building even stronger relationships with our consumers. We're strengthening our operational capabilities and delivering appropriate financial performance while positioning VF for sustainable, profitable growth over the long term. 
Our team will go deeper into the details in a moment. But translating all of that into our 2016 financial outlook, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth and 11% EPS growth. Given our incomplete visibility into the year, especially around our cold-weather-related products, we believe this is a sensible reflection on the current and going-forward environment. 
As I think more about our future, I think about VF's strengths and how they've enabled us to develop a respected track record of success with brands that we've added to our portfolio. Strategically, we described ourselves as active portfolio managers. And while I can't be specific, I can tell you that in 2016, we're taking an especially focused and proactive look towards the composition of our portfolio to ensure that we are optimally positioned to maximize growth and returns to our shareholders. We are actively exploring the segments of the business we want to expand our portfolio in, and we're exploring where we might want less exposure. We will certainly talk more about this in the future and keep you posted as those plans unfold. 
As you know, we have a long history of returning cash to our shareholders. In 2016, we'll continue this commitment because a softer retail -- a softer environment shouldn't mean shareholders have to sit on the sidelines. We've got a healthy increase in our share buyback to about $1 billion. And with our dividend payout, we expect to return $1.5 billion in total this year. 
Now allow me to pre-answer one of your almost-certain questions. With respect to potential portfolio composition, share buyback is an and conversation, not an or conversation, meaning there's no impact to our ability to pursue acquisitions that are right for VF. 
In closing, our business model remains solid and intact. Nothing is fundamentally different with our story. We're committed to our strategy, and it's working. VF is well equipped to navigate through these near-term challenges, and our strength and discipline lead us to maintain our commitment to retaining shareholder value.

Outdoor & Action Sports currency-neutral revenue was up 1% in the fourth quarter with a mid-single-digit increase in D2C, offset by a decline in wholesale. As you know, we're up against a 53rd week at the end of 2014. So normalizing for that",370,"Thanks, Eric. Outdoor & Action Sports currency-neutral revenue was up 1% in the fourth quarter with a mid-single-digit increase in D2C, offset by a decline in wholesale. As you know, we're up against a 53rd week at the end of 2014. So normalizing for that over both periods, the coalition was up 5% in the quarter. Clearly contributing to these results was the warmest fourth quarter on record, yet I'm proud to say that we came through relatively strong given the challenges. 
Taking a look at VF's 3 largest brands. Fourth quarter revenue for The North Face was down 2% with low single-digit growth in D2C, offset by a mid-single-digit decline in wholesale. Excluding FX and a 53rd week, revenue in the quarter was up 1% over last year. Revenue in the Americas region was down at a low single-digit rate, a result directly related to warm weather. And while heavier outerwear styles did not perform to expectations, we did see success with shells and midweight styles validating our strategy to provide more adaptable, multi-season product. 
Thermoball is a great example of this and a franchise that continued its strong growth. Thermoball is the best-selling outerwear franchise in the U.S. market across all brands over the past 2 years. This was bolstered by a new product-specific ad campaign launched in November. We also relaunched our pinnacle Summit Series collection globally, offering best mountaineering product and pushing the limits of product innovation and technology. Beyond outerwear, we saw great performance in our running and training apparel, driven by Mountain Athletics growing more than 40%. 
Our continued efforts to connect even more deeply with consumers through inspired exploration, including physical, emotional and creative pursuits, has never been more strategic. Our Never Stop Exploring brand campaign, which we launched in Q4, was our first expansive view of exploration and our first truly global brand effort. And with over 1 billion impressions, we're really pleased with the results and confident it connected with and inspired adventurers everywhere. As we look ahead, The North Face will continue to encourage consumers to explore, train and live, and we have a great pipeline of innovative product that will help them do just that. Now to Karl Heinz."

The North Face European business was down at a mid-single-digit rate, with low teen D2C growth being offset by decline in the wholesale business. We saw strength in our Thermoball and Mountain Athletics collection during the quarter as well as our Ultra footwear line. We also launched a new store concept on Regent Street in London, which allows athletes to train together in weekly sessions. We have seen great response so far. 
For the full year, The North Face in Europe grew faster than the overall outdoor apparel market. It was challenged by unseasonably warm weather in November and December and even so, our own DTC business grew 25%. 
Across the year, we put a lot of focus on elevating our brand position in the market by carefully managing inventories. We also made meaningful steps in terms of segmenting the European marketplace from a merchandising perspective. We feel well positioned for accelerated growth in 2016. 
In Asia, fourth quarter revenue increased at a low single-digit rate, driven by slight growth in D2C and a relatively flat wholesale business. During the quarter, we launched a FuseForm product for the first time with great response. We also hosted the TNF outdoor festival in Shanghai Century Park, which had more than 4,000 visitors during the course of the weekend."

Revenues for the year were up 5% globally in 2015 to $2.3 billion, or up 6%, excluding FX and the 53rd week. And while we're off our long-term growth target this year, our fourth quarter performance does give me confidence that this brand is built to perform in many environments, is strong and opportunistically, has many competitive advantages in play. 
Given the current environment, as we look at 2016, we see the year ahead as an opportunity to evolve and amplify The North Face brand, both on a strategic and tactical level. We've realigned our global category management model to better focus on individual consumer usage occasions. This enables us to deliver even stronger product and brand experiences to connect and inspire new and existing consumers in ways never done before. 
For the full year, we expect The North Face to grow revenue at a mid-single-digit rate, so similar to 2015. This early outlook, based on fourth quarter results and our fall selling process, is an accurate reflection of what we see ahead. 
Turning to Vans. Global revenue was up 8% in the fourth quarter with a low double-digit increase in D2C and a low single-digit increase in the wholesale business. Excluding FX and a 53rd week, the fourth quarter was up 13%. In the Americas, the fourth quarter was up at a mid-single-digit rate, again impacted by the 53rd week, with double-digit D2C growth and a slight decline in wholesale. 
On a product front, we continue to see success with our strategic move toward providing a complete 4-season offering. As evidence, our all-weather Mountain Edition footwear styles were all top sellers, and we've already seen significant sell-in for 2016 for these styles as well. We're also seeing success with our Mountain Edition weatherized apparel, further extending our brand beyond footwear. And our collaborations, including one with Vans and The North Face, are reinforcing our commitment to blending street style and performance in innovative products and really showing the consumer the strength of the VF portfolio. 
True to our off-the-wall culture, we continue to redefine new ways to connect with our consumers. During the fourth quarter, our PROPELLER skateboarding film saw great success and was one of iTunes' top 10 documentaries of the year, not to mention Transworld Skateboarding's film of the year. Vans was also recently named the #1 sneaker brand on Instagram, our young consumers' #1 social platform. These are great wins for the brand and great testament to keeping our core consumer at the center of everything we do."

During the quarter, we had several strong collaborations worth highlighting. Our second collaboration with Disney was really well received by consumers across footwear, apparel and accessories. The Vans TNF products sold out in a number of places across Europe, and the Vans Pendleton collection helped elevate our weatherized offering with great success. In our core Classics collection, we have seen higher-than-normal inventory levels. And even though we are performing better than our competition in this category, we do anticipate a more challenging sales environment in 2016 as this product works through the channel. The good news is that our brand health metrics have never been as strong, and our other product categories are selling through extremely well. 
In Asia, Vans grew more than 20%, driven by almost 40% D2C growth and a high teen increase in our wholesale business. Our House of Vans brand experience proved to be incredible for both the brand and our consumers. We took this experience on tour to 14 cities throughout the year and connected with thousands of fans. We also launched our Monkey Rules campaign for the Chinese New Year, and the response shows that this is a winner."

Looking at 2016, we'll be focused on continuing to expand the brand's relevance, updating classic silhouettes and introducing new styles and collections for the ever-changing global consumer. 
Also, Vans will celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2016. We definitely have unique products and experiences planned to keep consumers engaged and connected as we celebrate our authentic heritage. 
Regionally in 2016, we're expecting continued strength with double-digit growth in both the Americas and Asia businesses, which represent about 75% of the total. However, due to the factors KH spoke about, revenues could be down slightly in Europe. Our 26% growth expectation for Vans globally looks to be up in the high single-digit range. 
Now on to Timberland, where global revenues were up 1% on a currency-neutral basis, with slight growth in D2C, partially offset by relatively flat wholesale sales. Excluding FX and the 53rd week, fourth quarter revenue was up 5%. Similar to The North Face, Timberland was impacted by warm weather in the quarter, too. In the Americas, revenues was down at a low single-digit rate. And of course, we're comping against the 53rd week, so normalized rates are higher. Strategically, we continue to see great response to our efforts to evolve the perception of our outdoor lifestyle positioning. 
Looking at product. Boots were a strong performer during the quarter, led by both Classics and women's silhouettes. In fact, boots were strong across men's, women's and kids. And beyond just boots, we're continuing to gain traction in some of our more casual styles, such as our men's Britton Hill collection, which had a tremendous sell-through in our D2C channel. And in fact, the advertised style completely sold out. So clearly, great momentum there. 
We've also made significant progress in the women's business, especially in North America, and created a new generation of brand loyalists who love the style, fit and craftsmanship of the Amston and the Glancy. Early days, but super promising and much more coming. 
On the marketing front, we continue to connect with the outdoor lifestyler consumer. During the quarter, our Made for the Modern Trail campaign came to life across print, digital and social media, driving awareness for our Black Forest collection. All in, our consumer impressions were up 50% at 1.25 billion over last year. The PRO Boondock and Powertrain collections saw nice growth in the quarter, and it's clear that we're meeting consumers' needs for footwear that helps them get the job done. The PRO platform continues to be a great living laboratory for learning, testing and introducing new comfort and durability innovations that are very easily translated back into our casual lifestyle product."

This 360-degree effort enabled us to integrate classic and digital marketing efforts. It also allowed us to team up with our wholesale partners, giving us very visible and unique consumer touch points. 
Turning to Asia. Revenues were up -- revenues were down slightly, impacted by softer traffic in Hong Kong and Singapore, specifically. And despite unusually warm weather for the region, we were encouraged by the strength of our lightweight outerwear, which grew double digits.

A low single-digit increase in Lee revenue was offset by a low single-digit decline in Wrangler revenue. At Wrangler, our mass business showed solid growth with a mid-single-digit increase in revenues. This was more than offset by declines in the brand's Western Specialty business, where the regions challenged by the contraction in oil and gas exploration are hardest hit. 
From a product perspective, we're successfully expanding the Advanced Comfort line into casuals and warmer-weather product. Additionally, we're working to address the needs of everyday consumers as the outdoor and active categories converge with outdoor-inspired casual solutions and versatile fabrics and functional design aesthetics. 
We also had a very strong launch of our Cool Vantage product in our Western platform. We do expect the positive momentum that Wrangler realized in 2015 to continue into 2016 as we introduce new products with innovative fabrics that satisfy unmet consumer needs. 
On to Lee. We once again saw growth in this business during the quarter with the Americas growing in the low single digits. We're seeing strong response for both male and female consumers to our new performance fabrications and are excited to introduce even more advanced fabrication offerings in the coming year, including improved breathability and comfort innovations. We have also made great strides as we work to enhance our presence in department stores, clubs and e-commerce. And we are pleased to have grown nicely in 2015.

In Asia, despite uncertain economic conditions, our Lee business had another solid quarter, with revenue up at the low double-digit rate and very strong profit growth. We're truly becoming a leader in the premium denim segment in Asia, driven by our innovations, such as our Jade Fusion line and meaningful consumer activations throughout the region.

On today's call, you've heard recurrent themes, including things we can't impact, like record warm weather, strengthening of the U.S. dollar, the 53rd week of 2014 and a softer retail environment. You've also heard us refer to things we can impact, like operational and fiscal discipline; executing strategic initiatives; and ultimately, how our strengths and agility give us the unique ability to deliver consistent shareholder returns in an uneven environment. 
With both sides of this coin in play, let's review our fourth quarter results, and I'll do my best to filter through the noise to illustrate an apples-to-apples story that tells the true performance of VF's model. 
Starting at the top, revenue was down 1% on a currency-neutral basis. Or if you normalize for the 53rd week, it was up 3%. This included relative strength in our Outdoor & Action Sports, Jeanswear, international and direct-to-consumer businesses. 
Gross margin came in at 49% on a constant -- on a currency-neutral basis, equal to last year. Reported gross margin was down 70 basis points to 48.3%. And to walk you through the puts and takes, benefits from changes in mix and favorable product costs were more than offset by foreign currency headwinds and aggressive efforts to manage inventory among our brands with greatest exposure to cold weather. As you would expect, we responded quickly with respect to inventory, an effort that enabled us to finish the quarter with levels up just under 9%. For context, nearly half of that 9% increase is related specifically to cold weather-related product, and it's important to note that the composition of this inventory is good. It's core product that's already slated for our fall '16 line. So while inventory levels will remain a bit higher than we'd like for the first half of 2016, we expect them to normalize in the second half of the year. 
Earlier, Steve gave a quick overview of our Contemporary Brands coalition. Suffice it to say that it was a disappointing year for our business, one in which we fell short of our expectations. As a result, the fair values of 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss brands were determined to be below their respective carrying values. Therefore, we have recorded $144 million pretax noncash impairment charge in the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets of these brands. After tax, this was a $97 million charge or $0.23 of diluted EPS. 
Adjusted SG&A, that is excluding the impairment charge, was down 40 basis points in the quarter, demonstrating our disciplined approach to offsetting continued investments in D2C, demand creation and innovation, with operating leverage and expense control. Excluding the impairment charge, adjusted operating income was down 6% and adjusted operating margin was 15.8% compared with 16.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014. On a reported basis, operating income was 11.6% compared to 5.1% last year. 
And finally, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.95 compared to $0.98 in the same period of 2015. Adjusted currency-neutral EPS was up 5%. And if you exclude FX and the 53rd week, fourth quarter adjusted EPS was up 12%. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share was $0.72, up significantly over last year's fourth quarter. 
Turning now to the full year. 2015 revenue grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis. Excluding the 53rd week, revenue increased 7%. Highlights included 9% growth in both our Outdoor & Action Sports and international businesses and 7% growth in our direct-to-consumer business, which comped positively for the full year. Apples to apples, Outdoor & Action Sports and D2C were up 11% year-over-year. We also benefited from improved performance in our Jeanswear coalition, which, although it carries lower gross margins than VF's average, it's still our most profitable coalition. 
Gross margin was down 0.5 point to 48.3%. To walk you through the full year factors, our mix benefit was present but slightly less than that about 50 basis points we typically see due to improved Jeanswear performance and softer-than-expected D2C results. And while we did see expected tailwind -- the expected tailwind from lower product cost, our aggressive management of inventory offset this benefit. So that leaves us with FX, which negatively impacted our gross margin by 80 basis points. 
SG&A for the year, as a percentage of total revenue, was down 10 basis points due to the same discipline we exhibited in the fourth quarter. That is offsetting investments in our fastest-growing businesses and strategic priorities by maintaining strong cost controls across other areas in the organization. Excluding the impairment charge, adjusted currency-neutral operating income was unchanged at $1.8 billion and operating margin was 14.6% in 2015 compared with 14.9% in the prior year. Taking into account the 70 basis point foreign currency hit, we achieved an operating margin of 15.3% in spite of top line pressure. On a reported basis, full year operating income was $1.7 billion in 2015, and operating margin was 13.4% compared with 11.7% in 2014. 
So that brings us to full year adjusted EPS, which was $3.08, in line with 2014's result. On a currency-neutral basis, EPS was up 12%. Now at the end of year 3 of our 5-year plan, we've averaged 13% EPS growth annually, which is right in line with our long term guidance. On a GAAP basis, full year EPS was up 20% to $2.85. 
We ended the year with a strong balance sheet and a capital structure that continues to afford us great flexibility. In 2015, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations and returned nearly $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Turning now to 2016. While we do expect some challenges to continue in the near term, we remain as confident as ever in our ability to deliver long-term profitable growth and returns to our shareholders. And here's why. Our portfolio of brands, with its diversity of consumer, geography and channel, is supported by a deep arsenal of P&L levers, including strategic investments, focused operational discipline and a world-class supply chain, all of which deliver superior cash flow. Working in concert, these strengths will allow us the flexibility necessary to emerge even stronger coming out of 2016. We expect revenue in 2016 to grow at a mid-single-digit percentage rate, including about a 1% impact from a stronger U.S. dollar. On both a reported and currency-neutral basis, our plans include growth in every region as well as in our wholesale and D2C channels. 
By coalition, revenue for Outdoor & Action Sports is expected to increase at a high single-digit rate, with similar increases for Vans and Timberland and mid-single-digit growth for The North Face brand. In Jeanswear, we expect the momentum to continue with mid-single-digit revenue growth. And to round it out, we're expecting low single-digit growth for Imagewear, a slight decline in Sportswear and mid-single-digit decline in Contemporary Brands business. We expect momentum in the international and direct-to-consumer business to continue in 2016. International revenue is expected to be up at a high single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis or mid-single digits on a reported basis. 
By region, in Europe, we expect mid-single-digit increase in currency-neutral revenues up low single-digit reported. In our Asia Pacific region, currency-neutral revenue should be up a low double-digit percentage rate or up high single-digit reported. And in our Americas non-U.S. business, we're expecting revenue to grow at a low-teen percentage rate on a currency-neutral basis or up low single digits reported. 
Our D2C business should accelerate in 2016 with revenues expected to be up at a low double-digit currency-neutral rate with about 1 point of negative impact due to changes in FX. For the year, we expect to increase our total store count to about 1,600 doors compared with 1,520 at the end of 2015. Comp sales growth are expected to grow at a mid-single-digit rate, including growth of more than 20% in e-commerce. 
On now to gross margin. We expect 2016 gross margin rate to improve by 50 basis points to reach 48.8% or 49.5% on a currency-neutral basis. To click down into the drivers, we estimate a combination of product cost and pricing benefits to be equally offset by 70 basis points of FX headwinds. That leaves 50 basis points of mix benefit to flow through as Outdoor & Action Sports, international and D2C continue to drive gross margin expansion. 
In terms of SG&A, we will continue to make strategic investments in our brands with respect to product innovation and demand creation as well as investing in our growing D2C business. In addition to store openings, we continue to make significant investments in our e-commerce capabilities, specifically bringing additional brands onto the common VF platform. These investments, along with continued pressure from foreign currency rate changes, should result in a modest increase in our SG&A ratio in 2016. This brings us to operating margin, which we anticipate to reach 14.4% in 2016, net of an anticipated 70 basis points of foreign currency impact. 
Moving to the bottom line. We expect currency-neutral EPS to be up 11% in 2016, or up 5% reported, compared to the adjusted EPS of $3.08 in 2015. 
And as you think about the cadence of revenue and earnings, there's a few things to keep in mind. In the first quarter of 2016, we expect currency-neutral revenue to be about flat with the first quarter of 2015. With respect to earnings, recall that in the first quarter of 2015, we recorded a onetime $17 million gain related to the sale of a VF outlet store. Additionally, we expect that the first quarter will see the most difficult FX comparison of the year with an estimated 120 basis point negative hit to gross margin. Therefore, we anticipate currency-neutral EPS to be about flat or down low double digits as reported. 
In the second quarter of 2016, revenue should increase at a low single-digit percentage rate with a low single-digit decline in currency-neutral EPS or high single-digit as reported. Recall that last year's second quarter benefited from a significantly lower tax rate related to the settlement of prior year's tax audits. Currency-neutral revenue growth in the second half of 2016 should increase at a high single-digit percentage rate with the strongest performance coming in the fourth quarter. We expect second half EPS to increase at a mid- to high teen percentage rate. 
Our outlook for cash from operations remains very strong as we expect to generate $1.3 billion in 2016. And finally, our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders has never been more evident. In 2016, we expect our share buyback to reach about $1 billion, which is a meaningful increase over the prior year. 
And to echo what Eric said earlier, this increase is in response to cash flow generation and our commitment to shareholders, not an indication that we are changing our capital allocation priorities. In fact, our first priority remains acquisition. And as previously mentioned, our intention is to take a much more proactive approach to our portfolio composition this year. So share buyback, combined with our annual dividend, should return $1.5 billion of cash to our shareholders in 2016. That's a 15% increase in shareholder returns over 2015. 
In closing, I'd like to underscore that we are very proud of what we've accomplished in 2015. All global companies operate in a constantly changing environment. We've demonstrated time and time again our ability to effectively manage our business under a variety of conditions. This speaks to the agility of the VF model. We are highly confident that the power of our portfolio, along with numerous flexible levers, will enable us to drive revenue growth and profitability, mitigate risk, and most importantly, create value for our shareholders. 
And with that, we'll turn it back over to the operator and open it up for your questions."

I'll start trying to tackle your questions. So where was the biggest -- well, what caused the big miss? And you're right, we haven't had change like that to our expectations happen before to that degree of magnitude. As you know, from looking at all the retailers who are reporting, there was a significant slowdown in consumer spending from what everyone expected in the fourth quarter. So that hit everybody in all categories. It particularly hit cold-weather apparel and footwear, and that's a big piece of our business. So we were unusually impacted by it. And we came out of it with only 9% more inventory. And the implications of that were we understand the kind [ph] of inventory was probably not the right thing to do, so we aggressively got rid of it, and that affected our earnings. That was a big driver of the earnings miss, was the investment we made to end the year with only 9% more inventory than last year. So it was that combination that got to the EPS miss that we had. We think that was a smarter choice than getting closer to our guided EPS and ending the year with significant excess inventory. The -- how we're looking at next year? Scott guided -- gave pretty clear guidance to how we're seeing the first half, which suggests that there is an inventory overhang out there. Some vendors have it. We have a little bit of it. Scott mentioned that about half of 9% was in outdoor and cold-weather products. So that's going to slow things down here in the first half. And then as we approach the second half, we're cautious in our outlook for next winter's weather and consumer behavior, more cautious than we have been in the past. We have the early part of that season booked, and that's reflected in our guidance, and we're coming up against really easy numbers for us to beat, unless maybe it's going to be 80 degrees in New York next winter, I don't know. But unless -- if -- I think the odds are that the winter weather will be a little kinder around the world to us. So with a cautious outlook and really easy numbers to lap, that's where -- why we are more confident about the growth in the second half and we're off the growth rates we've had. But we've said during the call, we've been averaging 7% a year for the last couple of years, and we're calling it mid-single digits until we see how this plays out. I think your last question was anything post- all this that we learned about the consumers? And I don't know that we have. There were interesting product categories that slowed down. And most of the material impact for us was weather-related. We really hit our cold-weather brands. I'm looking on the table to see if anybody has more insight than I do on that, but I don't think there's any macro trends that we're seeing other than consumer spending is a little soft. And we think that will continue -- our expectations for 2016 assumes that, that continues through the first half of the year."

I'd also like to remind everyone, unless otherwise noted, amounts that our participants refer to on today's call will be predominately in currency-neutral terms, which we've defined in the press release that was issued at 6:55 Eastern this morning. We've chosen these currency-neutral amounts as the lead number in our discussions we feel it more accurately represents the true operational performance and underlying results of our business and brands. You may also hear us refer to reported amounts, which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These amounts include the impact of the foreign currency exchange rates. Reconciliation of GAAP measures to currency-neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial information included within the press release, which identify and qualify all excluded items.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2016 earnings call. At VF, delivering consistent, long-term value to shareholders by creating sustainable, profitable growth for our brands is at the heart of what we do every business day. To do this, we leverage our business model, which consists of powerful brands, powerful platforms, a healthy balance sheet and uniquely talented team. This foundation enables us to continually and successfully benefit from our key growth drivers, which include driving best-in-class product innovation, provide exceptional consumer engagement and leveraging our operational expertise to manage the growth potential for our brands and for our shareholders. We challenge ourselves and each other to operate our business with nothing less than excellence across our brands and channels. And we do that in a responsible way. Long term, consistent achievement is what's made VF an industry leader and what will enable us to remain successful for years to come. 
In the first quarter, we've delivered results that were right in line with our expectations, and yes, our first quarter performance puts us right on track to meet our goals for 2016. Our currency-neutral -- on a currency-neutral basis, revenue was up 2%, driven by 4% growth from our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition, with strong growth from The North Face and, as expected, moderate growth in Vans and Timberland. Likewise, Jeanswear was up 4%, with both Wrangler and Lee posting increases during the quarter. 
In terms of our fastest-growing brand this quarter, or should I say brands, it's a tie between The North Face and Kipling, each with 8% currency-neutral growth. Kudos to the teams at The North Face and Kipling who delivered for us in the quarter. 
The real strength in the quarter came from our direct-to-consumer business, which was up 8% and included a low single-digit comp. What this tells us is that our brands and products are resonating strongly with consumers who are happy to show their approval by buying. However, our wholesale business is still navigating through the inventory carryover from what was a challenging fourth quarter at retail in general. 
Our international sales were up 4% overall, with Europe up 2%, Asia up 6% and our non-U.S. Americas region growing 12%. On a reported basis, gross margin was down about 80 basis points for the quarter. We continue to see a benefit from pricing, lower product costs and a favorable sales mix shift. But as expected, this was more than offset by negative impact from changes in foreign currency. That said, we continue to expect that we'll expand gross margin for the year. This speaks to our portfolio's overall brand strength and supply chain excellence. 
For the quarter, currency-neutral earnings per share were in line with last year. And despite a flat start to the year for the bottom line, we continue to expect that EPS will increase 11% on a currency-neutral basis in 2016. Looking ahead, our brands remain strong. We continue to execute well, and we're taking the necessary steps to ensure that our portfolio is optimally positioned for growth and to enhance shareholder value during the long term. 
Now before I turn it over to Steve, I'll remind you what I said on our last call with respect to be active portfolio managers with an increased focus on ensuring our business is optimally positioned. To that end, we recently announced that we're exploring strategic alternatives for our Licensed Sports Group within our Imagewear coalition. That process is ongoing, and we'll be sure to update you when we have something to report. Steve?"

Currency-neutral revenue was up 4% in the fourth quarter -- first quarter, driven by a low teen increase in D2C and flat wholesale results. Sluggish traffic and the hangover from the warmer-than-normal weather once again influenced our cold-weather brands. That said, overall, we're pleased with how the quarter played out for the coalition. 
Let's take a look at VF's 3 largest Outdoor & Action Sports brands. Globally, first quarter revenue for The North Face was up 8% with strong mid-teen growth in D2C and low single-digit growth in wholesale. In the Americas region, revenue was up at a low single-digit rate with a low teen increase in D2C, including strong e-commerce results. On the wholesale side, sales were down at a mid-single-digit rate as retailers continued to do manage through inventories remaining from the difficult fourth quarter of last year. Within the quarter, there was a tale of 2 cities. With a cold start in the first half of the quarter, we saw success in our top 10 outerwear styles, which, as a group, was up mid-single-digits. In the second half, when the weather turned wet and springlike, we saw strength in our rainwear business led by FuseForm styles and the venture jacket. Other warm weather categories turned in nicely as well. In particular, our Mountain Athletics Training Collection and women's business, which continues to build momentum. Overall, the strength of these categories demonstrates our ability to achieve increased spring relevancy with consumers. 
During the quarter, The North Face launched the second installment of its Made in U.S.A. apparel line called the Backyard Project. This collection is completely designed, sourced, and produced in the United States. This uniquely local, relevant product driven by targeted media coverage has generated significant exposure, and although is off a small base, really scaling up production to nearly 15x in only the second year.

And really important to point out that this growth was widespread, from double-digit growth in D2C and wholesale to double-digit growth in the U.K., Italy, France, Spain and the Nordic region. 
In Asia, first quarter revenue increased at the high single-digit rate, driven by double-digit growth in the wholesale business and the mid-single-digit increase in DTC.

It's important to note that these results are in line with what we expected in February, the direct result of our choice to strategically reduce wholesale shipments on certain classic styles predominantly in Europe as we manage retailer seats to match otherwise healthy consumer demand. As we've indicated previously, the short -- this should be a short-term workthrough. It's not a brand, product or consumer issue. And accordingly, we expect growth to normalize in the second half for Vans. 
Now before we discuss specific regions, I do want to congratulate Vans on their 50th anniversary and thank the entire Vans family for 5 decades of an Off The Wall ethos that defines youth culture. On March 16, the brand kicked off a worldwide celebration to mark this event. Vans utilized multiple global advertising tactics, including promotional events and communication platforms backed by a new visual campaign with a fresh look that explains the brand's 50-year journey and the meaning of living Off The Wall. 75,000 people around the world attended 10 House of Vans events featuring music, art, action sports and creative workshops. And of course, Vans launched a number of products, including a gold pack of classic footwear and a range of apparel. Social media exploded with Vans 50th rising to the top as a trending topic on Instagram, Twitter and SnapChat. 
Now back to the geographies. In the Americas, in line with our expectations, revenue was up a high-single-digit rate with an impressive near 20% increase in D2C, including over 30% growth in e-commerce. This was offset by a slight decline in wholesale results. During the quarter, we launched our most innovative shoe ever, the AV rapid HealthPro. The shoe was cocreated with Vans Pro skater and Thrasher Magazine Skater of the Year, Anthony Van England. Using the Vans' heritage-inspired lace-up low-top, the show is engineered for advanced performance using innovative construction methods to improve comfort, increase flexibility and reduce overall weight. 
And of course, how could we not mention Daniel, as in Damn Daniel, as in Damn Daniel, which is, as you can imagine, did have a strong impact on the sales of White Vans, which saw 100% sell-through in both retail and D2C and wholesale channel. The national media attention the brand received is a wild demonstration of our creative expression, youth culture and loyalty can conspire to cause a phenomenon. Well done, Daniel. Well done. 
We also announced that Vans has renewed its title sponsorship of the U.S. Open of Surfing in Huntington Beach, California through 2018, one of the most preeminent action sports events in the country."

In Asia, Vans revenue was up at the low double-digit rate, driven by 25% D2C growth and a mid-single-digit increase in our wholesale business. Our Chinese New Year product, Monkey Pack, achieved strong sell-through in our D2C channel. The marketing anniversary, House of Vans events were held in Hong Kong, Seoul, Malaysia and Shanghai.

Our first quarter results were in line with our expectation. And despite the uneven retail environment we've seen across industry, VF's diversity, operational discipline and strong connection with consumers continues to give us great flexibility to deliver on our financial commitments. First quarter currency-neutral revenue was up 2% to $2.8 billion and included growth in 7 of our 10 largest brands. By coalition, Outdoor & Action Sports and Jeanswear, when combined, were more than 80% of the quarter's revenue, with each growing 4% on a currency-neutral basis. This was offset by a 4% decline in Imagewear and ongoing weakness in Sportswear and Contemporary Brands. By channel, direct-to-consumer revenue was up 8%, including low double-digit growth in our Outdoor & Action Sports business and weaker-than-expected Sportswear and Contemporary Brand results. Currency-neutral wholesale revenue was down 1%, reflecting the expected rightsizing of retail inventories we spoke about on the February call. By region, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific businesses each posted gains in the quarter. 
Gross margin was down 80 basis points to 48.2%. Benefits from pricing, lower product cost and favorable mix shift were more than offset by FX and inventory management actions, particularly in Sportswear and Contemporary Brands. 
In line with our expectations, SG&A, as a percentage of revenues, delevered by 130 basis points as we continued to invest in our key growth priorities, including D2C, product innovation and demand creation. 
First quarter operating margin was 11.8%, which included 90 basis points of negative impact from currency. And on a comp basis, keep in mind that last year's first quarter included a onetime gain on sale of a VF Outlet location. 
Clicking down into profitability by coalition, we see that we reported Outdoor & Action Sports operating income was down 13% and operating margin was 13.9%, a decrease of 230 basis points compared with last year's first quarter. More than half of that operating margin decrease was due to foreign currency changes as the majority of the coalition's business in the first quarter was outside of the U.S. 
Operating income in Jeanswear was up 4% in the quarter with operating margin up 40 basis points to 19.3%, driven by benefits from cost controls and favorable FX. The strength in Jeanswear continues globally, and we are very pleased with this, our sixth consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit revenue growth. 
Imagewear profit was up slightly and operating margin was up 80 basis points due to favorable mix of business and changes in FX. 
In Sportswear, operating income was down more than 60%, and the story remains the same, challenging department store and D2C conditions, along with the strategies we're employing to improve future profitability are impacting current results. And finally, Contemporary Brands saw more than a 50% drop in profitability as the sector remains challenging. 
So carrying all this to the bottom line, our reported earnings per share was $0.61 in the first quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, EPS was in line with last year's same period. Also to note, we elected to early adopt recent accounting rules related to the tax treatment of equity compensation, a change which yielded about $0.03 of benefit in the current quarter. 
Regarding our balance sheet. Inventories were up 9%, of which about half is cold-weather product that we are carrying forward to fill demand in the back half of the year. So all in all, very similar story to the fourth quarter. 
During the first quarter, we bought 11.3 million shares of our own stock for $714 million. There are about 19 million shares remaining under the current authorization, more than enough to accommodate our intent to repurchase about $1 billion of shares in 2016. 
Turning now to outlook. There is no change to the full year targets that we detailed on our February call. Revenue, up single digits. Gross margin, up 50 basis points, reaching 48.8%. Operating margin at 14.4%. And currency-neutral EPS, up 11% or up 5% on a reported basis against 2015's adjusted EPS of $3.08. 
So how should you think about the cadence for the first half and the full year? All in, we're expecting first half revenue to be flat on a reported basis or up at a low single-digit percentage rate, currency neutral. Based on what we said in February, reported half -- reported first half EPS should be $0.95, which is down at a low double-digit rate or down low single digits currency neutral. This reflects continued weakness in Sportswear and contemporary and our continued investment in our strategic growth drivers, which pressures earnings, given the relatively lower first half revenues. 
Recall that the second quarter 2015 benefited from a lower tax rate related primarily to the settlement of prior year's tax audits worth about $0.02 in EPS. 
We continue to expect currency-neutral revenue growth in the second half of 2016 to be up at a high single-digit percentage rate with the strongest performance coming in the fourth quarter. And finally, we expect second half reported EPS to increase at a mid-teen percentage rate or up high teens on a currency-neutral basis. 
In closing, as I stated earlier, our business model provides the operating flexibility necessary to deliver top line growth and profitability despite and an uneven retail environment. Our entire team remains steadfastly focused on our strategic growth drivers, including product innovation, consumer engagement and D2C expansion. This focus, coupled with a healthy balance sheet, powerful brands, a strong operating platform and exceptional execution capabilities, give us the confidence to maintain our 2016 outlook and to deliver on our long-term financial targets. 
And now with that, we'll turn it back over to the operator and open up the call for questions."

And why we're so confident is really 3 things. Our new products. I talked about the AV rapid All-Pro, but also innovations in our authentic collections, classics collections. We continue to see great growth in our Skate High and Old Skool group of products. It's really resonating with consumers. Now this quarter, we ramped up demand creation, and we saw a really great impact of the 50th anniversary promotional cadence as well as the events along with that. And I think -- we continue to see significant digital connectivity with this brand and its loyal consumer base. Things like Damn Daniel just don't happen by accident. That's years of building a loyal consumer base and having them really come to life and tell our story through their own words is very, very powerful. And then the success of our D2C model, as I mentioned at the beginning. There is one drag on our brand, it's EMEA. And we talked about that last quarter. And that's really wholesale inventory as we get that rightsized. But I think our DTC business there in Europe was up mid-teens. Our e-commerce business was up 30%. So again, another great example of a brand resonating with consumer and working through some channel partners issues, which we've talked about being rightsized by the second half. And I'd be remiss if I didn't say our Asia business continues to grow very, very strong, up low double digits with D2C trending plus 25%. They're connecting with their consumer, growing that loyal consumer base. And again, Van Super Brand Day, that doesn't happen with many brands. That really speaks to the power of this brand and the recognition of our partnership that this brand is good with them as well."

And the good news is, when they think about it, strong, authentic brands that offer a decent price-value equation are what they're drawn to. And we've got a portfolio of those. So we think this environment is good for us to the extent that we were very competitive in that environment. The interesting thing going on right now is around the retailers that we sell to, who are demonstrating very conservative behavior around buying. And that's why you see this big disconnect right now between our direct-to-consumer numbers, which are, quite frankly, very strong and our wholesale numbers, which are, quite frankly, weak. And it's a part in inventory build in part for consumers moving to a buy now, wear now. The consumers are buying closer to the need as are retailers. So that's changing the cadence of our bookings. Unfortunately, with our supply chain excellence, we're going to be able to respond to that demand when it comes. And we're pretty confident about that. I can't predict what the future is going to be with consumers, but I can predict that we're going to be able to deliver the kinds of numbers we put forward in our plans."

The bankruptcies, of course, we're not going to comment on any one particular account, but we're still watching to see how this develops. I think there's a lot of uncertainty right now on what the ultimate outcome is. We felt it -- well, in the long term, this is probably a net positive for us and for our brands. There could be some turmoil in the short term. As it relates to the year, too, in the first quarter -- we have seen some impact in the first quarter. And we've taken what we can see for the balance of the year. No year evolves exactly as you expect. And when you look at bankruptcies individually, it's not significant to VF. We talked about accounting change in the first quarter, which is a positive. We've got puts and takes, which are developing. For VF in total, given the fact that we're sitting in the first quarter, we've got 80% of the year to go. We don't see that as fundamentally changing our outlook for the full year."

On the other hand, we've absorbed the impact of bankruptcies in the first quarter and through the balance of the year. We talked about our Sportswear CBC business being a little bit weaker through the first quarter.

These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC. 
I'd also like to remind everyone, unless otherwise noted, amounts that our participants refer to on today's call will be predominately in currency-neutral terms, which we've defined in the press release that was issued at 6:55 Eastern this morning. We've chosen these currency-neutral amounts as the lead number in our discussions because we feel it more accurately represents the true operational performance and underlying results of our business and brands. You may also hear us refer to reported amounts, which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These amounts include the impact of the foreign currency exchange rates. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to currency-neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial information included within the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items. 
On today's call, you may also hear us reference to 'Damn Daniel', which is most certainly not meant as profanity, but instead a nod to a video that 2 California high school kids put together with great reverence for the Vans brand.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2016 earnings call. At VF, delivering consistent, long-term value to shareholders by creating sustainable, profitable growth for our brands is at the heart of what we do every business day. To do this, we leverage our business model, which consists of powerful brands, powerful platforms, a healthy balance sheet and a uniquely talented team.
This foundation enables us to continually and successfully benefit from our key growth drivers, which include driving best-in-class product innovation, provide an exceptional consumer engagement and leveraging our operational expertise to manage the growth potential for our brands and for our shareholders. We challenge ourselves and each other to operate our business with nothing less than excellence across our brands and channels, and we do that in a responsible way. Long-term consistent achievement is what's made VF an industry leader and what will enable us to remain successful for years to come. 
In the first quarter, we delivered results that were right in line with our expectations; and, yes, our first quarter performance puts us right on track to meet our goals for 2016. Our currency-neutral -- on a currency-neutral basis, revenue was up 2%, driven by 4% growth from our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition, with strong growth from The North Face and, as expected, moderate growth in Vans and Timberland. Likewise, Jeanswear was up 4%, with both Wrangler and Lee posting increases during the quarter. 
In terms of our fastest-growing brand this quarter, or should I say brands, it's a tie between The North Face and Kipling, each with 8% currency-neutral growth. Kudos to the teams at The North Face and Kipling who delivered for us in the quarter. 
The real strength in the quarter came from our direct-to-consumer business, which was up 8% and included a low single-digit comp. What this tells us is that our brands and products are resonating strongly with consumers who are happy to show their approval by buying. However, our wholesale business is still navigating through the inventory carryover from what was a challenging fourth quarter at retail in general. 
Our international sales were up 4% overall, with Europe up 2%, Asia up 6% and our non-U.S. Americas region growing 12%. On a reported basis, gross margin was down about 80 basis points for the quarter. We continue to see a benefit from pricing, lower product costs and a favorable sales mix shift; but as expected, this was more than offset by negative impact from changes in foreign currency. That said, we continue to expect that we will expand gross margin for the year. This speaks to our portfolio's overall brand strength and supply chain excellence. 
For the quarter, currency-neutral earnings per share were in line with last year. And despite a flat start to the year for the bottom line, we continue to expect that EPS will increase 11% on a currency-neutral basis in 2016. Looking ahead, our brands remain strong. We continue to execute well, and we're taking the necessary steps to ensure that our portfolio is optimally positioned for growth and to enhance shareholder value during the long term. 
Now before I turn it over to Steve, I'll remind you what I said on our last call with respect to being active portfolio managers with an increased focus on ensuring our business is optimally positioned. To that end, we recently announced that we're exploring strategic alternatives for our Licensed Sports Group within our Imagewear coalition. That process is ongoing, and we'll be sure to update you when we have something to report. Steve?"

Currency-neutral revenue was up 4% in the fourth quarter -- first quarter, driven by a low teen increase in D2C and flat wholesale results. Sluggish traffic and the hangover from the warmer-than-normal weather once again influenced our cold weather brands. That said, overall, we're pleased with how the quarter played out for the coalition. 
Let's take a look at VF's 3 largest Outdoor & Action Sports brands. Globally, first quarter revenue for The North Face was up 8% with strong mid-teen growth in D2C and low single-digit growth in wholesale. In the Americas region, revenue was up at a low single-digit rate, with a low teen increase in D2C, including strong e-commerce results. On the wholesale side, sales were down at a mid-single-digit rate, as retailers continued to do manage through inventories remaining from the difficult fourth quarter of last year.
Within the quarter, there was a tale of 2 cities. With a cold start in the first half of the quarter, we saw success in our top 10 outerwear styles, which, as a group, was up mid-single digits. In the second half, when the weather turned wet and spring-like, we saw strength in our rainwear business, led by FuseForm styles and the Venture jacket. Other warm weather categories turned in nicely as well. In particular, our Mountain Athletics Training collection in women's business, which continues to build momentum. Overall, the strength of these categories demonstrates our ability to achieve increased spring relevancy with consumers. 
During the quarter, The North Face launched the second installment of its Made in the U.S.A. apparel line called the Backyard Project. This collection is completely designed, sourced and produced in the United States. This uniquely local, relevant product driven by targeted media coverage has generated significant exposure. And although is off a small base, we're really scaling up production to nearly 15x in only the second year.

And really important to point out that this growth was widespread, from double-digit growth in D2C and wholesale to double-digit growth in the U.K., Italy, France, Spain and the Nordic Region. In Asia, first quarter revenue increased at a high single-digit rate, driven by double-digit growth in the wholesale business and a mid-single-digit increase in DTC. 
We launched fast hiking products, featuring the super lightweight FuseForm waterproof jacket as well as the circular-knit functional T-shirt and the 2-in-1 athletic pants. We believe these fast hiking initiatives will strengthen our relationship with current consumers, attract new ones and overall further establish our leadership position in the outdoor industry.

It's important to note that these results are in line with what we expected in February, the direct result of our choice to strategically reduce wholesale shipments on certain classic styles predominantly in Europe, as we manage retailer receipts to match otherwise healthy consumer demand. As we've indicated previously, the short -- this should be a short-term work-through. It's not a brand, product or consumer issue. And accordingly, we expect growth to normalize in the second half for Vans. 
Now before we discuss specific regions, I do want to congratulate Vans on their 50th anniversary and thank the entire Vans family for 5 decades of an Off The Wall ethos that defines youth culture. On March 16, the brand kicked off a worldwide celebration to mark this golden event. Vans utilized multiple global advertising tactics, including promotional events and communication platforms backed by a new visual campaign with a fresh creative look that explains the brand's 50-year journey and the meaning of living Off The Wall. 75,000 people around the world attended 10 House of Vans events featuring music, art, action sports and creative workshops. And of course, Vans launched a number of products, including a gold pack of classic footwear and a range of apparel. Social media exploded with Vans 50th rising to the top as a trending topic on Instagram, Twitter and SnapChat. 
Now back to the geographies. In the Americas, in line with our expectations, revenue was up at a high single-digit rate with an impressive near 20% increase in D2C, including over 30% growth in e-commerce. This was offset by a slight decline in wholesale results. During the quarter, we launched our most innovative Pro Skate shoe ever, the AV Rapidweld Pro. The shoe was co-created with Vans Pro skater and Thrasher Magazine Skater of the Year, Vans Anthony Van Engelen. Using the Vans' heritage-inspired lace-up low top, the show is engineered for advanced performance using innovative construction methods to improve comfort, increase flexibility and reduce overall weight. 
And of course, how could we not mention Daniel, as in 'Damn Daniel', as in 'Damn Daniel', which, as you can imagine, did have a strong impact on the sales of White Vans, which saw 100% sell-through in both retail D2C and wholesale channels. The national media attention the brand received is a wild demonstration of how creative expression, youth culture and loyalty can conspire to cause a phenomenon. Well done, Daniel. Well done. 
We also announced that Vans has renewed its title sponsorship of the U.S. Open of Surfing in Huntington Beach, California through 2018, one of the most preeminent action sports events in the country."

And to give more color in this, on our last call, we spoke about the proactive steps we are taking to manage through elevated inventory of the authentic style, which is part of the Classics collection. To be clear, this is really isolated to the authentic styles. In fact, 2 of the styles in the Classics collection, Old Skool and Sk8-Hi, were up strongly in the quarter. 
The anniversary celebrations across Europe, including major events in London, Paris, Milan and Berlin, drove strong momentum in D2C and our e-commerce business. In summary, progress is being made, and there's no change to the expectation that this will take a couple of more quarters in Europe for the wholesale business to normalize back to growth. 
In Asia, Vans revenue was up at the low double-digit rate, driven by 25% D2C growth and a mid-single-digit increase in our wholesale business. Our Chinese New Year product, Monkey pack, achieved strong sell-through in our D2C channel. To mark the anniversary, House of Vans events were held in Hong Kong, Seoul, Malaysia and Shanghai. 
Of special mention is a breakthrough e-commerce collaboration with China's Tmall, creating a Vans super brand day for our anniversary, an event that attracted more than 1 million unique visitors.

Another standout is men's Killington collection, featuring our SensorFlex comfort system. Even better, the Oxford style was #1, confirming that Timberland had increasingly greater permission to play in the warmer, drier months. 
On the marketing front, we continue to connect with our outdoor lifestyle consumer. Our spring media campaign showcases Timberland's unique combination of function and style, by pairing up the Britton Hill boot collection with our Mount Davis waxed canvas jackets. Strong demand for both collections continue to reinforce Timberland as a relevant brand for spring both inside and outside the city.
While we continue to see pressure in our industrial Timberland PRO business, one highlight is our Boondock boot collection, which caters to the construction market. This collection was up more than 40% versus last year, driven by the successful When Your Feet Hurt, Your Work Suffers campaign."

In the Americas region, Jeanswear revenue was up at a mid-single-digit rate, driven by the same increase in both the Wrangler and Lee brands. At Wrangler, our mass business remains strong with a mid-single-digit increase in revenue that marks the eighth consecutive quarter of growth for that business. 
These results were driven by innovation platforms extending into our seasonal businesses. Wrangler Advanced Comfort flat-front shorts with a 4-way flex technology and Riders by Lee Heavenly Touch Capris each saw meaningful increases in the channel. In contrast, and similar to results in the fourth quarter, we saw further declines in Wrangler's Western Specialty business, where challenges in oil and gas exploration continue to negatively impact that business. 
From a product perspective, we shipped our Cool Vantage innovation product in the Western platform and launched our Wrangler Ultimate Riding Jean Cool Vantage for women. This breakthrough sweat control technology works is 5x faster and pulls moisture outside the garment, which helps the consumer stay cool and dry even on the warmest days.

Given that, we'll now begin to lap this decline. We do expect the workwear business to stabilize in the second half of the year. 
Our Sportswear business was down 13% in the quarter because of traffic declines in both wholesale and D2C. Revenue at Nautica was down 14% due to ongoing challenges in the channel and our strategic decision to license the women's sleepwear and men's underwear businesses, worth about 6 points in the quarter; our decision to close unprofitable stores; and the reduction in wholesale sell-in to improve future profitability. 
Kipling's North America business was down 8% due to slower tourist traffic in D2C, including our outlets. Kipling's global business was up 8% driven by strength in both wholesale and D2C in Europe and Asia Pacific.

And despite the uneven retail environment we've seen across industry, VF's diversity, operational discipline and strong connection with consumers continues to give us great flexibili",943,"Thanks, Steve. Our first quarter results were in line with expectations. And despite the uneven retail environment we've seen across industry, VF's diversity, operational discipline and strong connection with consumers continues to give us great flexibility to deliver on our financial commitments.
First quarter currency-neutral revenue was up 2% to $2.8 billion and included growth in 7 of our 10 largest brands. By coalition, Outdoor & Action Sports and Jeanswear, when combined, were more than 80% of the quarter's revenue, with each growing 4% on a currency-neutral basis. This was offset by a 4% decline in Imagewear and ongoing weakness in Sportswear and Contemporary Brands.
By channel, direct-to-consumer revenue was up 8%, including low double-digit growth in our Outdoor & Action Sports business and weaker-than-expected Sportswear and Contemporary Brand results. Currency-neutral wholesale revenue was down 1%, reflecting the expected rightsizing of retail inventories we spoke about on the February call. By region, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific businesses each posted gains in the quarter. 
Gross margin was down 80 basis points to 48.2%. Benefits from pricing, lower product costs and favorable mix shift were more than offset by FX and inventory management actions, particularly in Sportswear and Contemporary Brands. In line with our expectations, SG&A, as a percentage of revenues, delevered by 130 basis points as we continued to invest in our key growth priorities, including D2C, product innovation and demand creation. 
First quarter operating margin was 11.8%, which included 90 basis points of negative impact from currency. And on a comp basis, keep in mind that last year's first quarter included a onetime gain on sale of a VF outlet location. 
Clicking down into profitability by coalition, we see that we reported Outdoor & Action Sports operating income was down 13% and operating margin was 13.9%, a decrease of 230 basis points compared with last year's first quarter. More than half of that operating margin decrease was due to foreign currency changes as the majority of the coalition's business in the first quarter was outside of the U.S. 
Operating income in Jeanswear was up 4% in the quarter with operating margin up 40 basis points to 19.3%, driven by benefits from cost controls and favorable FX. The strength in Jeanswear continues globally, and we are very pleased with this, our sixth consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit revenue growth. Imagewear profit was up slightly and operating margin was up 80 basis points due to favorable mix of business and changes in FX. 
In Sportswear, operating income was down more than 60%, and the story remains the same: Challenging department store and D2C conditions along with the strategies we're employing to improve future profitability are impacting current results. And finally, Contemporary Brands saw more than a 50% drop in profitability as the sector remains challenging. 
So carrying all this to the bottom line, our reported earnings per share was $0.61 in the first quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, EPS was in line with last year's same period. Also to note, we elected to early adopt recent accounting rules related to the tax treatment of equity compensation, a change which yielded about $0.03 of benefit in the current quarter. 
Regarding our balance sheet. Inventories were up 9%, of which about half is cold weather products that we are carrying forward to fill demand in the back half of the year. So all in all, very similar story to the fourth quarter.
During the first quarter, we bought 11.3 million shares of our own stock for $714 million. There are about 19 million shares remaining under the current authorization, more than enough to accommodate our intent to repurchase about $1 billion of shares in 2016. 
Turning now to outlook. There is no change to the full year targets that we detailed on our February call. Revenue, up single digits. Gross margin, up 50 basis points, reaching 48.8%. Operating margin at 14.4%. And currency-neutral EPS, up 11% or up 5% on a reported basis against 2015's adjusted EPS of $3.08. 
So how should you think about the cadence for the first half and the full year? All in, we're expecting first half revenue to be flat on a reported basis or up at a low single-digit percentage rate, currency-neutral. Based on what we said in February, reported half -- reported first half EPS should be $0.95, which is down at a low double-digit rate or down low single digits, currency-neutral. This reflects continued weakness in Sportswear and Contemporary, and our continued investment in our strategic growth drivers, which pressures earnings given the relatively lower first half revenues.
Recall that the second quarter 2015 benefited from a lower tax rate related primarily to the settlement of prior year's tax audits worth about $0.02 in EPS. We continue to expect currency-neutral revenue growth in the second half of 2016 to be up at a high single-digit percentage rate with the strongest performance coming in the fourth quarter. And finally, we expect second half reported EPS to increase at a mid-teen percentage rate or up high teens on a currency-neutral basis. 
In closing, as I stated earlier, our business model provides the operating flexibility necessary to deliver top line growth and profitability despite an uneven retail environment. Our entire team remains steadfastly focused on our strategic growth drivers, including product innovation, consumer engagement and D2C expansion. This focus, coupled with a healthy balance sheet, powerful brands, a strong operating platform and exceptional execution capabilities, give us the confidence to maintain our 2016 outlook and to deliver on our long-term financial targets. 
And now with that, we'll turn it back over to the operator and open up the call for questions."

So we needed to include our partners in the discussion early. And once we've included 4 or 5 partners, we felt the only fair thing to do was is to make a public statement about it.

And I think why we are so confident in our business, if you look at our global D2C results, we were up 20%, that is huge for a business like this. And why we are so confident is really 3 things. Our new products. I talked about the AV Rapidweld Pro, but also innovations in our Authentic collections, Classics collections. We continue to see great growth in our Sk8-Hi and Old Skool group of products, and really resonating with consumers. Now this quarter, we ramped up demand creation, and we saw a really great impact of the 50th anniversary promotional cadence as well as the events along with that. And I think we continue to see significant digital connectivity with this brand and its loyal consumer base. Things like 'Damn Daniel' just don't happen by accident. That's years of building a loyal consumer base, and having them really come to life and tell our story through their own words is very, very powerful. And then the success of our D2C model, as I mentioned at the beginning. There is one drag on our brand, it's EMEA, and we talked about that last quarter. And that's really wholesale inventory as we get that rightsized. But I think our DTC business there in Europe was up mid-teens. Our e-commerce business was up 30%. So again, another great example of a brand resonating with consumer and working through some channel-partner issues, which we've talked about being rightsized by the second half. And I'd be remiss if I didn't say our Asia business continues to grow very, very strong, up low double digits with D2C trending plus 25%. They're connecting with their consumer, growing that loyal consumer base. And again, Tmall Vans super brand day, that doesn't happen with many brands. That really speaks to the power of this brand and the recognition of our Tmall partnership, that this brand is good with them as well."

And the truth is, I looked back several years, I can't remember the time that it was. So it's not easy That consumers are being very thoughtful about how they engage in apparel and footwear. And the good news is, when they think about it, strong, authentic brands that offer a decent price-value equation are what they're drawn to, and we've got a portfolio of those. So we think this environment is good for us to the extent that we were very competitive in that environment. The interesting thing going on right now is around the retailers that we sell to, who are demonstrating very conservative behavior around buying. And that's why you see this big disconnect right now between our direct-to-consumer numbers, which are, quite frankly, very strong, and our wholesale numbers, which are, quite frankly, weak. And it's a part in inventory build and part with consumers moving to a buy-now-wear-now. The consumers are buying closer to their need as are retailers. So that's changing the cadence of our bookings. Fortunately, with our supply chain excellence, we're going to be able to respond to that demand when it comes, and we're pretty confident about that. I can't predict what the future is going to be with consumers, but I can predict that we're going to be able to deliver the kinds of numbers we put forward in our plans."

On the percent -- the classics makes up of the total Vans business. We really don't break that out. It's obviously a very important part. What's exciting is how our brands has built on the power of that franchise, bringing in new innovations with new lightweight cupsole options, innovating in insole cushioning, innovating with the Skate Pro series, kind of building off of that entire series. So important, I think the real story here is the continued methodical expansion of new styles, new franchises, while obviously staying very focused on maintaining that classics piece."

As it relates to the year or two, in the first quarter, we have seen some impact in the first quarter, and we've taken what we can see for the balance of the year. No year evolves exactly as you expect. And when you look at bankruptcies, individually it's not significant to VF. We talked about the accounting change in the first quarter, which is a positive.

But you have to put very interesting offers in front of them, new products with very compelling stories.

Reconciliations of GAAP measures to currency-neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial information included within the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2016 earnings call. At VF, delivering consistent, long-term value to shareholders by creating sustainable, profitable growth for our brands is at the heart of what we do every business day. To do this, we leverage our business model, which consists of powerful brands, powerful platforms, a healthy balance sheet and a uniquely talented team.
This foundation enables us to continually and successfully benefit from our key growth drivers, which include driving best-in-class product innovation, provide an exceptional consumer engagement and leveraging our operational expertise to manage the growth potential for our brands and for our shareholders. We challenge ourselves and each other to operate our business with nothing less than excellence across our brands and channels, and we do that in a responsible way. Long-term consistent achievement is what's made VF an industry leader and what will enable us to remain successful for years to come. 
In the first quarter, we delivered results that were right in line with our expectations; and, yes, our first quarter performance puts us right on track to meet our goals for 2016. Our currency-neutral -- on a currency-neutral basis, revenue was up 2%, driven by 4% growth from our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition, with strong growth from The North Face and, as expected, moderate growth in Vans and Timberland. Likewise, Jeanswear was up 4%, with both Wrangler and Lee posting increases during the quarter. 
In terms of our fastest-growing brand this quarter, or should I say brands, it's a tie between The North Face and Kipling, each with 8% currency-neutral growth. Kudos to the teams at The North Face and Kipling who delivered for us in the quarter. 
The real strength in the quarter came from our direct-to-consumer business, which was up 8% and included a low single-digit comp. What this tells us is that our brands and products are resonating strongly with consumers who are happy to show their approval by buying. However, our wholesale business is still navigating through the inventory carryover from what was a challenging fourth quarter at retail in general. 
Our international sales were up 4% overall, with Europe up 2%, Asia up 6% and our non-U.S. Americas region growing 12%. On a reported basis, gross margin was down about 80 basis points for the quarter. We continue to see a benefit from pricing, lower product costs and a favorable sales mix shift; but as expected, this was more than offset by negative impact from changes in foreign currency. That said, we continue to expect that we will expand gross margin for the year. This speaks to our portfolio's overall brand strength and supply chain excellence. 
For the quarter, currency-neutral earnings per share were in line with last year. And despite a flat start to the year for the bottom line, we continue to expect that EPS will increase 11% on a currency-neutral basis in 2016. Looking ahead, our brands remain strong. We continue to execute well, and we're taking the necessary steps to ensure that our portfolio is optimally positioned for growth and to enhance shareholder value during the long term. 
Now before I turn it over to Steve, I'll remind you what I said on our last call with respect to being active portfolio managers with an increased focus on ensuring our business is optimally positioned. To that end, we recently announced that we're exploring strategic alternatives for our Licensed Sports Group within our Imagewear coalition. That process is ongoing, and we'll be sure to update you when we have something to report. Steve?"

Currency-neutral revenue was up 4% in the fourth quarter -- first quarter, driven by a low teen increase in D2C and flat wholesale results. Sluggish traffic and the hangover from the warmer-than-normal weather once again influenced our cold weather brands. That said, overall, we're pleased with how the quarter played out for the coalition. 
Let's take a look at VF's 3 largest Outdoor & Action Sports brands. Globally, first quarter revenue for The North Face was up 8% with strong mid-teen growth in D2C and low single-digit growth in wholesale. In the Americas region, revenue was up at a low single-digit rate, with a low teen increase in D2C, including strong e-commerce results. On the wholesale side, sales were down at a mid-single-digit rate, as retailers continued to do manage through inventories remaining from the difficult fourth quarter of last year.
Within the quarter, there was a tale of 2 cities. With a cold start in the first half of the quarter, we saw success in our top 10 outerwear styles, which, as a group, was up mid-single digits. In the second half, when the weather turned wet and spring-like, we saw strength in our rainwear business, led by FuseForm styles and the Venture jacket. Other warm weather categories turned in nicely as well. In particular, our Mountain Athletics Training collection and women's business, which continues to build momentum. Overall, the strength of these categories demonstrates our ability to achieve increased spring relevancy with consumers. 
During the quarter, The North Face launched the second installment of its Made in the U.S.A. apparel line called the Backyard Project. This collection is completely designed, sourced and produced in the United States. This uniquely local, relevant product driven by targeted media coverage has generated significant exposure. And although it's off a small base, we're really scaling up production to nearly 15x in only the second year.

In Asia, first quarter revenue increased at a high single-digit rate, driven by double-digit growth in the wholesale business and a mid-single-digit increase in DTC. 
We launched fast hiking products, featuring the super lightweight FuseForm waterproof jacket as well as the circular-knit functional T-shirt and the 2-in-1 athletic pants.

It's important to note that these results are in line with what we expected in February, the direct result of our choice to strategically reduce wholesale shipments on certain classic styles predominantly in Europe, as we manage retailer receipts to match otherwise healthy consumer demand. As we've indicated previously, the short -- this should be a short-term work-through. It's not a brand, product or consumer issue. And accordingly, we expect growth to normalize in the second half for Vans. 
Now before we discuss specific regions, I do want to congratulate Vans on their 50th anniversary and thank the entire Vans family for 5 decades of an Off The Wall ethos that defines youth culture. On March 16, the brand kicked off a worldwide celebration to mark this golden event. Vans utilized multiple global advertising tactics, including promotional events and communication platforms backed by a new visual campaign with a fresh creative look that explains the brand's 50-year journey and the meaning of living Off The Wall. 75,000 people around the world attended 10 House of Vans events featuring music, art, action sports and creative workshops. And of course, Vans launched a number of products, including a gold pack of classic footwear and a range of apparel. Social media exploded with Vans 50th rising to the top as a trending topic on Instagram, Twitter and SnapChat. 
Now back to the geographies. In the Americas, in line with our expectations, revenue was up at a high single-digit rate with an impressive near 20% increase in D2C, including over 30% growth in e-commerce. This was offset by a slight decline in wholesale results. During the quarter, we launched our most innovative Pro Skate shoe ever, the AV Rapidweld Pro. The shoe was co-created with Vans Pro skater and Thrasher Magazine Skater of the Year, Anthony Van Engelen. Using the Vans' heritage-inspired lace-up low top, the show is engineered for advanced performance using innovative construction methods to improve comfort, increase flexibility and reduce overall weight. 
And of course, how could we not mention Daniel, as in 'Damn Daniel', as in 'Damn Daniel', which, as you can imagine, did have a strong impact on the sales of White Vans, which saw 100% sell-through in both retail D2C and wholesale channels. The national media attention the brand received is a wild demonstration of how creative expression, youth culture and loyalty can conspire to cause a phenomenon. Well done, Daniel. Well done. 
We also announced that Vans has renewed its title sponsorship of the U.S. Open of Surfing in Huntington Beach, California through 2018, one of the most preeminent action sports events in the country."

And to give more color in this, on our last call, we spoke about the proactive steps we are taking to manage through elevated inventory of the authentic style, which is part of the Classics collection. To be clear, this is really isolated to the authentic styles. In fact, 2 of the styles in the Classics collection, Old Skool and Sk8-Hi, were up strongly in the quarter. 
Anniversary celebrations across Europe, including major events in London, Paris, Milan and Berlin, drove strong momentum in D2C and our e-commerce business. In summary, progress is being made, and there's no change to the expectation that this will take a couple of more quarters in Europe for the wholesale business to normalize back to growth. 
In Asia, Vans revenue was up at the low double-digit rate, driven by 25% D2C growth and a mid-single-digit increase in our wholesale business. Our Chinese New Year product, Monkey pack, achieved strong sell-through in our D2C channel. To mark the anniversary, House of Vans events were held in Hong Kong, Seoul, Malaysia and Shanghai. 
Of special mention is a breakthrough e-commerce collaboration with China's Tmall, creating a Vans super brand day for our anniversary, an event that attracted more than 1 million unique visitors.

On the marketing front, we continue to connect with our outdoor lifestyle consumer. Our spring media campaign showcases Timberland's unique combination of function and style, by pairing up the Britton Hill boot collection with our Mount Davis waxed canvas jackets. Strong demand for both collections continue to reinforce Timberland as a relevant brand for spring both inside and outside the city.
While we continue to see pressure in our industrial Timberland PRO business, one highlight is our Boondock boot collection, which caters to the construction market. This collection was up more than 40% versus last year, driven by the successful When Your Feet Hurt, Your Work Suffers campaign."

At Wrangler, our mass business remains strong with a mid-single-digit increase in revenue that marks the eighth consecutive quarter of growth for that business. 
These results were driven by innovation platforms extending into our seasonal businesses. Wrangler Advanced Comfort flat-front shorts with a 4-way flex technology and Riders by Lee Heavenly Touch Capris each saw meaningful increases in the channel. In contrast, and similar to results in the fourth quarter, we saw further declines in Wrangler's Western Specialty business, where challenges in oil and gas exploration continue to negatively impact that business.

In Asia, our Jeanswear business was up mid-single digits, with similar growth in Lee and Wrangler. This growth was driven by strength in e-commerce, partially offset by softness in Hong Kong. Lee China launched a first-ever Chinese New Year advertising campaign on 101 Plus to capture the holiday season. This was a key business driver during the quarter. 
Now to Imagewear."

In LSG, our baseball performance saw a meaningful increase in Cool Base replica jersey sales; and our innovative Flex Base uniforms, which uses a patented design to maximize player flexibility and movement, debuted with all 30 teams during spring training. Also, the My Team My Colors marketing campaign, featuring a player from every MLB team, is really resonating. 
On the workwear side, positive Red Kap sales were offset by Bulwark, as the brand remained very challenged by slower oil and gas exploration with rig counts at historic lows. Given that we'll now begin to lap this decline, we do expect the workwear business to stabilize in the second half of the year. 
Our Sportswear business was down 13% in the quarter because of traffic declines in both wholesale and D2C. Revenue at Nautica was down 14% due to ongoing challenges in the channel and our strategic decision to license the women's sleepwear and men's underwear businesses, worth about 6 points in the quarter; our decision to close unprofitable stores; and the reduction in wholesale sell-in to improve future profitability. 
Kipling's North America business was down 8% due to slower tourist traffic in D2C, including our outlets. Kipling's global business was up 8% driven by strength in both wholesale and D2C in Europe and Asia Pacific. 
Revenue in the Contemporary Brands coalition declined 15% during the quarter, with weakness in both wholesale and D2C businesses. This sector remains challenging as softness and increased promotional activity continues in women's contemporary apparel. We remain focused on product innovation and differentiation and consumer connections. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott."

Our first quarter results were in line with expectations. And despite the uneven retail environment we've seen across industry, VF's diversity, operational discipline and strong connection with consumers continues to give us great flexibility to deliver on our financial commitments.
First quarter currency-neutral revenue was up 2% to $2.8 billion and included growth in 7 of our 10 largest brands. By coalition, Outdoor & Action Sports and Jeanswear, when combined, were more than 80% of the quarter's revenue, with each growing 4% on a currency-neutral basis. This was offset by a 4% decline in Imagewear and ongoing weakness in Sportswear and Contemporary Brands.
By channel, direct-to-consumer revenue was up 8%, including low double-digit growth in our Outdoor & Action Sports business and weaker-than-expected Sportswear and Contemporary Brand results. Currency-neutral wholesale revenue was down 1%, reflecting the expected rightsizing of retail inventories we spoke about on the February call. By region, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific businesses each posted gains in the quarter. 
Gross margin was down 80 basis points to 48.2%. Benefits from pricing, lower product costs and favorable mix shift were more than offset by FX and inventory management actions, particularly in Sportswear and Contemporary Brands. In line with our expectations, SG&A, as a percentage of revenues, delevered by 130 basis points as we continued to invest in our key growth priorities, including D2C, product innovation and demand creation. 
First quarter operating margin was 11.8%, which included 90 basis points of negative impact from currency. And on a comp basis, keep in mind that last year's first quarter included a onetime gain on sale of a VF outlet location. 
Clicking down into profitability by coalition, we see that we reported Outdoor & Action Sports operating income was down 13% and operating margin was 13.9%, a decrease of 230 basis points compared with last year's first quarter. More than half of that operating margin decrease was due to foreign currency changes as the majority of the coalition's business in the first quarter was outside of the U.S. 
Operating income in Jeanswear was up 4% in the quarter with operating margin up 40 basis points to 19.3%, driven by benefits from cost controls and favorable FX. The strength in Jeanswear continues globally, and we are very pleased with this, our sixth consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit revenue growth. Imagewear profit was up slightly and operating margin was up 80 basis points due to favorable mix of business and changes in FX. 
In Sportswear, operating income was down more than 60%, and the story remains the same: Challenging department store and D2C conditions along with the strategies we're employing to improve future profitability are impacting current results. And finally, Contemporary Brands saw more than a 50% drop in profitability as the sector remains challenging. 
So carrying all this to the bottom line, our reported earnings per share was $0.61 in the first quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, EPS was in line with last year's same period. Also to note, we elected to early adopt recent accounting rules related to the tax treatment of equity compensation, a change which yielded about $0.03 of benefit in the current quarter. 
Regarding our balance sheet. Inventories were up 9%, of which about half is cold weather product that we are carrying forward to fill demand in the back half of the year. So all in all, very similar story to the fourth quarter.
During the first quarter, we bought 11.3 million shares of our own stock for $714 million. There are about 19 million shares remaining under the current authorization, more than enough to accommodate our intent to repurchase about $1 billion of shares in 2016. 
Turning now to outlook. There is no change to the full year targets that we detailed on our February call. Revenue, up single digits. Gross margin, up 50 basis points, reaching 48.8%. Operating margin at 14.4%. And currency-neutral EPS, up 11% or up 5% on a reported basis against 2015's adjusted EPS of $3.08. 
So how should you think about the cadence for the first half and the full year? All in, we're expecting first half revenue to be flat on a reported basis or up at a low single-digit percentage rate, currency-neutral. Based on what we said in February, reported half -- reported first half EPS should be $0.95, which is down at a low double-digit rate or down low single digits, currency-neutral. This reflects continued weakness in Sportswear and Contemporary, and our continued investment in our strategic growth drivers, which pressures earnings given the relatively lower first half revenues.
Recall that the second quarter 2015 benefited from a lower tax rate related primarily to the settlement of prior year's tax audits worth about $0.02 in EPS. We continue to expect currency-neutral revenue growth in the second half of 2016 to be up at a high single-digit percentage rate with the strongest performance coming in the fourth quarter. And finally, we expect second half reported EPS to increase at a mid-teen percentage rate or up high teens on a currency-neutral basis. 
In closing, as I stated earlier, our business model provides the operating flexibility necessary to deliver top line growth and profitability despite an uneven retail environment. Our entire team remains steadfastly focused on our strategic growth drivers, including product innovation, consumer engagement and D2C expansion. This focus, coupled with a healthy balance sheet, powerful brands, a strong operating platform and exceptional execution capabilities, give us the confidence to maintain our 2016 outlook and to deliver on our long-term financial targets. 
And now with that, we'll turn it back over to the operator and open up the call for questions."

And I think why we are so confident in our business, if you look at our global D2C results, we were up 20%, that is huge for a business like this. And why we are so confident is really 3 things. Our new products. I talked about the AV Rapidweld Pro, but also innovations in our Authentic collections, Classics collections. We continue to see great growth in our Sk8-Hi and Old Skool group of products are really resonating with consumers. Now this quarter, we ramped up demand creation, and we saw a really great impact of the 50th anniversary promotional cadence as well as the events along with that. And I think we continue to see significant digital connectivity with this brand and its loyal consumer base. Things like 'Damn Daniel' just don't happen by accident. That's years of building a loyal consumer base, and having them really come to life and tell our story through their own words is very, very powerful. And then the success of our D2C model, as I mentioned at the beginning. There is one drag on our brand, it's EMEA, and we talked about that last quarter. And that's really wholesale inventory as we get that rightsized. But I think our DTC business there in Europe was up mid-teens and our e-commerce business was up 30%. So again, another great example of a brand resonating with consumer and working through some channel-partner issues, which we've talked about being rightsized by the second half. And I'd be remiss if I didn't say our Asia business continues to grow very, very strong, up low double digits with D2C trending plus 25%. They're connecting with their consumer, growing that loyal consumer base. And again, Tmall Vans super brand day, that doesn't happen with many brands. That really speaks to the power of this brand and the recognition of our Tmall partnership, that this brand is good with them as well."

No, we don't see anything that changes the trajectory of our organic growth rates in either revenue or earnings. But clearly, it's not easy out there right now. And the truth is, I looked back several years, I can't remember the time that it was. So it's not easy that consumers are being very thoughtful about how they engage in apparel and footwear. And the good news is, when they think about it, strong, authentic brands that offer a decent price-value equation are what they're drawn to, and we've got a portfolio of those. So we think this environment is good for us to the extent that we were very competitive in that environment. The interesting thing going on right now is around the retailers that we sell to, who are demonstrating very conservative behavior around buying. And that's why you see this big disconnect right now between our direct-to-consumer numbers, which are, quite frankly, very strong, and our wholesale numbers, which are, quite frankly, weak. And it's a part in inventory build and part with consumers moving to a buy-now-wear-now. The consumers are buying closer to their need as are retailers. So that's changing the cadence of our bookings. Fortunately, with our supply chain excellence, we're going to be able to respond to that demand when it comes, and we're pretty confident about that. I can't predict what the future is going to be with consumers, but I can predict that we're going to be able to deliver the kinds of numbers we put forward in our plans."

On top of that, we run the company with around 100 days' worth of inventory. That's a forward-looking assessment of inventory. So any day during the year, we've got kind of the next 100 days' worth of inventory sitting on the shelves in some capacity in our warehouses. So we have the inventory. The question is, how do we read it and get it out? And this hasn't been a change that happened like a light-switch change. It's evolving slowly every year with retailers wanting to manage their stores more efficiently. That means with less inventory. And rather than placing big -- placing all their orders well in advance of the season, they're placing some of their orders in advance of the season and asking us to be able to respond, and we are able to do that.

Reconciliations of GAAP measures to currency-neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial information included within the press release, which identify and quantify excluded items. 
On June 30, we announced an agreement to sell our Contemporary Brands business, which includes the 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2016 earnings call. 
All global companies operate in diverse and complicated environments and over both the short and long term, VF has been very consistent in our ability to effectively manage our business under a variety of conditions. 
We're a company with many capabilities, many opportunities and great confidence in our ability to execute. This doesn't happen by luck or accident, becomes an experience, judgment and the track record of consistency. Our consistency is built on an unparalleled focus on our consumers, optimizing product and retail innovation and superior financial discipline, which together, push our operational capabilities to even greater levels. This complements our obsession with the total performance-based approach to shareholder return. 
The second quarter, although our smallest by revenue and profit is exactly the quarter we're consistency plays a critical role in supporting any year at VF, and this year is no exception. I'm pleased to report at our second quarter results were a little better than our expectations, and that our first half of 2016 came in at promise. And the fact that this came in as promised gives us great confidence in our ability to deliver on our outlook for the full year. 
So let's take down a little bit. Revenue for the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition was up 2%, driven by a 6% increase in Vans and 2% growth in The North Face. This was tempered by a 7% decline in Timberland, which was softer than we expected but overall, the coalition was in line with where we thought we'd be 90 days ago. 
Jeanswear posted its seventh consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit growth with revenue up 6% and balanced in both brands and in all regions, a truly impressive performance by our Jeanswear team. 
Our Imagewear coalition, which grew 3% featured our fastest-growing business and brand of the quarter with a mid-teen increase in our Licensed Sports Group, driven by nearly 30% growth from our Majestic brand. Congratulations to the dedicated team in that business who clearly delivered for us in the quarter. 
[indiscernible], our Sportswear business saw revenue decline 19%, a result driven by a very challenging U.S. department store and outlet environment though we expect this environment to remain challenging, we expect this business to modestly improve in the balance of the year. 
In February, we said it intended to take a focused on proactive look at the composition of our portfolio to ensure we're well positioned to maximize growth and return to shareholders. 
During the quarter, we announced that VF had signed an agreement to sell our Contemporary Brands business, which includes 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss to Delta Galil Industries. This announcement demonstrates that our work as active portfolio managers is progressing. And while it's certainly hard to part with people we've come to know, respect and like, we had every confidence that this talented and passionate group is on the best path for long-term success. 
We're also aware that we're exploring strategic alternatives for LSG business within the image of our coalition. This process is ongoing and we'll update you when you have something more to report. 
Now back to some highlights. Our second quarter Direct-to-consumer business was up 7%, including mid-teen international growth and a low single digit increase in the U.S. and this growth was balanced. In fact, on a global basis, 9 of our 10 largest brands are revenue increases. 
Our e-commerce business continued strong momentum as well with revenue up nearly 30%. In line with expectations, our wholesale business was flat globally as many partners continue working through inventory from last winter and a sluggish first half of 2016, hence, we expect to gain continue in our third quarter. 
Our international sales were up 7% overall, with Europe up 3%; Asia, up 6% and our non-U.S. Americas region growing 20%. 
Gross margin on a reported basis improved slightly to 48.1% and reported earnings per share was $0.35 so $0.01 better than our original outlook but in line to support our full year EPS expectation of 5% growth. 
Looking into the second half of 2016 with 60% of our revenue and 70% of our earnings still ahead of us, we have resolute confidence in our ability to deliver on our full year outlook. 
And to address head-on with some have called out as concerns, I tell you that yes, we do in fact have wholesale orders in hand and be to see additions in both BRIC and click to support this  expected growth. 
Yes, our wholesale order book is more fourth quarter weighted than in 2015. 
Yes, retailers do have a cautious outlook on winter and that, too, is baked. 
And finally, yes, our outlook is fourth quarter heavy. Yet we are up against what is, by far, our weakest comparison of the year, which I'll remind you was down 1% in 2015, so maps on our side as well. 
That said, you can expect to see VF continue to drive brand energy through product innovation and closer connections with our consumers. We'll continue to leverage the power of our portfolio to deliver long-term improvement in gross margin, drive SG&A productivity and improve overall profitability to maximize shareholders returns. 
It's what you come to expect from VF and what we expect from ourselves. Over to Steve."

So in total, we checked the box. 
Now let's take a look at VF's largest brands. Globally, second quarter revenue for The North Face was up 2%, driven by more than 20% growth in D2C, which was offset by high single-digit decline in wholesale. In the 
Americas region, revenue was up at the low single digit rate, with more than 20% growth in D2C, which included strong e-commerce results. 
On wholesale side, revenue was down at a high single digit rate due to bankruptcies and in order book that is planned later in the year, which will naturally shift the majority of growth to the fourth quarter. 
During the second quarter, warmer weather categories, including Sportswear product and accessories saw a significant momentum, and we're up 40% and 60%, respectively. 
In men's fleece, sales doubled, driven by strategic shift to broaden our assortment of technical styles. 
In women's, newer silhouettes like the thermal big jacket are also seeing strong response and we're very product that Outside Magazine featured several North Face products in their summer buyers guide, including our [indiscernible] 70 pack, which won Outside Magazine's Gear of the Year award. This demonstrates that our continued focus to broaden our spring summer assortments is working. 
We're also supporting our spring summer relevancy through consumer experiences like our endurance challenge series of trail races, which draw over 13,000 attendees across event this past spring and community workouts that we sponsor twice a week in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, New York and D.C. 
In April, The North Face relocated its Palo Alto, California store and significantly elevated rate of experience through highly curated merchandising and digital storytelling. Through innovative interior sky windows, information is displayed about North Face's global athlete, weather forecasts, topographic maps and community information. 
During the opening weekend, The North Face virtual reality was featured, which is an immersive 360-degree 3D video and audio experience that virtually drops viewers into outdoor landscapes such as Muab, Yosemite and Nepal, an innovative example and a living lab that represent how we're starting to transform consumer experiences in our own retail stores and one of many that we plan to scale in the upcoming months.

Our Mountain Athletics collection across Europe had the successful start to the year with over 60% sets doing wholesale and a 60% increase in DTC. 
In Asia, second quarter revenue was down at the meeting rate, which was about in line at our expectations. This result was driven by low double-digit growth in DTC, including more than 35% growth in the e-commerce business. This was offset by weak wholesale results, due in part to timing of shipments. We expect the region to continue sequential improvement and return to growth in the fourth quarter. 
During the quarter, we launched our water adventure series, which features sustainable products, including waterproof jackets and bags. 
In April, we launched our outdoor training category, which features durable breathable materials maximized for running and training outdoors.  
To drive visibility in China and Hong Kong, we continue to host free outside group workout sessions, led by experienced trainers. 
Social engagement around this effort has already seen more than 16 million social impressions.

During the quarter, Vans showed the strength of its diverse classic offering, specifically the Sk8-Hi and Old Skool [indiscernible] styles, driving strong momentum with meaningful increases in women's sell-through. This success bodes well as we look at scaling a number of new silhouettes in the upcoming seasons. 
During the quarter, Vans launched another exacting collaboration with Nintendo, celebrating their iconic videogame heritage, including an extensive collection of footwear, apparel and accessories featuring Nintendo's extensive cast of iconic characters. The social media reception of this classic collaboration has been phenomenal, and it's performing well against expectations, which is no easy feat given it's up against the massive Disney launched last year's second quarter. 
With Vans kicking off its 50th anniversary year of March 16, the spring was packed with events across the country. 
In May, we continued our programming at the House of Vans in New York, which included music, traded workshops and documentary screenings. 
In June, the Vans worked to kick its 22nd-year bringing music, Vans' culture and fans together for more than 40 stops around the country. 
And tomorrow, the U.S. open of surfing kicks off in Huntington Beach with a royalty lead in surfing, skateboard and BMX reach for the podium.

These results were unpacked with what expected 90 days ago as the business continues to manage through elevated inventory. 
With a slight decline in Vans Europe expected in Q3, we continue to make progress and we expect the business will return to growth in the fourth quarter. 
In Europe, Old Skool and Sk8-Hi were also very successful, strengthened by high-impact window executions at retail. Nintendo was also success in Europe as we integrated the launch with in-store activations, House of Vans launch event and wholesale specific programs. 
Notably, on the first day of Nintendo launch, e-commerce has its best sales take ever. 
In Asia, Vans revenue was up mid-teens, driven by more than 30% DTC growth and a mid-single-digit increase in our wholesale business. 
E-commerce definitely played a significant role in these results by nearly doubling its business and similar to the Americas in Europe, Nintendo was a hit with more than 50% sell-through in the first full weeks and the e-commerce sell through of more than 70%, driven by impressive brand activations of the stores, including our retail lab in Korea. So very pleased with this results.

Accordingly, we're electing to take a more conservative view for the balance of 2016 as this product works through the channel. 
Similar for the context for Vans Europe, we are confident that this is a short-term inventory in balanced versus a brand issue and we're tempering sell in for a quarter or 2 to allow inventory to normalize. 
Timberland continues to our perform its competition, including market share gains and the brand help metrics that we track, including awareness conversion and sell-through remains strong. In fact sell-through rates are healthy, which gives us great confidence that this will be a short term, normalizing some time in the fourth quarter. 
Taking a look at the Americas, revenue was down at a high teen rate with wholesale business down 20% and D2C down at a mid-single-digit rate. Keep in mind that 3 quarters of Timberland's D2C business in the America is outlet based, which as you know is a channel that has seen reduced traffic. 
Notably in the mix, however, was a 25% increase in e-commerce so solid online growth. 
Product-wise, men's boots continue to relevant with strong sell-through in wholesale. Our distinctive Timberland boot company collection, driven by a new micro site launch saw a nice pickup in the quarter, a solid validation of the brand's reach given the collections premium price points. 
On the women's side of the business, we continue to be very encouraged by the progress Timberland is making. Families like the Amherst, the Newport Bay drove D2C women's casual comps up nearly 30% in full price and 50% in e-commerce. Contributing to this momentum, we launched our biggest spring effort ever to a partnership with Marie Claire, a program that ran across digital, print and in-store, driving digital engagement up over 80% versus last year. 
And finally, with oil rig counts reaching an all-time low in May, the entire work wear category, including our industrial pro business remains under significant pressure."

The wholesale channel increased as well by a mid-single-digit rate. 
Looking at product, after a very successful SensorFlex campaign, we drove traffic through some of our Heritage Collection in men's and women's boat shoes. 
Without new advertising campaign in digital and traditional media, we doubled our consumer reach and executed a seamless campaign in more than 600 store windows. 
In apparel, we continued to empower improvement of the product in terms of fit, fabric and style, and it's very nice progress with our spring '16 collections, driving low digit growth in the quarter. So strong progress there. 
Similarly Asian revenue was down high single digits, primarily from weakness in traffic and spending in Hong Kong and Japan, its largest market in the region. 
E-commerce was a large driver for the quarter with more than 50% growth, including apparel, just up more than 60% in China. 
In June, we opened a new workshop retail store in Shanghai, and we have seen strong early results. 
We're taking a prudent approach to the second half. As we now expect low single digit global revenue growth for Timberland in 2016.

On the worker side, while we continue to see consistent strength in Red Kap's automotive shop gear line, there should be no surprise that with oil rig count at historic lows, both Red Kap and Bulwark sales were down in the quarter. 
Given that, we'll begin to lap this decline in the second half and we do expect this business to return to modest growth in the fourth quarter.

Our Sportswear business was down 19% in the quarter due to traffic declines in both wholesale and D2C. 
Revenue at Nautica was down 20% due to the same challenges we've seen in the past few quarters, including heavy discounting and promotional environments in the U.S. department store channel, our strategic decision to license the women's sleepwear and men's underwear business and traffic declines at outlets where we closed 7 stores this year. 
Kipling's North America business was down 16%, also due to challenging category and channel performance. Kipling's global business was up 3%, driven by strength in both wholesale and D2C in Europe and Asia Pacific.

This discipline provides us with exceptional flexibility to deliver our financial commitments. 
As you know, this quarter produced some additional noise into the mix of our year, including the announcement of an agreement to divest our Contemporary Brands coalition, greater visibility in the bankruptcies, short-term challenges for Timberland and ongoing weakness in our Sportswear business. 
Yet even amid all this noise, we have multiple levers at our disposal that enable us to deliver and other year for earnings growth and shareholder value. 
So let's review our results. In the second quarter, currency-neutral revenue increased 1% to $2.4 billion. 
By coalition, Outdoor & Action Sports was up 2%, which is in line with expectations. Jeanswear continued its run with a 6% increase and Imagewear grew 3%. 
Partially offsetting this growth was a 19% decline in Sportswear, which continues to face very challenging conditions. 
By channel, Direct-to-Consumer revenue was up 7%, with low double-digit growth in our Outdoor & Action Sports business being tempered by a mid-teen decrease in our Sportswear coalition.  Currency-neutral wholesale revenue was flat in the quarter. 
By region, the Americas was up 1%; Europe, up 3%; Asia, up 6%. Internationally, that is outside of the U.S., our business was up 7% in the quarter. 
Gross margin was up slightly versus last year at 48.1% as benefits from pricing, lower product costs and mix were offset by FX and inventory management efforts. 
In line with expectations, SG&A as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points as we continue to invest in key growth priorities, including D2C and product innovation. 
Our second quarter operating margin was down 40 basis points to 8.6%, which included 40 basis points of negative impact from currency. 
Clicking down into profitability by coalition. On a reported basis, we see that Outdoor & Action Sports operating income was down 9% and operating margin was 8.7%, a decrease of 100 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. 
Continued investment in D2C, product design, innovation and demand creation pressured first half earnings in light of the tougher first half revenue comparisons, coupled with negative impact from FX in 2016. We expect this to normalize in the second half when profitability returns to historic levels. 
Operating income in Jeanswear was up 4% in the quarter with operating margin up 10 basis points to 17.3%, including the negative impact of FX. The strength in Jeanswear continues globally, and we are very pleased with this, our seventh consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit revenue growth. 
Imagewear profit was up 3% and operating margin up 10 basis points to 14.3% due to strength in LSG, offset by weakness on the workwear side of the business. 
And finally in Sportswear, operating income was down significantly and the story there remains the same, challenging department store and D2C conditions with traffic and category weakness. 
So carrying all these to the bottom line, our reported earnings per share was $0.35 in the second quarter, slightly ahead of where we thought would be 90 days ago and overall, where we thought we'd be halfway through this year. 
And keep in mind, this result includes a $0.06 headwind due to changes in net tax discrete compared to last year. 
Regarding our balance sheet, inventories were up 6%, of which half remains at same cold weather carryover product we've spoken about on our last 2 calls. Our inventories are in line with our second half growth projections. 
During the quarter, we bought back 1.9 million shares of VF stock for $120 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $834 million. So tracking well against the $1 billion target we set in February. 
Turning now to outlook, which like the rest of our results today are based and continuing operations. We now expect full year revenues to increase 3% to 4%, down from the previous mid-single-digit expectation. 
If you take a step back to gain perspective, these change is really about 2 main factors. First, we now expect the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition to grow at the mid-single-digit rate for the full year, down from the previous high single digit outlook. This is due to bankruptcy in the sporting goods and action sports channel and a revised outlook for Timberland based on -- primarily on challenges in the Americas business. However, these elements, while short-lived in nature do put enough pressure on the year for us to take Timberland's global outlook to a low single digit growth versus the previous high single digit increase. 
The second factor is a lower outlook for our Sportswear business. For reasons previously discussed, we have updated our full year expectations to a low double-digit decline versus the previous expectation of slight decline. 
Gross margin is expected to improve by 50 basis points, reaching 48.7%. 
Now keep in mind the contemporary business carried a higher than VF average gross margin, so when adjusted for this and continuing operations, 2015's gross margin is 10 basis points lower at 48.2%. 
Operating margin is expected to reach 14.5%, which includes about 60 basis points of FX, so right around 15% for the full year, excluding currency. 
Note that, while the exclusion of Contemporary Brands hurt gross margin, it helps operating margin. 
With respect to tax rate, our outlook for the full year now no about 21% versus the previous about 23%. Due to a beneficial shift in mix, new policies related to the treatment of equity comp and longer-term improvements we're making in our global tax structure. 
At the bottom line, reported earnings per share is expected to increase 5% to $3.20, up 11% currency-neutral compared to EPS from continuing operations of $3.04 in 2015. 
So even after adjusting for contemporary, we've maintained the same growth rate we targeted in February. 
For the second half of the year, we expect revenue growth to be up about 5% with low single digit increase in the third quarter, followed by high single digit increase in the fourth quarter. 
With respect to earnings cadence, we expect second half reported EPS to increase at a low teen percentage rate with a high single digit increase in the third quarter and a mid- to high-teen increase in the fourth quarter, our easiest comparison of the year. 
So to recap the changes to our 2016 outlook, revenue should grow 3% to 4%, down a bit due to bankruptcies, Timberland and Sportswear impacts. Gross margin expansion remains the same, and we took out $0.03 from the bottom line based on what Contemporary Brands would have directly contributed this year. 
Flexibility, operational excellence, strong cash flow and balance sheet and strategic financial management. From any angle, our model allows us to trends in short-term challenges and consistently deliver total shareholder return. And more importantly, it enables us to continue investing in our business and aggressively manage inventories for the long term without sacrificing shareholder returns along the way. We believe this combination uniquely positions us to accelerate growth and profitability when the overall environment returns to greater strength. 
And with that, we'll turn it back over to the operator and open up the call for questions."

It's Eric, I'll take that question. Our organic great goals remain impact. Clearly, this year, we're off to a slower start given all the implications of last winter and the inventory hangover that we faced in the first half of this year. But when you step back and look at our organic growth rate, internationally, we were up 7%. That tells us that against that 8% organic growth rate goal outside of the U.S., we're pretty much on track. Most confident in spite of part of this is that our direct-to-consumer business globally, we were up 7%. So being up 7% in our stores tells us that consumers are buying from us at the kind of growth rate that we have building to our long-term vision. Unfortunately, that's only about 27% of our business. Our wholesale business is not experiencing that, but that's not to say that our wholesale business -- the consumer take outs from wholesalers is strong. What is that they have a lot of inventory in their barring very cautiously. Our wholesale business is a reflection of what we're shipping to them this quarter for sale next quarter, and not a reflection of consumer engagement. So we still think we have brand portfolio and the what we're doing the right things with our brands to engage consumers at a near 8% growth rate even this year, which is clearly a bit a challenging year around the world. Obviously, the shape of VF is going to change. It's much easier and easier to manage the timing of selling something than it is buying the right thing. We're actively managing our portfolio, working equally hard on both divestitures and on acquisitions. The timing of one is more predictable than the other but we're committed to both."

We feel really good about our brand metrics as I mentioned in my comments, and we see just over the next quarter or 2 getting that inventory to normalize and why we're so confident about that is we've seen really good rates of sales through the second -- through the first half that continue into the second half. And as e-commerce growth rate of plus 25 continues to give us confidence around our ability to connect with the consumer and represent our brand in a really positive way.

Having said that, the economic -- the P&L model will look different, and we're trying to put ourselves in a position to accelerate the growth or organic growth rate in our core brands. And the 2 businesses that we're talking about, selling will do that by math because they have not grown at the kind of rate that the other rest of the business gross at consistently. From a capital standpoint, we're going to keep that powder dry to see how much capital we have, but our priorities remain the same. First is acquisitions and down the road, we will hit that dividends and share buyback. But our priority is acquisitions."

Reconciliations of GAAP measures to currency-neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial information included with the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items. 
On June 30, we announced an agreement to sell our Contemporary Brands business, which includes the 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss. Appropriately, we have classified the assets and liabilities of these businesses as held for sale and therefore, have moved their results into discontinued operations.
Therefore, unless otherwise noted, results presented on today's call are based on continuing operations.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2016 earnings call.
All global companies operate in diverse and complicated environments and over, both the short and long term, VF has been very consistent in our ability to effectively manage our business under a variety of conditions.
We're a company with many capabilities, many opportunities and great confidence in our ability to execute. This doesn't happen by luck or accident, becomes an experience, judgment and the track record of consistency. Our consistency is built on an unparalleled focus on our consumers, optimizing product and retail innovation and superior financial discipline, which together, push our operational capabilities to even greater levels. This complements our obsession with the total performance-based approach to shareholder return.
The second quarter, although our smallest by revenue and profit is exactly the quarter where consistency plays a critical role in supporting any year at VF, and this year is no exception. I'm pleased to report that our second quarter results were a little better than our expectations, and that our first half of 2016 came in as promised. And the fact that this came in as promised gives us great confidence in our ability to deliver on our outlook for the full year.
So let's dig down a little bit. Revenue for the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition was up 2%, driven by a 6% increase in Vans and 2% growth in The North Face. This was tempered by a 7% decline in Timberland, which was softer than we expected, but overall, the coalition was in line with where we thought we'd be 90 days ago.
Jeanswear posted its seventh consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit growth with revenue up 6% and balanced in both brands and in all regions, a truly impressive performance by our Jeanswear team.
Our Imagewear coalition, which grew 3% featured our fastest-growing business and brand of the quarter with a mid-teen increase in our Licensed Sports Group, driven by nearly 30% growth from our Majestic brand. Congratulations to the dedicated team in that business who clearly delivered for us in the quarter.
To round it out, our Sportswear business saw revenue decline 19%, a result driven by a very challenging U.S. department store and outlet environment and though we expect this environment to remain challenging, we expect this business to modestly improve in the balance of the year.
In February, we said we intended to take a focused and proactive look at the composition of our portfolio to ensure we're well positioned to maximize growth and return to shareholders.
During the quarter, we announced that VF had signed an agreement to sell our Contemporary Brand business, which includes 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss to Delta Galil Industries. This announcement demonstrates that our work as active portfolio managers is progressing. And while it's certainly hard to part with people we've come to know, respect and the like, we had every confidence that this talented and passionate group is on the best path for long-term success.
We're also aware that we're exploring strategic alternatives for LSG business within the Imagewear coalition. This process is ongoing and we'll update you when we have something more to report.
Now back to some highlights. Our second quarter direct-to-consumer business was up 7%, including mid-teen international growth and a low single digit increase in the U.S. and this growth was balanced. In fact, on a global basis, 9 of our 10 largest brands are revenue increases. 
Our e-commerce business continued its strong momentum as well with revenue up nearly 30%. In line with expectations, our wholesale business was flat globally as many partners continue working through inventory from last winter and a sluggished first half of 2016, trends we expect to continue into our third quarter.
Our international sales were up 7% overall with Europe, up 3%; Asia, up 6% and our non-U.S. Americas region growing 20%.
Gross margin on a reported basis improved slightly to 48.1% and reported earnings per share was $0.35 so $0.01 better than our original outlook, but in line to support our full year EPS expectation of 5% growth.
Looking into the second half of 2016 with 60% of our revenue and 70% of our earnings still ahead of us, we have resolute confidence in our ability to deliver on our full year outlook.
And to address head-on what some have called out as concerns, I'd tell you that, yes, we do in fact have wholesale orders in hand and see the additions in both brick and click to support this expected growth.
Yes, our wholesale order book is more fourth quarter weighted than in 2015.  Yes, retailers do have a cautious outlook on winter and that, too, is baked in.
And finally, yes, our outlook is fourth quarter heavy. Yet we are up against what is, by far, our weakest comparison of the year, which I'll remind you was down 1% in 2015 so maps on our side as well.
That said, you can expect to see VF continue to drive brand energy through product innovation and closer connections with our consumers. We'll continue to leverage the power of our portfolio to deliver long-term improvements in gross margin, drive SG&A productivity and improve overall profitability to maximize shareholders returns.
It's what you come to expect from VF and what we expect from ourselves. Over to Steve."

Revenue was up 2% in the second quarter, driven by a low double-digit increase in D2C and a low single-digit decrease in wholesale. This result was about what expected 90 days ago and keep in mind, the second quarter is Outdoor & Action Sports' smallest quarter of the year, both from a revenue and earnings perspective. So in total, we checked the box.
Now let's take a look at VF's largest brands. Globally, second quarter revenue for The North Face was up 2%, driven by more than 20% growth in D2C, which was offset by a high single-digit decline in wholesale. In the Americas region, revenue was up at a low single-digit rate, with more than 20% growth in D2C, which included strong e-commerce results.
On the wholesale side, revenue was down at a high single-digit rate due to bankruptcies and in order book that is planned later in the year, which will naturally shift the majority of growth to the fourth quarter.
During the second quarter, warmer weather categories, including Sportswear product and accessories saw a significant momentum, and we're up 40% and 60%, respectively.
In men's fleece, sales doubled, driven by strategic shift to broaden our assortment of technical styles. 
In women's, newer silhouettes like the Tomales Bay jacket are also seeing strong response and we're very proud that Outside Magazine featured several North Face products in their summer buyers guide, including our Fovero 70 pack, which won Outside Magazine's Gear of the Year award. This demonstrates that our continued focus to broaden our spring summer assortment is working.
We're also supporting our spring summer relevancy through consumer experiences, like our Endurance Challenge series of trail races, which drew over 13,000 attendees across the event this past spring and community workouts that we sponsor twice a week in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, New York and D.C. 
In April, The North Face relocated its Palo Alto, California store and significantly elevated the retail experience through highly curated merchandising and digital storytelling. Through innovative interior sky windows, information is displayed about North Face's global athlete team, weather forecasts, topographic maps and community information.
During the opening weekend, The North Face virtual reality was featured, which is an immersive 360-degree 3D video and audio experience that virtually drops viewers into outdoor landscapes such as Moab, Yosemite and Nepal, an innovative example and a living lab that represents how we're starting to transform consumer experiences in our own retail stores, and one of many that we plan to scale in the upcoming months.

The North Face European business had another strong quarter with revenues up at the low teen rates, driven by more than 25% growth in DTC and a mid-single-digit increase in our wholesale business.  And the growth was balanced and broad-based, too, with double-digit increases in the U.K., Germany, Benelux, Italy and Spain.
A great product highlight was our Footwear business, which grew more than 20%. This was supported by marketing campaigns and product styles, to help build on the momentum the team has been working on.
Our Mountain Athletics collection across Europe had the successful start to the year with over 60% sets doing wholesale and a 60% increase in DTC.
In Asia, second quarter revenue was down at the mid-teen rate, which was about in line with our expectations. This result was driven by a low double-digit growth in DTC, including more than 35% growth in the e-commerce business. This was offset by weak wholesale results, due in part to timing of shipments. We expect the region to continue sequential improvement and return to growth in the fourth quarter.
During the quarter, we launched our water adventure series, which features sustainable products, including waterproof jackets and bags.
In April, we launched our outdoor training category, which features durable breathable materials maximized for running and training outdoors.
To drive visibility in China and Hong Kong, we continue to host free outside group workout sessions, led by experienced trainers.
Social engagement around this effort has already seen more than 16 million social impressions.
Globally, the first half of 2016 finished well for The North Face, and we are right on track to reach our full year expectations of mid-single-digit growth.

Looking at regions. In the Americas, revenue was up at a high single-digit rate with a low double-digit increase in D2C, including over 25% growth in e-commerce and a mid-single-digit increase in wholesale. 
During the quarter, Vans showed the strength of its diverse classics offering, specifically the Sk8-Hi and Old Skool Side Stripe styles, driving strong momentum with meaningful increases in women's sell-through. This success bodes well as we look at scaling a number of new silhouettes in the upcoming seasons.
During the quarter, Vans launched another exciting collaboration with Nintendo, celebrating their iconic videogame, Heritage, including an extensive collection of footwear, apparel and accessories, featuring Nintendo's extensive cast of iconic characters. The social media reception to this collaboration has been phenomenal, and it's performing well against expectations, which is no easy feat, given it's up against the massive Disney launch of last year's second quarter.
With Vans kicking off its 50th anniversary year on March 16, the spring was packed with events across the country.
In May, we continued our programming at the House of Vans in New York, which included music, traded workshops and documentary screenings.
In June, the Vans Warped Tour kicked off its 22nd year, bringing music, Vans' culture and fans together for more than 40 stops around the country.
And tomorrow, the U.S. Open of Surfing kicks off in Huntington Beach with the world's elite in surfing, skateboard and BMX reach for the podium.
As a complete emerging into Vans' culture, this festival-wide celebration of action sports, creative expression and youth culture is about as core as it gets."

The low double-digit increase in DTC offset by a mid-teen decline in wholesale. These results were in fact with what we expected 90 days ago, as the business continues to manage through elevated inventory.
With a slight decline in Vans Europe expected in Q3, we continue to make progress and expect the business will return to growth in the fourth quarter. 
In Europe, Old Skool and Sk8-Hi were also very successful, strengthened by high-impact window executions at retail. Nintendo was also success in Europe as we integrated the launch with in-store activations, House of Vans launch event and wholesale specific programs.
Notably, on the first day of the Nintendo launch, e-commerce had its best sales state ever.
In Asia, Vans revenue was up mid-teens, driven by more than 30% DTC growth and a mid-single-digit increase in our wholesale business.
E-commerce definitely played a significant role in these results by nearly doubling its business and similar to the Americas in Europe, Nintendo was a hit with more than 50% sell-through in the first 4 weeks and e-commerce sell-through of more than 70%, driven by impressive brand activations at key stores, including our retail lab in Korea. So very pleased with these results. 
With the first half behind us and the momentum building for Vans globally, there are no changes to our full year outlook for high single-digit growth.
Now onto Timberland."

While these results were, for the most part, in line with our expectations for the brand smallest quarter, as we enter",388,"Timberland global revenue was down 7% with a low single-digit increase in D2C, offset by a low double-digit decline in wholesale sales. While these results were, for the most part, in line with our expectations for the brand smallest quarter, as we enter the second half of the year, we have seen higher-than-anticipated inventory levels, particularly in our Americas business and anticipated more challenging sales environment. Accordingly, we're electing to take a more conservative view for the balance of 2016 as this product works through the channel.
Similar to the context for Vans Europe, we are confident that this is a short-term inventory in balance versus a brand issue, and we're tempering selling for a quarter or 2 to allow inventory to normalize.
Timberland continues to outperform its competition, including market share gains and the brand help metrics that we track, including awareness, conversion and sell-through remained strong. In fact sell-through rates are healthy, which gives us great confidence that this will be a short term, normalizing some times in the fourth quarter.
Taking a look at the Americas, revenue was down at a high teen rate with wholesale business down 20% and D2C down at a mid-single-digit rate. Keep in mind that 3 quarters of Timberland's D2C business in the Americas is outlet based, which as you know is a channel that has seen reduced traffic.
Notably in the mix, however, was a 25% increase in e-commerce so solid online growth.
Product-wise, men's boots continue to be relevant with strong sell-through in wholesale. Our distinctive Timberland boot company collection, driven by a new micro site launch, saw a nice pickup in the quarter, a solid validation of the brand's reach given the collections premium price points.
On the women's side of the business, we continue to be very encouraged by the progress Timberland is making. Families like the Amherst and Newport Bay drove D2C women's casual comps up nearly 30% in full price and 50% in e-commerce. Contributing to this momentum, we launched our biggest spring effort ever through a partnership with Marie Claire, a program that ran across digital, print and in-store, driving digital engagement up over 80% versus last year.

Without new advertising campaign in digital and traditional media, we doubled our consumer reach and executed a seamless campaign in more than 600 store windows.
In apparel, we continued our improvement of the product, in terms of fit, fabric and style, and did see very nice progress with our spring '16 collections, driving low double-digit growth in the quarter. So strong progress there.
Similarly Asian revenue was down high single digits, primarily from weakness in traffic and spending in Hong Kong and Japan, its largest market in the region. 
E-commerce was a large driver for the quarter with more than 50% growth, including apparel, just up more than 60% in China.

Wrangler's mass business remained strong with a high single-digit increase that marks the ninth consecutive quarter of growth for that business, a story that remains the same, a strong collaborative retail partnership with the mutual goal of bringing innovation and value to consumers. Our innovation story is stronger than ever. Wrangler Advanced Comfort, outdoor performance shorts and Writers by Lee denim shorts and capris, each saw a meaningful increases in the channel. 
In contrast, and a trend we've spoken about over the past few quarters, our Western Specialty business was down as the oil and gas exploration communities continue to be hard-hit.

Wrangler saw a strength in both the wholesale and e-commerce businesses. During the quarter, we launched an out-of-home marketing campaign across Holland, Germany and Italy that boosted the reach and sell-through for our fall '16 products.
In Asia, Jeanswear's revenue was up at low single-digit rate, with a mid-single-digit increase in Lee, moderated by a slight decline in the Wrangler business.

Kipling's North America business was down 16%, also due to challenging category and channel performance. Kipling's global business was up 3%, driven by strength in both wholesale and D2C in Europe and Asia Pacific.

At our last call, I spoke about VF's diverse business model and our consistent operational discipline. This discipline provides us with exceptional flexibility to deliver our financial commitments.
As you know, this quarter produced some additional noise into the mix of our year, including the announcement of an agreement to divest our Contemporary Brands coalition, greater visibility into bankruptcies, short-term challenges for Timberland and ongoing weakness in our Sportswear business.
Yet even amid all this noise, we have multiple levers at our disposal that enable us to deliver another year for earnings growth and shareholder value.
So let's review our results. In the second quarter, currency-neutral revenue increased 1% to $2.4 billion.
By coalition, Outdoor & Action Sports was up 2%, which is in line with expectations. Jeanswear continued its run with a 6% increase and Imagewear grew 3%.
Partially offsetting this growth was a 19% decline in Sportswear, which continues to face very challenging conditions. 
By channel, Direct-to-Consumer revenue was up 7%, with low double-digit growth in our Outdoor & Action Sports business being tempered by a mid-teen decrease in our Sportswear coalition.  Currency-neutral wholesale revenue was flat in the quarter.
By region, the Americas was up 1%; Europe, up 3%; Asia, up 6%. Internationally, that is outside of the U.S., our business was up 7% in the quarter.
Gross margin was up slightly versus last year at 48.1% as benefits from pricing, lower product costs and mix were offset by FX and inventory management efforts.
In line with expectations, SG&A as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points as we continue to invest in key growth priorities, including D2C and product innovation.
Our second quarter operating margin was down 40 basis points to 8.6%, which included 40 basis points of negative impact from currency.
Clicking down into profitability by coalition. On a reported basis, we see that Outdoor & Action Sports operating income was down 9% and operating margin was 8.7%, a decrease of 100 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. 
Continued investment in D2C, product design, innovation and demand creation pressured first half earnings in light of the tougher first half revenue comparisons, coupled with negative impact from FX in 2016. We expect this to normalize in the second half when profitability returns to historic levels.
Operating income in Jeanswear was up 4% in the quarter with operating margin up 10 basis points to 17.3%, including the negative impact of FX. The strength in Jeanswear continues globally, and we are very pleased with this, our seventh consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit revenue growth.
Imagewear profit was up 3% and operating margin up 10 basis points to 14.3% due to strength in LSG, offset by weakness on the Workwear side of the business.
And finally in Sportswear, operating income was down significantly and the story there remains the same, challenging department store and D2C conditions with traffic and category weakness.
So carrying all these to the bottom line, our reported earnings per share was $0.35 in the second quarter, slightly ahead of where we thought would be 90 days ago and overall, where we thought we'd be halfway through this year. 
And keep in mind, this result includes a $0.06 headwind due to changes in net tax discretes compared to last year. 
Regarding our balance sheet, inventories were up 6%, of which half remains at same cold weather carryover product we've spoken about on our last 2 calls. Our inventories in line with our second half growth projections.
During the quarter, we bought back 1.9 million shares of VF stock for $120 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $834 million. So tracking well against the $1 billion target we set in February.
Turning now to outlook, which like the rest of our results today are based on continuing operations. We now expect full year revenues to increase 3% to 4%, down from the previous mid-single-digit expectation.
If you take a step back to gain perspective, these change is really about 2 main factors. First, we now expect the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition to grow at a mid-single-digit rate for the full year, down from the previous high single-digit outlook. This is due to bankruptcy in the sporting goods and action sports channel and a revised outlook for Timberland based on -- primarily on challenges in the Americas business. However, these elements, while short-lived in nature, do put enough pressure on the year for us to take Timberland's global outlook to a low single-digit growth versus the previous high single-digit increase.
The second factor is a lower outlook for our Sportswear business. For reasons previously discussed, we have updated our full year expectations to a low double-digit decline versus the previous expectation of slight decline.
Gross margin is expected to improve by 50 basis points, reaching 48.7%.
Now keep in mind the contemporary business carried a higher than VF average gross margin so when adjusted for this and continuing operations, 2015's gross margin is 10 basis points lower at 48.2%.
Operating margin is expected to reach 14.5%, which includes about 60 basis points of FX so right around 15% for the full year, excluding currency.
Note that, while the exclusion of Contemporary Brands hurt gross margin, it helps operating margin.
With respect to tax rate, our outlook for the full year is now about 21% versus the previous about 23%. Due to a beneficial shift in mix, new policies related to the treatment of equity comp and longer-term improvements we're making in our global tax structure.
At the bottom line, reported earnings per share is expected to increase 5% to $3.20, up 11% currency-neutral compared to EPS from continuing operations of $3.04 in 2015.
So even after adjusting for contemporary, we've maintained the same growth rate we targeted in February.
For the second half of the year, we expect revenue growth to be up about 5% with a low single-digit increase in the third quarter, followed by a high single-digit increase in the fourth quarter.
With respect to earnings cadence, we expect second half reported EPS to increase at a low teen percentage rate with a high single-digit increase in the third quarter and a mid- to high-teen increase in the fourth quarter, our easiest comparison of the year.
So to recap the changes to our 2016 outlook, revenue should grow 3% to 4%, down a bit due to bankruptcies, Timberland and Sportswear impacts. Gross margin expansion remains the same, and we took out $0.03 from the bottom line based on what Contemporary Brands would have directly contributed this year.
Flexibility, operational excellence, strong cash flow and balance sheet and strategic financial management. From any angle, our model allows us to trends in short-term challenges and consistently deliver total shareholder return. And more importantly, it enables us to continue investing in our business and aggressively manage inventories for the long term without sacrificing shareholder returns along the way. We believe this combination uniquely positions us to accelerate growth and profitability when the overall environment returns to greater strength.
And with that, we'll turn it back over to the operator and open up the call for questions."

It's Eric, I'll take that question. Our organic growth rate goals remain intact. Clearly, this year, we're off to a slower start, given all the implications of last winter and the inventory hangover that we faced in the first half of this year. But when you step back and look at our organic growth rate, internationally, we were up 7%. That tells us that against that 8% organic growth rate goal, outside of the U.S., we're pretty much on track. Most confident inspiring part of this for me is that, in our direct-to-consumer business globally, we were up 7%. So being up 7% in our stores tells us that consumers are buying from us at the kind of growth rate that we have building to our long-term vision. Unfortunately, that's only about 27% of our business. Our wholesale business is not experiencing that, but that's not to say that our wholesale business -- the consumer takeout from our wholesalers isn't strong. What it says is that they have a lot of inventory and they're buying very cautiously. Our wholesale business is a reflection of what we're shipping to them this quarter for sale in the next quarter, and not a reflection of consumer engagement. So we still think we have the brand portfolio and the -- we're doing the right things with our brands, to engage consumers at a near 8% growth rate even this year, which is clearly a pretty challenging year around the world. Obviously, the shape of VF is going to change. It's much easier and easier to manage the timing of selling something than it is buying the right thing. We're actively managing our portfolio, working equally hard on both divestitures and on acquisitions. The timing of one is more predictable than the other, but we're committed to both."

So the inventory imbalance we talked about is primarily Americas issue, and we see it primarily in our boots category. It really started to see this at the beginning of early Q2, both in our wholesale and PRO business.

We feel really good about our brand metrics as I mentioned in my comments, and we see just over the next quarter or 2, getting that inventory to normalize and why we're so confident about that is we've seen really good rates of sale through the second -- through the first half that continue into the second half. And as e-commerce growth rate of plus 25 continues to give us confidence around our ability to connect with the consumer and represent our brand in a really positive way. So we see returning to growth in the second half, low single digit, mid-single-digit despite -- we're coming up against the Q3 in 2015, where we grew over 40%. So we -- that's -- I would tell you, kind of frame up why we're positive. As the brand continues strong, the sell-through rates are good.

These currency-neutral amounts as lead numbers in our discussion because we feel it more accurately represents the true operational performance and underlying results of our businesses and brands.
You may also hear us refer to reported amounts, which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These amounts include the impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to currency-neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial information included with the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items. 
On June 30, we announced an agreement to sell our Contemporary Brands business, which includes the 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss brands. Appropriately, we have classified the assets and liabilities of these businesses as held for sale and therefore, have moved their results into discontinued operations.
Therefore, unless otherwise noted, results presented on today's call are based on continuing operations. Removing this business from the mix impacts the P&L for both 2015 and 2016 and we have furnished a full year 2015 P&L, which designates the impacts.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2016 earnings call.
All global companies operate in diverse and complicated environments, yet over both the short and long term, VF has been very consistent in our ability to effectively manage our business under a variety of conditions.
We're a company with many capabilities, many opportunities and great confidence in our ability to execute. This doesn't happen by luck or accident. It comes from experience, judgment and a track record of consistency. Our consistency is built on an unparalleled focus on our consumers, optimizing product and retail innovation and superior financial discipline, which together, push our operational capabilities to even greater levels. This complements our obsession with the total performance-based approach to shareholder return.
The second quarter, although our smallest by revenue and profit, is exactly the quarter where consistency plays a critical role in supporting any year at VF, and this year is no exception. I'm pleased to report that our second quarter results were a little better than our expectations, and that our first half of 2016 came in as promised. And the fact that this came in as promised gives us great confidence in our ability to deliver on our outlook for the full year.
So let's dig down a little bit. Revenue for the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition was up 2%, driven by a 6% increase in Vans and 2% growth in The North Face. This was tempered by a 7% decline in Timberland, which was softer than we expected, but overall, the coalition was in line with where we thought we'd be 90 days ago.
Jeanswear posted its seventh consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit growth with revenue up 6% and balanced in both brands and in all regions, a truly impressive performance by our Jeanswear team.
Our Imagewear coalition, which grew 3%, featured our fastest-growing business and brand of the quarter with a mid-teen increase in our Licensed Sports Group, driven by nearly 30% growth from our Majestic brand. Congratulations to the dedicated team in that business who clearly delivered for us in the quarter.
To round it out, our Sportswear business saw revenue decline 19%, a result driven by a very challenging U.S. department store and outlet environment and though we expect this environment to remain challenging, we expect this business to modestly improve in the balance of the year.
In February, we said that we intended to take a focused and proactive look at the composition of our portfolio to ensure we're well positioned to maximize growth and return to shareholders.
During the quarter, we announced that VF had signed an agreement to sell our Contemporary Brand business, which includes 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss, to Delta Galil Industries. This announcement demonstrates that our work as active portfolio managers is progressing. And while it's certainly hard to part with people we've come to know, respect and like, we had every confidence that this talented and passionate group is on the best path for long-term success.
You're also aware that we're exploring strategic alternatives for LSG business within the Imagewear coalition. This process is ongoing and we'll update you when we have something more to report.
Now back to some highlights. Our second quarter direct-to-consumer business was up 7%, including mid-teen international growth and a low single digit increase in the U.S. and this growth was balanced. In fact, on a global basis, 9 of our 10 largest brands saw revenue increases. 
Our e-commerce business continued its strong momentum as well with revenue up nearly 30%. In line with expectations, our wholesale business was flat globally as many partners continue working through inventory from last winter and a sluggish first half of 2016, trends we expect to continue into our third quarter.
Our international sales were up 7% overall with Europe, up 3%; Asia, up 6% and our non-U.S. Americas region growing 20%.
Gross margin on a reported basis improved slightly to 48.1% and reported earnings per share was $0.35 so $0.01 better than our original outlook, but in line to support our full year EPS expectation of 5% growth.
Looking into the second half of 2016 with 60% of our revenue and 70% of our earnings still ahead of us, we have resolute confidence in our ability to deliver on our full year outlook.
And to address head-on what some have called out as concerns, I'd tell you that, yes, we do in fact have wholesale orders in hand and need to see additions in both brick and click to support this expected growth.
Yes, our wholesale order book is more fourth quarter weighted than in 2015.  Yes, retailers do have a cautious outlook on winter and that, too, is baked in.
And finally, yes, our outlook is fourth quarter heavy. Yet we are up against what is, by far, our weakest comparison of the year, which I'll remind you was down 1% in 2015 so math's on our side as well.
That said, you can expect to see VF continue to drive brand energy through product innovation and closer connections with our consumers. We'll continue to leverage the power of our portfolio to deliver long-term improvements in gross margin, drive SG&A productivity and improve overall profitability to maximize shareholders returns.
It's what you've come to expect from VF and what we expect from ourselves. Over to Steve."

Revenue was up 2% in the second quarter, driven by a low double-digit increase in D2C and a low single-digit decrease in wholesale. This result was about what we expected 90 days ago and keep in mind, the second quarter is Outdoor & Action Sports' smallest quarter of the year, both from a revenue and earnings perspective. So in total, we checked the box.
Now let's take a look at VF's largest brands. Globally, second quarter revenue for The North Face was up 2%, driven by more than 20% growth in D2C, which was offset by a high single-digit decline in wholesale. In the Americas region, revenue was up at a low single-digit rate, with more than 20% growth in D2C, which included strong e-commerce results.
On the wholesale side, revenue was down at a high single-digit rate due to bankruptcies and in order book that is planned later in the year, which will naturally shift the majority of growth to the fourth quarter.
During the second quarter, warmer weather categories, including Sportswear product and accessories, saw significant momentum, and were up 40% and 60%, respectively.
In men's fleece, sales doubled, driven by strategic shift to broaden our assortment of technical styles. 
In women's, newer silhouettes like the Tomales Bay jacket are also seeing strong response and we're very proud that Outside Magazine featured several North Face products in their summer buyers guide, including our Fovero 70 pack, which won Outside Magazine's Gear of the Year award. This demonstrates that our continued focus to broaden our spring-summer assortment is working.
We're also supporting our spring-summer relevancy through consumer experiences, like our Endurance Challenge series of trail races, which drew over 13,000 attendees across events this past spring and community workouts that we sponsored twice a week in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, New York and D.C. 
In April, The North Face relocated its Palo Alto, California store and significantly elevated the retail experience through highly curated merchandising and digital storytelling. Through innovative interior sky windows, information is displayed about North Face's global athlete team, weather forecasts, topographic maps and community information.
During the opening weekend, North Face virtual reality was featured, which is an immersive 360-degree 3D video and audio experience that virtually drops viewers into outdoor landscapes such as Moab, Yosemite and Nepal, an innovative example and a living lab that represents how we're starting to transform consumer experiences in our own retail stores, and one of many that we plan to scale in the upcoming months.

The North Face European business had another strong quarter with revenues up at the low teen rates, driven by more than 25% growth in DTC and a mid-single-digit increase in our wholesale business.  And the growth was balanced and broad-based, too, with double-digit increases in the U.K., Germany, Benelux, Italy and Spain.
A great product highlight was our Footwear business, which grew more than 20%. This was supported by marketing campaigns and product styles, to help build on the momentum the team has been working on.
Our Mountain Athletics collection across Europe had a successful start to the year with over 60% sales-through in wholesale and a 60% increase in DTC.
In Asia, second quarter revenue was down at the mid-teen rate, which was about in line with our expectations. This result was driven by low double-digit growth in DTC, including more than 35% growth in the e-commerce business. This was offset by weak wholesale results, due in part to timing of shipments. We expect the region to continue sequential improvement and return to growth in the fourth quarter.
During the quarter, we launched our water adventure series, which features sustainable products, including waterproof jackets and bags.
In April, we launched our outdoor training category, which features durable breathable materials maximized for running and training outdoors.
To drive visibility in China and Hong Kong, we continue to host free outside group workout sessions, led by experienced trainers.
Social engagement around this effort has already seen more than 16 million social impressions.
Globally, the first half of 2016 finished well for The North Face, and we are right on track to reach our full year expectations of mid-single-digit growth.

Looking at regions. In the Americas, revenue was up at a high single-digit rate with a low double-digit increase in D2C, including over 25% growth in e-commerce and a mid-single-digit increase in wholesale. 
During the quarter, Vans showed the strength of its diverse classics offering, specifically the Sk8-Hi and Old Skool Side Stripe styles, driving strong momentum with meaningful increases in women's sell-through. This success bodes well as we look at scaling a number of new silhouettes in the upcoming seasons.
During the quarter, Vans launched another exciting collaboration with Nintendo, celebrating their iconic videogame, Heritage, including an extensive collection of footwear, apparel and accessories, featuring Nintendo's extensive cast of iconic characters. The social media reception to this collaboration has been phenomenal, and it's performing well against expectations, which is no easy feat, given it's up against the massive Disney launch of last year's second quarter.
With Vans kicking off its 50th anniversary year on March 16, the spring was packed with events across the country.
In May, we continued our programming at the House of Vans in New York, which included music, creative workshops and documentary screenings.
In June, the Vans Warped Tour kicked off its 22nd year, bringing music, Vans' culture and fans together for more than 40 stops around the country.
And tomorrow, the U.S. Open of Surfing kicks off in Huntington Beach where the world's elite in surfing, skateboard and BMX reach for the podium.
As a complete emerging into Vans' culture, this festival-wide celebration of action sports, creative expression and youth culture is about as core as it gets."

These results were on track with what we expected 90 days ago, as the business continues to manage through elevated inventory.
With a slight decline in Vans Europe expected in Q3, we continue to make progress and expect the business will return to growth in the fourth quarter. 
In Europe, Old Skool and Sk8-Hi were also very successful, strengthened by high-impact window executions at retail. Nintendo was also a success in Europe as we integrated the launch with in-store activations, House of Vans launch event and wholesale specific programs.
Notably, on the first day of the Nintendo launch, e-commerce had its best sales state ever.
In Asia, Vans revenue was up mid-teens, driven by more than 30% DTC growth and a mid-single-digit increase in our wholesale business.
E-commerce definitely played a significant role in these results by nearly doubling its business and similar to the Americas in Europe, Nintendo was a hit with more than 50% sell-through in the first 4 weeks and e-commerce sell-through of more than 70%, driven by impressive brand activations at key stores, including our retail lab in Korea. So very pleased with these results. 
With the first half behind us and the momentum building for Vans globally, there are no changes to our full year outlook for high single-digit growth.
Now onto Timberland."

While these results were, for the most part, in line with our expectations for the brand's smallest quarter, as we enter the second half of the year, we have seen higher-than-anticipated inventory levels, particularly in our Americas business and anticipated more challenging sales environment. Accordingly, we're electing to take a more conservative view for the balance of 2016 as this product works through the channel.
Similar to the context for Vans Europe, we are confident that this is a short-term inventory imbalance versus a brand issue, and we're tempering sell-in for a quarter or 2 to allow inventory to normalize.
Timberland continues to outperform its competition, including market share gains and the brand help metrics that we track, including awareness, conversion and sell-through, remained strong. In fact, sell-through rates are healthy, which gives us great confidence that this will be a short term, normalizing sometimes in the fourth quarter.
Taking a look at the Americas, revenue was down at a high teen rate with wholesale business down 20% and D2C down at a mid-single-digit rate. Keep in mind that 3 quarters of Timberland's D2C business in the Americas is outlet based, which as you know is a channel that has seen reduced traffic.
Notably in the mix, however, was a 25% increase in e-commerce, so solid online growth.
Product-wise, men's boots continue to be relevant with strong sell-through in wholesale. Our distinctive Timberland boot company collection, driven by a new micro site launch, saw a nice pickup in the quarter, a solid validation of the brand's reach given the collection's premium price points.
On the women's side of the business, we continue to be very encouraged by the progress Timberland is making. Families like the Amherst and Newport Bay drove D2C women's casual comps up nearly 30% in full price and 50% in e-commerce. Contributing to this momentum, we launched our biggest spring effort ever through a partnership with Marie Claire, a program that ran across digital, print and in-store, driving digital engagement up over 80% versus last year.
And finally, with oil rig counts reaching an all-time low in May, the entire Workwear category, including our industrial PRO business, remains under significant pressure."

In apparel, we continued our improvement of the product in terms of fit, fabric and style, and did see very nice progress with our spring '16 collections, driving low double-digit growth in the quarter. So strong progress there.
Similarly, Asian revenue was down high single digits, primarily from weakness in traffic and spending in Hong Kong and Japan, its largest market in the region. 
E-commerce was a large driver for the quarter with more than 50% growth, including apparel, just up more than 60% in China.
In June, we opened a new workshop retail store in Shanghai, and we have seen strong early results.
We're taking a prudent approach to the second half. And we now expect low single-digit global revenue growth for Timberland in 2016.

This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit growth for the Jeanswear coalition. So once again, hats off to the global team. 
In the Americas region, Jeanswear revenues were up at a mid-single-digit rate, driven by a mid-single-digit increase for Wrangler and a low double-digit increase for Lee.
Wrangler's mass business remains strong with a high single-digit increase that marks the ninth consecutive quarter of growth for that business. The story that remains the same, a strong collaborative retail partnership with the mutual goal of bringing innovation and value to consumers. Our innovation story is stronger than ever. Wrangler Advanced Comfort outdoor performance shorts and Riders by Lee denim shorts and capris each saw meaningful increases in the channel. 
In contrast, and a trend we've spoken about over the past few quarters, our Western Specialty business was down as the oil and gas exploration communities continue to be hard-hit.
Lee saw excellent consumer response to the new innovative extreme comfort men's casual pant that has led to market share expansion and wholesale growth through new shelf space as well as expanded distribution and in a nod to the ultimate blend of elegance and performance, American ballet star, Misty Copeland, is pictured wearing Lee Dream Jean in the August issue of Cosmopolitan magazine.

Wrangler saw strength in both the wholesale and e-commerce businesses. During the quarter, we launched an out-of-home marketing campaign across Poland, Germany and Italy that boosted the region sell-through for our fall '16 products.
In Asia, Jeanswear's revenue was up at low single-digit rate, with a mid-single-digit increase in Lee, moderated by a slight decline in the Wrangler business. Lee's online sales more than doubled, helped significantly by the Jade Fusion 2.0 launch. Jade Fusion also led to outstanding digital metrics and achieved a record high social engagement of almost 2 million followers in key Chinese markets.

On the Workwear side, while we continue to see consistent strength in Red Kap's automotive shop gear line, it should be no surprise that with oil rig counts at historic lows, both Red Kap and Bulwark sales were down in the quarter. 
Given that, we'll begin to lap this decline in the second half and we do expect this business to return to modest growth in the fourth quarter. 
For the full year, globally, there's no change to the expectation that Imagewear revenue will be up at a low single-digit rate.
Our Sportswear business was down 19% in the quarter due to traffic decline in both wholesale and D2C.
Revenue at Nautica was down 20% due to the same challenges we've seen in the past few quarters, including heavy discounting and promotional environments in the U.S. department store channel, our strategic decision to license the women's sleepwear and men's underwear business and traffic declines at outlet, where we've closed 7 stores this year.
Kipling's North America business was down 16%, also due to challenging category and channel performance. Kipling's global business was up 3%, driven by strength in both wholesale and D2C in Europe and Asia Pacific. 
Accordingly, we're now expecting a low double-digit decline in revenues for the full year for our Sportswear coalition.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott."

On our last call, I spoke about VF's diverse business model and our consistent operational discipline. This discipline provides us with exceptional flexibility to deliver our financial commitments.
As you know, this quarter produced some additional noise into the mix of our year, including the announcement of an agreement to divest our Contemporary Brands coalition, greater visibility into bankruptcies, short-term challenges for Timberland and ongoing weakness in our Sportswear business.
Yet even amid all this noise, we have multiple levers at our disposal that enable us to deliver another year of earnings growth and shareholder value.
So let's review our results. In the second quarter, currency-neutral revenue increased 1% to $2.4 billion.
By coalition, Outdoor & Action Sports was up 2%, which is in line with expectations. Jeanswear continued its run with a 6% increase and Imagewear grew 3%.
Partially offsetting this growth was a 19% decline in Sportswear, which continues to face very challenging conditions. 
By channel, Direct-to-Consumer revenue was up 7%, with low double-digit growth in our Outdoor & Action Sports business being tempered by a mid-teen decrease in our Sportswear coalition. Currency-neutral wholesale revenue was flat in the quarter.
By region, the Americas was up 1%; Europe, up 3%; Asia, up 6%. Internationally, that is outside of the U.S., our business was up 7% in the quarter.
Gross margin was up slightly versus last year at 48.1% as benefits from pricing, lower product costs and mix were offset by FX and inventory management efforts.
In line with expectations, SG&A as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points as we continue to invest in key growth priorities, including D2C and product innovation.
Our second quarter operating margin was down 40 basis points to 8.6%, which included 40 basis points of negative impact from currency.
Clicking down into profitability by coalition. On a reported basis, we see that Outdoor & Action Sports operating income was down 9% and operating margin was 8.7%, a decrease of 100 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. 
Continued investment in D2C, product design, innovation and demand creation pressured first half earnings in light of the tougher first half revenue comparisons, coupled with negative impact from FX in 2016. We expect this to normalize in the second half when profitability returns to historic levels.
Operating income in Jeanswear was up 4% in the quarter with operating margin up 10 basis points to 17.3%, including the negative impact of FX. The strength in Jeanswear continues globally, and we are very pleased with this, our seventh consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit revenue growth.
Imagewear profit was up 3% and operating margin up 10 basis points to 14.3% due to strength in LSG, offset by weakness on the Workwear side of the business.
And finally in Sportswear, operating income was down significantly and the story there remains the same, challenging department store and D2C conditions with traffic and category weakness.
So carrying all this to the bottom line, our reported earnings per share was $0.35 in the second quarter, slightly ahead of where we thought we would be 90 days ago and overall, where we thought we'd be halfway through this year. 
And keep in mind, this result includes a $0.06 headwind due to changes in net tax discretes compared to last year. 
Regarding our balance sheet, inventories were up 6%, of which half remains that same cold weather carryover product we've spoken about on our last 2 calls. Our inventory is in line with our second half growth projections.
During the quarter, we bought back 1.9 million shares of VF stock for $120 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $834 million. So tracking well against the $1 billion target we set in February.
Turning now to outlook, which like the rest of our results today are based on continuing operations. We now expect full year revenues to increase 3% to 4%, down from the previous mid-single-digit expectation.
If you take a step back to gain perspective, this change is really about 2 main factors. First, we now expect the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition to grow at a mid-single-digit rate for the full year, down from the previous high single-digit outlook. This is due to bankruptcy in the sporting goods and action sports channel and a revised outlook for Timberland based on -- primarily on challenges in the Americas business. However, these elements, while short-lived in nature, do put enough pressure on the year for us to take Timberland's global outlook to a low single-digit growth versus the previous high single-digit increase.
The second factor is a lower outlook for our Sportswear business. For reasons previously discussed, we have updated our full year expectations to a low double-digit decline versus the previous expectation of slight decline.
Gross margin is expected to improve by 50 basis points, reaching 48.7%.
Now keep in mind the contemporary business carried a higher than VF average gross margin so when adjusted for this and continuing operations, 2015's gross margin is 10 basis points lower at 48.2%.
Operating margin is expected to reach 14.5%, which includes about 60 basis points of FX so right around 15% for the full year, excluding currency.
Note that, while the exclusion of Contemporary Brands hurt gross margin, it helps operating margin.
With respect to tax rate, our outlook for the full year is now about 21% versus the previous about 23% due to a beneficial shift in mix, new policies related to the treatment of equity comp and longer-term improvements we're making in our global tax structure.
At the bottom line, reported earnings per share is expected to increase 5% to $3.20, up 11% currency-neutral compared to EPS from continuing operations of $3.04 in 2015.
So even after adjusting for contemporary, we've maintained the same growth rate we targeted in February.
For the second half of the year, we expect revenue growth to be up about 5% with a low single-digit increase in the third quarter, followed by a high single-digit increase in the fourth quarter.
With respect to earnings cadence, we expect second half reported EPS to increase at a low teen percentage rate with a high single-digit increase in the third quarter and a mid- to high-teen increase in the fourth quarter, our easiest comparison of the year.
So to recap the changes to our 2016 outlook, revenue should grow 3% to 4%, down a bit due to bankruptcies, Timberland and Sportswear impacts. Gross margin expansion remains the same, and we took out $0.03 from the bottom line based on what Contemporary Brands would have directly contributed this year.
Flexibility, operational excellence, strong cash flow and balance sheet and strategic financial management. From any angle, our model allows us to transcend short-term challenges and consistently deliver total shareholder return. And more importantly, it enables us to continue investing in our business and aggressively manage inventories for the long term without sacrificing shareholder returns along the way. We believe this combination uniquely positions us to accelerate growth and profitability when the overall environment returns to greater strength.
And with that, we'll turn it back over to the operator and open up the call for questions."

I'll take that question. Our organic growth rate goals remain intact. Clearly, this year, we're off to a slower start, given all the implications of last winter and the inventory hangover that we faced in the first half of this year. But when you step back and look at our organic growth rate, internationally, we were up 7%. That tells us that against that 8% organic growth rate goal, outside of the U.S., we're pretty much on track. The most confidence-inspiring part of this for me is that, in our direct-to-consumer business globally, we were up 7%. So being up 7% in our stores tells us that consumers are buying from us at the kind of growth rate that we have built into our long-term vision. Unfortunately, that's only about 27% of our business. Our wholesale business is not experiencing that, but that's not to say that our wholesale business -- the consumer takeout from our wholesalers isn't strong. What it says is that they have a lot of inventory and they're buying very cautiously. Our wholesale business is a reflection of what we're shipping to them this quarter for sale next quarter, and not a reflection of consumer engagement. So we still think we have the brand portfolio and the -- we're doing the right things with our brands, to engage consumers at a near 8% growth rate even this year, which is clearly a pretty challenging year around the world. Obviously, the shape of VF is going to change. It's much easier and easier to manage the timing of selling something than it is buying the right thing. We're actively managing our portfolio, working equally hard on both divestitures and on acquisitions. The timing of one is more predictable than the other, but we're committed to both."

So the inventory imbalance we talked about is primarily Americas issue, and we see it primarily in our boots category. It really started to see this at the beginning of early Q2, both in our wholesale and PRO business.

We feel really good about our brand metrics as I mentioned in my comments, and we see just over the next quarter or 2, getting that inventory to normalize and why we're so confident about that is we've seen really good rates of sale through the second -- through the first half that continue into the second half. And that e-commerce growth rate of plus 25 continues to give us confidence around our ability to connect with the consumer and represent our brand in a really positive way. So we see returning to growth in the second half, low single digit, mid-single-digit despite -- we're coming up against the Q3 in 2015, where we grew over 40%. So we -- that's -- I would tell you, kind of frame up why we're positive. As the brand continues strong, the sell-through rates are good.

And in the case of Timberland, we will continue to drive our boots. The boot trend is still alive and well, and we've got some great offerings, along with our SensorFlex platform and that has been in place now for 3 years and continues to gain momentum and grab share, not only here, but mostly, I would see it in our international markets."

Unless otherwise noted, amounts that our participants refer to on today's call will be predominantly in currency-neutral terms, which we've defined in the press release that was issued at 6:55 a.m. Eastern time this morning. These currency-neutral amounts as lead numbers in our discussion because we feel it more accurately represents the true operational performance and underlying results of our businesses and brands.
You may also hear us refer to reported amounts, which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These amounts include the impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to currency-neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial information included with the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items. 
On June 30, we announced an agreement to sell our Contemporary Brands business, which includes the 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss brands. Appropriately, we have classified the assets and liabilities of these businesses as held for sale and therefore, have moved their results into discontinued operations.
Therefore, unless otherwise noted, results presented on today's call are based on continuing operations. Removing this business from the mix impacts the P&L for both 2015 and 2016 and we have furnished a full year 2015 P&L, which designates the impacts.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2016 earnings call.
All global companies operate in diverse and complicated environments, yet over both the short and long term, VF has been very consistent in our ability to effectively manage our business under a variety of conditions.
We're a company with many capabilities, many opportunities and great confidence in our ability to execute. This doesn't happen by luck or accident. It comes from experience, judgment and a track record of consistency. Our consistency is built on an unparalleled focus on our consumers, optimizing product and retail innovation and superior financial discipline, which together, push our operational capabilities to even greater levels. This complements our obsession with the total performance-based approach to shareholder return.
The second quarter, although our smallest by revenue and profit, is exactly the quarter where consistency plays a critical role in supporting any year at VF, and this year is no exception. I'm pleased to report that our second quarter results were a little better than our expectations, and that our first half of 2016 came in as promised. And the fact that this came in as promised gives us great confidence in our ability to deliver on our outlook for the full year.
So let's dig down a little bit. Revenue for the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition was up 2%, driven by a 6% increase in Vans and 2% growth in The North Face. This was tempered by a 7% decline in Timberland, which was softer than we expected, but overall, the coalition was in line with where we thought we'd be 90 days ago.
Jeanswear posted its seventh consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit growth with revenue up 6% and balanced in both brands and in all regions, a truly impressive performance by our Jeanswear team.
Our Imagewear coalition, which grew 3%, featured our fastest-growing business and brand of the quarter with a mid-teen increase in our Licensed Sports Group, driven by nearly 30% growth from our Majestic brand. Congratulations to the dedicated team in that business who clearly delivered for us in the quarter.
To round it out, our Sportswear business saw revenue decline 19%, a result driven by a very challenging U.S. department store and outlet environment and though we expect this environment to remain challenging, we expect this business to modestly improve in the balance of the year.
In February, we said that we intended to take a focused and proactive look at the composition of our portfolio to ensure we're well positioned to maximize growth and return to shareholders.
During the quarter, we announced that VF had signed an agreement to sell our Contemporary Brand business, which includes 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss, to Delta Galil Industries. This announcement demonstrates that our work as active portfolio managers is progressing. And while it's certainly hard to part with people we've come to know, respect and like, we had every confidence that this talented and passionate group is on the best path for long-term success.
You're also aware that we're exploring strategic alternatives for LSG business within the Imagewear coalition. This process is ongoing and we'll update you when we have something more to report.
Now back to some highlights. Our second quarter direct-to-consumer business was up 7%, including mid-teen international growth and a low single digit increase in the U.S. and this growth was balanced. In fact, on a global basis, 9 of our 10 largest brands saw revenue increases. 
Our e-commerce business continued its strong momentum as well with revenue up nearly 30%. In line with expectations, our wholesale business was flat globally as many partners continue working through inventory from last winter and a sluggish first half of 2016, trends we expect to continue into our third quarter.
Our international sales were up 7% overall with Europe, up 3%; Asia, up 6% and our non-U.S. Americas region growing 20%.
Gross margin on a reported basis improved slightly to 48.1% and reported earnings per share was $0.35 so $0.01 better than our original outlook, but in line to support our full year EPS expectation of 5% growth.
Looking into the second half of 2016 with 60% of our revenue and 70% of our earnings still ahead of us, we have resolute confidence in our ability to deliver on our full year outlook.
And to address head-on what some have called out as concerns, I'd tell you that, yes, we do in fact have wholesale orders in hand and need to see additions in both brick and click to support this expected growth.
Yes, our wholesale order book is more fourth quarter weighted than in 2015.  Yes, retailers do have a cautious outlook on winter and that, too, is baked in.
And finally, yes, our outlook is fourth quarter heavy. Yet we are up against what is, by far, our weakest comparison of the year, which I'll remind you was down 1% in 2015 so math's on our side as well.
That said, you can expect to see VF continue to drive brand energy through product innovation and closer connections with our consumers. We'll continue to leverage the power of our portfolio to deliver long-term improvements in gross margin, drive SG&A productivity and improve overall profitability to maximize shareholders returns.
It's what you've come to expect from VF and what we expect from ourselves. Over to Steve."

Revenue was up 2% in the second quarter, driven by a low double-digit increase in D2C and a low single-digit decrease in wholesale. This result was about what we expected 90 days ago and keep in mind, the second quarter is Outdoor & Action Sports' smallest quarter of the year, both from a revenue and earnings perspective. So in total, we checked the box.
Now let's take a look at VF's largest brands. Globally, second quarter revenue for The North Face was up 2%, driven by more than 20% growth in D2C, which was offset by a high single-digit decline in wholesale. In the Americas region, revenue was up at a low single-digit rate, with more than 20% growth in D2C, which included strong e-commerce results.
On the wholesale side, revenue was down at a high single-digit rate due to bankruptcies and in order book that is planned later in the year, which will naturally shift the majority of growth to the fourth quarter.
During the second quarter, warmer weather categories, including Sportswear product and accessories, saw significant momentum, and were up 40% and 60%, respectively.
In men's fleece, sales doubled, driven by strategic shift to broaden our assortment of technical styles. 
In women's, newer silhouettes like the Tomales Bay jacket are also seeing strong response and we're very proud that Outside Magazine featured several North Face products in their summer buyers guide, including our Fovero 70 pack, which won Outside Magazine's Gear of the Year award. This demonstrates that our continued focus to broaden our spring-summer assortment is working.
We're also supporting our spring-summer relevancy through consumer experiences, like our Endurance Challenge series of trail races, which drew over 13,000 attendees across events this past spring and community workouts that we sponsored twice a week in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, New York and D.C. 
In April, The North Face relocated its Palo Alto, California store and significantly elevated the retail experience through highly curated merchandising and digital storytelling. Through innovative interior sky windows, information is displayed about North Face's global athlete team, weather forecasts, topographic maps and community information.
During the opening weekend, North Face virtual reality was featured, which is an immersive 360-degree 3D video and audio experience that virtually drops viewers into outdoor landscapes such as Moab, Yosemite and Nepal, an innovative example and a living lab that represents how we're starting to transform consumer experiences in our own retail stores, and one of many that we plan to scale in the upcoming months.

The North Face European business had another strong quarter with revenues up at the low teen rates, driven by more than 25% growth in DTC and a mid-single-digit increase in our wholesale business.  And the growth was balanced and broad-based, too, with double-digit increases in the U.K., Germany, Benelux, Italy and Spain.
A great product highlight was our Footwear business, which grew more than 20%. This was supported by marketing campaigns and product styles, to help build on the momentum the team has been working on.
Our Mountain Athletics collection across Europe had a successful start to the year with over 60% sales-through in wholesale and a 60% increase in DTC.
In Asia, second quarter revenue was down at the mid-teen rate, which was about in line with our expectations. This result was driven by low double-digit growth in DTC, including more than 35% growth in the e-commerce business. This was offset by weak wholesale results, due in part to timing of shipments. We expect the region to continue sequential improvement and return to growth in the fourth quarter.
During the quarter, we launched our water adventure series, which features sustainable products, including waterproof jackets and bags.
In April, we launched our outdoor training category, which features durable breathable materials maximized for running and training outdoors.
To drive visibility in China and Hong Kong, we continue to host free outside group workout sessions, led by experienced trainers.
Social engagement around this effort has already seen more than 16 million social impressions.
Globally, the first half of 2016 finished well for The North Face, and we are right on track to reach our full year expectations of mid-single-digit growth.

Looking at regions. In the Americas, revenue was up at a high single-digit rate with a low double-digit increase in D2C, including over 25% growth in e-commerce and a mid-single-digit increase in wholesale. 
During the quarter, Vans showed the strength of its diverse classics offering, specifically the Sk8-Hi and Old Skool Side Stripe styles, driving strong momentum with meaningful increases in women's sell-through. This success bodes well as we look at scaling a number of new silhouettes in the upcoming seasons.
During the quarter, Vans launched another exciting collaboration with Nintendo, celebrating their iconic videogame, Heritage, including an extensive collection of footwear, apparel and accessories, featuring Nintendo's extensive cast of iconic characters. The social media reception to this collaboration has been phenomenal, and it's performing well against expectations, which is no easy feat, given it's up against the massive Disney launch of last year's second quarter.
With Vans kicking off its 50th anniversary year on March 16, the spring was packed with events across the country.
In May, we continued our programming at the House of Vans in New York, which included music, creative workshops and documentary screenings.
In June, the Vans Warped Tour kicked off its 22nd year, bringing music, Vans' culture and fans together for more than 40 stops around the country.
And tomorrow, the U.S. Open of Surfing kicks off in Huntington Beach where the world's elite in surfing, skateboard and BMX reach for the podium.
As a complete emerging into Vans' culture, this festival-wide celebration of action sports, creative expression and youth culture is about as core as it gets."

The low double-digit increase in DTC offset by a mid-teen decline in wholesale. These results were on track with what we expected 90 days ago, as the business continues to manage through elevated inventory.
With a slight decline in Vans Europe expected in Q3, we continue to make progress and expect the business will return to growth in the fourth quarter. 
In Europe, Old Skool and Sk8-Hi were also very successful, strengthened by high-impact window executions at retail. Nintendo was also a success in Europe as we integrated the launch with in-store activations, House of Vans launch event and wholesale specific programs.
Notably, on the first day of the Nintendo launch, e-commerce had its best sales state ever.
In Asia, Vans revenue was up mid-teens, driven by more than 30% DTC growth and a mid-single-digit increase in our wholesale business.
E-commerce definitely played a significant role in these results by nearly doubling its business and similar to the Americas in Europe, Nintendo was a hit with more than 50% sell-through in the first 4 weeks and e-commerce sell-through of more than 70%, driven by impressive brand activations at key stores, including our retail lab in Korea. So very pleased with these results. 
With the first half behind us and the momentum building for Vans globally, there are no changes to our full year outlook for high single-digit growth.
Now onto Timberland."

While these results were, for the most part, in line with our expectations for the brand's smallest quarter, as we enter the second half of the year, we have seen higher-than-anticipated inventory levels, particularly in our Americas business and anticipated more challenging sales environment. Accordingly, we're electing to take a more conservative view for the balance of 2016 as this product works through the channel.
Similar to the context for Vans Europe, we are confident that this is a short-term inventory imbalance versus a brand issue, and we're tempering sell-in for a quarter or 2 to allow inventory to normalize.
Timberland continues to outperform its competition, including market share gains and the brand help metrics that we track, including awareness, conversion and sell-through, remained strong. In fact, sell-through rates are healthy, which gives us great confidence that this will be a short term, normalizing sometimes in the fourth quarter.
Taking a look at the Americas, revenue was down at a high teen rate with wholesale business down 20% and D2C down at a mid-single-digit rate. Keep in mind that 3 quarters of Timberland's D2C business in the Americas is outlet based, which as you know is a channel that has seen reduced traffic.
Notably in the mix, however, was a 25% increase in e-commerce, so solid online growth.
Product-wise, men's boots continue to be relevant with strong sell-through in wholesale. Our distinctive Timberland boot company collection, driven by a new micro site launch, saw a nice pickup in the quarter, a solid validation of the brand's reach given the collection's premium price points.
On the women's side of the business, we continue to be very encouraged by the progress Timberland is making. Families like the Amherst and Newport Bay drove D2C women's casual comps up nearly 30% in full price and 50% in e-commerce. Contributing to this momentum, we launched our biggest spring effort ever through a partnership with Marie Claire, a program that ran across digital, print and in-store, driving digital engagement up over 80% versus last year.
And finally, with oil rig counts reaching an all-time low in May, the entire Workwear category, including our industrial PRO business, remains under significant pressure."

A huge contributor to this came from our e-commerce channel, where demand transitioned to VF's global digit platform, enabling faster closer consumer engagement and more effective handling of the site. 
The wholesale channel increased as well by a mid-single-digit rate.
Looking at product, after a very successful SensorFlex campaign, we drove traffic through summer Heritage Collections in men's and women's boat shoes.
With our new advertising campaign in digital and traditional media, we doubled our consumer reach and executed a seamless campaign in more than 600 store windows.
In apparel, we continued our improvement of the product in terms of fit, fabric and style, and did see very nice progress with our spring '16 collections, driving low double-digit growth in the quarter. So strong progress there.
Similarly, Asian revenue was down high single digits, primarily from weakness in traffic and spending in Hong Kong and Japan, its largest market in the region. 
E-commerce was a large driver for the quarter with more than 50% growth, including apparel, just up more than 60% in China.
In June, we opened a new workshop retail store in Shanghai, and we have seen strong early results.
We're taking a prudent approach to the second half. And we now expect low single-digit global revenue growth for Timberland in 2016.

This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit growth for the Jeanswear coalition. So once again, hats off to the global team. 
In the Americas region, Jeanswear revenues were up at a mid-single-digit rate, driven by a mid-single-digit increase for Wrangler and a low double-digit increase for Lee.
Wrangler's mass business remains strong with a high single-digit increase that marks the ninth consecutive quarter of growth for that business. The story that remains the same, a strong collaborative retail partnership with the mutual goal of bringing innovation and value to consumers. Our innovation story is stronger than ever. Wrangler Advanced Comfort outdoor performance shorts and Riders by Lee denim shorts and capris each saw meaningful increases in the channel. 
In contrast, and a trend we've spoken about over the past few quarters, our Western Specialty business was down as the oil and gas exploration communities continue to be hard-hit.
Lee saw excellent consumer response to the new innovative extreme comfort men's casual pant that has led to market share expansion and wholesale growth through new shelf space as well as expanded distribution and in a nod to the ultimate blend of elegance and performance, American ballet star, Misty Copeland, is pictured wearing Lee Dream Jean in the August issue of Cosmopolitan magazine.
We saw very strong retail sales of Lee's seasonal products, including shorts and capris, especially once the weather turned warmer in May."

These saw great success in the quarter, driven by positive results across all categories. A couple of highlights include continuing double-digit trends in our top 10 accounts, our at-once business and the strong start for our new Scarlet for women and Rider for men products. 
Wrangler saw strength in both the wholesale and e-commerce businesses. During the quarter, we launched an out-of-home marketing campaign across Poland, Germany and Italy that boosted the region sell-through for our fall '16 products.
In Asia, Jeanswear's revenue was up at low single-digit rate, with a mid-single-digit increase in Lee, moderated by a slight decline in the Wrangler business. Lee's online sales more than doubled, helped significantly by the Jade Fusion 2.0 launch. Jade Fusion also led to outstanding digital metrics and achieved a record high social engagement of almost 2 million followers in key Chinese markets.
For the full year, globally, there's no change to the expectation of mid-single-digit revenue growth in Jeanswear.

In LSG, Major League Baseball jersey demand was strong, aided by continued success of the Cool Base replica jersey as well as the addition of 3 new teams in the Japanese Professional League.
In the NBA, the Cavaliers championship delivered strong results for the license portfolio.
On the Workwear side, while we continue to see consistent strength in Red Kap's automotive shop gear line, it should be no surprise that with oil rig counts at historic lows, both Red Kap and Bulwark sales were down in the quarter. 
Given that, we'll begin to lap this decline in the second half and we do expect this business to return to modest growth in the fourth quarter. 
For the full year, globally, there's no change to the expectation that Imagewear revenue will be up at a low single-digit rate.
Our Sportswear business was down 19% in the quarter due to traffic decline in both wholesale and D2C.
Revenue at Nautica was down 20% due to the same challenges we've seen in the past few quarters, including heavy discounting and promotional environments in the U.S. department store channel, our strategic decision to license the women's sleepwear and men's underwear business and traffic declines at outlet, where we've closed 7 stores this year.
Kipling's North America business was down 16%, also due to challenging category and channel performance. Kipling's global business was up 3%, driven by strength in both wholesale and D2C in Europe and Asia Pacific. 
Accordingly, we're now expecting a low double-digit decline in revenues for the full year for our Sportswear coalition.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott."

On our last call, I spoke about VF's diverse business model and our consistent operational discipline. This discipline provides us with exceptional flexibility to deliver our financial commitments.
As you know, this quarter produced some additional noise into the mix of our year, including the announcement of an agreement to divest our Contemporary Brands coalition, greater visibility into bankruptcies, short-term challenges for Timberland and ongoing weakness in our Sportswear business.
Yet even amid all this noise, we have multiple levers at our disposal that enable us to deliver another year of earnings growth and shareholder value.
So let's review our results. In the second quarter, currency-neutral revenue increased 1% to $2.4 billion.
By coalition, Outdoor & Action Sports was up 2%, which is in line with expectations. Jeanswear continued its run with a 6% increase and Imagewear grew 3%.
Partially offsetting this growth was a 19% decline in Sportswear, which continues to face very challenging conditions. 
By channel, Direct-to-Consumer revenue was up 7%, with low double-digit growth in our Outdoor & Action Sports business being tempered by a mid-teen decrease in our Sportswear coalition. Currency-neutral wholesale revenue was flat in the quarter.
By region, the Americas was up 1%; Europe, up 3%; Asia, up 6%. Internationally, that is outside of the U.S., our business was up 7% in the quarter.
Gross margin was up slightly versus last year at 48.1% as benefits from pricing, lower product costs and mix were offset by FX and inventory management efforts.
In line with expectations, SG&A as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points as we continue to invest in key growth priorities, including D2C and product innovation.
Our second quarter operating margin was down 40 basis points to 8.6%, which included 40 basis points of negative impact from currency.
Clicking down into profitability by coalition. On a reported basis, we see that Outdoor & Action Sports operating income was down 9% and operating margin was 8.7%, a decrease of 100 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. 
Continued investment in D2C, product design, innovation and demand creation pressured first half earnings in light of the tougher first half revenue comparisons, coupled with negative impact from FX in 2016. We expect this to normalize in the second half when profitability returns to historic levels.
Operating income in Jeanswear was up 4% in the quarter with operating margin up 10 basis points to 17.3%, including the negative impact of FX. The strength in Jeanswear continues globally, and we are very pleased with this, our seventh consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit revenue growth.
Imagewear profit was up 3% and operating margin up 10 basis points to 14.3% due to strength in LSG, offset by weakness on the Workwear side of the business.
And finally in Sportswear, operating income was down significantly and the story there remains the same, challenging department store and D2C conditions with traffic and category weakness.
So carrying all this to the bottom line, our reported earnings per share was $0.35 in the second quarter, slightly ahead of where we thought we would be 90 days ago and overall, where we thought we'd be halfway through this year. 
And keep in mind, this result includes a $0.06 headwind due to changes in net tax discretes compared to last year. 
Regarding our balance sheet, inventories were up 6%, of which half remains that same cold weather carryover product we've spoken about on our last 2 calls. Our inventory is in line with our second half growth projections.
During the quarter, we bought back 1.9 million shares of VF stock for $120 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $834 million. So tracking well against the $1 billion target we set in February.
Turning now to outlook, which like the rest of our results today are based on continuing operations. We now expect full year revenues to increase 3% to 4%, down from the previous mid-single-digit expectation.
If you take a step back to gain perspective, this change is really about 2 main factors. First, we now expect the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition to grow at a mid-single-digit rate for the full year, down from the previous high single-digit outlook. This is due to bankruptcy in the sporting goods and action sports channel and a revised outlook for Timberland based on -- primarily on challenges in the Americas business. However, these elements, while short-lived in nature, do put enough pressure on the year for us to take Timberland's global outlook to a low single-digit growth versus the previous high single-digit increase.
The second factor is a lower outlook for our Sportswear business. For reasons previously discussed, we have updated our full year expectations to a low double-digit decline versus the previous expectation of slight decline.
Gross margin is expected to improve by 50 basis points, reaching 48.7%.
Now keep in mind the contemporary business carried a higher than VF average gross margin so when adjusted for this and continuing operations, 2015's gross margin is 10 basis points lower at 48.2%.
Operating margin is expected to reach 14.5%, which includes about 60 basis points of FX so right around 15% for the full year, excluding currency.
Note that, while the exclusion of Contemporary Brands hurt gross margin, it helps operating margin.
With respect to tax rate, our outlook for the full year is now about 21% versus the previous about 23% due to a beneficial shift in mix, new policies related to the treatment of equity comp and longer-term improvements we're making in our global tax structure.
At the bottom line, reported earnings per share is expected to increase 5% to $3.20, up 11% currency-neutral compared to EPS from continuing operations of $3.04 in 2015.
So even after adjusting for contemporary, we've maintained the same growth rate we targeted in February.
For the second half of the year, we expect revenue growth to be up about 5% with a low single-digit increase in the third quarter, followed by a high single-digit increase in the fourth quarter.
With respect to earnings cadence, we expect second half reported EPS to increase at a low teen percentage rate with a high single-digit increase in the third quarter and a mid- to high-teen increase in the fourth quarter, our easiest comparison of the year.
So to recap the changes to our 2016 outlook, revenue should grow 3% to 4%, down a bit due to bankruptcies, Timberland and Sportswear impacts. Gross margin expansion remains the same, and we took out $0.03 from the bottom line based on what Contemporary Brands would have directly contributed this year.
Flexibility, operational excellence, strong cash flow and balance sheet and strategic financial management. From any angle, our model allows us to transcend short-term challenges and consistently deliver total shareholder return. And more importantly, it enables us to continue investing in our business and aggressively manage inventories for the long term without sacrificing shareholder returns along the way. We believe this combination uniquely positions us to accelerate growth and profitability when the overall environment returns to greater strength.
And with that, we'll turn it back over to the operator and open up the call for questions."

I'll take that question. Our organic growth rate goals remain intact. Clearly, this year, we're off to a slower start, given all the implications of last winter and the inventory hangover that we faced in the first half of this year. But when you step back and look at our organic growth rate, internationally, we were up 7%. That tells us that against that 8% organic growth rate goal, outside of the U.S., we're pretty much on track. The most confidence-inspiring part of this for me is that, in our direct-to-consumer business globally, we were up 7%. So being up 7% in our stores tells us that consumers are buying from us at the kind of growth rate that we have built into our long-term vision. Unfortunately, that's only about 27% of our business. Our wholesale business is not experiencing that, but that's not to say that our wholesale business -- the consumer takeout from our wholesalers isn't strong. What it says is that they have a lot of inventory and they're buying very cautiously. Our wholesale business is a reflection of what we're shipping to them this quarter for sale next quarter, and not a reflection of consumer engagement. So we still think we have the brand portfolio and the -- we're doing the right things with our brands, to engage consumers at a near 8% growth rate even this year, which is clearly a pretty challenging year around the world. Obviously, the shape of VF is going to change. It's much easier and easier to manage the timing of selling something than it is buying the right thing. We're actively managing our portfolio, working equally hard on both divestitures and on acquisitions. The timing of one is more predictable than the other, but we're committed to both."

So the inventory imbalance we talked about is primarily Americas issue, and we see it primarily in our boots category. It really started to see this at the beginning of early Q2, both in our wholesale and PRO business. And it's truly a short-term inventory balance because what we see is just a little bit of inventory sitting in our channels, coming out of last fourth quarter and similar to our Vans Europe business, it's not a product or brand issue. We feel really good about our brand metrics as I mentioned in my comments, and we see just over the next quarter or 2, getting that inventory to normalize and why we're so confident about that is we've seen really good rates of sale through the second -- through the first half that continue into the second half. And that e-commerce growth rate of plus 25 continues to give us confidence around our ability to connect with the consumer and represent our brand in a really positive way. So we see returning to growth in the second half, low single digit, mid-single-digit despite -- we're coming up against the Q3 in 2015, where we grew over 40%. So we -- that's -- I would tell you, kind of frame up why we're positive. As the brand continues strong, the sell-through rates are good.

But in the case of The North Face, we'll be really anchoring ourselves in these new brand territories I've talked about, driving our Summit Series collection, which continues to evolve after its relaunch last year on a global basis and also driving Mountain Athletics in footwear. And in the case of Timberland, we will continue to drive our boots. The boot trend is still alive and well, and we've got some great offerings, along with our SensorFlex platform and that has been in place now for 3 years and continues to gain momentum and grab share, not only here, but mostly, I would see it in our international markets."

You'll hear that our third quarter results confirm our ability to deliver value in an uneven global economy. You will hear caution around the external environment and confidence that our operational discipline can safeguard profitability in the near and long term. But what you won't hear is that it's business as usual for VF. 
Let's start with the environment. Last October, our year-to-date revenue on a comp basis was up 9% and EPS was up 17%, including broad-based strength across our brands and regions around the world. However, during the past 4 quarters, weak consumer spending, the warmest winter on record, retail bankruptcies and excess inventory in the off-price channel have had an outsized impact, particularly on our U.S. business. Consistently positive results from our international business, which is about 40% of our revenues, have been somewhat offset by a slight decline in our U.S. business. Simply put, we've seen mixed results. 
By channel, our D2C business has seen steady growth, up 7% year-to-date, and we've made significant progress towards amplifying our connection with consumers in the space where we directly control our brands. In harnessing this powerful growth driver, we're keeping a sharpened eye toward brick and quick channel shifts while staying laser-focused on productivity and ensuring our growth-oriented investments are balanced accordingly. 
In wholesale, conservative retailer open buys, buy-now-wear-now calendar shifts and leaner inventory positions remain among the top priorities for many retailers. As you'd imagine, this conservatism has put even greater pressure on vendors who are being asked to take on larger inventory risk to meet demand closer to consumer need. And while we don't like it, rather than speculatively building inventory, we reduced our inventory buys to protect our brands and ensure channel health, and we're pulling various levers to preserve gross margin expansion and ensure profitability. With inventory up only 1%, we're confidently managing the business to be in line with the environment. 
That said, let's take a look at how this environment impacted our third quarter top line results. Revenue was down 1%. And while we were down in the U.S., VF's international business was up 6%, with a 6% increase in Europe, a 9% increase in the non-U.S. Americas region and 4% growth in Asia Pacific. 
Our direct-to-consumer business was also up 6%, with strength in the Outdoor & Action Sports and Jeanswear coalitions being tempered by ongoing weakness in Sportswear. Our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition was up 2%, driven by an 8% increase in Vans and essentially flat results for both The North Face and Timberland. Keep in mind these 3 brands faced tough comps against last year's third quarter when Timberland was up 21%, The North Face up 11% and Vans up 10% in a very different environment. 
Let's take a moment on Vans and paraphrasing Mark Twain. The reports of Vans' decline have been greatly exaggerated, so let's take a closer look. Unless you've been following along all year, Vans' 8% growth on top of last year's 10% growth doesn't tell the whole story. As we detailed on previous calls, Vans' EMEA business, which is about 25% of global revenue, have been working through an inventory imbalance in 2016. This work-through saw Vans' EMEA revenue down slightly this quarter, which is exactly what we expected, and we still expect the brand to return to growth in the last quarter of this year. 
In Asia, the Vans momentum continued, with revenue up more than 20%. Now in the Americas, despite reports from channel checks and even partner commentary that was mistakenly interpreted to our brand, the Vans business was up 10%, which is an acceleration of 9% in the second quarter and 8% in the first quarter. That makes 10% growth on top of 10% growth for the Vans America business. So by quarter, 8%, 9% and 10%, and we're expecting the fourth quarter to be in line with the third. And yes, that's more detailed than we normally give but it just seemed necessary this time around. 
Next up, and returning to the mixed and uneven environment theme, Jeanswear revenue was down 4% following 7 consecutive quarters of mid-single-digit growth. Steve will go into greater detail about the particulars in the quarter. But on balance for the year, Q3 should prove to be an anomaly, and we expect Jeanswear to return to mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. 
Our Imagewear  coalition declined 4% as growth on our Licensed Sports Group was offset by ongoing sector challenges in the workwear business. And despite the revenue decline, profited remains strong, up more than 2 points. Our Sportswear business saw revenue decline 13%, and the story there remains the same: trouble in U.S. department store and outlet conditions, along with general category weakness. And finally, in August, we completed the sale of the Contemporary Brands business to Delta Galil Industries. 
Now rounding up the P&L. On a currency-neutral basis, our gross margin was up 130 basis points to 49%, and our operating margin was up 50 basis points to 18.6%. Take that through to the bottom line and currency-neutral EPS was up 16%. While we're certainly not satisfied with this quarter's top line performance, we clearly demonstrated some of the many levers we have at our disposal to ultimately get the EPS job done, and we did just that. 
So what's not business as usual? The current environment has led us to employ even greater analysis with respect to the areas of the business where we can become stronger, more efficient and more effective, from processes and operations to product creation, category expansion and distribution opportunities, to the shape of our brand portfolio and where we ultimately plan to take it in our next chapter. All of this requires an aggressive yet measured and holistic approach to marketplace management to bring the industry's most compelling and innovative products to consumers more quickly, delivering premium experiences whenever, wherever and however they connect with our brands. Our approach is centered on the development of business scenarios assessing the risk and opportunities by brand and platforms and the playbook necessary to address them and then leveraging the full power of VF's operational and financial disciplines. If this sounds like just the type of content that would fill an Investor Day, then you would be correct, an event we're targeting for some time late in the first quarter of 2017, with more details to follow. 
And speaking of next chapters, we announced earlier this month that I'm retiring from the CEO position and will remain Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. The board named Steve Rendle CEO effective January 1. I give VF's board a lot of credit for its long-standing rigorous approach to succession planning, and Steve's selection is the direct result of this process. When I became CEO 9 years ago, within the first few months, the board began work to identify and prepare the right person to succeed me. Steve is the right person. 
I know most of you have had the pleasure of meeting Steve, and I can assure you VF will be in very capable hands. Steve?"

I look forward to January 1 and the incredible opportunities that lie ahead for VF in its next chapter. 
For now, let's take a look at Q3. Starting with the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition. Revenue was up 2%. As described earlier, where we control our brands directly, we continue to see consistent growth. In the quarter, Outdoor & Action Sports D2C was up low double digits with positive results in 9 of our 11 brands. This was offset by a low single-digit decline in wholesale, where a tough comp against last year's low-teen increase, buy-now-wear-now calendar shifts and bankruptcies tempered results. 
Turning to our 3 largest brands. Revenue for The North Face was flat, with a mid-teen increase in D2C offset by a mid-single-digit decline in wholesale. Keep in mind that last year, The North Face grew 11% in the third quarter. So even though the results were flat, we performed relatively well given the changes in the environment and retailer caution around orders headed into this winter season. On a comp basis, if you exclude impacts from bankruptcies, global revenues for The North Face would have been up at a mid-single-digit rate. 
In the Americas, revenue was down mid-single digits, with healthy mid-teen D2C growth offset by a low double-digit decline in wholesale. Bankruptcies had a big impact on our wholesale business. Without them, total revenue for North Face Americas would have been flat in the quarter versus a mid-single-digit decline. Versus last year, we did see a meaningful shift of retailers wanting deliveries later in the calendar, particularly a third to fourth quarter shift. This reflects the desire to have leaner inventory positions and match consumers buy-now-wear-now behavior. Setting floors with seasonal products when it's actually the season is a shift we believe is appropriate and one that should eventually help mitigate what's been a volatile markdown environment. 
Taking a look at some of the product highlights during the quarter. As we continue to evolve our 4-season strategy, warm weather categories like training apparel, lightweight outerwear and sportswear continue to resonate. Our Mountain Athletics collection, along with products like Dryzzle, Venture and Millerton, have seen some early season momentum. 
Additionally, Thermal 3D, our new smooth-faced fleece, is already a top 5 selling sportswear style in our direct-to-consumer business. We also saw strong results in backpacks and logo wear [ph], which, combined, were up at a mid-teen rate. 
On the branding side, less than 2 weeks ago, in honor of its 50th anniversary, The North Face unveiled its new global brand campaign, Question Madness. The campaign's digital content series showcases athletes from throughout the brand's history, examining individual mottos for exploration and the gratification that comes from pushing norms and boundaries. And finally on Wednesday this week, The North Face officially opens its Fifth Avenue store in New York City, an immersive brand experience that includes an interactive climbing wall, our unique consumer segmentation strategy and custom product that will only be available at that location. 
Clearly, a lot of momentum, innovation and experiences at play, yet we're electing to take a cautious approach to the balance of the year to more closely mirror market conditions. Despite the fact that we feel well positioned with our inventory in the channel, it's readily apparent that there's a lot competitive product in the marketplace, particularly in the off-price channel,  that's stunting early autumn momentum. This, along with bankruptcies and warmer September and October conditions, have caused us to take a more prudent position with inventory to try to mitigate markdown risk and protect the long-term integrity of the brand. 
Given this conservativism in the Americas business, we are taking our full year global expectations down to low single-digit growth compared to the previous mid-single digit. This move is also mirrored in our full year Outdoor & Action Sports coalition outlook, certainly not what we'd like to do at this point, but on balance, the right thing to do for the brand and overall channel health. 
Now to KH."

Sportswear also performed strongly, with revenue up over 20%. In September, our new Thermoball campaign went live across e-commerce, retail and wholesale, good timing before cooler weather has started to set in. 
During the quarter, we opened our first Urban Exploration store in London, an active lifestyle-focused location geared at the city adventurer. We also opened our first brand store based on a new concept, with a higher focus on the consumer experience and our distinct consumer segmentation strategies. Early results have been very promising. We are really pleased with TNF's European business. The work we started a few years ago with respect to local-for-local product design, a targeted distribution strategy and changes in the way we reach consumers has put the business solidly on track for a very strong year. 
In Asia, third quarter revenue was down slightly. Our retail business saw mid-teen growth, driven by strength in Hong Kong and strong e-commerce sales, which more than doubled as we revamped our website. This was offset by mid-single-digit decline in wholesale due to heavy promotions across the outdoor category in China. Overall, we expect Asia to return to growth in the fourth quarter.

In the third quarter, Vans' global revenue was up 8%, driven by a mid-teen increase in D2C and a slight bump in wholesale driven by strong results in the Americas and Asia Pacific businesses. In the Americas, revenue was up 10%. D2C, which is more than 50% of this region's revenue, and there's your cautionary tale about market share data, was up at a low-teen rate, with 15% e-commerce growth. 
Wholesale revenue was up mid-single digits with fairly even strength across concepts. And to point out once again, this 10% increase follows 9% growth in Q2, which was up from 8% growth in Q1. 
During the quarter, our new light and Iso models met the demands of the athletic lifestyle-inspired consumer, with lightweight construction, new colors and materials. Our classic styles, specifically the Sk8-Hi and Old Skool, continue to perform really well and have been recently called out by quite a few magazines and blogs as the ""it"" shoe being frequently seen on the feet of celebrities, athletes and tastemakers worldwide. 
And of course, in its 50th year of business, Vans' heritage remains front of mind. As the original and still #1 skate shoe in core board shops, we continue to support skateboarders worldwide. During the quarter, Vans held its first Pro Skate Park Series competition in 4 countries to create the platform for skateboarding's inaugural participation in the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics. 
Earlier this month, Vans launched a collection celebrating the original characters from Disney's Toy Story movie, which showcases Andy's favorite toys across an extensive assortment of adult and kids footwear as well as apparel and accessories. Following Star Wars and Nintendo, the bar is set is pretty high, but early momentum on this one is very encouraging. 
To close out, Vans remains obsessively focused on their consumer and is becoming even better and more capable of delivering the right product across multiple channels. With momentum and the ever-present ""it"" factor on our side, we're looking forward to finishing yet another strong year for the brand in the Americas."

This result is right where we said we would be on our last call, so tracking along as planned. Independent of wholesale, which is where inventory actions have taken place all year, our DTC business has performed well, with revenue up 20%. This was driven by mid-teen comps in e-commerce, which was up more than 40% on the back of a new platform launch. 
Our iconic Old Skool and Sk8-Hi classic delivered solid [indiscernible] sales. Our Pro Skate performance was also strong, with sales up more than 30%, supported by the finals of the Pro Skate Park Series, which were held in Malmö, Sweden. Our apparel business also continues to show really strong results. Overall, for Vans Europe, we expect this business to return to growth in the fourth quarter. 
In Asia, Vans revenue continues to impress, with more than 20% growth, driven by almost 40% growth in DTC and a mid-teen increase in our wholesale business. Similar to last quarter, e-commerce had a significant role in these results by doubling its business. 
Looking at product. Old Skool continues to perform well and was up over 70% compared to last year while the Nintendo collection continues to be a hit and had over 80% sell-through. We also completed a series of House of Vans pop-up events across Asia, which continues to be a key brand activation platform centered around creative self-expression. With more than 45,000 attendees and over 2.5 million live video views in China, we are constantly driving momentum through visibility and consumer touch points.

Timberland had the toughest comparison at VF in the third quarter as it was up against a 20% -- 21% growth last year, which was driven by a 40% increase in the Americas business. Excluding impacts from bankruptcies, global revenues for Timberland would have been up at a low single-digit rate. 
The Americas had a mid-single-digit decline, with flat D2C results offset by mid-single-digit decline in wholesale. The dip in wholesale reflects the impacts of the proactive reduction in sell-in that we spoke about on our last call and the buy-now-wear-now calendar shift very similar to The North Face, with retailers trying to set floors later in the year for cold-weather product. 
D2C was flat, including gains in full-price stores and nearly a 30% increase in e-commerce being offset by outlet locations which saw a reduction in traffic. And similar to last quarter, the PRO business is still under pressure from subdued oil and gas exploration and industrial manufacturing. Product-wise, we've continued to see momentum in the men's casual footwear across both wholesale and D2C, which is positive validation that our diversification strategy is working. We're particularly excited about the success of our SensorFlex platform, with collections like Britton Hill and Amherst seeing excellent sell-through.  
Another bright spot is the Timberland Boot Company, which was our top family in D2C and saw strong results with our exclusive department store partner. At more than $300 a pair, this reinforces we have permission to play in the premium footwear market. In women's, we see a similar story with our casual footwear collections. Revenues for our heeled Glancy 6-inch boot were up 5x in D2C, and the Kenniston, again, a SensorFlex style, saw a strong sell-through as well, more proof points that Timberland's focus on women is paying off. 
Helping to drive the success, we launched a new marketing campaign touting the flex appeal of SensorFlex, hitting [ph] on both style and performance. The brand also launched a 360-degree marketing campaign centered on our yellow boot, driving extensive awareness, PR buzz and social engagement. In fact, the yellow boot video garnered over 3.5 million views in 6 weeks and was reported as best in class by YouTube."

Men's footwear was up nicely, supported by SensorFlex campaign. The new footwear technology combines the SensorFlex outsole with a cup sole look and is selling well. Casual category also performed and drove the footwear business to positive growth in the quarter despite the warm weather in Q3. 
In women's, we continue to innovate and bring new products to market with Kenniston being our #2 seller after the yellow boot. 
In apparel, new product introductions with updated fits, fabric and style contributed to a 30% increase in that business, especially outerwear category that performed very well, gaining market share against competition in new silhouettes. 
Revenue in Timberland's Asian business was down slightly, with low double-digit wholesale growth offset by a mid-teen decrease in DTC due to traffic declines in Singapore and Japan. This was partially offset by e-commerce, which was up more than 50% in the region. Killington sold too very well in the quarter, supported by impactful in-store marketing. 
In September, consumers in Japan camped out overnight to purchase items from the limited Timberland Monkey Time Apparel collection. The collaboration between the 2 brands that's sold-out in hours. 
Also just last week, Timberland launched its first ad e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia by opening a site in Singapore. So an excellent way to connect further with consumers in this important market. 
With the full year globally, there are no changes to the expectation that Timberland will see low single digit revenue growth. 
Now to Jeanswear."

While we did plan for the business to be down slightly based on changes in the timing of shipments, the decline was a little more than we had originally anticipated",402,"Our global Jeanswear business declined 4%, with similar declines at both Wrangler and Lee. While we did plan for the business to be down slightly based on changes in the timing of shipments, the decline was a little more than we had originally anticipated, but as Eric indicated, should still prove to be an anomaly for the full year. 
Our Americas business saw the majority of the decline which was partially offset by strength in Europe. Results in Asia Pacific region were in line with last year. 
In the Americas, Jeanswear revenue was down at a high single digit rate, with the mid-single-digit decline in Wrangler and a high single digit decline in Lee. 
In addition, the timing of shipments, we're off to a slower start our second half. And similar to the North Face and Timberland, when cold weather materializes, we've seen immediate pickup in our denim and long bottom business. We expect the return to mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. 
In Wrangler, on the marketing impact, the brand launched a new fall prey to complain in conjunction with the start of the American football season that has received strong consumer response in brand awareness and recall. The brand also sponsored weekly programs, including ESPN College Football Live and NFL's Game day Morning, contributing to more than 2.3 billion national media impressions in the quarter. 
Wrangler's Western Specialty business continues to be challenged. 
In addition, subdued energy and industrial manufacturing conditions are impacting community spending levels and retailers are aggressively managing inventory. 
Lee's high single digit decline in the third quarter doesn't necessarily tell the whole story. With a low double-digit increase in the second quarter due to accelerated timing of shipments, the third quarter was penalized accordingly. When an average across both quarters which are pretty similar in size, revenue was essentially flat year-over-year for the comparable period. 
That said, we expect to deliver low single digit growth in the fourth quarter. 
A few product highlights in the quarter that received positive response included the new extreme comfort men's casual pants that has led to market share expansion and wholesale growth. 
In late September, Lee's dream jean was featured on Good Morning America's best denim segment which has driven very nice pickup in sales. And in the marketing front, we launched the Move Your Lee Campaign in September to rave reviews, an event that spiked e-commerce sales significantly."

The Scarlet for women and Rider for men continued be strong drivers for the brand. Also in Europe, the Move Your Lee brand campaign launched in Scandinavia, Germany, France and U.K. to a very positive reception. 
Wrangler's saw strength as the brand transition to modern assortments with success in top and bottoms as well as an increase in third quarter reorders. Our PR and social campaign reached more than 5 million views. 
In Asia, Jeanswear revenue was in line with last year, driven by a low double-digit increase in Wrangler, offset by a slight decline in Lee due to timing of shipments from Q3 to Q4. These e-commerce business was up over 20%. 
During the quarter, Body Optics launched in 400 doors in China, Hong Kong and e-commerce with particularly strong sell-through. Media efforts behind body optics kicked off in August and it was the first ever to be streamed live on Tmall.

On the workwear side, while we continue to see consistent strength in red caps automotive Shop Gear line, which should be no surprise that with oil rig counts hovering at historic lows, both Red Kap and Bulwark sales were down in the quarter. 
Considering we will soon began to lap this decline, we expect the workwear business to return to growth in the fourth quarter. 
Our Sportswear business was down 13% in the quarter due to weakness in both wholesale and D2C. Revenue at Nautica was down 15%. However, adjusting for strategic decision to license the women's sleepwear and men's underwear business, the brand was down 7%.
Nautica continues to face the same challenges, including heavy discounting and promotional environment in the U.S. department store channel and traffic declines at outlet, where we've closed 11 stores in the past year. 
Kipling's North America business was down 6% and the international business was down 2%, and we expect both businesses to return to growth in the fourth quarter.

We've already reviewed the individual coalition results, so let's look at the global business by channel. 
Direct-to-consumer revenue was up 6%, including a low double-digit increase in Outdoor & Action Sports and mid-single-digit growth in Jeanswear, moderated by a low teen decline in Sportswear. 
Wholesale was down at a low single digit rate in the quarter, with a mid-single-digit increase in our international business being offset by high single digit decline in the U.S. 
By region, the Americas was down 4%, EMEA 6% and APAC was up 4%. 
Gross margin was 48.4%, up 70 basis points versus last year as benefits from pricing, mix and lower product costs were held back a bit by inventory management efforts and the 60 basis points headwind from FX. In fact, currency-neutral gross margin expanded by 130 basis points in the quarter. 
SG&A as a percentage of revenues was up 60 basis points to 30.2% as we balanced appropriate cost controls with continued strategic investments in Direct-to-Consumer, product innovation and connecting our brands with consumers, whenever, wherever and however they shop. 
Third quarter operating margin was up 10 basis points to 18.2% which included 40 basis points of negative impact from currency. 
By coalition, operating income in the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition was up 1% and operating margin was 21%, that's 20 basis points less than last year as strong gross margin expansion was tempered by FX and continued investment in strategic priorities, including D2C and innovation. 
Jeanswear operating income was down 10% with operating margin down 90 basis points to 20.3% due to top line volume and the quarter's specific impacts discussed earlier. 
Profit for Imagewear was up 11% and operating margin was up 230 basis points to 16.6% as widespread gross margin improvement with particular strength in LSG drove the results. 
And in Sportswear, operating income was down 35% for the reasons already detailed. 
So carrying all these to the bottom line, our reported EPS grew 13% to $1.20 in the third quarter. Currency-neutral earnings were up 16%. This increase was primarily due to the gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate due to the regional mix and discrete items. 
Now to our balance sheet. If we turn back the clock to February 19, which was in the midst of winter that never showed up, we told you we intended to carry forward about $60 million of cold weather core product to fulfill orders for the 2016 fall-winter season. We said it again on April 29 and again, on July 22. 
With today's report that our inventory position is nearly flat, we've now delivered and our commitment to solid inventory management. We have great confidence that our marketplace discipline, that is our ability to quickly adapt to supply demand changes, will continue to play an essential role in our future performance. 
During the quarter, we bought back 2.7 million shares of VF's stock for $166 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $1 billion, meeting the target we set in February. 
As you know, our commitment and track record of returning cash to shareholders is essential to our approach to delivering total shareholder return. 
In fact, at the end of 2016, we will have returned more than $5.5 billion of cash via share buybacks and dividends over the past 5 years. 
This year, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, which is $0.05 or 14% over the prior quarterly amount. This marks the 44th consecutive year we've increased our annual dividend payout. 
With this increase, our calendar 2016 dividend will reach $1.53, a 15% increase over the prior year. 
Turning to outlook. We expect full year currency-neutral revenue to be up 2% to about $12.2 billion. This revision is primarily due to lower-than-expected third quarter results, which flowed through the balance of the year and specific inventory actions we're taking at The North Face and Timberland to improve brand and channel health. 
Gross margin should improve 40 basis points to 48.6% or 49.3 currency-neutral. 
Operating margin should reach 14.3% or 14.8% currency-neutral. Our tax rate should be about 20% and our reported EPS is expected to increase 3% to $3.13 or up 7% on a currency-neutral basis. 
As we assess our performance during the past year, pressures in the global economic environment and related shopping patterns combined to create what is now been a 4 quarter long uneven environment with mixed performance across our portfolio. Throughout this period, we've continued to speak to delivering sustainable profitable growth by investing in the future and delivering value for our shareholders. 
And while many things in this environment have changed and shifted since last October, our financial philosophy has not. Maintaining profitability, preserving and returning capital to shareholders and strengthening our brands to ensure long-term, sustainable growth remain our top priorities. 
For VF, the current environment is characterized by both challenges and opportunities. To meet the challenges, we're using multiple P&L and balance sheet levers to counterbalance top line weakness. 
From supply chain initiatives and inventory management, to expense discipline around overhead, demand creation and investments, the evolution of our tax platform to powerful free cash flow, historically high return on capital and dividend yields, we remain able to mitigate the risk and safeguard consistency even in the face of an even conditions. We began to work to strategically assess and actively explore how best to optimize and leverage our strengths to create an even better, more responsive organization to accelerate growth. 
As Eric mentioned, we do have line of sight to an Investor Day where we will share the strategies in the context of our next long-range plan. 
Currently, we're looking sometime late in the first quarter of next year. So stay tuned, and we'll be in touch by the holidays, if not sooner, for a save the date and more details. 
To close out today's call, amid persistently tough conditions in some geographies and categories, we believe passionately in our brands, our business and our ability to deliver the results you come to expect from us even when our top line is challenged in an uneven environment. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll take your questions."

They're intensely focused on the consumers and as they think about the different channels, they're being very thoughtful around the collections in the different co-labs that they're bringing to bear in each of the seasons. The channel inventory that we see here in the U.S. is nothing is alarming to us. The right where we expected them to be, but I think the most of markable thing, Bob, is the results that we're seeing in our own direct-to-consumer channel, where we control that complete brand experience, continuing to drive significant growth this last quarter, up low teens.

We saw -- we kind of have a good sense of what was kind of going on in the off-price channel. We participated in moving goods here last fall. But I would tell you, as we came into September, we were a bit surprised by the sheer amount of outerwear from the outdoor industry, but in all categories from across apparel. And what caused what really brought us to make this decision to really these thoughtful around our go-forward actions and to mitigate the impact that participation in this channel can have on the long-term health of the brand. I think if we have to do it over again, we may have taken a little bit less of a position as we went into out of last fall.

As we saw a slowdown in the performance of our North Face stores in North America earlier this year, we rapidly worked to implement some in-store model changes that made our stores look different and more engaging for consumers. We've been rolling that out, and we're seeing immediate impact from it. So they're pretty significant changes and if you were to go into the Michigan Avenue store or the new store in New York City, you're going to see what we think the future that looks like. It was a sense of urgency around making some of those tactical things, and we're doing that around the world. You heard at our D2C business is up 7% year-to-date in total, and that to us is very encouraging because when we record revenue in our D2C business is because a consumer came into a store and bought something they want it. Moving forward revenue I our wholesale model, it's shipment to another retailer for future sale to consumer. One is a truly impact upon effectively our products and stories communicate. The other has a long delay on it, and it's impacted by things we don't control like wholesale -- I'm sorry, like inventory and wholesale. So we been working on the shorter-term things.

And as we evolve our model and really move to more frequency of deliveries across the season, this idea of pre-book and wait for preorders starts to give way to more monthly or every 6 to 8 weeks drops of meaningful collections across the different channel partners at our brands have to work and putting the right product for the consumer in front of them and using the powerful demand creation that draw them in to transact with us directly or through our powerful wholesale partners."

You'll hear that our third quarter results confirm our ability to deliver value in an uneven global economy. You will hear caution around the external environment and confidence that our operational discipline can safeguard profitability in the near and long term. But what you won't hear is that it's business as usual for VF. 
Let's start with the environment. Last October, our year-to-date revenue on a comp basis was up 9% and EPS was up 17%, including broad-based strength across our brands and regions around the world. However, during the past 4 quarters, weak consumer spending, the warmest winter on record, retail bankruptcies and excess inventory in the off-price channel have had an outsized impact, particularly on our U.S. business. Consistently positive results from our international business, which is about 40% of our revenues, have been somewhat offset by a slight decline in our U.S. business. Simply put, we've seen mixed results. 
By channel, our D2C business has seen steady growth, up 7% year-to-date, and we've made significant progress towards amplifying our connection with consumers in the space where we directly control our brands. In harnessing this powerful growth driver, we're keeping a sharpened eye toward brick and quick channel shifts while staying laser-focused on productivity and ensuring our growth-oriented investments are balanced accordingly. 
In wholesale, conservative retailer open buys, buy-now-wear-now calendar shifts and leaner inventory positions remain among the top priorities for many retailers. As you'd imagine, this conservatism has put even greater pressure on vendors who are being asked to take on larger inventory risk to meet demand closer to consumer need. And while we don't like it, rather than speculatively building inventory, we reduced our inventory buys to protect our brands and ensure channel health, and we're pulling various levers to preserve gross margin expansion and ensure profitability. With inventory up only 1%, we're confidently managing the business to be in line with the environment. 
That said, let's take a look at how this environment impacted our third quarter top line results. Revenue was down 1%. And while we were down in the U.S., VF's international business was up 6%, with a 6% increase in Europe, a 9% increase in the non-U.S. Americas region and 4% growth in Asia Pacific. 
Our direct-to-consumer business was also up 6%, with strength in the Outdoor & Action Sports and Jeanswear coalitions being tempered by ongoing weakness in Sportswear. Our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition was up 2%, driven by an 8% increase in Vans and essentially flat results for both The North Face and Timberland. Keep in mind these 3 brands faced tough comps against last year's third quarter when Timberland was up 21%, The North Face up 11% and Vans up 10% in a very different environment. 
Let's take a moment on Vans and paraphrasing Mark Twain. The reports of Vans' decline have been greatly exaggerated, so let's take a closer look. Unless you've been following along all year, Vans' 8% growth on top of last year's 10% growth doesn't tell the whole story. As we detailed on previous calls, Vans' EMEA business, which is about 25% of global revenue, have been working through an inventory imbalance in 2016. This work-through saw Vans' EMEA revenue down slightly this quarter, which is exactly what we expected, and we still expect the brand to return to growth in the last quarter of this year. 
In Asia, the Vans momentum continued, with revenue up more than 20%. Now in the Americas, despite reports from channel checks and even partner commentary that was mistakenly interpreted to our brand, the Vans business was up 10%, which is an acceleration of 9% in the second quarter and 8% in the first quarter. That makes 10% growth on top of 10% growth for the Vans America business. So by quarter, 8%, 9% and 10%, and we're expecting the fourth quarter to be in line with the third. And yes, that's more detailed than we normally give but it just seemed necessary this time around. 
Next up, and returning to the mixed and uneven environment theme, Jeanswear revenue was down 4% following 7 consecutive quarters of mid-single-digit growth. Steve will go into greater detail about the particulars in the quarter. But on balance for the year, Q3 should prove to be an anomaly, and we expect Jeanswear to return to mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. 
Our Imagewear  coalition declined 4% as growth on our Licensed Sports Group was offset by ongoing sector challenges in the workwear business. And despite the revenue decline, profited remains strong, up more than 2 points. Our Sportswear business saw revenue decline 13%, and the story there remains the same: trouble in U.S. department store and outlet conditions, along with general category weakness. And finally, in August, we completed the sale of the Contemporary Brands business to Delta Galil Industries. 
Now rounding up the P&L. On a currency-neutral basis, our gross margin was up 130 basis points to 49%, and our operating margin was up 50 basis points to 18.6%. Take that through to the bottom line and currency-neutral EPS was up 16%. While we're certainly not satisfied with this quarter's top line performance, we clearly demonstrated some of the many levers we have at our disposal to ultimately get the EPS job done, and we did just that. 
So what's not business as usual? The current environment has led us to employ even greater analysis with respect to the areas of the business where we can become stronger, more efficient and more effective, from processes and operations to product creation, category expansion and distribution opportunities, to the shape of our brand portfolio and where we ultimately plan to take it in our next chapter. All of this requires an aggressive yet measured and holistic approach to marketplace management to bring the industry's most compelling and innovative products to consumers more quickly, delivering premium experiences whenever, wherever and however they connect with our brands. Our approach is centered on the development of business scenarios assessing the risk and opportunities by brand and platforms and the playbook necessary to address them and then leveraging the full power of VF's operational and financial disciplines. If this sounds like just the type of content that would fill an Investor Day, then you would be correct, an event we're targeting for some time late in the first quarter of 2017, with more details to follow. 
And speaking of next chapters, we announced earlier this month that I'm retiring from the CEO position and will remain Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. The board named Steve Rendle CEO effective January 1. I give VF's board a lot of credit for its long-standing rigorous approach to succession planning, and Steve's selection is the direct result of this process. When I became CEO 9 years ago, within the first few months, the board began work to identify and prepare the right person to succeed me. Steve is the right person. 
I know most of you have had the pleasure of meeting Steve, and I can assure you VF will be in very capable hands. Steve?"

I look forward to January 1 and the incredible opportunities that lie ahead for VF in its next chapter. 
For now, let's take a look at Q3. Starting with the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition. Revenue was up 2%. As described earlier, where we control our brands directly, we continue to see consistent growth. In the quarter, Outdoor & Action Sports D2C was up low double digits with positive results in 9 of our 11 brands. This was offset by a low single-digit decline in wholesale, where a tough comp against last year's low-teen increase, buy-now-wear-now calendar shifts and bankruptcies tempered results. 
Turning to our 3 largest brands. Revenue for The North Face was flat, with a mid-teen increase in D2C offset by a mid-single-digit decline in wholesale. Keep in mind that last year, The North Face grew 11% in the third quarter. So even though the results were flat, we performed relatively well given the changes in the environment and retailer caution around orders headed into this winter season. On a comp basis, if you exclude impacts from bankruptcies, global revenues for The North Face would have been up at a mid-single-digit rate. 
In the Americas, revenue was down mid-single digits, with healthy mid-teen D2C growth offset by a low double-digit decline in wholesale. Bankruptcies had a big impact on our wholesale business. Without them, total revenue for North Face Americas would have been flat in the quarter versus a mid-single-digit decline. Versus last year, we did see a meaningful shift of retailers wanting deliveries later in the calendar, particularly a third to fourth quarter shift. This reflects the desire to have leaner inventory positions and match consumers buy-now-wear-now behavior. Setting floors with seasonal products when it's actually the season is a shift we believe is appropriate and one that should eventually help mitigate what's been a volatile markdown environment. 
Taking a look at some of the product highlights during the quarter. As we continue to evolve our 4-season strategy, warm weather categories like training apparel, lightweight outerwear and sportswear continue to resonate. Our Mountain Athletics collection, along with products like Dryzzle, Venture and Millerton, have seen some early season momentum. 
Additionally, Thermal 3D, our new smooth-faced fleece, is already a top 5 selling sportswear style in our direct-to-consumer business. We also saw strong results in backpacks and logo wear [ph], which, combined, were up at a mid-teen rate. 
On the branding side, less than 2 weeks ago, in honor of its 50th anniversary, The North Face unveiled its new global brand campaign, Question Madness. The campaign's digital content series showcases athletes from throughout the brand's history, examining individual mottos for exploration and the gratification that comes from pushing norms and boundaries. And finally on Wednesday this week, The North Face officially opens its Fifth Avenue store in New York City, an immersive brand experience that includes an interactive climbing wall, our unique consumer segmentation strategy and custom product that will only be available at that location. 
Clearly, a lot of momentum, innovation and experiences at play, yet we're electing to take a cautious approach to the balance of the year to more closely mirror market conditions. Despite the fact that we feel well positioned with our inventory in the channel, it's readily apparent that there's a lot competitive product in the marketplace, particularly in the off-price channel,  that's stunting early autumn momentum. This, along with bankruptcies and warmer September and October conditions, have caused us to take a more prudent position with inventory to try to mitigate markdown risk and protect the long-term integrity of the brand. 
Given this conservativism in the Americas business, we are taking our full year global expectations down to low single-digit growth compared to the previous mid-single digit. This move is also mirrored in our full year Outdoor & Action Sports coalition outlook, certainly not what we'd like to do at this point, but on balance, the right thing to do for the brand and overall channel health. 
Now to KH."

The North Face European business had another strong quarter with revenue up over 20%, driven by high-teen increase in DTC and more than 20% growth in our wholesale business. Demand remains strong across most geographies and product categories. Warm weather products performed well in the quarter, with our Mountain Athletics collection up over 70%, driven by our expanded men's collection. Sportswear also performed strongly, with revenue up over 20%. In September, our new Thermoball campaign went live across e-commerce, retail and wholesale, good timing before cooler weather has started to set in. 
During the quarter, we opened our first Urban Exploration store in London, an active lifestyle-focused location geared at the city adventurer. We also opened our first brand store based on a new concept, with a higher focus on the consumer experience and our distinct consumer segmentation strategies. Early results have been very promising. We are really pleased with TNF's European business. The work we started a few years ago with respect to local-for-local product design, a targeted distribution strategy and changes in the way we reach consumers has put the business solidly on track for a very strong year. 
In Asia, third quarter revenue was down slightly. Our retail business saw mid-teen growth, driven by strength in Hong Kong and strong e-commerce sales, which more than doubled as we revamped our website. This was offset by mid-single-digit decline in wholesale due to heavy promotions across the outdoor category in China. Overall, we expect Asia to return to growth in the fourth quarter. 
Now on to Vans."

In the third quarter, Vans' global revenue was up 8%, driven by a mid-teen increase in D2C and a slight bump in wholesale driven by strong results in the Americas and Asia Pacific businesses. In the Americas, revenue was up 10%. D2C, which is more than 50% of this region's revenue, and there's your cautionary tale about market share data, was up at a low-teen rate, with 15% e-commerce growth. 
Wholesale revenue was up mid-single digits with fairly even strength across concepts. And to point out once again, this 10% increase follows 9% growth in Q2, which was up from 8% growth in Q1. 
During the quarter, our new light and Iso models met the demands of the athletic lifestyle-inspired consumer, with lightweight construction, new colors and materials. Our classic styles, specifically the Sk8-Hi and Old Skool, continue to perform really well and have been recently called out by quite a few magazines and blogs as the ""it"" shoe being frequently seen on the feet of celebrities, athletes and tastemakers worldwide. 
And of course, in its 50th year of business, Vans' heritage remains front of mind. As the original and still #1 skate shoe in core board shops, we continue to support skateboarders worldwide. During the quarter, Vans held its first Pro Skate Park Series competition in 4 countries to create the platform for skateboarding's inaugural participation in the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics. 
Earlier this month, Vans launched a collection celebrating the original characters from Disney's Toy Story movie, which showcases Andy's favorite toys across an extensive assortment of adult and kids footwear as well as apparel and accessories. Following Star Wars and Nintendo, the bar is set is pretty high, but early momentum on this one is very encouraging. 
To close out, Vans remains obsessively focused on their consumer and is becoming even better and more capable of delivering the right product across multiple channels. With momentum and the ever-present ""it"" factor on our side, we're looking forward to finishing yet another strong year for the brand in the Americas."

This result is right where we said we would be on our last call, so tracking along as planned. Independent of wholesale, which is where inventory actions have taken place all year, our DTC business has performed well, with revenue up 20%. This was driven by mid-teen comps in e-commerce, which was up more than 40% on the back of a new platform launch. 
Our iconic Old Skool and Sk8-Hi classic delivered solid [indiscernible] sales. Our Pro Skate performance was also strong, with sales up more than 30%, supported by the finals of the Pro Skate Park Series, which were held in Malmö, Sweden. Our apparel business also continues to show really strong results. Overall, for Vans Europe, we expect this business to return to growth in the fourth quarter. 
In Asia, Vans revenue continues to impress, with more than 20% growth, driven by almost 40% growth in DTC and a mid-teen increase in our wholesale business. Similar to last quarter, e-commerce had a significant role in these results by doubling its business. 
Looking at product. Old Skool continues to perform well and was up over 70% compared to last year while the Nintendo collection continues to be a hit and had over 80% sell-through. We also completed a series of House of Vans pop-up events across Asia, which continues to be a key brand activation platform centered around creative self-expression. With more than 45,000 attendees and over 2.5 million live video views in China, we are constantly driving momentum through visibility and consumer touch points. 
And finally, China continues to maintain strong momentum, posting over 30% growth on the back of an aggressively growing e-commerce business. Globally, Vans remains on track to deliver high single-digit growth for the year.

Timberland had the toughest comparison at VF in the third quarter as it was up against a 20% -- 21% growth last year, which was driven by a 40% increase in the Americas business. Excluding impacts from bankruptcies, global revenues for Timberland would have been up at a low single-digit rate. 
The Americas had a mid-single-digit decline, with flat D2C results offset by mid-single-digit decline in wholesale. The dip in wholesale reflects the impacts of the proactive reduction in sell-in that we spoke about on our last call and the buy-now-wear-now calendar shift very similar to The North Face, with retailers trying to set floors later in the year for cold-weather product. 
D2C was flat, including gains in full-price stores and nearly a 30% increase in e-commerce being offset by outlet locations which saw a reduction in traffic. And similar to last quarter, the PRO business is still under pressure from subdued oil and gas exploration and industrial manufacturing. Product-wise, we've continued to see momentum in the men's casual footwear across both wholesale and D2C, which is positive validation that our diversification strategy is working. We're particularly excited about the success of our SensorFlex platform, with collections like Britton Hill and Amherst seeing excellent sell-through.  
Another bright spot is the Timberland Boot Company, which was our top family in D2C and saw strong results with our exclusive department store partner. At more than $300 a pair, this reinforces we have permission to play in the premium footwear market. In women's, we see a similar story with our casual footwear collections. Revenues for our heeled Glancy 6-inch boot were up 5x in D2C, and the Kenniston, again, a SensorFlex style, saw a strong sell-through as well, more proof points that Timberland's focus on women is paying off. 
Helping to drive the success, we launched a new marketing campaign touting the flex appeal of SensorFlex, hitting on both style and performance. The brand also launched a 360-degree marketing campaign centered on our yellow boot, driving extensive awareness, PR buzz and social engagement. In fact, the yellow boot video garnered over 3.5 million views in 6 weeks and was reported as best in class by YouTube."

Men's footwear was up nicely, supported by SensorFlex campaign. The new footwear technology combines the SensorFlex outsole with a cup sole look and is selling well. Casual category also performed and drove the footwear business to positive growth in the quarter despite the warm weather in Q3. 
In women's, we continue to innovate and bring new products to market with Kenniston being our #2 seller after the yellow boot. 
In apparel, new product introductions with updated fits, fabric and style contributed to a 30% increase in that business, especially outerwear category that performed very well, gaining market share against competition in new silhouettes. 
Revenue in Timberland's Asian business was down slightly, with low double-digit wholesale growth offset by a mid-teen decrease in DTC due to traffic declines in Singapore and Japan. This was partially offset by e-commerce, which was up more than 50% in the region. Killington sold, too, very well in the quarter, supported by impactful in-store marketing. 
In September, consumers in Japan camped out overnight to purchase items from the limited Timberland, monkey time apparel collection, a collaboration between the 2 brands that sold out in hours. Also, just last week, Timberland launched its first [indiscernible] e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia by opening a site in Singapore, so an excellent way to connect further with consumers in this important market. For the full year globally, there are no changes to the expectation that Timberland will see low single-digit revenue growth. 
Now to Jeanswear."

While we did plan for the business to be down slightly based on changes in the timing of shipments, the decline was a little more than we originally anticipated but, as Eric indicated, should still prove to be an anomaly for the full year. 
Our Americas business saw the majority of the decline, which was partially offset by strength in Europe. Results in the Asia Pacific region were in line with last year. In the Americas, Jeanswear revenue was down at a high single-digit rate, with a mid-single-digit decline in Wrangler and a high single-digit decline in Lee. In addition to timing of shipments, we're off to a slower start to our second half. And similar to The North Face and Timberland, when cold weather materializes, we've seen immediate pickup in our denim and long bottoms business. We expect to return to mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. 
In Wrangler, on the marketing front, the brand launched a new fall creative campaign in conjunction with the start of the American football season that has received strong consumer response in brand awareness and recall. The brand also sponsored weekly programs, including ESPN College Football Live and the NFL's GameDay Morning, contributing to more than 2.3 billion national media impressions in the quarter. Wrangler's western specialty business continues to be challenged. In addition, subdued energy and industrial manufacturing conditions are impacting community spending levels, and retailers are aggressively managing inventory. 
Lee's high single-digit decline in the third quarter doesn't necessarily tell the whole story. With a low double-digit increase in the second quarter due to accelerated timing of shipments, the third quarter was penalized accordingly. When averaged across both quarters, which are pretty similar in size, revenue was essentially flat year-over-year for the comparable period. That said, we expect to deliver low single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. 
A few product highlights in the quarter that received positive response included the new Xtreme Comfort men's casual pants that has led to market share expansion and wholesale growth. In late September, Lee's Dream Jean was featured on Good Morning America's best denim segment, which has driven very nice pickup in sales. And on the marketing front, we launched the Move Your Lee campaign in September to rave reviews, an event that spiked e-commerce sales significantly."

On the workwear side, while we continue to see consistent strength in Red Kap's automotive Shop Gear line, it should be no surprise that with oil rig counts hovering at historic lows, both Red Kap and Bulwark sales were down in the quarter. Considering we will soon begin to lap this decline, we expect the workwear business to return to growth in the fourth quarter.

However, adjusting for strategic decision to license the women's sleepwear and men's underwear business, the brand was down 7%.

We've already reviewed the individual coalition results, so let's look at the global business by channel. 
Direct-to-consumer revenue was up 6%, including a low double-digit increase in Outdoor & Action Sports and mid-single-digit growth in Jeanswear, moderated by a low-teen decline in Sportswear. Wholesale was down at a low single-digit rate in the quarter, with a mid-single-digit increase in our international business being offset by high single-digit decline in the U.S. By region, the Americas was down 4%, EMEA up 6% and APAC was up 4%. 
Gross margin was 48.4%, up 70 basis points versus last year as benefits from pricing, mix and lower product costs were held back a bit by inventory management efforts and a 60 basis point headwind from FX. In fact, currency-neutral gross margin expanded by 130 basis points in the quarter. 
SG&A as a percentage of revenues was up 60 basis points to 30.2% as we balanced appropriate cost controls with continued strategic investments in direct-to-consumer, product innovation and connecting our brands with consumers, whenever, wherever and however they shop. Third quarter operating margin was up 10 basis points to 18.2%, which included 40 basis points of negative impact from currency. 
By coalition, operating income in the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition was up 1%, and operating margin was 21%. That's 20 basis points less than last year as strong gross margin expansion was tempered by FX and continued investment in strategic priorities, including D2C and innovation. Jeanswear operating income was down 10%, with operating margin down 90 basis points to 20.3% due to top line volume and the quarter-specific impacts discussed earlier. 
Profit for Imagewear was up 11%, and operating margin was up 230 basis points to 16.6% as widespread gross margin improvement with particular strength in LSG drove the results. And in Sportswear, operating income was down 35% for the reasons already detailed. 
So carrying all this to the bottom line, our reported EPS grew 13% to $1.20 in the third quarter. Currency-neutral earnings were up 16%. This increase was primarily due to gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate due to regional mix and discrete items. 
Now to our balance sheet. If we turn back the clock to February 19, which was in the midst of winter that never showed up, we told you we intended to carry forward about $60 million of cold-weather core product to fulfill orders for the 2016 fall/winter season. We said it again on April 29 and again on July 22. With today's report that our inventory position is nearly flat, we've now delivered on  our commitment to solid inventory management. We have great confidence that our marketplace discipline, that is our ability to quickly adapt to supply-demand changes, will continue to play an essential role in our future performance. 
During the quarter, we bought back 2.7 million shares of VF's stock for $166 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $1 billion, meeting the target we set in February. As you know, our commitment and track record of returning cash to shareholders is essential to our approach to delivering total shareholder return. In fact, at the end of 2016, we will have returned more than $5.5 billion of cash via share buybacks and dividends over the past 5 years. 
This year, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, which is $0.05 or 14% over the prior quarterly amount. This marks the 44th consecutive year we've increased our annual dividend payout. With this increase, our calendar 2016 dividend will reach $1.53, a 15% increase over the prior year. 
Turning to outlook. We expect full year currency-neutral revenue to be up 2% to about $12.2 billion. This revision is primarily due to lower-than-expected third quarter results, which flow through to the balance of the year, and specific inventory actions we're taking at The North Face and Timberland to improve brand and channel health. 
Gross margin should improve 40 basis points to 48.6% or 49.3% currency-neutral. Operating margin should reach 14.3% or 14.8% currency-neutral. Our tax rate should be about 20%, and our reported EPS is expected to increase 3% to $3.13 or up 7% on a currency-neutral basis. 
As we assess our performance during the past year, pressures in the global economic environment and related shopping patterns combined to create what has now been a 4-quarter long uneven environment with mixed performance across our portfolio. Throughout this period, we've continued to speak to delivering sustainable profitable growth by investing in the future and delivering value for our shareholders. And while many things in this environment have changed and shifted since last October, our financial philosophy has not. Maintaining profitability, preserving and returning capital to shareholders and strengthening our brands to ensure long-term sustainable growth remain our top priorities. 
For VF, the current environment is characterized by both challenges and opportunities. To meet the challenges, we're using multiple P&L and balance sheet levers to counterbalance top line weakness. From supply chain initiatives and inventory management to expense discipline around overhead, demand creation and investments, the evolution of our tax platform, to powerful free cash flow, historically high return on capital and dividend yields, we remain able to mitigate risk and safeguard consistency even in the face of uneven conditions. We began to work to strategically assess and actively explore how best to optimize and leverage our strengths to create an even better, more responsive organization to accelerate growth. 
As Eric mentioned, we do have line of sight to an Investor Day where we will share these strategies in the context of our next long-range plan. Currently, we're looking at some time late in the first quarter of next year. So stay tuned, and we'll be in touch by the holidays, if not sooner, for a ""save the date"" and more details. 
To close out today's call, amid persistently tough conditions in some geographies and categories, we believe passionately in our brands, our business and our ability to deliver the results you'd come to expect from us even when our top line is challenged in an uneven environment. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll take your questions."

I would tell you, first and foremost, that our Vans brand, the strong momentum continues, and I feel compelled to reiterate we were up 10% for this quarter following a 9% in Q2 and an 8% in Q1. This brand's ability to have consistent flow of relevant new products for each of the channels that they do business with, is really, I think, one of the main points that continues to drive their significant and sustainable growth. They're intently focused on their consumer, and as they think about the different channels, they're being very thoughtful around the collections and the different collabs that they're bringing to bear in each of these seasons. The channel inventory that we see here in the U.S. is -- nothing is alarming to us. We -- they're right where we expected them to be. But I think the most remarkable thing, Bob, is the results that we're seeing in our own direct-to-consumer channel, where we control that complete brand experience, continuing to drive significant growth, this last quarter, up low teens. And I'll pass it to KH, and he can talk about Europe, where we have had some inventory build that we've been systematically working through."

So I think an important fact here, Bob, is we have seen demand in the wholesale channel shift from Q3 to Q4 or, as we said in the commentary, to the right. And we've seen this beginning but -- coming out of the last winter, the dealer caution is at a significant level, and we took actions at that point to really mitigate the amount of inventory that we brought in to cover our orders. We saw -- we kind of had a good sense of what was going to go on in the off-price channel. We participated in moving goods there last fall. But I would tell you, as we came into September, we were a bit surprised by the sheer amount of just not outerwear from the outdoor industry but all categories from across apparel. And it's what caused -- it's really brought us to make this decision to really be thoughtful around our go-forward actions and to mitigate the impact that participation in this channel can have on the long-term health of the brand. I think if we had to do it over again, we may have taken a little bit less of a position as we went into -- out of last fall. And I think what we saw may be compounded things that we didn't see last fall, was the bankruptcies that took place early in the year that had an additional amount of inventory moving to the off-price channel as well as online that's causing some pressure in the outdoor industry."

And if you were to go into the Michigan Avenue store or the new store in New York City, you're going to see what we think the future of that looks like. It was a sense of urgency around making some of those tactical things, and we're doing that around the world. You heard that our D2C business is up 7% year-to-date in total. And that to us is very encouraging because when we record revenue in our D2C business it's because a consumer came into a store and bought something they wanted. When we report revenue in our wholesale model, it's shipment to another retailer for future sale to consumer. One is a true impact of how effectively we're -- our products and stories communicate. The other has a long delay on it and is impacted by things we don't control like wholesale -- I'm sorry, like inventory and wholesale. So we've been working on the shorter-term things.

I really do wish that I had a crystal ball that could give me clear context around the fourth quarter. Let me just shape up how we look at it. The fourth quarter, Erinn, in terms of total revenue is about the same size as the third quarter. So we're looking at about a $3.5 billion quarter in each. One of the differences is that the third quarter is more about wholesale shipments to retailers for eventual sale, and we've already documented that we've struggled with that in the third quarter. And the fourth quarter for us is much more about our D2C business. It is when that business peaks as a percentage of our revenue, and it's a business that is up 7% year-to-date. So it has been working for us all year around the globe, and that's one thing that gives us confidence. We've also assumed a normal winter. And by normal winter we don't mean a 1980s normal winter. We mean an average of the last 3 to 5 years normal winter, which includes some good ones and some bad ones. And if it sets up like that, which is our assumption and that is a big assumption, that we're going to be just fine because we know our stories are working and we know we have the right products. And then as we said, we're up 7% year-to-date. We're up 6% in the third quarter. And our effort on communicating to consumers is a lot around driving them to retail, ours or our customers'."

I mean we all get to watch the TV these last few weeks, and I think there's an overarching theme going on in our political atmosphere that's giving consumers a little bit of pause and potentially making them a bit conservative as we're all uneasy about where we're ultimately going here. I think last year's fall season has had a compounding effect not just on the winter goods but in apparel and footwear in general. And we've seen bankruptcies come into view, having an impact on, certainly, where businesses like ours have the opportunity to sell but also where consumers are looking to engage. So I think the U.S. market just finds itself in maybe a similar situation where our European business was 2 or 3 years ago. And as we've got a lot of lessons learned and are employing a lot of really great solutions, I think you saw the growth that we delivered here for Q3, I think we have a really strong playbook of how to navigate this. Because, I think, at the center here is powerful brands, consumers absolutely want to connect with them, engage with them and purchase from them. And it's really in our core to create the compelling products and the demand creation that draws them to us and really create that loyal relationship that we can build on year-over-year."

You'll hear that our third quarter results confirm our ability to deliver value in an uneven global economy. You will hear caution around the external environment and confidence that our operational discipline can safeguard profitability in the near and long term. But what you won't hear is that it's business as usual for VF. 
Let's start with the environment. Last October, our year-to-date revenue on a comp basis was up 9% and EPS was up 17%, including broad-based strength across our brands and regions around the world. However, during the past 4 quarters, weak consumer spending, the warmest winter on record, retail bankruptcies and excess inventory in the off-price channel have had an outsized impact, particularly on our U.S. business. Consistently positive results from our international business, which is about 40% of our revenues, have been somewhat offset by a slight decline in our U.S. business. Simply put, we've seen mixed results. 
By channel, our D2C business has seen steady growth, up 7% year-to-date, and we've made significant progress towards amplifying our connection with consumers in the space where we directly control our brands. In harnessing this powerful growth driver, we're keeping a sharpened eye toward brick and click channel shifts while staying laser-focused on productivity and ensuring our growth-oriented investments are balanced accordingly. 
In wholesale, conservative retailer open buys, buy-now-wear-now calendar shifts and leaner inventory positions remain among the top priorities for many retailers. As you'd imagine, this conservatism has put even greater pressure on vendors, who are being asked to take on larger inventory risk to meet demand closer to consumer need. And while we don't like it, rather than speculatively building inventory, we reduced our inventory buys to protect our brands and ensure channel health, and we're pulling various levers to preserve gross margin expansion and ensure profitability. With inventory up only 1%, we're confidently managing the business to be in line with the environment. 
That said, let's take a look at how this environment impacted our third quarter top line results. Revenue was down 1%. And while we were down in the U.S., VF's international business was up 6%, with a 6% increase in Europe, a 9% increase in the non-U.S. Americas region and 4% growth in Asia Pacific. 
Our direct-to-consumer business was also up 6%, with strength in the Outdoor & Action Sports and Jeanswear coalitions being tempered by ongoing weakness in Sportswear. Our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition was up 2%, driven by an 8% increase in Vans and essentially flat results for both The North Face and Timberland. Keep in mind these 3 brands faced tough comps against last year's third quarter when Timberland was up 21%, The North Face up 11% and Vans up 10% in a very different environment. 
Let's take a moment on Vans. In paraphrasing Mark Twain, the reports of Vans' decline have been greatly exaggerated. So let's take a closer look. Unless you've been following along all year, Vans' 8% growth on top of last year's 10% growth doesn't tell the whole story. As we've detailed on previous calls, Vans' EMEA business, which is about 25% of global revenue, have been working through an inventory imbalance in 2016. This work-through saw Vans' EMEA revenue down slightly this quarter, which is exactly what we expected, and we still expect the brand to return to growth in the last quarter of this year. 
In Asia, the Vans momentum continued, with revenue up more than 20%. Now in the Americas, despite reports from channel checks and even partner commentary that was mistakenly interpreted to our brand, the Vans business was up 10%, which is an acceleration of 9% in the second quarter and 8% in the first quarter. That makes 10% growth on top of 10% growth for the Vans America business. So by quarter, 8%, 9% and 10%, and we're expecting the fourth quarter to be in line with the third. And yes, that's more details than we normally give but it just seemed necessary this time around. 
Next up, and returning to the mixed and uneven environment theme, Jeanswear revenue was down 4% following 7 consecutive quarters of mid-single-digit growth. Steve will go into greater detail about the particulars in the quarter, but on balance for the year, Q3 should prove to be an anomaly, and we expect Jeanswear to return to mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. 
Our Imagewear  coalition declined 4% as growth on our Licensed Sports Group was offset by ongoing sector challenges in the workwear business. And despite the revenue decline, profit remains strong, up more than 2 points. Our Sportswear business saw revenue decline 13%, and the story there remains the same: troubling U.S. department store and outlet conditions, along with general category weakness. And finally, in August, we completed the sale of the Contemporary Brands business to Delta Galil Industries. 
Now rounding up the P&L. On a currency-neutral basis, our gross margin was up 130 basis points to 49%, and our operating margin was up 50 basis points to 18.6%. Take that through to the bottom line and currency-neutral EPS was up 16%. While we're certainly not satisfied with this quarter's top line performance, we clearly demonstrated some of the many levers we have at our disposal to ultimately get the EPS job done, and we did just that. 
So what's not business as usual? The current environment has led us to employ even greater analysis with respect to the areas of the business where we can become stronger, more efficient and more effective, from processes and operations to product creation, category expansion and distribution opportunities, to the shape of our brand portfolio and where we ultimately plan to take it in our next chapter. All of this requires an aggressive yet measured and holistic approach to marketplace management to bring the industry's most compelling and innovative products to consumers more quickly, delivering premium experiences whenever, wherever and however they connect with our brands. Our approach is centered on the development of business scenarios assessing the risk and opportunities by brand and platforms and the playbook necessary to address them and then leveraging the full power of VF's operational and financial disciplines. If this sounds like just the type of content that would fill an Investor Day, then you would be correct. It's an event we're targeting for some time late in the first quarter of 2017, with more details to follow. 
And speaking of next chapters, we announced earlier this month that I'm retiring from the CEO position and will remain Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. The board named Steve Rendle CEO effective January 1. I give VF's board a lot of credit for its longstanding rigorous approach to succession planning, and Steve's selection is the direct result of this process. When I became CEO 9 years ago, within the first few months, the board began work to identify and prepare the right person to succeed me. Steve is the right person. 
I know most of you have had the pleasure of meeting Steve, and I can assure you VF will be in very capable hands. Steve?"

I look forward to January 1 and the incredible opportunities that lie ahead for VF in its next chapter. 
For now, let's take a look at Q3. Starting with the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition. Revenue was up 2%. As described earlier, where we control our brands directly, we continue to see consistent growth. In the quarter, Outdoor & Action Sports D2C was up low double digits, with positive results in 9 of our 11 brands. This was offset by a low single-digit decline in wholesale, where a tough comp against last year's low-teen increase, buy-now-wear-now calendar shifts and bankruptcies tempered results. 
Turning to our 3 largest brands. Revenue for The North Face was flat, with a mid-teen increase in D2C offset by a mid-single-digit decline in wholesale. Keep in mind that last year The North Face grew 11% in the third quarter. So even though the results were flat, we performed relatively well given the changes in the environment and retailer caution around orders headed into this winter season. On a comp basis, if you exclude impacts from bankruptcies, global revenues for The North Face would have been up at a mid-single-digit rate. 
In the Americas, revenue was down mid-single digits, with healthy mid-teen D2C growth offset by a low double-digit decline in wholesale. Bankruptcies had a big impact on our wholesale business. Without them, total revenue for North Face Americas would have been flat in the quarter versus a mid-single-digit decline. Versus last year, we did see a meaningful shift of retailers wanting deliveries later in the calendar, particularly a third to fourth quarter shift. This reflects the desire to have leaner inventory positions and match consumers buy-now-wear-now behavior. Setting floors with seasonal products when it's actually the season is a shift we believe is appropriate and one that should eventually help mitigate what's been a volatile markdown environment. 
Taking a look at some of the product highlights during the quarter. As we continue to evolve our 4-season strategy, warm weather categories like training apparel, lightweight outerwear and sportswear continue to resonate. Our Mountain Athletics collection, along with products like Dryzzle, Venture and Millerton, have seen some early season momentum. 
Additionally, Thermal 3D, our new smooth-faced fleece, is already a top 5 selling sportswear style in our direct-to-consumer business. We also saw strong results in backpacks and logo wear, which, combined, were up at a mid-teen rate. 
On the branding side, less than 2 weeks ago, in honor of its 50th anniversary, The North Face unveiled its new global brand campaign, Question Madness. The campaign's digital content series showcases athletes from throughout the brand's history, examining individual mottos for exploration and the gratification that comes from pushing norms and boundaries. And finally on Wednesday this week, The North Face officially opens its Fifth Avenue store in New York City, an immersive brand experience that includes an interactive climbing wall, our unique consumer segmentation strategy and custom product that will only be available at that location. 
Clearly, a lot of momentum, innovation and experiences at play, yet we're electing to take a cautious approach to the balance of the year to more closely mirror market conditions. Despite the fact that we feel well positioned with our inventory in the channel, it's readily apparent that there's a lot of competitive product in the marketplace, particularly in the off-price channel,  that's stunting early autumn momentum. This, along with bankruptcies and warmer September and October conditions, have caused us to take a more prudent position with inventory to try to mitigate markdown risk and protect the long-term integrity of the brand. 
Given this conservativism in the Americas business, we are taking our full year global expectations down to low single-digit growth compared to the previous mid-single digit. This move is also mirrored in our full year Outdoor & Action Sports coalition outlook, certainly not what we'd like to do at this point, but on balance, the right thing to do for the brand and overall channel health. 
Now to KH."

The North Face European business had another strong quarter, with revenue up over 20%, driven by high-teen increase in DTC and more than 20% growth in our wholesale business. Demand remains strong across most geographies and product categories. Warm weather products performed well in the quarter, with our Mountain Athletics collection up over 70%, driven by our expanded men's collection. Sportswear also performed strongly, with revenue up over 20%. In September, our new Thermoball campaign went live across e-commerce, retail and wholesale, good timing before cooler weather has started to set in. 
During the quarter, we opened our first Urban Exploration store in London, an active lifestyle-focused location geared at the city adventurer. We also opened our first brand store based on a new concept, with a higher focus on the consumer experience and our distinct consumer segmentation strategies. Early results have been very promising. We are really pleased with TNF's European business. The work we started a few years ago with respect to local-for-local product design, a targeted distribution strategy and changes in the way we reach consumers has put the business solidly on track for a very strong year. 
In Asia, third quarter revenue was down slightly. Our retail business saw mid-teen growth, driven by strength in Hong Kong and strong e-commerce sales, which more than doubled as we revamped our website. This was offset by mid-single-digit decline in wholesale due to heavy promotions across the outdoor category in China. Overall, we expect Asia to return to growth in the fourth quarter.

In the third quarter, Vans' global revenue was up 8%, driven by a mid-teen increase in D2C and a slight bump in wholesale driven by strong results in the Americas and Asia Pacific businesses. In the Americas, revenue was up 10%. D2C, which is more than 50% of this region's revenue, and there is your cautionary tale about market share data, was up at a low-teen rate, with 15% e-commerce growth. 
Wholesale revenue was up mid-single digits, with fairly even strength across concepts. And to point out once again, this 10% increase follows 9% growth in Q2, which was up from 8% growth in Q1. 
During the quarter, our new light and Iso models met the demands of the athletic lifestyle-inspired consumer, with lightweight construction, new colors and materials. Our classic styles, specifically the Sk8-Hi and Old Skool, continue to perform really well and have been recently called out by quite a few magazines and blogs as the ""it"" shoe being frequently seen on the feet of celebrities, athletes and tastemakers worldwide. 
And of course, in its 50th year of business, Vans' heritage remains front of mind. As the original and still #1 skate shoe in core board shops, we continue to support skateboarders worldwide. During the quarter, Vans held its first Pro Skate Park Series competition in 4 countries to create the platform for skateboarding's inaugural participation in the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics. 
Earlier this month, Vans launched a collection celebrating the original characters from Disney's Toy Story movie, which showcases Andy's favorite toys across an extensive assortment of adult and kids footwear as well as apparel and accessories. Following Star Wars and Nintendo, the bar is set is pretty high, but early momentum on this one is very encouraging. 
To close out, Vans remains obsessively focused on their consumer and is becoming even better and more capable of delivering the right product across multiple channels. With momentum and the ever-present ""it"" factor on our side, we're looking forward to finishing yet another strong year for the brand in the Americas."

This result is right where we said we would be on our last call, so tracking along as planned. Independent of wholesale, which is where inventory actions have taken place all year, our DTC business has performed well, with revenue up 20%. This was driven by mid-teen comps in e-commerce, which was up more than 40% on the back of a new platform launch. 
Our iconic Old Skool and Sk8-Hi classic delivered solid [indiscernible] sales. Our Pro Skate performance was also strong, with sales up more than 30%, supported by the finals of the Pro Skate Park Series, which were held in Malmö, Sweden. Our apparel business also continues to show really strong results. Overall, for Vans Europe, we expect this business to return to growth in the fourth quarter. 
In Asia, Vans revenue continues to impress, with more than 20% growth, driven by almost 40% growth in DTC and a mid-teen increase in our wholesale business. Similar to last quarter, e-commerce had a significant role in these results by doubling its business. 
Looking at product. Old Skool continues to perform well and was up over 70% compared to last year, while the Nintendo collection continues to be a hit and had over 80% sell-through. We also completed a series of House of Vans pop-up events across Asia, which continues to be a key brand activation platform centered around creative self-expression. With more than 45,000 attendees and over 2.5 million live video views in China, we are constantly driving momentum through visibility and consumer touch points. 
And finally, China continues to maintain strong momentum, posting over 30% growth on the back of an aggressively growing e-commerce business. Globally, Vans remains on track to deliver high single-digit growth for the year.

Timberland had the toughest comparison at VF in the third quarter as it was up against a 20% -- 21% growth last year, which was driven by a 40% increase in the Americas business. Excluding impacts from bankruptcies, global revenues for Timberland would have been up at a low single-digit rate. 
The Americas had a mid-single-digit decline, with flat D2C results offset by a mid-single-digit decline in wholesale. The dip in wholesale reflects the impacts of the proactive reduction in sell-in that we spoke about on our last call and the buy-now-wear-now calendar shift very similar to The North Face, with retailers trying to set floors later in the year for cold-weather product. 
D2C was flat, including gains in full-price stores and nearly a 30% increase in e-commerce being offset by outlet locations, which saw a reduction in traffic. And similar to last quarter, the PRO business is still under pressure from subdued oil and gas exploration and industrial manufacturing. Product-wise, we've continued to see momentum in the men's casual footwear across both wholesale and D2C, which is positive validation that our diversification strategy is working. We're particularly excited about the success of our SensorFlex platform, with collections like Britton Hill and Amherst seeing excellent sell-through.  
Another bright spot is the Timberland Boot Company, which was our top family in D2C and saw strong results with our exclusive department store partner. At more than $300 a pair, this reinforces we have permission to play in the premium footwear market. In women's, we see a similar story with our casual footwear collections. Revenues for our heeled Glancy 6-inch boot were up 5x in D2C, and the Kenniston, again, a SensorFlex style, saw a strong sell-through as well, more proof points that Timberland's focus on women is paying off. 
Helping to drive the success, we launched a new marketing campaign touting the flex appeal of SensorFlex, hitting on both style and performance. The brand also launched a 360-degree marketing campaign centered on our yellow boot, driving extensive awareness, PR buzz and social engagement. In fact, the yellow boot video garnered over 3.5 million views in 6 weeks and was reported as best in class by YouTube."

In women's, we continue to innovate and bring new products to market with Kenniston being our #2 seller after the yellow boot. 
In apparel, new product introductions with updated fits, fabric and styles contributed to a 30% increase in that business, especially outerwear category that performed very well, gaining market share against competition in new silhouettes. 
Revenue in Timberland's Asian business was down slightly, with low double-digit wholesale growth offset by a mid-teen decrease in DTC due to traffic declines in Singapore and Japan. This was partially offset by e-commerce, which was up more than 50% in the region. Killington sold, too, very well in the quarter, supported by impactful in-store marketing. 
In September, consumers in Japan camped out overnight to purchase items from the limited Timberland, monkey time apparel collection, a collaboration between the 2 brands that sold out in hours. Also, just last week, Timberland launched its first direct e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia by opening a site in Singapore, so an excellent way to connect further with consumers in this important market. For the full year globally, there are no changes to the expectation that Timberland will see low single-digit revenue growth.

Corporation","Executives","Our global Jeanswear business declined 4%, with similar declines at both Wrangler and Lee. While we did plan for the business to be down slightly based on changes in the timing of shipments, the decline was a little more than we originally anticipated but",397,"Our global Jeanswear business declined 4%, with similar declines at both Wrangler and Lee. While we did plan for the business to be down slightly based on changes in the timing of shipments, the decline was a little more than we originally anticipated but, as Eric indicated, should still prove to be an anomaly for the full year. 
Our Americas business saw the majority of the decline, which was partially offset by strength in Europe. Results in the Asia Pacific region were in line with last year. In the Americas, Jeanswear revenue was down at a high single-digit rate, with a mid-single-digit decline in Wrangler and a high single-digit decline in Lee. In addition to timing of shipments, we're off to a slower start to our second half. And similar to The North Face and Timberland, when cold weather materializes, we've seen immediate pickup in our denim and long bottoms business. We expect to return to mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. 
In Wrangler, on the marketing front, the brand launched a new fall creative campaign in conjunction with the start of the American football season that has received strong consumer response in brand awareness and recall. The brand also sponsored weekly programs, including ESPN College Football Live and the NFL's GameDay Morning, contributing to more than 2.3 billion national media impressions in the quarter. Wrangler's western specialty business continues to be challenged. In addition, subdued energy and industrial manufacturing conditions are impacting community spending levels, and retailers are aggressively managing inventory. 
Lee's high single-digit decline in the third quarter doesn't necessarily tell the whole story. With a low double-digit increase in the second quarter due to accelerated timing of shipments, the third quarter was penalized accordingly. When averaged across both quarters, which are pretty similar in size, revenue was essentially flat year-over-year for the comparable period. That said, we expect to deliver low single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. 
A few product highlights in the quarter that received positive response included the new Xtreme Comfort men's casual pants that has led to market share expansion and wholesale growth. In late September, Lee's Dream Jean was featured on Good Morning America's best denim segment, which has driven very nice pickup in sales. And on the marketing front, we launched the Move Your Lee campaign in September to rave reviews, an event that spiked e-commerce sales significantly."

Marking more than 3 years of consecutive quarterly growth, Lee's results were driven by solid fall/winter  bookings and strong replenishment. 
The Scarlett for women and Rider for men continued to be strong drivers for the brand. Also in Europe, the Move Your Lee brand campaign launched across Scandinavia, Germany, France and the U.K. to a very positive reception. 
Wrangler saw strength as the brand transitioned to more modern assortments, with success in top and bottoms as well as an increase in third quarter reorders. Our Body Bespoke PR and social campaign reached more than 5 million views. 
In Asia, Jeanswear revenue was in line with last year, driven by a low double-digit increase in Wrangler, offset by a slight decline in Lee due to timing of shipments from Q3 to Q4. Lee's e-commerce business was up over 20%. During the quarter, Body Optix launched in 400 doors in China, Hong Kong and e-commerce, with particularly strong sell-through. The media efforts behind Body Optix kicked off in August and was the first ever to be streamed live on Tmall. 
For the full year globally, Jeanswear revenue is now expected to see low single-digit growth.

This business, similar to Timberland and Wrangler, continue to be impacted by weakness in the energy and industrial manufacturing sectors. In LSG, MLB saw double-digit growth, with strong jersey demand aided by continued success of the Cool Base replica Jersey. 
On the workwear side, while we continue to see consistent strength in Red Kap's automotive Shop Gear line, it should be no surprise that with oil rig counts hovering at historic lows, both Red Kap and Bulwark sales were down in the quarter. Considering we will soon begin to lap this decline, we expect the workwear business to return to growth in the fourth quarter. 
Our Sportswear business was down 13% in the quarter due to weakness in both wholesale and D2C. Revenue at Nautica was down 15%. However, adjusting for a strategic decision to license the women's sleepwear and men's underwear business, the brand was down 7%. Nautica continues to face the same challenges, including heavy discounting and promotional environments in the U.S. department store channel and traffic declines at outlets, where we've closed 11 stores in the past year. 
Kipling's North America business was down 6%, and the international business was down 2%. And we expect both businesses to return to growth in the fourth quarter. And last but not least, congratulations to the Napapijri team for being VF's fastest-growing brand in the quarter.

We've already reviewed the individual coalition results, so let's look at the global business by channel. 
Direct-to-consumer revenue was up 6%, including a low double-digit increase in Outdoor & Action Sports and mid-single-digit growth in Jeanswear, moderated by a low-teen decline in Sportswear. Wholesale was down at a low single-digit rate in the quarter, with a mid-single-digit increase in our international business being offset by high single-digit decline in the U.S. By region, the Americas was down 4%, EMEA up 6% and APAC was up 4%. 
Gross margin was 48.4%, up 70 basis points versus last year as benefits from pricing, mix and lower product costs were held back a bit by inventory management efforts and a 60 basis point headwind from FX. In fact, currency-neutral gross margin expanded by 130 basis points in the quarter. 
SG&A as a percentage of revenues was up 60 basis points to 30.2% as we balanced appropriate cost controls with continued strategic investments in direct-to-consumer, product innovation and connecting our brands with consumers, whenever, wherever and however they shop. Third quarter operating margin was up 10 basis points to 18.2%, which included 40 basis points of negative impact from currency. 
By coalition, operating income in the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition was up 1%, and operating margin was 21%. That's 20 basis points less than last year as strong gross margin expansion was tempered by FX and continued investment in strategic priorities, including D2C and innovation. Jeanswear operating income was down 10%, with operating margin down 90 basis points to 20.3% due to the top line volume and the quarter-specific impacts discussed earlier. 
Profit for Imagewear was up 11%, and operating margin was up 230 basis points to 16.6% as widespread gross margin improvement, with particular strength in LSG, drove the results. And in Sportswear, operating income was down 35% for the reasons already detailed. 
So carrying all this to the bottom line, our reported EPS grew 13% to $1.20 in the third quarter. Currency-neutral earnings were up 16%. This increase was primarily due to gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate due to regional mix and discrete items. 
Now to our balance sheet. If we turn back the clock to February 19, which was in the midst of winter that never showed up, we told you we intended to carry forward about $60 million of cold-weather core product to fulfill orders for the 2016 fall/winter season. We said it again on April 29 and again on July 22. With today's report that our inventory position is nearly flat, we've now delivered on  our commitment to solid inventory management. We have great confidence that our marketplace discipline, that is, our ability to quickly adapt to supply-demand changes, will continue to play an essential role in our future performance. 
During the quarter, we bought back 2.7 million shares of VF's stock for $166 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $1 billion, meeting the target we set in February. As you know, our commitment and track record of returning cash to shareholders is essential to our approach to delivering total shareholder return. In fact, at the end of 2016, we will have returned more than $5.5 billion of cash via share buybacks and dividends over the past 5 years. 
This year, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, which is $0.05 or 14% over the prior quarterly amount. This marks the 44th consecutive year we've increased our annual dividend payout. With this increase, our calendar 2016 dividend will reach $1.53, a 15% increase over the prior year. 
Turning to outlook. We expect full year currency-neutral revenue to be up 2% to about $12.2 billion. This revision is primarily due to lower-than-expected third quarter results, which flow through to the balance of the year, and specific inventory actions we're taking at The North Face and Timberland to improve brand and channel health. 
Gross margin should improve 40 basis points to 48.6% or 49.3% currency-neutral. Operating margin should reach 14.3% or 14.8% currency-neutral. Our tax rate should be about 20%, and our reported EPS is expected to increase 3% to $3.13 or up 7% on a currency-neutral basis. 
As we assess our performance during the past year, pressures in the global economic environment and related shopping patterns combined to create what has now been a 4-quarter-long uneven environment with mixed performance across our portfolio. Throughout this period, we've continued to speak to delivering sustainable profitable growth by investing in the future and delivering value for our shareholders. And while many things in this environment have changed and shifted since last October, our financial philosophy has not. Maintaining profitability, preserving and returning capital to shareholders and strengthening our brands to ensure long-term sustainable growth remain our top priorities. 
For VF, the current environment is characterized by both challenges and opportunities. To meet the challenges, we're using multiple P&L and balance sheet levers to counterbalance top line weakness. From supply chain initiatives and inventory management to expense discipline around overhead, demand creation and investments, the evolution of our tax platform to powerful free cash flow, historically high return on capital and dividend yields, we remain able to mitigate risk and safeguard consistency even in the face of uneven conditions. We've begun to work to strategically assess and actively explore how best to optimize and leverage our strengths to create an even better, more responsive organization to accelerate growth. 
As Eric mentioned, we do have line of sight to an Investor Day, where we will share these strategies in the context of our next long-range plan. Currently, we're looking at some time late in the first quarter of next year. So stay tuned, and we'll be in touch by the holidays, if not sooner, for a ""save the date"" and more details. 
To close out today's call, amid persistently tough conditions in some geographies and categories, we believe passionately in our brands, our business and our ability to deliver the results you've come to expect from us even when our top line is challenged in an uneven environment. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll take your questions."

This brand's ability to have consistent flow of relevant new products for each of the channels that they do business in, is really, I think, one of the main points that continues to drive their significant and sustainable growth. They're intently focused on their consumer, and as they think about the different channels, they're being very thoughtful around the collections and the different collabs that they're bringing to bear in each of these seasons. The channel inventory that we see here in the U.S. is -- nothing is alarming to us. We -- they're right where we expected them to be. But I think the most remarkable thing, Bob, is the results that we're seeing in our own direct-to-consumer channel, where we control that complete brand experience, continuing to drive significant growth, this last quarter, up low teens.

But I will tell you, as we came into September, we were a bit surprised by the sheer amount of just not outerwear from the outdoor industry but all categories from across apparel. And it's what caused -- it's really brought us to make this decision to really be thoughtful around our go-forward actions and to mitigate the impact that participation in this channel can have on the long-term health of the brand. I think if we had to do it over again, we may have taken a little bit less of a position as we went into -- out of last fall. And I think what we saw that maybe compounded things that we didn't see last fall, was the bankruptcies that took place early in the year that had an additional amount of inventory moving to the off-price channel as well as online that's causing some pressure in the outdoor industry."

But I'll give you a couple real-time examples. As we saw a slowdown in the performance of our North Face stores in North America earlier this year, we rapidly worked to implement some in-store model changes that made our stores look different and were more engaging for consumers. We've been rolling that out, and we're seeing immediate impact from it. So they're pretty significant changes. And if you were to go into the Michigan Avenue store or the new store in New York City, you're going to see what we think the future of that looks like. It was a sense of urgency around making some of those tactical things, and we're doing that around the world. You heard that our D2C business is up 7% year-to-date in total. And that to us is very encouraging because when we record revenue in our D2C business it's because a consumer came into a store and bought something they wanted. When we report revenue on our wholesale model, it's shipment to another retailer for future sale to a consumer. One is a true impact of how effectively we're -- our products and stories communicate. The other has a long delay on it and is impacted by things we don't control like wholesale -- I'm sorry, like inventory and wholesale. So we've been working on the shorter-term things. And we'll be giving a lot more detail around the shape of the portfolio, the regions and how we're going to distort effort in some of those and more later in the first quarter."

One of the things that we have that is a unique competitive advantage is just under 1/3 of the products that we sell in the United States we make in this hemisphere in factories that we own and operate. And in a time when retailers are carrying less inventory and consumers are going through this buy-now-wear-now, everything is happening later, closer to the moment of purchase. And by far, our shortest lead time is when we make it in factories that we own and operate in this hemisphere, and we're uniquely positioned to do that in our space, because not very many people own and operate factories like we do. And our lead time there is a fraction of what it is from other regions of the world, and it gives us an advantage.

And we've seen bankruptcies come into view, having an impact on, certainly, where businesses like ours have the opportunity to sell but also where consumers are looking to engage. So I think the U.S. market just finds itself in maybe a similar situation where our European business was 2 or 3 years ago. And as we've got a lot of lessons learned and are employing a lot of really great solutions, I think you saw the growth that we delivered here for Q3, I think we have a really strong playbook of how to navigate this.

You'll hear that our third quarter results confirm our ability to deliver value in an uneven global economy. You will hear caution around the external environment and confidence that our operational discipline can safeguard profitability in the near and long term. But what you won't hear is that it's business as usual for VF. 
Let's start with the environment. Last October, our year-to-date revenue on a comp basis was up 9% and EPS was up 17%, including broad-based strength across our brands and regions around the world. However, during the past 4 quarters, weak consumer spending, the warmest winter on record, retail bankruptcies and excess inventory in the off-price channel have had an outsized impact, particularly on our U.S. business. Consistently positive results from our international business, which is about 40% of our revenues, have been somewhat offset by a slight decline in our U.S. business. Simply put, we've seen mixed results. 
By channel, our D2C business has seen steady growth, up 7% year-to-date, and we've made significant progress towards amplifying our connection with consumers in the space where we directly control our brands. In harnessing this powerful growth driver, we're keeping a sharpened eye toward brick and click channel shifts while staying laser-focused on productivity and ensuring our growth-oriented investments are balanced accordingly. 
In wholesale, conservative retailer open buys, buy-now-wear-now calendar shifts and leaner inventory positions remain among the top priorities for many retailers. As you'd imagine, this conservatism has put even greater pressure on vendors, who are being asked to take on larger inventory risk to meet demand closer to consumer need. And while we don't like it, rather than speculatively building inventory, we reduced our inventory buys to protect our brands and ensure channel health, and we're pulling various levers to preserve gross margin expansion and ensure profitability. With inventory up only 1%, we're confidently managing the business to be in line with the environment. 
That said, let's take a look at how this environment impacted our third quarter top line results. Revenue was down 1%. And while we were down in the U.S., VF's international business was up 6%, with a 6% increase in Europe, a 9% increase in the non-U.S. Americas region and 4% growth in Asia Pacific. 
Our direct-to-consumer business was also up 6%, with strength in the Outdoor & Action Sports and Jeanswear coalitions being tempered by ongoing weakness in Sportswear. Our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition was up 2%, driven by an 8% increase in Vans and essentially flat results for both The North Face and Timberland. Keep in mind these 3 brands faced tough comps against last year's third quarter when Timberland was up 21%, The North Face up 11% and Vans up 10% in a very different environment. 
Let's take a moment on Vans. In paraphrasing Mark Twain, the reports of Vans' decline have been greatly exaggerated. So let's take a closer look. Unless you've been following along all year, Vans' 8% growth on top of last year's 10% growth doesn't tell the whole story. As we've detailed on previous calls, Vans' EMEA business, which is about 25% of global revenue, have been working through an inventory imbalance in 2016. This work-through saw Vans' EMEA revenue down slightly this quarter, which is exactly what we expected, and we still expect the brand to return to growth in the last quarter of this year. 
In Asia, the Vans momentum continued, with revenue up more than 20%. Now in the Americas, despite reports from channel checks and even partner commentary that was mistakenly interpreted to our brand, the Vans business was up 10%, which is an acceleration of 9% in the second quarter and 8% in the first quarter. That makes 10% growth on top of 10% growth for the Vans America business. So by quarter, 8%, 9% and 10%, and we're expecting the fourth quarter to be in line with the third. And yes, that's more details than we normally give but it just seemed necessary this time around. 
Next up, and returning to the mixed and uneven environment theme, Jeanswear revenue was down 4% following 7 consecutive quarters of mid-single-digit growth. Steve will go into greater detail about the particulars in the quarter, but on balance for the year, Q3 should prove to be an anomaly, and we expect Jeanswear to return to mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. 
Our Imagewear  coalition declined 4% as growth on our Licensed Sports Group was offset by ongoing sector challenges in the workwear business. And despite the revenue decline, profit remains strong, up more than 2 points. Our Sportswear business saw revenue decline 13%, and the story there remains the same: troubling U.S. department store and outlet conditions, along with general category weakness. And finally, in August, we completed the sale of the Contemporary Brands business to Delta Galil Industries. 
Now rounding up the P&L. On a currency-neutral basis, our gross margin was up 130 basis points to 49%, and our operating margin was up 50 basis points to 18.6%. Take that through to the bottom line and currency-neutral EPS was up 16%. While we're certainly not satisfied with this quarter's top line performance, we clearly demonstrated some of the many levers we have at our disposal to ultimately get the EPS job done, and we did just that. 
So what's not business as usual? The current environment has led us to employ even greater analysis with respect to the areas of the business where we can become stronger, more efficient and more effective, from processes and operations to product creation, category expansion and distribution opportunities, to the shape of our brand portfolio and where we ultimately plan to take it in our next chapter. All of this requires an aggressive yet measured and holistic approach to marketplace management to bring the industry's most compelling and innovative products to consumers more quickly, delivering premium experiences whenever, wherever and however they connect with our brands. Our approach is centered on the development of business scenarios assessing the risk and opportunities by brand and platforms and the playbook necessary to address them and then leveraging the full power of VF's operational and financial disciplines. If this sounds like just the type of content that would fill an Investor Day, then you would be correct. It's an event we're targeting for sometime late in the first quarter of 2017, with more details to follow. 
And speaking of next chapters, we announced earlier this month that I'm retiring from the CEO position and will remain Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. The board named Steve Rendle CEO effective January 1. I give VF's board a lot of credit for its longstanding rigorous approach to succession planning, and Steve's selection is the direct result of this process.

I look forward to January 1 and the incredible opportunities that lie ahead for VF in its next chapter. 
For now, let's take a look at Q3. Starting with the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition. Revenue was up 2%. As described earlier, where we control our brands directly, we continue to see consistent growth. In the quarter, Outdoor & Action Sports D2C was up low double digits, with positive results in 9 of our 11 brands. This was offset by a low single-digit decline in wholesale, where a tough comp against last year's low-teen increase, buy-now-wear-now calendar shifts and bankruptcies tempered results. 
Turning to our 3 largest brands. Revenue for The North Face was flat, with a mid-teen increase in D2C offset by a mid-single-digit decline in wholesale. Keep in mind that last year The North Face grew 11% in the third quarter. So even though the results were flat, we performed relatively well given the changes in the environment and retailer caution around orders headed into this winter season. On a comp basis, if you exclude impacts from bankruptcies, global revenues for The North Face would have been up at a mid-single-digit rate. 
In the Americas, revenue was down mid-single digits, with healthy mid-teen D2C growth offset by a low double-digit decline in wholesale. Bankruptcies had a big impact on our wholesale business. Without them, total revenue for North Face Americas would have been flat in the quarter versus a mid-single-digit decline. Versus last year, we did see a meaningful shift of retailers wanting deliveries later in the calendar, particularly a third to fourth quarter shift. This reflects the desire to have leaner inventory positions and match consumers buy-now-wear-now behavior. Setting floors with seasonal products when it's actually the season is a shift we believe is appropriate and one that should eventually help mitigate what's been a volatile markdown environment. 
Taking a look at some of the product highlights during the quarter. As we continue to evolve our 4-season strategy, warm weather categories like training apparel, lightweight outerwear and sportswear continue to resonate. Our Mountain Athletics collection, along with products like Dryzzle, Venture and Millerton, have seen some early season momentum. 
Additionally, Thermal 3D, our new smooth-faced fleece, is already a top 5 selling sportswear style in our direct-to-consumer business. We also saw strong results in backpacks and logo wear, which, combined, were up at a mid-teen rate. 
On the branding side, less than 2 weeks ago, in honor of its 50th anniversary, The North Face unveiled its new global brand campaign, Question Madness. The campaign's digital content series showcases athletes from throughout the brand's history, examining individual mottos for exploration and the gratification that comes from pushing norms and boundaries. And finally on Wednesday this week, The North Face officially opens its Fifth Avenue store in New York City, an immersive brand experience that includes an interactive climbing wall, our unique consumer segmentation strategy and custom product that will only be available at that location. 
Clearly, a lot of momentum, innovation and experiences at play, yet we're electing to take a cautious approach to the balance of the year to more closely mirror market conditions. Despite the fact that we feel well positioned with our inventory in the channel, it's readily apparent that there's a lot of competitive product in the marketplace, particularly in the off-price channel,  that's stunting early autumn momentum. This, along with bankruptcies and warmer September and October conditions, have caused us to take a more prudent position with inventory to try to mitigate markdown risk and protect the long-term integrity of the brand. 
Given this conservativism in the Americas business, we are taking our full year global expectations down to low single-digit growth compared to the previous mid-single digit. This move is also mirrored in our full year Outdoor & Action Sports coalition outlook, certainly not what we'd like to do at this point, but on balance, the right thing to do for the brand and overall channel health. 
Now to KH."

The North Face European business had another strong quarter, with revenue up over 20%, driven by high-teen increase in DTC and more than 20% growth in our wholesale business. Demand remains strong across most geographies and product categories. Warm weather products performed well in the quarter, with our Mountain Athletics collection up over 70%, driven by our expanded men's collection. Sportswear also performed strongly, with revenue up over 20%. In September, our new Thermoball campaign went live across e-commerce, retail and wholesale, good timing before cooler weather has started to set in. 
During the quarter, we opened our first Urban Exploration store in London, an active lifestyle-focused location geared at the city adventurer. We also opened our first brand store based on a new concept, with a higher focus on the consumer experience and our distinct consumer segmentation strategies. Early results have been very promising. We are really pleased with TNF's European business. The work we started a few years ago with respect to local-for-local product design, a targeted distribution strategy and changes in the way we reach consumers has put the business solidly on track for a very strong year. 
In Asia, third quarter revenue was down slightly. Our retail business saw mid-teen growth, driven by strength in Hong Kong and strong e-commerce sales, which more than doubled as we revamped our website. This was offset by mid-single-digit decline in wholesale due to heavy promotions across the outdoor category in China. Overall, we expect Asia to return to growth in the fourth quarter. 
Now on to Vans."

In the third quarter, Vans' global revenue was up 8%, driven by a mid-teen increase in D2C and a slight bump in wholesale driven by strong results in the Americas and Asia Pacific businesses. In the Americas, revenue was up 10%. D2C, which is more than 50% of this region's revenue, and there is your cautionary tale about market share data, was up at a low-teen rate, with 15% e-commerce growth. 
Wholesale revenue was up mid-single digits, with fairly even strength across concepts. And to point out once again, this 10% increase follows 9% growth in Q2, which was up from 8% growth in Q1. 
During the quarter, our new light and Iso models met the demands of the athletic lifestyle-inspired consumer, with lightweight construction, new colors and materials. Our classic styles, specifically the Sk8-Hi and Old Skool, continue to perform really well and have been recently called out by quite a few magazines and blogs as the ""it"" shoe being frequently seen on the feet of celebrities, athletes and tastemakers worldwide. 
And of course, in its 50th year of business, Vans' heritage remains front of mind. As the original and still #1 skate shoe in core board shops, we continue to support skateboarders worldwide. During the quarter, Vans held its first Pro Skate Park Series competition in 4 countries to create the platform for skateboarding's inaugural participation in the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics. 
Earlier this month, Vans launched a collection celebrating the original characters from Disney's Toy Story movie, which showcases Andy's favorite toys across an extensive assortment of adult and kids footwear as well as apparel and accessories. Following Star Wars and Nintendo, the bar is set is pretty high, but early momentum on this one is very encouraging. 
To close out, Vans remains obsessively focused on their consumer and is becoming even better and more capable of delivering the right product across multiple channels. With momentum and the ever-present ""it"" factor on our side, we're looking forward to finishing yet another strong year for the brand in the Americas."

This result is right where we said we would be on our last call, so tracking along as planned. Independent of wholesale, which is where inventory actions have taken place all year, our DTC business has performed well, with revenue up 20%. This was driven by mid-teen comps in e-commerce, which was up more than 40% on the back of a new platform launch. 
Our iconic Old Skool and Sk8-Hi classic delivered solid [indiscernible] sales. Our Pro Skate performance was also strong, with sales up more than 30%, supported by the finals of the Pro Skate Park Series, which were held in Malmö, Sweden. Our apparel business also continues to show really strong results. Overall, for Vans Europe, we expect this business to return to growth in the fourth quarter. 
In Asia, Vans revenue continues to impress, with more than 20% growth, driven by almost 40% growth in DTC and a mid-teen increase in our wholesale business. Similar to last quarter, e-commerce had a significant role in these results by doubling its business. 
Looking at product. Old Skool continues to perform well and was up over 70% compared to last year, while the Nintendo collection continues to be a hit and had over 80% sell-through. We also completed a series of House of Vans pop-up events across Asia, which continues to be a key brand activation platform centered around creative self-expression. With more than 45,000 attendees and over 2.5 million live video views in China, we are constantly driving momentum through visibility and consumer touch points. 
And finally, China continues to maintain strong momentum, posting over 30% growth on the back of an aggressively growing e-commerce business. Globally, Vans remains on track to deliver high single-digit growth for the year.

Timberland had the toughest comparison at VF in the third quarter as it was up against a 20% -- 21% growth last year, which was driven by a 40% increase in the Americas business. Excluding impacts from bankruptcies, global revenues for Timberland would have been up at a low single-digit rate. 
The Americas had a mid-single-digit decline, with flat D2C results offset by a mid-single-digit decline in wholesale. The dip in wholesale reflects the impacts of the proactive reduction in sell-in that we spoke about on our last call and the buy-now-wear-now calendar shift very similar to The North Face, with retailers trying to set floors later in the year for cold-weather product. 
D2C was flat, including gains in full-price stores and nearly a 30% increase in e-commerce being offset by outlet locations, which saw a reduction in traffic. And similar to last quarter, the PRO business is still under pressure from subdued oil and gas exploration and industrial manufacturing. Product-wise, we've continued to see momentum in the men's casual footwear across both wholesale and D2C, which is positive validation that our diversification strategy is working. We're particularly excited about the success of our SensorFlex platform, with collections like Britton Hill and Amherst seeing excellent sell-through.  
Another bright spot is the Timberland Boot Company, which was our top family in D2C and saw strong results with our exclusive department store partner. At more than $300 a pair, this reinforces we have permission to play in the premium footwear market. In women's, we see a similar story with our casual footwear collections. Revenues for our heeled Glancy 6-inch boot were up 5x in D2C, and the Kenniston, again, a SensorFlex style, saw a strong sell-through as well, more proof points that Timberland's focus on women is paying off. 
Helping to drive the success, we launched a new marketing campaign touting the flex appeal of SensorFlex, hitting on both style and performance. The brand also launched a 360-degree marketing campaign centered on our yellow boot, driving extensive awareness, PR buzz and social engagement. In fact, the yellow boot video garnered over 3.5 million views in 6 weeks and was reported as best in class by YouTube."

Men's footwear was up nicely, supported by SensorFlex campaign. The new footwear technology combines the SensorFlex outsole with a cup sole look and is selling well. Casual category also performed and drove the footwear business to positive growth in the quarter despite the warm weather in Q3. 
In women's, we continue to innovate and bring new products to market with Kenniston being our #2 seller after the yellow boot. 
In apparel, new product introductions with updated fits, fabric and styles contributed to a 30% increase in that business, especially outerwear category that performed very well, gaining market share against competition in new silhouettes. 
Revenue in Timberland's Asian business was down slightly, with low double-digit wholesale growth offset by a mid-teen decrease in DTC due to traffic declines in Singapore and Japan. This was partially offset by e-commerce, which was up more than 50% in the region. Killington sold, too, very well in the quarter, supported by impactful in-store marketing. 
In September, consumers in Japan camped out overnight to purchase items from the limited Timberland, monkey time apparel collection, a collaboration between the 2 brands that sold out in hours. Also, just last week, Timberland launched its first direct e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia by opening a site in Singapore, so an excellent way to connect further with consumers in this important market. For the full year globally, there are no changes to the expectation that Timberland will see low single-digit revenue growth. 
Now to Jeanswear."

While we did plan for the business to be down slightly based on changes in the timing of shipments, the decline was a little more than we originally anticipated but, as Eric indicated, should still prove to be an anomaly for the full year. 
Our Americas business saw the majority of the decline, which was partially offset by strength in Europe. Results in the Asia Pacific region were in line with last year. In the Americas, Jeanswear revenue was down at a high single-digit rate, with a mid-single-digit decline in Wrangler and a high single-digit decline in Lee. In addition to timing of shipments, we're off to a slower start to our second half. And similar to The North Face and Timberland, when cold weather materializes, we've seen immediate pickup in our denim and long bottoms business. We expect to return to mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. 
In Wrangler, on the marketing front, the brand launched a new fall creative campaign in conjunction with the start of the American football season that has received strong consumer response in brand awareness and recall. The brand also sponsored weekly programs, including ESPN College Football Live and the NFL's GameDay Morning, contributing to more than 2.3 billion national media impressions in the quarter. Wrangler's western specialty business continues to be challenged. In addition, subdued energy and industrial manufacturing conditions are impacting community spending levels, and retailers are aggressively managing inventory. 
Lee's high single-digit decline in the third quarter doesn't necessarily tell the whole story. With a low double-digit increase in the second quarter due to accelerated timing of shipments, the third quarter was penalized accordingly. When averaged across both quarters, which are pretty similar in size, revenue was essentially flat year-over-year for the comparable period. That said, we expect to deliver low single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. 
A few product highlights in the quarter that received positive response included the new Xtreme Comfort men's casual pants that has led to market share expansion and wholesale growth. In late September, Lee's Dream Jean was featured on Good Morning America's best denim segment, which has driven very nice pickup in sales. And on the marketing front, we launched the Move Your Lee campaign in September to rave reviews, an event that spiked e-commerce sales significantly."

Wrangler saw strength as the brand transitioned to more modern assortments, with success in top and bottoms as well as an increase in third quarter reorders. Our Body Bespoke PR and social campaign reached more than 5 million views.

On the workwear side, while we continue to see consistent strength in Red Kap's automotive Shop Gear line, it should be no surprise that with oil rig counts hovering at historic lows, both Red Kap and Bulwark sales were down in the quarter.

We've already reviewed the individual coalition results, so let's look at the global business by channel. 
Direct-to-consumer revenue was up 6%, including a low double-digit increase in Outdoor & Action Sports and mid-single-digit growth in Jeanswear, moderated by a low-teen decline in Sportswear. Wholesale was down at a low single-digit rate in the quarter, with a mid-single-digit increase in our international business being offset by high single-digit decline in the U.S. By region, the Americas was down 4%, EMEA up 6% and APAC was up 4%. 
Gross margin was 48.4%, up 70 basis points versus last year as benefits from pricing, mix and lower product costs were held back a bit by inventory management efforts and a 60 basis point headwind from FX. In fact, currency-neutral gross margin expanded by 130 basis points in the quarter. 
SG&A as a percentage of revenues was up 60 basis points to 30.2% as we balanced appropriate cost controls with continued strategic investments in direct-to-consumer, product innovation and connecting our brands with consumers, whenever, wherever and however they shop. Third quarter operating margin was up 10 basis points to 18.2%, which included 40 basis points of negative impact from currency. 
By coalition, operating income in the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition was up 1%, and operating margin was 21%. That's 20 basis points less than last year as strong gross margin expansion was tempered by FX and continued investment in strategic priorities, including D2C and innovation. Jeanswear operating income was down 10%, with operating margin down 90 basis points to 20.3% due to the top line volume and the quarter-specific impacts discussed earlier. 
Profit for Imagewear was up 11%, and operating margin was up 230 basis points to 16.6% as widespread gross margin improvement, with particular strength in LSG, drove the results. And in Sportswear, operating income was down 35% for the reasons already detailed. 
So carrying all this to the bottom line, our reported EPS grew 13% to $1.20 in the third quarter. Currency-neutral earnings were up 16%. This increase was primarily due to gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate due to regional mix and discrete items. 
Now to our balance sheet. If we turn back the clock to February 19, which was in the midst of winter that never showed up, we told you we intended to carry forward about $60 million of cold-weather core product to fulfill orders for the 2016 fall/winter season. We said it again on April 29 and again on July 22. With today's report that our inventory position is nearly flat, we've now delivered on  our commitment to solid inventory management. We have great confidence that our marketplace discipline, that is, our ability to quickly adapt to supply-demand changes, will continue to play an essential role in our future performance. 
During the quarter, we bought back 2.7 million shares of VF's stock for $166 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $1 billion, meeting the target we set in February. As you know, our commitment and track record of returning cash to shareholders is essential to our approach to delivering total shareholder return. In fact, at the end of 2016, we will have returned more than $5.5 billion of cash via share buybacks and dividends over the past 5 years. 
This year, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, which is $0.05 or 14% over the prior quarterly amount. This marks the 44th consecutive year we've increased our annual dividend payout. With this increase, our calendar 2016 dividend will reach $1.53, a 15% increase over the prior year. 
Turning to outlook. We expect full year currency-neutral revenue to be up 2% to about $12.2 billion. This revision is primarily due to lower-than-expected third quarter results, which flow through to the balance of the year, and specific inventory actions we're taking at The North Face and Timberland to improve brand and channel health. 
Gross margin should improve 40 basis points to 48.6% or 49.3% currency-neutral. Operating margin should reach 14.3% or 14.8% currency-neutral. Our tax rate should be about 20%, and our reported EPS is expected to increase 3% to $3.13 or up 7% on a currency-neutral basis. 
As we assess our performance during the past year, pressures in the global economic environment and related shopping patterns combined to create what has now been a 4-quarter-long uneven environment with mixed performance across our portfolio. Throughout this period, we've continued to speak to delivering sustainable profitable growth by investing in the future and delivering value for our shareholders. And while many things in this environment have changed and shifted since last October, our financial philosophy has not. Maintaining profitability, preserving and returning capital to shareholders and strengthening our brands to ensure long-term sustainable growth remain our top priorities. 
For VF, the current environment is characterized by both challenges and opportunities. To meet the challenges, we're using multiple P&L and balance sheet levers to counterbalance top line weakness. From supply chain initiatives and inventory management to expense discipline around overhead, demand creation and investments, the evolution of our tax platform to powerful free cash flow, historically high return on capital and dividend yields, we remain able to mitigate risk and safeguard consistency even in the face of uneven conditions. We've begun to work to strategically assess and actively explore how best to optimize and leverage our strengths to create an even better, more responsive organization to accelerate growth. 
As Eric mentioned, we do have line of sight to an Investor Day, where we will share these strategies in the context of our next long-range plan. Currently, we're looking at sometime late in the first quarter of next year. So stay tuned, and we'll be in touch by the holidays, if not sooner, for a ""save the date"" and more details. 
To close out today's call, amid persistently tough conditions in some geographies and categories, we believe passionately in our brands, our business and our ability to deliver the results you've come to expect from us even when our top line is challenged in an uneven environment. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll take your questions."

I would tell you, first and foremost, that our Vans brand, the strong momentum continues, and I feel compelled to reiterate we were up 10% for this quarter following a 9% in Q2 and an 8% in Q1. This brand's ability to have consistent flow of relevant new products for each of the channels that they do business in, is really, I think, one of the main points that continues to drive their significant and sustainable growth. They're intently focused on their consumer, and as they think about the different channels, they're being very thoughtful around the collections and the different collabs that they're bringing to bear in each of these seasons. The channel inventory that we see here in the U.S. is -- nothing is alarming to us. We -- they're right where we expected them to be. But I think the most remarkable thing, Bob, is the results that we're seeing in our own direct-to-consumer channel, where we control that complete brand experience, continuing to drive significant growth, this last quarter, up low teens. And I'll pass it to KH, and he can talk about Europe, where we have had some inventory build that we've been systematically working through."

So I think the important fact here, Bob, is we have seen demand in the wholesale channel shift from Q3 to Q4 or, as we said in the commentary, to the right. And we've seen this beginning but -- coming out of the last winter, the dealer caution is at a significant level, and we took actions at that point to really mitigate the amount of inventory that we brought in to cover our orders. We saw -- we kind of had a good sense of what was going to go on in the off-price channel. We participated in moving goods there last fall. But I will tell you, as we came into September, we were a bit surprised by the sheer amount of just not outerwear from the outdoor industry but all categories from across apparel. And it's what caused -- it's really brought us to make this decision to really be thoughtful around our go-forward actions and to mitigate the impact that participation in this channel can have on the long-term health of the brand. I think if we had to do it over again, we may have taken a little bit less of a position as we went into -- out of last fall. And I think what we saw that maybe compounded things that we didn't see last fall, was the bankruptcies that took place early in the year that had an additional amount of inventory moving to the off-price channel as well as online that's causing some pressure in the outdoor industry."

We've been rolling that out, and we're seeing immediate impact from it. So they're pretty significant changes. And if you were to go into the Michigan Avenue store or the new store in New York City, you're going to see what we think the future of that looks like. It was a sense of urgency around making some of those tactical things, and we're doing that around the world. You heard that our D2C business is up 7% year-to-date in total. And that to us is very encouraging because when we record revenue in our D2C business it's because a consumer came into a store and bought something they wanted. When we report revenue on our wholesale model, it's shipment to another retailer for future sale to a consumer. One is a true impact of how effectively we're -- our products and stories communicate. The other has a long delay on it and is impacted by things we don't control like wholesale -- I'm sorry, like inventory and wholesale. So we've been working on the shorter-term things.

I really do wish that I had a crystal ball that could give me clear context around the fourth quarter. Let me just shape up how we look at it. The fourth quarter, Erinn, in terms of total revenue is about the same size as the third quarter. So we're looking at about a $3.5 billion quarter in each. One of the differences is that the third quarter is more about wholesale shipments to retailers for eventual sale, and we've already documented that we struggled with that in the third quarter. And the fourth quarter for us is much more about our D2C business. It is when that business peaks as a percentage of our revenue, and it's a business that is up 7% year-to-date. So it has been working for us all year around the globe, and that's one thing that gives us confidence. We've also assumed a normal winter. And by normal winter we don't mean a 1980s normal winter. We mean an average of the last 3 to 5 years a normal winter, which includes some good ones and some bad ones. And if it sets up like that, which is our assumption and that is a big assumption, that we're going to be just fine because we know our stories are working and we know we have the right products in them.

I mean, we all get to watch the TV these last few weeks, and I think there's an overarching theme going on in our political atmosphere that's giving consumers a little bit of pause and potentially making them a bit conservative as we're all uneasy about where we're ultimately going here. I think last year's fall season has had a compounding effect not just on the winter goods but in apparel and footwear in general. And we've seen bankruptcies come into view, having an impact on, certainly, where businesses like ours have the opportunity to sell but also where consumers are looking to engage. So I think the U.S. market just finds itself in maybe a similar situation where our European business was 2 or 3 years ago. And as we've got a lot of lessons learned and are employing a lot of really great solutions, I think you saw the growth that we delivered here for Q3, I think we have a really strong playbook of how to navigate this. Because I think at the center here is powerful brands, consumers absolutely want to connect with them, engage with them and purchase from them. And it's really in our court to create the compelling products and the demand creation that draws them to us and really create that loyal relationship that we can build on year-over-year."

And as I've stacked them up geographically -- and by the way, you see about the same thing in Vans, where in Americas, it was up low teens; and in EMEA, it was up over 20%, there was still strong growth in our own stores and differences in the wholesale piece of the business."

Well, the numbers I gave in an earlier comment of -- and I was focused on The North Face, where our direct-to-consumer business was up mid-teens both in the Americas and Asia and high teens in EMEA, guaranteed that there's unit sales increase in that because we certainly don't have mid-teens to high-teens price increases in our products, particularly in the third quarter, when we're not selling our most expensive outerwear products, we're selling other kinds of products in those stores, so it implies -- I mean, it actually tells you that there's a unit price increase that would -- might be slightly below those because we haven't taken big retail price increases."

I said at the opening that we had a lot to cover. That's why we went a little long on the Q&A. We wanted to give you a chance to ask your questions. I hope you heard from us a lot of confidence about the upcoming quarter. 
As I said earlier, the fourth quarter is where our business model shifts and our direct-to-consumer business peaks, both in dollars and as a percent of our revenues. And that's our best indicator, and that's where we've been performing strongly. We're up 7% year-to-date. 
We also have confidence in our wholesale business because, by this stage in the game, we obviously are -- in the quarter, we have the most visibility of any quarter in terms of what's going to happen from a wholesale business. And we sit here confident that we can deliver the year as promised even though we have -- it is not what we promised at the beginning of the year for lots of reasons that we've discussed. 
Hope we gave you some clarity, and look forward to talking to you in February."
