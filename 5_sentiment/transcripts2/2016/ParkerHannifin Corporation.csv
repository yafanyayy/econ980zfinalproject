295170,322372427,920869,"Parker-Hannifin Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Parker-Hannifin Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jon, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your anticipation today. To start, let me make a few summary comments. It continues to be a very tough environment in many of our end markets and regions. We've responded decisively to adju",919,"Thanks, Jon, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your anticipation today. 
To start, let me make a few summary comments. It continues to be a very tough environment in many of our end markets and regions. We've responded decisively to adjust to these conditions and delivered impressive margin return on sales, taking control of discretionary spending, boost employment levels across our regions in our company and implemented reduced work schedules, where necessary. This is in addition to the previously announced actions we have underway to restructure our fixed cost and simplification efforts designed to streamline our operations. On both of those fronts, we made excellent progress in the second quarter. 
Given the current headwinds, we are very pleased with the way our teams have responded, as evidenced by a strong margin performance and our ability to control decremental marginal return on sales for the past 3 quarters. We expect strong decremental margin return on sales to continue through our fiscal year-end. 
Moving on to specifics for the second quarter. Sales declined 14% as the effects of the strong dollar negatively impacted us by approximately 4%. And organic sales declined 10%, reflecting end market weakness. Total order rates for the second quarter declined 12% compared with the same quarter last year. Despite this downturn, I am very pleased we delivered total segment operating margins of 12.2% or 13.5% on an adjusted basis. 
During the second quarter, we delivered decremental margin return on sales of 17.2% adjusted, which represents excellent performance in this current business climate. This is really a testament to the way we are fundamentally changing Parker's operating structure. In previous downturns in which we've experienced such a significant reduction in sales volume, we would not have been able to maintain such strong margin performance. The primary drivers for our margin performance include: savings from restructuring we have done in prior periods, immediate and decisive actions on cost-containment and the benefits of a range of simplification initiatives that we have implemented. 
Regarding simplification, we have announced a total of 28 division consolidations. We continue to review our organization and process to reduce overhead cost and simplify processes. This has also helped us to reduce corporate G&A cost. 
Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.33 or $1.52 adjusted for business realignment expenses. Operating cash flow year-to-date includes a $200 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. pension plan. Excluding the contribution year-to-date, operating cash to sales was 9.8%. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased $90 million of Parker shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $400 million. We have now repurchased $1.74 billion under our previous announced $2 billion to $3 billion Parker share repurchase plan over 2 years, which began in October 2014. 
Moving on to discussion on key market trends. As projected in the second quarter, we saw continued pressure in natural resource markets such as oil and gas, agriculture, mining and construction equipment, as the prices of commodities continued to move lower. Our distribution channel remained affected by these markets, particularly those with exposure to oil and gas. We continue to experience general industrial activity weakening due to the knock-on effect from natural resource markets. These challenging markets outweighed positive growth in other markets such as power generation, air-conditioning, turf, rail and heavy-duty truck. 
In summary, our second quarter sales were in line with our October guidance. And Lee will provide some more color on our end markets in the Q&A portion of the call. 
Now switching to our outlook. For fiscal year 2016, we are narrowing the range of our guidance for earnings to $5.90 to $6.30 per share on an adjusted basis, which maintains the earnings midpoint of $6.10 per share. It also means that our implied guidance for the second half of the fiscal year has been adjusted downward for sales and earnings to reflect weaker order entry levels that we experienced in the second quarter. 
We will continue to aggressively manage costs in this challenging environment. Our primary focus will be on maintaining strong decremental margin performance and positioning Parker to weather this downturn and emerge stronger as conditions improve. 
We are also continuing with actions [indiscernible] growth opportunities we have identified under the new Win Strategy. So just to reinforce, our long-term financial objectives to be achieved at the end of fiscal year 2020 are: targeting sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production. We're also targeting 17% segment operating margins. And progress towards these goals is expected to deliver on the annual growth rate on earnings per share of 8% over this 5-year period. 
We are excited about opportunities we have to position Parker at the top-quartile company compared with our proxy peers. 
Growth initiatives are underway to further expand our distribution network, commercialize new products and systems, improve the customer experience, expand our service offerings and to leverage e-business Internet of Things capabilities. 
During the second quarter, we developed a comprehensive, long-term plan to accelerate our e-business capabilities. We see opportunities to leverage our distribution channel as part of our strategy to grow our business and create a better customer experience. 
Parker's Internet of Things initiatives became significant momentum in the quarter. We hosted a global connected [indiscernible] that garnered dozens of which Internet of Things application ideas. 
In summary, execution under the new Win Strategy is expected to deliver top-quartile performance versus our proxy peers. 
So for now I hand things back to Jon to review more details in the quarter."

Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.33 versus $1.80 for the same quarter a year ago. This excludes business real",1433,"Thanks, Tom. And at this time, please refer to Slide #5. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.33 versus $1.80 for the same quarter a year ago. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.19 and compares to $0.04 for the same quarter last year. 
On Slide #6, you'll find the significant components of the law from adjusted earnings per share of $1.84 for the second quarter FY '15 to $1.52 for the second quarter of this year. The impact of fewer shares outstanding equated to an increase of $0.11 per share. 
Increases to adjusted per share income include: lower corporate G&A expense equating to $0.11 due to reduction in and long-term incentive accruals as well as our simplification efforts, as Tom mentioned. A reduced tax rate for the quarter contributed $0.02, driven by the passage of the U.S. extenders from which the company recognized R&D credit. Reductions to adjusted per share income include lower adjusted segment operating income of $0.39 per share due to the impact of foreign currency and the continued weakening of end market demand and increased interest and other expense that totaled $0.18 per share as compared to the prior year in which various onetime favorable adjustments were recognized. 
Moving to Slide #7 with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the second quarter. Total company organic sales in the first quarter decreased by 9.6% over the same quarter last year. It was a modest 3% contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was slightly higher than planned, equating to a negative impact on reported sales of $139 million or 4.4% in the quarter. 
Total company segment operating margins for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter, was 13.5% versus 14% for the same quarter last year. Restructuring costs incurred in the quarter were $35 million versus $9 million last year. 
The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $366 million versus $439 million last year reflects the impact of reduced volume and unfavorable mix from the continued weakening of several industrial end markets. 
Moving to Slide #8. I'll discuss the business segments starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the second quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 15.2% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a modest impact from acquisitions and a negative impact from currency of 1.3% in the quarter. 
Operating margin for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 15% of sales versus 16.3% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses incurred totaled $20 million as compared to a nominal spend in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $174 million as compared to $227 million, driven by reduced volume as a result of softening trends in key end markets. 
I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on Slide #9. Organic sales for the second quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 7.1%. Currency negatively impacted sales by 10%. Operating margin for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment cost, was 11% of sales versus 12.3% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $14 million as compared to $9 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $109 million as compared to $146 million, which reflects the impact of the foreign currencies as well as weaker end markets. 
I'll now move to Slide #10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues decreased nominally at 0.7% for the second quarter. Currency posed a modest negative impact of about 4/10 of 1% [ph]. Sales for the period were maintained as a result of higher aftermarket sales volume, which offset modest year-over-year declines in OEM sales. 
Operating margins for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment cost, was 14.8% of sales versus 12% in the prior year. Nominal realignment expenses were incurred for the period adjusted operating income was $82 million as compared to $67 million, reflecting the favorable mix of higher aftermarket sales volume this quarter combined with reduced development costs as a percentage of sales. 
Moving to Slide #11 with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a 3-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. 
Total orders were a negative 12% for the quarter end, reflecting the further softening of the Industrial segment stemming from natural resource-related end markets, as Tom mentioned. Diversified Industrial North American orders decreased to negative 15%. Diversified Industrial International orders decreased to negative 10% for the quarter. Aerospace Systems orders improved to a negative 11% for the quarter, which continues to be impacted by lumpy prior-year comparables. 
On Slide #12, we report cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operating activities year-to-date was $347 million, but when adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, cash from operating activities was 9.8% of sales. This compares to 8.4% of sales for the same period last year. 
In addition to the pension contribution, the significant uses of cash year-to-date were $572 million returned to our shareholders via share repurchases of $400 million and dividends of $172 million. $68 million was spent for acquisitions closed during the first quarter. No acquisitions were announced in the second quarter. And we had $75 million for CapEx equating to approximately 1.4% of sales year-to-date. 
Slide #13 provides the -- for FY '16 guidance as outlined. Guidance is being provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of approximately $100 million, which are forecast to be incurred throughout FY '16. 
Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 12.6% to negative 9.3% or negative 9.9% at the midpoint as compared to the prior year. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is negative 7.9%. Currency in the guidance negatively impacts sales by 3.4%, which is nearly all attributable to the international industrial segment. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of December 31, 2015, and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the balance of FY '16. 
The total Parker adjustment segment operating margins are forecast to be between 14.4% and 14.6%. This compares to 14.9% for FY '15 on an adjusted basis. As Tom mentioned, we're very pleased to be guiding to this level of adjusted segment operating margins, given the magnitude of the end market softness and order decline. 
The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate admin, interest and our category, Other, is $440 million -- $484 million for the year at the midpoint. Our full year tax rate is projected at approximately 28%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full year guidance is 137.1 million shares. 
For the full year, guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis is $5.90 to $6.30 or $6.10 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $100 million to be incurred in FY '16. Savings from these business realignment initiatives continue to be projected in the amount of $70 million, which are reflected in the segment operating margins. 
Some additional key assumptions for full year 2016 guidance are: sales are divided 49%, first half; 51%, second half. Adjusted segment operating income is divided 49%, first half; 51%, second half. Adjusted EPS is $3.04 in the first half and $3.06 in the second half. Q3 FY '16 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.40 per share at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.17 of business realignment expenses. 
On Slide #14, you'll find the reconciliation of the major components of the revised FY '16 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.10 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY '16 EPS guidance. Increases include $0.12 from reduced tax rate, $0.13 from a reduced corporate G&A, interest and other, and $0.05 from fewer shares outstanding. This is fully offset by a decrease of $0.30 reduction in segment operating income, reflecting further reduced volume and unfavorable mix forecasted within key industrial end markets. 
Please remember that the forecast excludes any future acquisitions or divestitures that might be closed during FY '16. For consistency, we ask that you exclude restructuring expenses from your published estimates. 
This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary comments."

Like I've done before in the past,, I'll just kind of walk around the regions, and I'll make some comments on the end markets and I'll also comment on our distribution channel. I think one common thread that hasn't changed is the whole natural resources-driven markets, ag, mining, construction, equipment, oil and gas, they really, by and large, continue to be challenging everywhere around the world. So starting off with North America. I think oil and gas, in terms of distribution, continues to be the big story when you think about distribution in aggregate. Now having said that, if I focus on distribution, it doesn't have heavy continent oil and gas. We've got positive year-over-year growth. But what's happened with oil and gas and its pervasiveness through the distribution base, that is still very difficult. Looking at really air-conditioning, refrigeration markets in North America, we've seen good North American residential air-conditioning growth. This is a result obviously of the continued strengthening of housing market. We've seen share gains on our behalf, and the really increased in product content, which has to do with the sheer efficiency changes that occurred last year. So we're really happy with what's happening in those markets. Commercial air-conditioning refrigeration market really have been down year-over-year, but we are expecting growth in the balance of calendar 2016 and moving into 2017. And then lastly, if I look at the aftermarket channel in this segment, which should be different than the industrial distribution, we really remain solid year-to-date growth. And this is really what -- based on the markets but also a big part of some new products and some smart service toolkit that we've introduced into that market segment, so very positive there. Touching back on North America, oil and gas. As I mentioned in  my distribution comments, we continue to see extreme weakness, double-digit declines across all of our end customers. Our customers, and I've had plenty of these conversations, are not signaling any significant improvement until the end of calendar year '16 or early 2017. All of them have very active restructuring plans to be profitable in today's oil prices. Turning to agriculture. We continue to see top line declines, which is consistent, I think, in contraction and production schedules at our major customers, so very weak on the agricultural equipment side. On energy, wind and energy storage business for us remains robust, with major customers maintaining a healthy backlog. And then the decommissioning of U.S. coal and oil-fired plants continues at a fairly brisk pace and has brought some good opportunity for us on natural gas conversion projects. On heavy-duty truck, Class 8 truck, this market has been very good and growing for us and was excellent. But consistent with industry forecast, we are lowering our forecast by at least 20% from the 2015 levels going forward. On the mobile side, mobile equipment. The traditional construction equipment markets continue to be soft in North America. A highlight here has been some really nice wins in the turf business. The market is up and has been a bright spot as we continue to win new business there. And then lastly, I'll just talk about implant automotive. Our key North American distribution that covers implant automotive is up year-over-year versus Q2 versus prior. But we are expecting a slowing of CapEx spending in this area, which will have an impact on the machine tool builders in this area. So next, North America. In Europe, there's -- well, I'll comment on Europe. So if I talk about distribution, weak overall, with Q2 down versus last year. I think what I have to highlight here is if you pull out distribution, it's tied to oil and gas, which is really U.K., Norway. It's up year-over-year. And we have seen steady progress outside oil and gas-related distribution. We've continued to see strong distribution growth in emerging regions, and this is a highlight. If I look at Germany, it's ahead of last year-to-date. It obviously has much less oil and gas exposure than other countries. Oil and gas for the region, investment in North Sea is almost at a standstill. Looking at the U.K., capital investment in North Sea has dropped significantly. But we are still finding opportunities. We've had some nice wins in point of use for clean diesel wins in some emerging markets, really, systems eliminating high water content using our fluid conveyance and filtration technologies. Agriculture, still pretty much the same as North America. Production rates, low. In energy, very excited about some recent wins for energy grid-type systems and really is a complement to our growth in the renewable energy segments. Class 8 truck, that continues to remain strong. I was looking at this. I think this is the fifth consecutive quarter of growth in that area, so we're very positive about that. And then the mobile construction equipment markets, we actually have seen some stability there with a little bit of modest growth from Q1 to Q2. Turning to Asia. Distribution. As a total, flat to moderately down year-over-year. And I attribute some of that to our continued expansion, which we in highlighted our Win Strategy of expanding our distribution points around the world. And we are doing that in the region. Oil and gas. Again, it is a contraction across the region. It's a note that we do see some positive success with some project builds in China. And I think with a lot of these state-owned oil and gas companies that still continue to invest, maybe it's somewhat of a reduced rate. On energy in the region, really, I'm speaking to China mostly. Renewable, wind, solar and hydro is growing rapidly, but traditional thermal power, coal, is still taking a major share. On rail, and this really speaks to China. We continue to be very bullish on the rail market. The Chinese government's making significant investments in this area. We've had -- there's a strong focus on the export markets, suffice rail technology Europe, Africa and Asia, and they continue to win business there. And for us, we've had a very good market participation in that segment. We continue to have strong participation across the rail market in China. On mobile construction, I can't say anything. It has progressed positively, so last time we talked, there continues to be a slowing rate of growth in China's construction industry and really has been a key driving factor in the deceleration declaration of many parts of the Asia-Pacific. In our customers there continue to have really tons of idle capacity and inventory on hand. And then lastly, just talking to Latin America. It's really about Brazil. I wouldn't go into details. I think everybody knows what was a continued to be just a very dire condition. And we've seen softness in all our end markets, mining, power gen, oil and gas, heavy-duty truck, et cetera."

What we did for the second half is basically took the order entry that we saw that Lee described in all the regions and markets in the second quarter. What's really -- Aerospace orders got better, less negative. And Industrial North America got forced by 3 points, and internationally, of course, by 2. So we took that order entry and basically translated that into the second half from an organic growth standpoint. So our second half organic growth from our previous guidance used to be minus 5, and now it's minus 7.5%. So we dropped the 2.5 points organically. And then we have the second half coming out at a minus 15% decremental MROS, and that's how you get the second half EPS numbers."

I'll start with the material cost side. I would say, compared to our previous guidance, we're seeing a consistent GAAP between pricing and the materials side, that our ability to maintain the decrementals is driven by the simplification of the restructuring actions. And remember that the bulk of our savings is in the second half, so that is going to help carry us. And we feel good about this fiscal year. I'm not going to go beyond this fiscal year trying to tell you what our large return on sales is going to be. But this fiscal year, we feel very good about sustainability. Return on 3 quarters in a row, and I think for everybody on the phone to help remind everybody, the way we achieved that is it was prior-year restructuring that we did. All the teams are moved out very rapidly to get on top of the market adjustment that we launched the simplification plan, which really was more strategically restructuring leading to the footprint restructuring that we're doing. That enabled us to keep these very nice, basically half of what we have historically have done is a bit of a history lesson. If you go back to the '01 projection, we are -- recession, there's a minus 60% MROS. The Great Recession was around minus 40%. And here we are with minus 15% to minus 20% range on an adjusted basis and low 20s even reported all-in. So I think it's sustainable and that's what we have in the plan for the next 2 quarters. On the balance sheet, the acquisitions -- the pipeline's active, but valuations are still high. And I think what you're seeing is a delay in the reality from sellers expectations to fires like us as far as setting a new revenue targets for what they think for the business. That's the key valuation difference. I think everybody we're disciplined buyers, and we buy things that are in our space. So we understand what the growth rates are. And I think at time's on our side. I think as time goes on, people see the new reality that, hey, it's maybe not going to grow that they had thought. It was the previous decade. But those valuations will come in more online, and I think our pipeline will become were actionable at that point. So it's lumpy. It's hard for us to predict output, but we're still working."

And we look at the bottom tail, the density of the numbers and the corporate give it is the cost to sustain that. We're very early days in the heading into that. And that a little more typical for us to work with their early days of that. And then the whole organization of process optimization is the second part. We still see lots of opportunities on that. So that's more strategic restructuring overhead structure of the company. The division consolidations was the third leg of it. So we're 28 divisions so far that we're working on. We'll do more. I do think you'll see another 28 in the next fiscal year, what you'll see us continue to work that. And then just good old-fashioned bureaucracy. We're looking at our planning process, approvals, reports, you name it, all of the things that just slows things down, and that obviously carries cost and create better service opportunities for our customers.

With the cash generated, what taxes said we have to cash and also with our goal that we'd like to maintain as we go through this for a lot of reasons. But on the deployment side, if we look at the best opportunities to yield the best long-term value for our shareholders comparing, recognizing we're going to do the dividends first.

I'm going to be a little bit coy here with you here because I'm not going to give you the dividend color that I might normally work because I'll be giving competitively sensitive information to our competitors and trying to help them be successful. But let me just, suffice it to say, that we want on e-business side is we want a Google-like experience for our customers and for our distributors when they come to the website. And we've launched a number of things that we think we'll get us there. It's not going to happen overnight. We've made progress, we think, over the last couple of years. And as we talked our customers and distributors, they see that, but we clearly recognize we're not there. So we see this as a potential additional growth channel leveraging the great distribution channel that we have already. And just remember that about 60% of the relationship between our customers and suppliers nowadays happens to be that website. It happens before we even talk to you. So that's why we want this to be so important. We're investing in it. We made some organizational design changes to add some resources and add leadership because that's what the change we made in August last year. On the Internet of Things, that [indiscernible] place people not familiar with what that is, is basically in aviation process we have gathered ideas around the company. And that coupled with the fact that we make that equity investment in exo site, which gives us a software backbone to help all the applications throughout the company has really given us program for ideas. So we've taken that ideation process to connectathon and we've narrowed it down to about 10 of what we think are the best, most commercial actionable project and we think that's got multimillion-type of look, tens of millions of dollars of revenues over the next 3 years. Most of that's, not going to cut and probably towards the end of FY '17 and FY '18. It's probably going to take 1.5 years incubation here. We do have 2 good examples, and Lee highlighted one of them that the smart service get, which is helping us in refrigeration from the air-conditioning market. So if you take a air-conditioning contract today, they have a lot of mechanical tools they have to do to measure pressure, humidity, temperatures. And so this is a patented sensor that we have, allows you to diagnose and troubleshoot the conditions of that air-conditioning much more rapidly for the value of the contractors. Many more calls happens during the day. They can get a print out be under smartphone or [indiscernible] and pointed out if they wanted for the customer so they can see what's going on with your units. So we launched that. We've been very pleased with the initial sale sand that's really good example of taking a traditional market and using the Internet of Things to make it to be -- to make it even better. It makes our expansion valves and things we get into our check valves very sticky. But in our contract, it's really loved in the toolkit. If you to go to our website, you can probably find a value from one of our contractors testimonial talk about it as well."

To start, let me make a few summary comments. It continues to be a very tough environment in many of our end markets and regions. We have responded decisively to adjust to these conditions and delivered impressive margin return on sales. We have taken control of discretionary spending, boosted employment levels across our regions in our company and implemented reduced work schedules where necessary. This is in addition to the previously announced actions we have underway to restructure our fixed cost and simplification efforts designed to streamline our operations. On both of those fronts, we made excellent progress in the second quarter. 
Given the current headwinds, we are very pleased with the way our teams have responded, as evidenced by the strong margin performance and our ability to control decremental marginal return on sales for the past 3 quarters. We expect strong decremental marginal return on sales to continue through our fiscal year-end. 
Moving on to specifics for the second quarter. Sales declined 14% as the effects of the strong dollar negatively impacted us by approximately 4%. And organic sales declined 10%, reflecting end market weakness. Total order rates for the second quarter declined 12% compared with the same quarter last year. Despite this downturn, I am very pleased we delivered total segment operating margins of 12.2% or 13.5% on an adjusted basis. 
During the second quarter, we delivered decremental marginal return on sales of 17.2% adjusted, which represents excellent performance in this current business climate. This is really a testament to the way we are fundamentally changing Parker's operating structure. In previous downturns in which we have experienced such a significant reduction in sales volume, we would not have been able to maintain such strong margin performance. 
The primary drivers for our margin performance include savings from restructuring we have done in prior periods, immediate and decisive actions on cost containment and the benefits of a range of simplification initiatives that we have implemented. 
Regarding simplification, we have announced a total of 28 division consolidations. We continue to review our organization and process to reduce overhead costs and simplify processes. This has also helped us to reduce corporate G&A costs. 
Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.33 or $1.52 adjusted for business realignment expenses. Operating cash flow year-to-date includes a $200 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. pension plan. Excluding the contribution year-to-date, operating cash to sales was 9.8%. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased $90 million in Parker shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $400 million. We have now repurchased $1.74 billion under our previously announced $2 billion to $3 billion Parker share repurchase plan over 2 years, which began in October 2014. 
Moving on to the discussion on key market trends. As projected in the second quarter, we saw continued pressure on natural resource markets, such as oil and gas, agriculture, mining and construction equipment, as the prices of commodities continue to move lower. Our distribution channel remain affected by these markets, particularly those with exposure to oil and gas. We continue to experience general industrial activity weakening due to the knock-on effect from natural resource markets. These challenging markets outweighed positive growth in other markets, such as power generation, air conditioning, lawn and turf, rail and heavy-duty truck. 
In summary, our second quarter sales were in line with our October guidance. And Lee will provide some more color on our end markets in the Q&A portion of the call. 
Now switching to our outlook. For fiscal year 2016, we are narrowing the range of our guidance for earnings to $5.90 to $6.30 per share on an adjusted basis, which maintains the earnings midpoint of $6.10 per share. It also means that our implied guidance for the second half of the fiscal year has been adjusted downward for sales and earnings to reflect weaker order entry levels that we experienced in the second quarter. 
We will continue to aggressively manage costs in this challenging environment. Our primary focus will be on maintaining strong decremental margin performance and positioning Parker to weather this downturn and emerge stronger as conditions improve. We are also continuing with actions to execute the many growth opportunities we have identified under the new Win Strategy. 
So just to reinforce, our long-term financial objectives to be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2020 are targeting sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production, we are also targeting 17% segment operating margins, and progress towards these goals is expected to deliver a compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this 5-year period. 
We are excited about opportunities we have to position Parker as a top-quartile company compared with our proxy peers. 
Growth initiatives are underway to further expand our distribution network, commercialize new products and systems, improve the customer experience, expand our service offerings and to leverage e-business and Internet of Things capabilities. 
During the second quarter, we developed a comprehensive long-term plan to accelerate our e-business capabilities. We see opportunities to leverage our distribution channel as part of our strategy to grow our business and create a better customer experience. 
Parker's Internet of Things initiative gained significant momentum in the quarter. We hosted a global Connectathon that garnered dozens of rich Internet of Things application ideas. 
In summary, execution on the new Win Strategy is expected to deliver top-quartile performance versus our proxy peers. 
So for now, I hand things back to Jon to review more details on the quarter."

I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.33 versus $1.80 for the same quarter a year ago. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.19 and compares to $0.04 for the same quarter last year. 
On Slide #6, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.84 for the second quarter FY '15 to $1.52 for the second quarter of this year. The impact of fewer shares outstanding equated to an increase of $0.11 per share. 
Increases to adjusted per share income include lower corporate G&A expense equating to $0.11 due to reduction in long-term incentive accruals as well as our simplification efforts, as Tom mentioned. A reduced tax rate for the quarter contributed $0.02, driven by the passage of the U.S. extenders from which the company recognized R&D credit. Reductions to adjusted per share income include lower adjusted segment operating income of $0.39 per share due to the impact of foreign currency, and the continued weakening of end market demand and increased interest and other expense that totaled $0.18 per share as compared to the prior year in which various onetime favorable loan adjustments were recognized. 
Moving to Slide #7 with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the second quarter. Total company organic sales in the first quarter decreased by 9.6% over the same quarter last year. It was a modest 3% contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was slightly higher than planned, equating to a negative impact on reported sales of $139 million or 4.4% in the quarter. 
Total company segment operating margins for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter, was 13.5% versus 14% for the same quarter last year. Restructuring costs incurred in the quarter were $35 million versus $9 million last year. 
The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $366 million versus $439 million last year reflects the impact of reduced volume and unfavorable mix from the continued weakening of several industrial end markets. 
Moving to Slide #8. I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the second quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 15.2% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a modest impact from acquisitions and a negative impact from currency of 1.3% in the quarter. 
Operating margin for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 15% of sales versus 16.3% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses incurred totaled $20 million as compared to a nominal spend in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $174 million as compared to $227 million, driven by reduced volume as a result of softening trends in key end markets. 
I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on Slide #9. Organic sales for the second quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 7.1%. Currency negatively impacted sales by 10%. Operating margin for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 11% of sales versus 12.3% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $14 million as compared to $9 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $109 million as compared to $146 million, which reflects the impact of the foreign currencies as well as weaker end markets. 
I'll now move to Slide #10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues decreased nominally at 0.7% for the second quarter. Currency posed a modest negative impact of about 0.4%. Sales for the period were maintained as a result of higher aftermarket sales volume, which offset modest year-over-year declines at OEM sales. 
Operating margins for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 14.8% of sales versus 12% in the prior year. Nominal realignment expenses were incurred for the period. Adjusted operating income was $82 million as compared to $67 million, reflecting the favorable mix of higher aftermarket sales volume this quarter combined with reduced development costs as a percentage of sales. 
Moving to Slide #11 with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a 3-month rolling average while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. 
Total orders were a negative 12% for the quarter end, reflecting the further softening of the Industrial segment stemming from natural resource-related end markets, as Tom mentioned. Diversified Industrial North American orders decreased to negative 15%. Diversified Industrial International orders decreased to negative 10% for the quarter. Aerospace Systems orders improved to a negative 11% for the quarter, which continues to be impacted by lumpy prior year comparables. 
On Slide #12, we report cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operating activities year-to-date was $347 million, but when adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, cash from operating activities was 9.8% of sales. This compares to 8.4% of sales for the same period last year. 
In addition to the pension contribution, the significant uses of cash year-to-date were $572 million returned to our shareholders via share repurchases of $400 million and dividends of $172 million. $68 million was expended for acquisitions closed during the first quarter. No acquisitions were announced in the second quarter. And we had $75 million for CapEx, equating to approximately 1.4% of sales year-to-date. 
Slide #13 provides the -- for FY '16 guidance as outlined. Guidance is being provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of approximately $100 million, which are forecast to be incurred throughout FY '16. 
Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 12.6% to negative 9.3% or negative 9.9% at the midpoint as compared to the prior year. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is negative 7.9%. Currency in the guidance negatively impacts sales by 3.4%, which is nearly all attributable to the International Industrial segment. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of December 31, 2015, and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the balance of FY '16. 
For total Parker, adjusted segment operating margins are forecast to be between 14.4% and 14.6%. This compares to 14.9% for FY '15 on an adjusted basis. As Tom mentioned, we are very pleased to be guiding to this level of adjusted segment operating margins given the magnitude of the end market softness and order decline. 
The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate admin, interest and our category, other, is 440 -- $484 million for the year at the midpoint. Our full year tax rate is projected at approximately 28%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full year guidance is 137.1 million shares. 
For the full year, guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis is $5.90 to $6.30 or $6.10 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $100 million to be incurred in FY '16. Savings from these business realignment initiatives continue to be projected in the amount of $70 million, which are reflected in the segment operating margins. 
Some additional key assumptions for full year 2016 guidance are sales are divided 49% first half, 51% second half. Adjusted segment operating income is divided 49% first half, 51% second half. Adjusted EPS is $3.04 in the first half and $3.06 in the second half. Q3 FY '16 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.40 per share at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.17 of business realignment expenses. 
On Slide #14, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of the revised FY '16 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.10 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY '16 EPS guidance. Increases include $0.12 from reduced tax rate; $0.13 from a reduced corporate G&A, interest and other; and $0.05 from fewer shares outstanding. This is fully offset by a decrease of $0.30 reduction in segment operating income, reflecting further reduced volume and unfavorable mix forecasted within key industrial end markets. 
Please remember that the forecast excludes any future acquisitions or divestitures that might be closed during FY '16. For consistency, we ask that you exclude restructuring expenses from your published estimates. 
This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary comments."

I am very encouraged by the response of our Parker team members. It has been just about 1 year since Lee and I took full responsibility for the company. It's certainly been a challenging year from a market perspective. However, our teams have not only adapted quickly to the challenges before them, but they have also embraced the new path forward for Parker and are working hard to build a stronger and better Parker for the future under the direction of the Win Strategy.

Like I've done before in the past,, I'll just kind of walk around the regions, and I'll make some comments on the end markets, and I'll also comment on our distribution channel. I think one common thread that hasn't changed is the whole natural resource-driven markets: ag, mining, construction equipment, oil and gas, they really, by and large, continue to be challenging everywhere around the world. So starting off with North America. I think oil and gas in terms of distribution continues to be the big story when you think about distribution in aggregate. Now having said that, if I focus on distribution, it doesn't have heavy content in oil and gas. We've got positive year-over-year growth. But what's happened with oil and gas and its pervasiveness through the distribution base, that is still very difficult. Looking at really air conditioning and refrigeration markets in North America, we've seen good North America residential air conditioning growth. This is a result obviously of the continued strengthening of the housing market. We've seen share gains on our behalf, and they really had increased in product content, which has to do with the sheer efficiency changes that occurred last year. So we're really happy with what's happening in those markets. Commercial air conditioning and refrigeration markets really have been down year-over-year, but we are expecting growth in the balance of calendar 2016 and moving into 2017. And then lastly, if I look at the aftermarket channel in this segment, which should be different than the industrial distribution, we really remain solid year-to-date growth. And this is really, one, based on the markets but also a big part of some new products and some smart service toolkits that we've introduced into that market segment, so very positive there. Touching back on North America oil and gas. As I mentioned in my distribution comments, we continue to see extreme weakness, double-digit declines across all of our end customers. Our customers, and I've had plenty of these conversations, are not signaling any significant improvement until the end of calendar year '16 or early 2017. And all of them have very active restructuring plans to be profitable in today's oil prices. Turning to agriculture. We continue to see top line declines, which is consistent, I think, in contraction and production schedules at our major customers, so very weak on the agricultural equipment side. On energy, wind and energy storage business for us remains robust, with major customers maintaining a healthy backlog. And then the decommissioning of U.S. coal and oil-fired plants continues at a fairly brisk pace and has brought some good opportunity for us on natural gas conversion projects. On heavy-duty truck, Class 8 truck, this market has been very good and growing for us and was excellent. But consistent with industry forecasts, we are lowering our forecast by at least 20% from the 2015 levels going forward. On the mobile side, mobile equipment, the traditional construction equipment markets continue to be soft in North America. A highlight here has been some really nice wins in the turf business. The market is up and has been a bright spot as we continue to win new business there. And then lastly, I'll just talk about in-plant automotive. Our key North America distribution that covers in-plant automotive is up year-over-year versus -- I mean, Q2 versus prior. But we are expecting a slowing of CapEx spending in this area, which will have impact on the machine tool builders that cover this area. So that's North America. In Europe, there's -- well, I'll comment on Europe. So if I talk about distribution, weak overall, with Q2 down versus last year. But I think what I have to highlight here is if you pull out distribution that's tied to oil and gas, which is really U.K., Norway, it's up year-over-year, and we have seen steady progress outside oil and gas-related distribution. We've continued to see strong distribution growth in emerging regions. And this is a highlight, if I look at Germany, it's ahead of last year-to-date. It obviously has much less oil and gas exposure than other countries. Oil and gas for the region, investment in North Sea is almost at a standstill. Looking at the U.K., capital investment in North Sea has dropped significantly. But we are still finding opportunities. We've had some nice wins in point of use for clean diesel wins in some emerging markets, really systems eliminating high water content using our fluid conveyance and filtration technologies. Agriculture, still pretty much the same as North America. Production rates, low. In energy, very excited about some recent wins in -- for energy grid-type systems and really is a complement to our growth in the renewable energy segments. Class 8 truck continues to remain strong. I was looking at this. I think this is the fifth consecutive quarter of growth in that area, so we're very positive about that. And then the mobile construction equipment markets, we actually have seen some stability there with a little bit of modest growth from Q1 to Q2. Turning to Asia. Distribution, as a total, flat to moderately down year-over-year. And I attribute some of that to our continued expansion, which we highlighted in our Win Strategy of expanding our distribution points around the world, and we are doing that in the region. Oil and gas, again, it is a contraction across the region. It's of note that we do see some positive success with some project builds in China. And I think with a lot of these state-owned oil and gas companies that still continue to invest, maybe it's somewhat of a reduced rate. On energy in the region, really, I'm speaking to China mostly. Renewable, wind, solar and hydro, is growing rapidly, but traditional thermal power as coal, gas and nuclear is still taking a major share. On rail, and this really speaks to China. We continue to be very bullish on the rail market. The Chinese government's making significant investments in this area. We've had -- there's a strong focus on the export markets of high-speed-rail technology to North America, Europe, Africa and Asia, and they continue to win business there. And for us, we've had a very good market participation in that segment. We continue to have strong participation across the rail market in China. On mobile construction, I can't say anything. It has progressed positively since the last time we talked. There continues to be a slowing rate of growth in China's construction industry and really has been a key driving factor in the deceleration in many parts of Asia Pacific. But our customers there continue to have really tons of idle capacity and inventory on hand. And then lastly, just talking to Latin America. It's really about Brazil. I won't go into the details. I think everybody knows, but Brazil continues to be just in very dire condition. And we've seen softness in all our end markets: mining, power gen, oil and gas, heavy-duty truck, et cetera."

So I'll start with the material cost side. I would say, compared to our previous guidance, we're seeing a consistent gap between pricing and the materials side, that our ability to maintain the decrementals is driven by the simplification and the restructuring actions. And remember that the bulk of our savings is in the second half, so that is going to help carry us. And we feel good about this fiscal year. I'm not going to go beyond this fiscal year trying to tell you what the marginal return on sales are going to be. But for this fiscal year, we feel very good about sustainability. We've done it 3 quarters in a row. And I think for everybody on the phone, to help remind everybody, the way we achieved that is it was prior year restructuring that we did. All the teams moved up very rapidly to get on top of the market adjustment, and then we launched the simplification plan, which really was more strategically restructuring initiative, to the footprint restructuring that we're doing. That enabled us to keep these very nice, basically half of what we historically have done. And as a bit of a history lesson, if you go back to the '01 reduction, we were -- recession, there's a minus 60% MROS, and Great Recession was around minus 40%, and here we are, that minus 15% to minus 20% range on an adjusted basis and low 20s even reported all-in. So I think it's sustainable, and that's what we have in the plan for the next 2 quarters. On the balance sheet, the acquisitions -- the pipeline's active, but valuations are still high. And I think what you're seeing is a delay in the reality from sellers' expectations to buyers like us as far as setting a new revenue target as far as what they think for the business. That's the key valuation difference. I think everybody knows we're disciplined buyers, and we're going to -- and we buy things that are in our space, so we understand what the growth rates are. And I think that time's on our side with that. I think as time goes on and people see the new reality that, hey, it's maybe not going to grow what they had thought as well as the previous decade, but those valuations will come in more aligned, and I think our pipeline will become were actionable at that point. So it's lumpy. It's hard for us to predict output, but we're still working on it."

I don't want to get above my skis for '17. We'll talk about that in August. But yes, I mean, what we've seen for simplification so far is that the payback is more rapid and has a better payback than traditional restructuring. The good thing about it, just to remind people, there's 4 areas we're looking at: revenue profile complexity, so that's the tail of the revenue, and looking at the bottom tail, that density of hard numbers and the corporate activity and just the costs to sustain that. We're very early days in getting into that. I mean, that's a little more typical for us to work, but very early days of that. And then the whole organization and process optimization is the second part. We still see lots of opportunities on that. So that's more strategic restructuring geared at the overhead structure of the company. The division consolidations was the third leg of it. So we have 28 divisions so far that we're working on. We'll do more. I don't think you'll see another 28 in the next fiscal year, but you'll -- you're going to see us continue to work that. And then just good old-fashioned bureaucracy. We're looking at our planning process, approvals, reports, you name it, all of the things that just slows things down, so the -- and that obviously carries costs and creates better service opportunities for our customers. So early days, and I feel very good about where this could -- what this could mean for us. And you -- I think mostly everybody has seen the walk and taken us to 17% operating margins.

We look at cash generation capabilities, what do we think we're going to generate in a closed-loop model, taking a look at that, where is the cash generated, what access do we have to the cash, and also with our goal of we'd like to maintain an A rating as we go through this for a lot of good reasons. But on the deployment side, if we look at the best opportunities to yield the best long-term value for our shareholders comparing -- recognizing, hey, we're going to do the dividends first. We're not going to move off of that. We're going to fund organic growth, but then we're going to look at the balance of share repurchase versus acquisition to just try to make that best decision. So it's hard for me to give you a specific number that will land on the share repurchase because it's really an opportunistic look, weighing those various tugs and pulls every quarter as we go through that closed-loop model."

I'm going to be a little bit coy with you here because I'm not going to give you the kind of color that I might normally would because I would be giving competitively sensitive information to our competitors and trying to help them be successful. Let me just -- suffice it to say that what we want on the e-business side is we want a Google-like experience for our customers and for our distributors when they come to that website. And we've launched a number of things that we think will get us there. It's not going to happen overnight. We've made progress, we think, over the last couple of years. And as we talked to our customers and distributors, they see that, but we clearly recognize we're not there. So we see this as a potential additional growth channel, leveraging the great distribution channel that we have already. And just remember that about 60% of the relationship between a customer and a supplier nowadays happens via that website and happens before they even talk to you. So that's why we want this to be so important. We're investing in it. We made some organization design changes to add some resources and add leadership to that. That was the change we made in August last year. On the Internet of Things, that Connectathon, in case people are not familiar with what that is, is basically an ideation process. We gather ideas from around the company. And that, coupled with the fact that we made that equity investment in Exosite, which gives us a software backbone to help all the applications throughout the company, has really given us program for ideas. So we've taken that ideation process to Connectathon, we've narrowed it down to about 10 of what we think are the best most commercial actionable projects, and we think that's got multimillion-type of look, tens of millions of dollars of revenue over the next 3 years. Most of it this is not going to cut into probably towards the end of FY '17 and FY '18 and probably going to take 1.5-year incubation here. We do have 2 good examples, and Lee highlighted one of them, that the SMART Service Kit, which is helping us in refrigeration, primarily the air conditioning market. So if you take an air conditioning contract today, they have a lot of mechanical tools they have to utilize to measure pressure, humidity, temperatures. And so this is a patented sensor that we have, allows you to diagnose and troubleshoot the conditions of that air conditioning unit much more rapidly than the value from the contractors. Many more calls happens during the day. They can get a printout right on their smartphone or visual on their smartphones and print it out if they wanted for the customer so they can see what's going on with their unit. So we launched that. We've been very pleased with the initial sales. And that's a really good example of taking a traditional market and using Internet of Things to make it even better. It makes our expansion valves and things we go into and our check valves very sticky. But then our contractors, they absolutely love the new toolkit. I think if you to go to our website, you can probably find a video from one of our contractors, a testimonial talking about it as well."

We have responded decisively to a",932,"Thanks, Jon, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation today. 
To start, let me make a few summary comments. It continues to be a very tough environment in many of our end markets and regions. We have responded decisively to adjust to these conditions and delivered impressive margin return on sales. We've tightened control of discretionary spending, boosted employment levels across all regions in our company and implemented reduced work schedules where necessary. This is in addition to the previously announced actions we have underway to restructure our fixed costs and simplification efforts designed to streamline our operations. On both of those fronts, we made excellent progress in the second quarter. 
Given the current headwinds, we are very pleased with the way our teams have responded, as evidenced by the strong margin performance and our ability to control decremental marginal return on sales for the past 3 quarters. We expect strong decremental margin return on sales to continue through our fiscal year-end. 
Moving on to specifics for the second quarter. Sales declined 14% as the effects of the strong dollar negatively impacted us by approximately 4%. And organic sales declined 10%, reflecting end market weakness. Total order rates for the second quarter declined 12% compared with the same quarter last year. Despite this downturn, I am very pleased we delivered total segment operating margins of 12.2%, or 13.5% on an adjusted basis. 
During the second quarter, we delivered decremental marginal return on sales of 17.2% adjusted, which represents excellent performance in this current business climate. This is really a testament to the way we are fundamentally changing Parker's operating structure. In previous downturns in which we have experienced such a significant reduction in sales volume, we would not have been able to maintain such strong margin performance. 
The primary drivers of our margin performance include savings from restructuring we have done in prior periods, immediate and decisive actions on cost containment and the benefits of a range of simplification initiatives that we have implemented. 
Regarding simplification, we have announced a total of 28 division consolidations. We continue to review our organization and process to reduce overhead costs and simplify processes. This has also helped us to reduce corporate G&A costs. 
Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.33, or $1.52 adjusted for business realignment expenses. Our operating cash flow year-to-date includes a $200 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. pension plan. Excluding the contribution year-to-date, operating cash to sales was 9.8%. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased $90 million in Parker shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $400 million. We have now repurchased $1.74 billion under our previously announced $2 billion to $3 billion Parker share repurchase plan over 2 years, which began in October 2014. 
Moving on to discussion on key market trends. As projected in the second quarter, we saw continued pressure on natural resource markets, such as oil and gas, agriculture, mining and construction equipment, as the prices of commodities continued to move lower. Our distribution channel remained affected by these markets, particularly those with exposure to oil and gas. We continue to experience general industrial activity weakening due to the knock-on effect from natural resource markets. These challenging markets outweighed positive growth in other markets, such as power generation, air conditioning, lawn and turf, rail and heavy-duty truck. 
In summary, our second quarter sales were in line with our October guidance. And Lee will provide some more color on our end markets in the Q&A portion of the call. 
Now switching to our outlook. For fiscal year 2016, we are narrowing the range of our guidance for earnings to $5.90 to $6.30 per share on an adjusted basis, which maintains the earnings midpoint of $6.10 per share. It also means that our implied guidance for the second half of the fiscal year has been adjusted downward for sales and earnings to reflect weaker order entry levels that we have experienced in the second quarter. 
We will continue to aggressively manage costs in this challenging environment. Our primary focus will be on maintaining strong decremental margin performance and positioning Parker to weather this downturn and emerge stronger as conditions improve. We are also continuing with actions to execute the many growth opportunities we have identified under the new Win Strategy. 
So just to reinforce, our long-term financial objectives to be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2020 are targeting sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production, we are also targeting 17% segment operating margins, and progress towards these goals is expected to deliver a compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this 5-year period. 
We are excited about opportunities we have to position Parker as a top-quartile company compared with our proxy peers. 
Growth initiatives are underway to further expand our distribution network, commercialize new products and systems, improve the customer experience, expand our service offerings and to leverage e-business and Internet of Things capabilities. 
During the second quarter, we developed a comprehensive long-term plan to accelerate our e-business capabilities. We see opportunities to leverage our distribution channel as part of our strategy to grow our business and create a better customer experience. 
Parker's Internet of Things initiative gained significant momentum in the quarter. We hosted a global Connectathon that garnered dozens of rich Internet of Things application ideas. 
In summary, execution on the new Win Strategy is expected to deliver top-quartile performance versus our proxy peers. 
So for now, I'll hand things back to Jon to review more details on the quarter."

Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.33 versus $1.80 for the same quarter a year ago. This excludes business real",1433,"Thanks, Tom. And at this time, please refer to Slide #5. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.33 versus $1.80 for the same quarter a year ago. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.19 and compares to $0.04 for the same quarter last year. 
On Slide #6, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.84 for the second quarter FY '15 to $1.52 for the second quarter of this year. The impact of fewer shares outstanding equated to an increase of $0.11 per share. 
Increases to adjusted per share income include lower corporate G&A expense equating to $0.11 due to reduction in long-term incentive accruals as well as our simplification efforts, as Tom mentioned. A reduced tax rate for the quarter contributed $0.02, driven by the passage of the U.S. extenders from which the company recognized R&D credit. Reductions to adjusted per share income include lower adjusted segment operating income of $0.39 per share due to the impact of foreign currency, and the continued weakening of end market demand and increased interest and other expense that totaled $0.18 per share as compared to the prior year in which various onetime favorable loan adjustments were recognized. 
Moving to Slide #7 with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the second quarter. Total company organic sales in the first quarter decreased by 9.6% over the same quarter last year. There was a modest 3% contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was slightly higher than planned, equating to a negative impact on reported sales of $139 million or 4.4% in the quarter. 
Total company segment operating margins for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter, was 13.5% versus 14% for the same quarter last year. Restructuring costs incurred in the quarter were $35 million versus $9 million last year. 
A lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $366 million versus $439 million last year reflects the impact of reduced volume and unfavorable mix from the continued weakening of several industrial end markets. 
Moving to Slide #8. I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the second quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 15.2% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a modest impact from acquisitions and a negative impact from currency of 1.3% in the quarter. 
Operating margin for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 15% of sales versus 16.3% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses incurred totaled $20 million as compared to a nominal spend in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $174 million as compared to $227 million, driven by reduced volume as a result of softening trends in key end markets. 
I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on Slide #9. Organic sales for the second quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 7.1%. Currency negatively impacted sales by 10%. Operating margin for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 11% of sales versus 12.3% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $14 million as compared to $9 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $109 million as compared to $146 million, which reflects the impact of the foreign currencies as well as weaker end markets. 
I'll now move to Slide #10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues decreased nominally at 0.7% for the second quarter. Currency posed a modest negative impact of about 0.4%. Sales for the period were maintained as a result of higher aftermarket sales volume, which offset modest year-over-year declines in OEM sales. 
Operating margins for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 14.8% of sales versus 12% in the prior year. While nominal realignment expenses were incurred for the period, adjusted operating income was $82 million as compared to $67 million, reflecting the favorable mix of higher aftermarket sales volume this quarter combined with reduced developmental costs as a percentage of sales. 
Moving to Slide #11 with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a 3-month rolling average while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. 
Total orders were a negative 12% for the quarter end, reflecting the further softening of the Industrial segment stemming from natural resource-related end markets, as Tom mentioned. Diversified Industrial North American orders decreased to negative 15%. Diversified Industrial International orders decreased to negative 10% for the quarter. Aerospace Systems orders improved to a negative 11% for the quarter, which continues to be impacted by lumpy prior year comparables. 
On Slide #12, we report cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operating activities year-to-date was $347 million, but when adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, cash from operating activities was 9.8% of sales. This compares to 8.4% of sales for the same period last year. 
In addition to the pension contribution, the significant uses of cash year-to-date were $572 million returned to our shareholders via share repurchases of $400 million and dividends of $172 million. $68 million was expended for acquisitions closed during the first quarter. No acquisitions were announced in the second quarter. And we had $75 million for CapEx, equating to approximately 1.4% of sales year-to-date. 
Slide #13 provides the -- for FY '16 guidance as outlined. Guidance is being provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of approximately $100 million, which are forecast to be incurred throughout FY '16. 
Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 12.6% to negative 9.3%, or negative 9.9% at the midpoint, as compared to the prior year. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is negative 7.9%. Currency in the guidance negatively impacts sales by 3.4%, which is nearly all attributable to the International Industrial segment. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of December 31, 2015, and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the balance of FY '16. 
For total Parker, adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.4% and 14.6%. This compares to 14.9% for FY '15 on an adjusted basis. As Tom mentioned, we are very pleased to be guiding to this level of adjusted segment operating margins given the magnitude of the end market softness and order decline. 
The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate admin, interest and our category, other, is 440 -- $484 million for the year at the midpoint. Our full year tax rate is projected at approximately 28%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full year guidance is 137.1 million shares. 
For the full year, guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis is $5.90 to $6.30, or $6.10 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $100 million to be incurred in FY '16. Savings from these business realignment initiatives continue to be projected in the amount of $70 million, which are reflected in the segment operating margins. 
Some additional key assumptions for full year 2016 guidance are sales are divided 49% first half, 51% second half. Adjusted segment operating income is divided 49% first half, 51% second half. Adjusted EPS is $3.04 in the first half and $3.06 in the second half. Q3 FY '16 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.40 per share at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.17 of business realignment expenses. 
On Slide #14, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of the revised FY '16 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.10 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY '16 EPS guidance. Increases include $0.12 from a reduced tax rate; $0.13 from a reduced corporate G&A, interest and other; and $0.05 from fewer shares outstanding. This is fully offset by a decrease of $0.30 reduction in segment operating income, reflecting further reduced volume and unfavorable mix forecasted within key industrial end markets. 
Please remember that the forecast excludes any future acquisitions or divestitures that might be closed during FY '16. For consistency, we ask that you exclude restructuring expenses from your published estimates. 
This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary comments."

I am very encouraged by the response of our Parker team members. It has been just about one year since Lee and I took full responsibility for the company. It's certainly been a challenging year from a market perspective. However, our teams have not only adapted quickly to the challenges before them, but they have also embraced the new path forward for Parker and are working hard to build a stronger and better Parker for the future under the direction of the Win Strategy.

Like I've done before in the past, I'll just kind of walk around the regions, and I'll make some comments on the end markets, and I'll also comment on our distribution channel. I think one common thread that hasn't changed is the whole natural resource-driven markets: ag, mining, construction equipment, oil and gas, they really, by and large, continue to be challenging everywhere around the world. So starting off with North America. I think oil and gas in terms of distribution continues to be the big story when you think about distribution in aggregate. Now having said that, if I focus on distribution that doesn't have heavy content in oil and gas, we've got positive year-over-year growth. But what's happened with oil and gas and its pervasiveness through the distribution base, that is still very difficult. Looking at really air conditioning and refrigeration markets in North America, we've seen good North America residential air conditioning growth. This is a result, obviously, of the continued strengthening in the housing market. We've seen share gains on our behalf, and then, really, it increased in product content, which has to do with the sheer efficiency changes that occurred last year. So we're really happy with what's happening in those markets. Commercial air conditioning and refrigeration markets really have been down year-over-year, but we are expecting growth in the balance of calendar 2016 and moving into 2017. And then lastly, if I look at the aftermarket channel in this segment, which would be different than the industrial distribution, we really remain solid year-to-date growth. And this is really, one, based on the markets, but also a big part of some new products and some smart service toolkits that we've introduced into that market segment, so very positive there. Touching back on North America oil and gas. As I mentioned in my distribution comments, we continue to see extreme weakness, double-digit declines across all of our end customers. Our customers, and I've had plenty of these conversations, are not signaling any significant improvement until the end of calendar year '16 or early 2017. And all of them have very active restructuring plans to be profitable at today's oil prices. Turning to agriculture. We continue to see top line declines, which is consistent, I think, in contraction and production schedules at our major customers, so very weak on the agricultural equipment side. On energy, wind and energy storage business for us remains robust, with major customers maintaining a healthy backlog. And then the decommissioning of U.S. coal and oil-fired plants continues at a fairly brisk pace and has brought some good opportunity for us on natural gas conversion projects. On heavy-duty truck, Class 8 truck, this market has been very good and growing for us, and it was excellent. But consistent with industry forecasts, we are lowering our forecast by at least 20% from the 2015 levels going forward. On the mobile side, mobile equipment, the traditional construction equipment markets continue to be soft in North America. A highlight here has been some really nice wins in the turf business. The market is up and has been a bright spot as we continue to win new business there. And then lastly, I'll just talk about in-plant automotive. Our key North America distribution that covers in-plant automotive is up year-over-year versus -- Q2 versus prior. But we are expecting a slowing of CapEx spending in this area, which will have an impact on the machine tool builders that cover this area. So that's North America. In Europe, there's -- well, I'll comment on Europe. So if I talk about distribution, weak overall, with Q2 down versus last year. But I think what I have to highlight here is if you pull out distribution that's tied to oil and gas, which is really U.K., Norway, it's up year-over-year, and we have seen steady progress outside oil and gas-related distribution. We've continued to see strong distribution growth in emerging regions. And just as a highlight, if I look at Germany, it's ahead of last year-to-date. It obviously has much less oil and gas exposure than other countries. Oil and gas for the region, investment in North Sea is almost at a standstill. Looking at the U.K., capital investment in North Sea has dropped significantly. But we are still finding opportunities. We've had some nice wins in point of use for clean diesel wins in some emerging markets, really systems eliminating high water content using our fluid conveyance and filtration technologies. Agriculture, still pretty much the same as North America. Production rates low. In energy, very excited about some recent wins in -- for energy grid-type systems and really is a complement to our growth in the renewable energy segments. Class 8 truck continues to remain strong. I was looking at this, I think this is their fifth consecutive quarter of growth in that area, so we're very positive about that. And then the mobile construction equipment markets, we actually have seen some stability there with a little bit of modest growth from Q1 to Q2. Turning to Asia. Distribution, as a total, is flat to moderately down year-over-year. And I attribute some of that to our continued expansion, which we highlighted in our Win Strategy of expanding our distribution points around the world, and we are doing that in the region. Oil and gas, again, it is a contraction across the region. It's of note that we do see some positive success with some project builds in China. And I think with a lot of these state-owned oil and gas companies, they're still continuing to invest, maybe at somewhat of a reduced rate. On energy in the region, really, I'm speaking to China mostly. Renewable, wind, solar and hydro, is growing rapidly, but traditional thermal powers, coal, gas and nuclear is still taking a major share. On rail, and this really speaks to China. We continue to be very bullish on the rail market. The Chinese government's making significant investments in this area. We've had -- there's a strong focus on the export markets of high-speed-rail technology to North America, Europe, Africa and Asia, and they continue to win business there. And for us, we've had a very good market participation in that segment. We continue to have strong participation across the rail market in China. On mobile construction, I can't say anything that has progressed positively since the last time we talked. There continues to be a slowing rate of growth in China's construction industry and really has been a key driving factor in the deceleration in many parts of Asia Pacific. But our customers there continue to have really tons of idle capacity and inventory on hand. And then lastly, just talking to Latin America. It's really about Brazil. I won't go into the details I think everybody knows, but Brazil continues to be just in very dire condition. And we've seen softness in all our end markets: mining, power gen, oil and gas, heavy-duty truck, et cetera."

So I'll start with the material cost side. I would say, compared to our previous guidance, we're seeing a consistent gap between pricing and the materials side, that our ability to maintain the decrementals is driven by the simplification and the restructuring actions. And remember that the bulk of our savings is in the second half, so that is going to help carry us. And we feel good about this fiscal year. I'm not going to go beyond this fiscal year trying to tell you what the margin return on sales are going to be. But for this fiscal year, we feel very good about sustainability. We've done it 3 quarters in a row. And I think for everybody on the phone, to help remind everybody, the way we achieved that is it was prior year restructuring that we did. All the teams moved up very rapidly to get on top of the market adjustment, and then we launched the simplification plan, which really was more strategic restructuring in addition to the footprint restructuring we were doing that enabled us to keep these very nice, basically half of what we historically have done. And as a bit of a history lesson, if you go back to the '01 reduction, we were -- recession, there's a minus 60% MROS, the Great Recession was around minus 40%, and here we are in that minus 15% to minus 20% range on an adjusted basis and low 20s even reported all-in. So I think it's sustainable, and that's what we have in the plan for the next 2 quarters. On the balance sheet, the acquisitions -- the pipeline's active, but valuations are still high. And I think what you're seeing is a delay in the reality from sellers' expectations to buyers like us as far as setting a new revenue target as far as what they think for the business. That's the key valuation difference. I think everybody knows we're disciplined buyers, and we're going to -- and we buy things that are in our space, so we understand what the growth rates are. And I think that time's on our side with that. I think as time goes on and people see the new reality that, hey, it's maybe not going to grow what they had thought it was the previous decade, but those valuations will come in more aligned, and I think our pipeline will become were actionable at that point. So it's lumpy. It's hard for us to predict output, but we're still working on it."

I don't want to get above my skis for '17. We'll talk about that in August. But yes, I mean, what we've seen for simplification so far is that the payback is more rapid and has a better payback than traditional restructuring. The good thing about it, and just to remind people, there's 4 areas we're looking at: revenue profile complexity, so that's that tail of the revenue, and looking at the bottom tail, that density of hard numbers and the corporate activity and just the costs to sustain that. We're very early days at getting into that. I mean, that's a little more difficult for us to work, but very early days of that. And then the whole organization and process optimization is the second part. We still see lots of opportunities on that. So that's more strategic restructuring geared at the overhead structure of the company. The division consolidations was the third leg of it. So we're at 28 divisions so far that we're working on. We'll do more. I don't think you'll see another 28 in the next fiscal year, but you'll -- you're going to see us continue to work that. And then just good old-fashioned bureaucracy. We're looking at our planning process, approvals, reports, you name it, all the things that just slows things down, so the -- and that obviously carries costs and creates better service opportunities for our customers. So early days, and I feel very good about where this could -- what this could mean for us. And you -- I think most everybody has seen the walk on taking us to 17% operating margins.

We're 87% of the way through to the low end of the $2 billion to $3 billion range. And maybe if I could just give a little color into the process that we have, so every quarter, we sit down, and it's really a cash allocation discussion. We look at cash generation capabilities, what do we think we're going to generate in a closed-loop model, taking a look at that. Where is the cash generated, what access do we have to the cash, and also with our goal that we'd like to maintain an A rating as we go through this, for a lot of good reasons. Then on the deployment side, we look at the best opportunities to yield the best long-term value for our shareholders, comparing -- recognizing, hey, we're going to do the dividends first. We're not going to move off of that. We're going to fund organic growth, but then we're going to look at the balance of share repurchase versus acquisitions to try to make that best decision. So it's hard for me to give you a specific number that we'll land on the share repurchase because it's really an opportunistic look, weighing those various tugs and pulls every quarter as we go through that closed-loop model."

Nathan, this is Tom again. So I'm going to start on e-business. I'm going to be a little bit coy with you here because I'm not going to give you the kind of color that I might normally would because I would be giving competitively sensitive information to our competitors and trying to help them be successful. Let me just suffice it to say that what we want on the e-business side is we want a Google-like experience for our customers and for our distributors when they come to that website. And we've launched a number of the things that we think will get us there. It's not going to happen overnight. We've made progress, we think, over the last couple of years. And as we've talked to our customers and distributors, they see that, but we clearly recognize we're not there. So we see this as a potential additional growth channel, leveraging the great distribution channel that we have already. And just remember that about 60% of the relationship between a customer and a supplier nowadays happens via that website and happens before they even talk to you. So that's why we want this to be so important. We're investing in it. We made some organization design changes to add some resources and add leadership to that. That was the change we made in August last year. On the Internet of Things, that Connectathon, in case people aren't familiar with what that is, is basically an ideation process. We gather ideas from around the company. And that, coupled with the fact that we made that equity investment in Exosite, which gives us a software backbone to help all the applications throughout the company, has really given us fertile ground for ideas. So we've taken that ideation process to Connectathon, we've narrowed it down to about 10 of what we think are the best, most commercial, actionable projects, and we think that's got multimillion-type of look, tens of millions of dollars of revenue over the next 3 years. Most of that's not going to cut in until probably towards the end of FY '17 and FY '18, it's probably going to take 1.5-year incubation here. We do have 2 good examples, and Lee highlighted one of them, that the SMART Service Kit, which is helping us in the refrigeration, primarily the air conditioning market. So if you take an air conditioning contractor today, they have a lot of mechanical tools they have to utilize to measure pressure, humidity, temperatures. And so this is a patented sensor that we have, it allows you to diagnose and troubleshoot the conditions of that air conditioning unit much more rapidly. So the value for the contractor is many more calls happens during the day. They can get a printout right on their smartphone, or a visual on their smartphones, and print it out if they wanted for the customer so they can see what's going on with their unit. So we launched that. We've been very pleased with the initial sales. And that's a really good example of taking a traditional market and using Internet of Things to make it even better. It makes our expansion valves and things we go into and our check valves very sticky. But then our contractors absolutely love the new toolkit. I think if you to go to our website, you could probably find a video from one of our contractors, a testimonial talking about it as well."

We have responded decisively to a",932,"Thanks, Jon, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation today. 
To start, let me make a few summary comments. It continues to be a very tough environment in many of our end markets and regions. We have responded decisively to adjust to these conditions and delivered impressive margin return on sales. We've tightened control of discretionary spending, boosted employment levels across all regions in our company and implemented reduced work schedules where necessary. This is in addition to the previously announced actions we have underway to restructure our fixed costs and simplification efforts designed to streamline our operations. On both of those fronts, we made excellent progress in the second quarter. 
Given the current headwinds, we are very pleased with the way our teams have responded, as evidenced by the strong margin performance and our ability to control decremental marginal return on sales for the past 3 quarters. We expect strong decremental margin return on sales to continue through our fiscal year-end. 
Moving on to specifics for the second quarter. Sales declined 14% as the effects of the strong dollar negatively impacted us by approximately 4%. And organic sales declined 10%, reflecting end market weakness. Total order rates for the second quarter declined 12% compared with the same quarter last year. Despite this downturn, I am very pleased we delivered total segment operating margins of 12.2%, or 13.5% on an adjusted basis. 
During the second quarter, we delivered decremental marginal return on sales of 17.2% adjusted, which represents excellent performance in this current business climate. This is really a testament to the way we are fundamentally changing Parker's operating structure. In previous downturns in which we have experienced such a significant reduction in sales volume, we would not have been able to maintain such strong margin performance. 
The primary drivers of our margin performance include savings from restructuring we have done in prior periods, immediate and decisive actions on cost containment and the benefits of a range of simplification initiatives that we have implemented. 
Regarding simplification, we have announced a total of 28 division consolidations. We continue to review our organization and process to reduce overhead costs and simplify processes. This has also helped us to reduce corporate G&A costs. 
Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.33, or $1.52 adjusted for business realignment expenses. Our operating cash flow year-to-date includes a $200 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. pension plan. Excluding the contribution year-to-date, operating cash to sales was 9.8%. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased $90 million in Parker shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $400 million. We have now repurchased $1.74 billion under our previously announced $2 billion to $3 billion Parker share repurchase plan over 2 years, which began in October 2014. 
Moving on to discussion on key market trends. As projected in the second quarter, we saw continued pressure on natural resource markets, such as oil and gas, agriculture, mining and construction equipment, as the prices of commodities continued to move lower. Our distribution channel remained affected by these markets, particularly those with exposure to oil and gas. We continue to experience general industrial activity weakening due to the knock-on effect from natural resource markets. These challenging markets outweighed positive growth in other markets, such as power generation, air conditioning, lawn and turf, rail and heavy-duty truck. 
In summary, our second quarter sales were in line with our October guidance. And Lee will provide some more color on our end markets in the Q&A portion of the call. 
Now switching to our outlook. For fiscal year 2016, we are narrowing the range of our guidance for earnings to $5.90 to $6.30 per share on an adjusted basis, which maintains the earnings midpoint of $6.10 per share. It also means that our implied guidance for the second half of the fiscal year has been adjusted downward for sales and earnings to reflect weaker order entry levels that we have experienced in the second quarter. 
We will continue to aggressively manage costs in this challenging environment. Our primary focus will be on maintaining strong decremental margin performance and positioning Parker to weather this downturn and emerge stronger as conditions improve. We are also continuing with actions to execute the many growth opportunities we have identified under the new Win Strategy. 
So just to reinforce, our long-term financial objectives to be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2020 are targeting sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production, we are also targeting 17% segment operating margins, and progress towards these goals is expected to deliver a compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this 5-year period. 
We are excited about opportunities we have to position Parker as a top-quartile company compared with our proxy peers. 
Growth initiatives are underway to further expand our distribution network, commercialize new products and systems, improve the customer experience, expand our service offerings and to leverage e-business and Internet of Things capabilities. 
During the second quarter, we developed a comprehensive long-term plan to accelerate our e-business capabilities. We see opportunities to leverage our distribution channel as part of our strategy to grow our business and create a better customer experience. 
Parker's Internet of Things initiative gained significant momentum in the quarter. We hosted a global Connectathon that garnered dozens of rich Internet of Things application ideas. 
In summary, execution on the new Win Strategy is expected to deliver top-quartile performance versus our proxy peers. 
So for now, I'll hand things back to Jon to review more details on the quarter."

I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.33 versus $1.80 for the same quarter a year ago. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.19 and compares to $0.04 for the same quarter last year. 
On Slide #6, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.84 for the second quarter FY '15 to $1.52 for the second quarter of this year. The impact of fewer shares outstanding equated to an increase of $0.11 per share. 
Increases to adjusted per share income include lower corporate G&A expense equating to $0.11 due to reduction in long-term incentive accruals as well as our simplification efforts, as Tom mentioned. A reduced tax rate for the quarter contributed $0.02, driven by the passage of the U.S. extenders from which the company recognized R&D credit. Reductions to adjusted per share income include lower adjusted segment operating income of $0.39 per share due to the impact of foreign currency, and the continued weakening of end market demand and increased interest and other expense that totaled $0.18 per share as compared to the prior year in which various onetime favorable loan adjustments were recognized. 
Moving to Slide #7 with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the second quarter. Total company organic sales in the first quarter decreased by 9.6% over the same quarter last year. There was a modest 3% contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was slightly higher than planned, equating to a negative impact on reported sales of $139 million or 4.4% in the quarter. 
Total company segment operating margins for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter, was 13.5% versus 14% for the same quarter last year. Restructuring costs incurred in the quarter were $35 million versus $9 million last year. 
A lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $366 million versus $439 million last year reflects the impact of reduced volume and unfavorable mix from the continued weakening of several industrial end markets. 
Moving to Slide #8. I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the second quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 15.2% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a modest impact from acquisitions and a negative impact from currency of 1.3% in the quarter. 
Operating margin for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 15% of sales versus 16.3% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses incurred totaled $20 million as compared to a nominal spend in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $174 million as compared to $227 million, driven by reduced volume as a result of softening trends in key end markets. 
I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on Slide #9. Organic sales for the second quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 7.1%. Currency negatively impacted sales by 10%. Operating margin for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 11% of sales versus 12.3% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $14 million as compared to $9 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $109 million as compared to $146 million, which reflects the impact of the foreign currencies as well as weaker end markets. 
I'll now move to Slide #10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues decreased nominally at 0.7% for the second quarter. Currency posed a modest negative impact of about 0.4%. Sales for the period were maintained as a result of higher aftermarket sales volume, which offset modest year-over-year declines in OEM sales. 
Operating margins for the second quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 14.8% of sales versus 12% in the prior year. While nominal realignment expenses were incurred for the period, adjusted operating income was $82 million as compared to $67 million, reflecting the favorable mix of higher aftermarket sales volume this quarter combined with reduced developmental costs as a percentage of sales. 
Moving to Slide #11 with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a 3-month rolling average while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. 
Total orders were a negative 12% for the quarter end, reflecting the further softening of the Industrial segment stemming from natural resource-related end markets, as Tom mentioned. Diversified Industrial North American orders decreased to negative 15%. Diversified Industrial International orders decreased to negative 10% for the quarter. Aerospace Systems orders improved to a negative 11% for the quarter, which continues to be impacted by lumpy prior year comparables. 
On Slide #12, we report cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operating activities year-to-date was $347 million, but when adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, cash from operating activities was 9.8% of sales. This compares to 8.4% of sales for the same period last year. 
In addition to the pension contribution, the significant uses of cash year-to-date were $572 million returned to our shareholders via share repurchases of $400 million and dividends of $172 million. $68 million was expended for acquisitions closed during the first quarter. No acquisitions were announced in the second quarter. And we had $75 million for CapEx, equating to approximately 1.4% of sales year-to-date. 
Slide #13 provides the -- for FY '16 guidance as outlined. Guidance is being provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of approximately $100 million, which are forecast to be incurred throughout FY '16. 
Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 12.6% to negative 9.3%, or negative 9.9% at the midpoint, as compared to the prior year. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is negative 7.9%. Currency in the guidance negatively impacts sales by 3.4%, which is nearly all attributable to the International Industrial segment. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of December 31, 2015, and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the balance of FY '16. 
For total Parker, adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.4% and 14.6%. This compares to 14.9% for FY '15 on an adjusted basis. As Tom mentioned, we are very pleased to be guiding to this level of adjusted segment operating margins given the magnitude of the end market softness and order decline. 
The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate admin, interest and our category, other, is 440 -- $484 million for the year at the midpoint. Our full year tax rate is projected at approximately 28%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full year guidance is 137.1 million shares. 
For the full year, guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis is $5.90 to $6.30, or $6.10 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $100 million to be incurred in FY '16. Savings from these business realignment initiatives continue to be projected in the amount of $70 million, which are reflected in the segment operating margins. 
Some additional key assumptions for full year 2016 guidance are sales are divided 49% first half, 51% second half. Adjusted segment operating income is divided 49% first half, 51% second half. Adjusted EPS is $3.04 in the first half and $3.06 in the second half. Q3 FY '16 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.40 per share at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.17 of business realignment expenses. 
On Slide #14, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of the revised FY '16 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.10 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY '16 EPS guidance. Increases include $0.12 from a reduced tax rate; $0.13 from a reduced corporate G&A, interest and other; and $0.05 from fewer shares outstanding. This is fully offset by a decrease of $0.30 reduction in segment operating income, reflecting further reduced volume and unfavorable mix forecasted within key industrial end markets. 
Please remember that the forecast excludes any future acquisitions or divestitures that might be closed during FY '16. For consistency, we ask that you exclude restructuring expenses from your published estimates. 
This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary comments."

I am very encouraged by the response of our Parker team members. It has been just about one year since Lee and I took full responsibility for the company. It's certainly been a challenging year from a market perspective. However, our teams have not only adapted quickly to the challenges before them, but they have also embraced the new path forward for Parker and are working hard to build a stronger and better Parker for the future under the direction of the Win Strategy. 
I look forward to sharing more with you on our progress throughout this year. At this time, we're ready to take questions. So Abigail, if you would like to get us started."

Like I've done before in the past, I'll just kind of walk around the regions, and I'll make some comments on the end markets, and I'll also comment on our distribution channel. I think one common thread that hasn't changed is the whole natural resource-driven markets: ag, mining, construction equipment, oil and gas, they really, by and large, continue to be challenging everywhere around the world. So starting off with North America. I think oil and gas in terms of distribution continues to be the big story when you think about distribution in aggregate. Now having said that, if I focus on distribution, it doesn't have heavy content in oil and gas, we've got positive year-over-year growth. But what's happened with oil and gas and its pervasiveness through the distribution base, that is still very difficult. Looking at really air conditioning and refrigeration markets in North America, we've seen good North America residential air conditioning growth. This is a result, obviously, of the continued strengthening in the housing market. We've seen share gains on our behalf, and then, really, it increased in product content, which has to do with the sheer efficiency changes that occurred last year. So we're really happy with what's happening in those markets. Commercial air conditioning and refrigeration markets really have been down year-over-year, but we are expecting growth in the balance of calendar 2016 and moving into 2017. And then lastly, if I look at the aftermarket channel in this segment, which would be different than the industrial distribution, we really remain solid year-to-date growth. And this is really, one, based on the markets, but also a big part of some new products and some smart service toolkits that we've introduced into that market segment, so very positive there. Touching back on North America oil and gas. As I mentioned in my distribution comments, we continue to see extreme weakness, double-digit declines across all of our end customers. Our customers, and I've had plenty of these conversations, are not signaling any significant improvement until the end of calendar year '16 or early 2017. And all of them have very active restructuring plans to be profitable at today's oil prices. Turning to agriculture. We continue to see top line declines, which is consistent, I think, in contraction and production schedules at our major customers, so very weak on the agricultural equipment side. On energy, wind and energy storage business for us remains robust, with major customers maintaining a healthy backlog. And then the decommissioning of U.S. coal and oil-fired plants continues at a fairly brisk pace and has brought some good opportunity for us on natural gas conversion projects. On heavy-duty truck, Class 8 truck, this market has been very good and growing for us, and it was excellent. But consistent with industry forecasts, we are lowering our forecast by at least 20% from the 2015 levels going forward. On the mobile side, mobile equipment, the traditional construction equipment markets continue to be soft in North America. A highlight here has been some really nice wins in the turf business. The market is up and has been a bright spot as we continue to win new business there. And then lastly, I'll just talk about in-plant automotive. Our key North America distribution that covers in-plant automotive is up year-over-year versus -- Q2 versus prior. But we are expecting a slowing of CapEx spending in this area, which will have an impact on the machine tool builders that cover this area. So that's North America. In Europe, there's -- well, I'll comment on Europe. So if I talk about distribution, weak overall, with Q2 down versus last year. But I think what I have to highlight here is if you pull out distribution that's tied to oil and gas, which is really U.K., Norway, it's up year-over-year, and we have seen steady progress outside oil and gas-related distribution. We've continued to see strong distribution growth in emerging regions. And just as a highlight, if I look at Germany, it's ahead of last year-to-date. It obviously has much less oil and gas exposure than other countries. Oil and gas for the region, investment in North Sea is almost at a standstill. Looking at the U.K., capital investment in North Sea has dropped significantly. But we are still finding opportunities. We've had some nice wins in point of use for clean diesel wins in some emerging markets, really systems eliminating high water content using our fluid conveyance and filtration technologies. Agriculture, still pretty much the same as North America. Production rates low. In energy, very excited about some recent wins in -- for energy grid-type systems and really is a complement to our growth in the renewable energy segments. Class 8 truck continues to remain strong. I was looking at this, I think this is their fifth consecutive quarter of growth in that area, so we're very positive about that. And then the mobile construction equipment markets, we actually have seen some stability there with a little bit of modest growth from Q1 to Q2. Turning to Asia. Distribution, as a total, is flat to moderately down year-over-year. And I attribute some of that to our continued expansion, which we highlighted in our Win Strategy of expanding our distribution points around the world, and we are doing that in the region. Oil and gas, again, it is a contraction across the region. It's of note that we do see some positive success with some project builds in China. And I think with a lot of these state-owned oil and gas companies, they're still continuing to invest, maybe at somewhat of a reduced rate. On energy in the region, really, I'm speaking to China mostly. Renewable, wind, solar and hydro, is growing rapidly, but traditional thermal powers, coal, gas and nuclear is still taking a major share. On rail, and this really speaks to China. We continue to be very bullish on the rail market. The Chinese government's making significant investments in this area. We've had -- there's a strong focus on the export markets of high-speed-rail technology to North America, Europe, Africa and Asia, and they continue to win business there. And for us, we've had a very good market participation in that segment. We continue to have strong participation across the rail market in China. On mobile construction, I can't say anything that has progressed positively since the last time we talked. There continues to be a slowing rate of growth in China's construction industry and really has been a key driving factor in the deceleration in many parts of Asia Pacific. But our customers there continue to have really tons of idle capacity and inventory on hand. And then lastly, just talking to Latin America. It's really about Brazil. I won't go into the details I think everybody knows, but Brazil continues to be just in very dire condition. And we've seen softness in all our end markets: mining, power gen, oil and gas, heavy-duty truck, et cetera."

That's about $4 million, and that accounts for about $0.02. The -- and of course, Eli talked about the tax rate, and we had guided to a higher tax rate. And again, we did not know that the extenders was going to pass. And so of course, that turned out to be good news for us, and that gave us $0.15 on the -- versus the prior guide. And then at the operating income level, even with the reduced -- projected reduced revenues, we were able to get approximately $15 million in additional operating income versus the prior guide on a slight beat in revenues."

So I'll start with the material cost side. I would say, compared to our previous guidance, we're seeing a consistent gap between pricing and the materials side, that our ability to maintain the decrementals is driven by the simplification and the restructuring actions. And remember that the bulk of our savings is in the second half, so that is going to help carry us. And we feel good about this fiscal year. I'm not going to go beyond this fiscal year trying to tell you what the margin return on sales are going to be. But for this fiscal year, we feel very good about sustainability. We've done it 3 quarters in a row. And I think for everybody on the phone, to help remind everybody, the way we achieved that is it was prior year restructuring that we did. All the teams moved up very rapidly to get on top of the market adjustment, and then we launched the simplification plan, which really was more strategic restructuring in addition to the footprint restructuring we were doing that enabled us to keep these very nice, basically half of what we historically have done. And as a bit of a history lesson, if you go back to the '01 reduction, we were -- recession, there's a minus 60% MROS, the Great Recession was around minus 40%, and here we are in that minus 15% to minus 20% range on an adjusted basis and low 20s even reported all-in. So I think it's sustainable, and that's what we have in the plan for the next 2 quarters. On the balance sheet, the acquisitions -- the pipeline's active, but valuations are still high. And I think what you're seeing is a delay in the reality from sellers' expectations to buyers like us as far as setting a new revenue target as far as what they think for the business. That's the key valuation difference. I think everybody knows we're disciplined buyers, and we're going to -- and we buy things that are in our space, so we understand what the growth rates are. And I think that time's on our side with that. I think as time goes on and people see the new reality that, hey, it's maybe not going to grow what they had thought it was the previous decade, but those valuations will come in more aligned, and I think our pipeline will become were actionable at that point. So it's lumpy. It's hard for us to predict output, but we're still working on it."

I don't want to get above my skis for '17. We'll talk about that in August. But yes, I mean, what we've seen for simplification so far is that the payback is more rapid and has a better payback than traditional restructuring. The good thing about it, and just to remind people, there's 4 areas we're looking at: revenue profile complexity, so that's that tail of the revenue, and looking at the bottom tail, that density of hard numbers and the corporate activity and just the costs to sustain that. We're very early days at getting into that. I mean, that's a little more difficult for us to work, but very early days of that. And then the whole organization and process optimization is the second part. We still see lots of opportunities on that. So that's more strategic restructuring geared at the overhead structure of the company. The division consolidations was the third leg of it. So we're at 28 divisions so far that we're working on. We'll do more. I don't think you'll see another 28 in the next fiscal year, but you'll -- you're going to see us continue to work that. And then just good old-fashioned bureaucracy. We're looking at our planning process, approvals, reports, you name it, all the things that just slows things down, so the -- and that obviously carries costs and creates better service opportunities for our customers. So early days, and I feel very good about where this could -- what this could mean for us. And you -- I think most everybody has seen the walk on taking us to 17% operating margins.

I'm going to be a little bit coy with you here because I'm not going to give you the kind of color that I might normally would because I would be giving competitively sensitive information to our competitors and trying to help them be successful. Let me just suffice it to say that what we want on the e-business side is we want a Google-like experience for our customers and for our distributors when they come to that website. And we've launched a number of the things that we think will get us there. It's not going to happen overnight. We've made progress, we think, over the last couple of years. And as we've talked to our customers and distributors, they see that, but we clearly recognize we're not there. So we see this as a potential additional growth channel, leveraging the great distribution channel that we have already. And just remember that about 60% of the relationship between a customer and a supplier nowadays happens via that website and happens before they even talk to you. So that's why we want this to be so important. We're investing in it. We made some organization design changes to add some resources and add leadership to that. That was the change we made in August last year. On the Internet of Things, that Connectathon, in case people aren't familiar with what that is, is basically an ideation process. We gather ideas from around the company. And that, coupled with the fact that we made that equity investment in Exosite, which gives us a software backbone to help all the applications throughout the company, has really given us fertile ground for ideas. So we've taken that ideation process to Connectathon, we've narrowed it down to about 10 of what we think are the best, most commercial, actionable projects, and we think that's got multimillion-type of look, tens of millions of dollars of revenue over the next 3 years. Most of that's not going to cut into probably towards the end of FY '17 and FY '18, it's probably going to take 1.5-year incubation here. We do have 2 good examples, and Lee highlighted one of them, that the SMART Service Kit, which is helping us in the refrigeration, primarily the air conditioning market. So if you take an air conditioning contractor today, they have a lot of mechanical tools they have to utilize to measure pressure, humidity, temperatures. And so this is a patented sensor that we have, it allows you to diagnose and troubleshoot the conditions of that air conditioning unit much more rapidly. So the value for the contractor is many more calls happens during the day. They can get a printout right on their smartphone, or a visual on their smartphones, and print it out if they wanted for the customer so they can see what's going on with their unit. So we launched that. We've been very pleased with the initial sales. And that's a really good example of taking a traditional market and using Internet of Things to make it even better. It makes our expansion valves and things we go into and our check valves very sticky. But then our contractors absolutely love the new toolkit. I think if you to go to our website, you could probably find a video from one of our contractors, a testimonial talking about it as well."

Good morning, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation. So today, we're going to cover 4 key topics with you. First, I'll summarize the third quarter results; second, some commentary on key market trends; give you",1237,"Thanks, Jon. Good morning, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation. So today, we're going to cover 4 key topics with you. First, I'll summarize the third quarter results; second, some commentary on key market trends; give you an update on the revised full year guidance; and finally, I'll highlight some of the progress we're making on the key initiatives of the Win Strategy. 
So beginning with the third quarter results. Sales declined 10.6%, as the effects of the strong dollar negatively impacted us by 1.5%, and organic sales declined approximately 9.4%. Total order rates for the third quarter declined 6% compared with the same quarter last year. This is a sequential improvement from the second quarter. 
Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.37 or $1.51, adjusted for business realignment, which was ahead of our expectations. Operating cash flow year-to-date includes a $200 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. pension plan. Excluding the contribution year-to-date, operating cash to sales was 10.5%. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased $50 million in shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $450 million. We have now repurchased $1.8 billion of shares since October 2014. 
However, the most impressive accomplishment of the third quarter was our margin performance. I am very pleased we delivered total segment operating margins of 13.8% or 14.7% on an adjusted basis. This represents a 30 basis point improvement year-over-year in adjusted margins, which is a significant complement, given the difficult economic conditions we are facing. 
During the third quarter, we delivered decremental margin return on sales of 17% or 11.8%, adjusted for business realignment expenses. This demonstrates excellent performance by our global team. 
This quarter marks the fifth consecutive quarter with decremental MRO less of less than 30%. This is both on a reported and an adjusted basis. Year-to-date, we have also held SG&A flat at 12.1% of sales, despite a $1.2 billion drop in sales, another significant accomplishments by our team. 
Our performance during such a sustained period of lower sales and order rates is unprecedented. It demonstrates Parker's ability to create a more adaptable cost structure and deliver a less cyclical financial performance. 
So now a few brief comments on key end markets. So reflecting on order rates over the past year, we're encouraged the point of moderating decline. More specifically, from Q2 to Q3, we saw a number of end markets moving from what we'd classify as accelerating decline to a decelerating decline, which is a good sign. We will continue to monitor additional data points in the coming months to help solidify our interpretation of the direction of the macroeconomic trends and provide you an update on our August call. 
As usual, I'll provide more detail on our specific and markets during the Q&A portion of this call. 
Switching to the outlook. For fiscal year 2016, we are increasing our guidance for earnings to the range of $6.20 to $6.40 per share on an adjusted basis, which results in an earnings mid-point of $6.30 per share. Adjusted guidance represents a $0.20 increase from our previous estimate at the mid-point. The increase can be attributed to the third quarter beat and incremental savings we are now seeing from the realignment actions we've taken year-to-date. 
We also now anticipate higher business realignment expenses, which, for the full year, will go from $100 million to $120 million or $0.63 per share. 
As we have moved deeper into the new Win Strategy initiatives, our global teams [indiscernible] additional near-term actions that will generate attractive return on investment. 
These actions will position us well for future growth and profitability.
Now I'd like to give you some highlights from the new Win Strategy. We continue to make meaningful progress with our Win Strategy initiatives to increase the member engagement, deliver premier customer experience and drive overall growth and financial performance. 
Take a moment to update you on progress in a couple of select areas. Starting with safety. We have seen a 29% reduction in our reportable injuries compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2016 with the same period a year ago on a rolling 12-month basis. This reflects safety engagement across the organization and the progress of our safety-focused, high-performance teams. Our goal is to reach 0 accidents. The significance for our shareholders is that safe operations are productive operations, which translate to excellent financial results. 
Our simplification initiative is gaining tremendous momentum throughout the organization. It focuses on 4 key areas: revenue complexity, organizational structure and processes, division consolidations and bureaucracy. It's a strategic review of our overhead but also a strategic review of our organization process and to improve our customers experience in Parker and also to drive growth. I'll give you a few examples of that. 
Our division consolidations have yielded cost savings and will generate technology and products for future growth. Our sales force organization redesign providing more effective alignment between our customers, distributors and divisions. 
And another example, normally at this same of year, we are working through an extensive annual planning process. This year, we greatly simplified that process and dramatically reduce amount of time that goes into the developing our annual plan. What used to take 5 months now takes 8 weeks. In August, we will share the outlook for this process and form of our guidance for fiscal year 2017. 
Innovation activity continues to be strong and will position us well when the macro conditions stabilize. I'll give you 3 examples on the innovation front. Several years ago, we've commercialized a series of conductive gels that helped cool delicate, electronic components in mobile devices and automotive applications such as collision avoidance. That product series continues to do well for us today in these fast-growing markets. 
Turning to the third quarter, we were particularly pleased to receive FDA approval of our groundbreaking exoskeleton technology, Indego. Indego was approved for clinical and personal use by individuals with spinal cord injury, which allows them to walk again. With approvals now in the U.S. and Europe, we're positioned for full commercial launch of Indego. Markedly, we went from an idea to launch in less than 3 years already generating initial sales in FY 2016. 
Planned for launch next year as a CNG fuel regular a modular, which optimizes fuel emissions for Class 5 to 8 trucks. This module is a one-piece design and integrates multiple products into a central compact system, we're optimistic about the commercial [indiscernible] important product. 
These examples that showcase just some of the highlights from the past, present and future innovations that create vitality and growth for new products and technologies. 
So in summary, by executing the new Win Strategy, we are confident we will achieve our key financial objectives by the end of fiscal 2020, which includes targeted sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production. We're also targeting 17% segment operating margins. And progress towards these goals is expected to drive a compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this 5-year period. 
I am very pleased at how far we have come in such a short period of time and continue to be excited about the opportunities we have for the future, as we strive to make Parker a top-quartile company as compared to our proxy peers. 
So for now I'll hand things back to Jon to review more detail s on the quarter."

And at this time, please refer to Slide #5. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.51 versus $2.06 for the same quarter a year ago. This excludes business realignment",1409,"Thanks, Tom. And at this time, please refer to Slide #5. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.51 versus $2.06 for the same quarter a year ago. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.14 and compares to $0.04 for the same quarter last year.
On to Slide #6, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $2.06 for the third quarter FY '15 to $1.51 for the third quarter of this year. 
Increases to adjusted per share income include the impact of fewer shares outstanding equating to an increase of $0.05 [ph] per share and lower corporate G&A and interest expense equating to $0.04 due to reduction of long-term incentive accruals and our simplification efforts. 
Reductions to adjusted income per share income include increased other expense that totals $0.33 per share as compared to the prior year, in which, last year, sizable onetime favorable currency adjustments were recognized, lower adjustment segment operating income of $0.21 per share due to the impact of the weakened markets and $0.10 from an increased effective tax rate, driven by various discrete items booked in the quarter.
Moving to Slide #7. With the reveal of total company sales and segment operating margin for the third quarter, total company organic sales in the third quarter decreased by 9.4% over the same quarter last year. There was a 3% contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was relatively in line with our guidance, equating to a negative impact on reported sales of 1.5% in the quarter. 
Total company segment operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter, was 14.7% versus 14.4% for the same quarter last year. We are especially pleased with this performance, given the end market softness. 
Realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $25 million versus $8 million last year. As forecast previously, the lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $417 million versus $456 million last year reflects the impact of the reduced volume and the unfavorable mix from the weakening of industrial end markets.
Moving to Slide #8. I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the third quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 12.7% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a modest impact from acquisitions and a negative impact of currency of 0.8% in the quarter. Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was an impressive 16.9% of sales versus 16.4% in the prior year. 
Realignment expenses incurred totaled $9 million as compared to $1 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $211 million as compared to $237 million, driven by reduced volume as a result of the weakening in our key end markets.
On Slide #9, I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on this slide. Organic sales for the third quarter in the industrial international segment decreased by 8.7%. Currency negatively impacted sales by 3.1%. Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 11.9% of sales versus 12.7% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $16 million as compared to $7 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $121 million as compared to $146 million, which reflects the impact of weaker end markets.
I'll now move to Slide # 10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues decreased 2% for the quarter. Currency impact was negligible. Sales for the period was impacted by some softness in helicopter and business jets. 
Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 15.1% of sales versus 12.9% in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $85 million as compared to $74 million last year, reflecting combination of higher aftermarket sales volume mix, reduced development costs as a percent of sales and implementation of the new Win Strategy.
Moving to Slide #11 with the detail of orders changes by segment as. A reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segment report on a 3-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders were a negative 6% for the quarter end, reflecting less negative order rates in Industrial segments and Aerospace segment, order is turning positive. Diversified Industrial North American orders improved to negative 9. 
Diversified industrial international orders improved to negative 6 for the quarter. Aerospace System orders improved to a positive 1 for the quarter. 
Now turning to Slide # 12 on cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities year-to-date was $681 million. When adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, cash from operating activities was $881 million or 10.5% of sales. This compares to 8.3% of sales for the same period last year. 
In addition to the pension contribution discussed earlier, the significant uses of cash year-to-date were $707 million returned to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends; $68 million for acquisitions closed during Q1. No acquisitions were announced in Q3. $111 million for CapEx equating to 1.3% of sales year-to-date.
The revised full year earnings guidance for FY '16 is outlined on Slide # 13. Guidance is being provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of approximately $120 million, the balance of which are forecast to be incurred in Q4 of FY '16. 
Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 11.9% to negative 9.9% or negative 10.9% at the mid-point as compared to last year. 
Adjusted organic growth at the mid-point is negative 8.2. Currency in the guidance negatively impacts sales by 3, the majority of which is attributed to the Industrial International segment. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of March 31, 2016. And we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the balance of '16.
The total Parker adjusted segment operating margins are forecast to be between 14.7% and 14.9% or 14.8% at the mid-point. This compares to 14.9% for FY '15 on an adjusted basis. As Tom mentioned, we are very pleased to be guiding to this level of adjusted segment operating margins, given the magnitude of the end market declines. 
The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate admin, interest and other is $478 million for the year to the mid-point. The full year tax rate is projected at approximately 28%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in our full year guidance is 137 million. 
And for the full year, guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis has been increased to $6.20 to $6.40 or $6.30 at the mid-point. The guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $120 million to be incurred in FY '16. Savings for these business realignment initiatives are projected in the amount of $85 million, which are reflected in the segment operating margins. 
Slide #14, you'll find a reconciliation of major components of the revised FY '16 as reported EPS guidance of $5.67 per share at the mid-point from the prior FY '16 EPS of $5.60 per share. Increases include $0.18 in segment operating income as a result of simplification efforts and increased savings from restructuring actions taken a day and $0.08 from reduced corporate G&A, interest share and share; the company's decision to increase full year realignment cost to $120 million, resulting in an additional expense of $0.13 per share. Income taxes and other expense projected comprise additional expense of $0.06, reflecting discrete items in current projections. 
On Slide #15, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of the revised FY '16 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 per share at the mid-point from prior FY '16 EPS of $6.10. As previously detailed, increases include $0.18 in segment operating income and $0.08 from reduced corporate G&A, interest and share count. This is partially offset by $0.06 increase in other expense and taxes. 
Please remember that the forecast excludes any future acquisitions, divestitures that might be closed during FY '16. 
For consistency's purposes, we ask that you exclude restructuring expenses from your published estimates. 
This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary comments."

One, Tom, I guess everyone's interested in sort of the order of sales trends that you saw throughout the first quarter and potentially what you're seeing in the month of April. Are there any markets that you sort of see bottoming or perhaps even seen seeing green shoots without being too optimistic? And then, I guess, just my second question to you is with one quarter left within the year, you upped your restructuring again. As we're thinking about 2017, do we think we've done enough to restructuring, given your view on the markets, that this should be -- we just have to execute on what's already out there? Or could there be potential for more as we think about 2017?"

So orders during the quarter sequentially got better, as we saw January through March. I see what we saw in April, it's consistent with the guidance that we gave you. As far as the markets go, I'll finish all my comments. I'll let Lee you some deeper color. But I made a comment about we saw a number of markets move from accelerating decline to decelerating decline. So I think the theme of what you're seeing as this moderation of decline. And the movers from accelerating to decelerating correlates lead to charge for distribution and general industrial, ag, mining and semicon. And he asked for some of the positive markets, positive markets are refrigeration and air-conditioning, rail, turf, aerospace, commercial, MRO and power gen. And I'll let Lee go into more details here in a minute on all the market color. On the restructuring, we moved from $100 million to $120 million. And just to clear the air with people listening on the phone, this isn't because we saw some market change or worsening of orders that we felt we needed to do this. Really was we saw more opportunities as you start to peel the new Win Strategy being implemented within the company. Just more opportunities that the team members around the world to identify and traditional restructuring and simplification, et cetera, that we thought would be very good to take now and that will put us in a good position in FY '17. But you asked about '17 now. In my opening comments, talked about your moves us to an 8-week process, 3 weeks into it, so I won't comment about 17, as you might imagine going about '17 in April. It's even harder to commenting about it in August. However, I will give us some color on the restructuring. So restructuring this year is, I would call, a high water market, $120 million. And if you look at the traditional before kind of the restructuring we've done in the last several years, we're more $20 million to $25 million range. Now while the restructuring is not finalized for what we think year and rolling about halfway through reviews, I think we're looking at something that's in between the traditional $20 million to $25 million and the $120 million that we did this year. So that's my take in your comments, Jamie. If it's okay, I'll let Lee take over with giving you a lot more color on the markets, which I'm sure other people will have questions on as well."

So as Tom talked about, sequentially, total Parker organic growth moved to a better direction during the quarter. If you look at it, it was largely a result of North America, followed by EMEA.

If you look at it, it was largely a result of North America, followed by EMEA. I'm going to walk you through the different regions and try to give you as much color as I can. So starting with North America, industrial distribution. Total North American distribution still is annualizing at a high single-digit year-over-year decline for FY '16. Now this is mostly, as we talked about in the past, impacted by oil and gas. So we continue to see tightening of CapEx and OpEx budgets, which has really been a drag for distribution. It's most aligned with those end markets. If you get away from that, we continue to see real positive growth out of distribution in the Great Lakes, Midwest areas and cover auto plants Tier 1 machine builders, et cetera. So it's a couple of different tales, depend on where you are in the country. Tom mentioned air conditioning and refrigeration. That's really a bright spot for us. We continue to experience really strong residential air conditioning growth. Much of that growth can be attributed to some product introductions, as we've done. It's really giving us a strong market participation. Commercial air conditioner refrigeration business is up low single digits, and our aftermarket business, organically with the market and some new product introductions. So that continues to be real strong. The story around oil and gas, I guess, major OEMs really continue to indicate no significant improvement until the end of calendar 2016, early 2017. And really massive, and I'm sure you've covered this, restructuring plans taking place. So looks like everybody's trying to restructure and work to be profitable around $40 per barrel. And we look at some of those different segments, the consensus appears that really the offshore rig market for new builds can take years to recover. I think the land base will come back sooner. But on the positive side, you've heard us talk about this. We continue to increase demand for solar aftermarket service capabilities such as Parker tracking system that enables asset integrity management in the field. We've had a good traction with that. On agriculture, we expect sales and farm equipment down industry-wide, and our demand continues to be consistent with that. I'm focusing on energy. We continue to increase our market position with a large frame term OEMs, and this has been a plus because there's been a -- continues to be a strong conversion of power plants from coal to natural gas in the U.S. So it's a lot of us to participate in. And we did see benefits from our wind and solar business to get a boost from the production tax credits and investment tax grants that were extended. So that was a positive for us in the quarter. Turning to heavy truck in North America. Current forecast, ACT forecast is now 275,000 units, which is really up from the November forecast. And our North America transportation business is down high single digits, better than industry build rate declines. And I would attribute this to some product introductions and really our aftermarket exposure here, kind of softens some of that downturn. On the mobile markets, I think a real positive. Tom mentioned Turf. It's a North American central market but continues to be real strong highlight for us. And then with all the major construction equipment that continues to experience topline declines. But there doesn't seem to be a lot of industry commentary about finding a bottom here, which I'll comment more later on. And then plant automotive, really, this is a key North American distribution that covers that. We're up Q3 versus prior and continue to do well there. Just touching on Europe. Distribution, trends are consistent with [indiscernible] last quarter. Distribution tied to industrial MRO. Automotive markets continue to be flat to slightly positive. And then anything tied to oil and gas, as I mentioned before, continues to be weak. I think one of the bright spots for us really contained in our Win Strategy initiative is distribution is up in emerging markets, Eastern Europe, Africa. These are high single digits, a combination of organic growth within the region but plus a fact of increased market participation by us. Oil and gas, demand across all those related markets continue to contract. We've talked about North Sea investment, and that really is still at a standstill. But then again, this is another area where we've had sort of really decent experience with our aftermarket integrity management initiatives offsetting some of the contraction that we see at our first field level. And then on ag, we have seen sequential growth quarter-to-quarter. Still flat year-over-year, but the production we're seeing now, I'll call it, increased normal seasonality. On heavy truck, stronger demand continues in the quarter, and this is really following a strong fiscal Q2. We saw demand sequentially from Q2 to Q3. And mobile, demand has stabilized at current activity level. We did have an art exhibit at the recent [indiscernible] Show, and I think all of us were encouraged by, one, the attendance, but also the favorable sentiment taking place at the show. So maybe it guys creates this positive going forward. Turning to Asia now. Really, distribution then is flat to moderately down year-over-year. China is the biggest issue. It's the most sluggish. It's down high single digits year-over-year. If I take that out, we're up across the region. I give this a lot of credit to what our guys are doing, expansion that we talked to you about such as ASEAN and some of these developing markets. So we continue to expand there. Energy across the region, we still see increased activity  in renewable, which wind, solar and hydro and traditional thermal energy, coal gas and nuclear still taking a major share and participating in the numbers. Rail, we've talked about talk some accelerating growth. Continues to be a great story. Sometime on the strength of this market in China. And China has really become a preferred builder. We recently signed high-speed rail contracts with [indiscernible] Indonesia. And we continue to have strong exposure [indiscernible] build rates. And that in mobile construction, where we see some modest growth in China. And I heard some industry comments regarding that. I will tell you that in the most part, the OEM inventory still extremely high. So I think it'll take some time for us to see that, but our business has stabilized at current levels. And then lastly, just touching on Latin America. I think it's really dominated by the Brazil story. Construction equipment, ag markets, et cetera, still very soft. But there is decent activity if you get outside of Brazil, but the whole story in Latin America is really brought by Brazil. So taken all together, total Parker organic growth sequentially moved in a better direction, largely as a result, as I mentioned. North America and EMEA. And I think moderately declining coming to our minds scrambled you're seeing out of a year-over-year basis."

I still think my characterization of being somewhere between $120 million, and the 20 to 25 is probably a good indicator. I still think that, for the most part, this restructuring is pretty good payback from a timing standpoint. Usually, 12-month indicator, obviously some are more traditional or international orientating type of restructuring will take longer, probably 18 to 24 months.

So on the buyback, we continue to look at that on a dynamic basis, looking what and what makes sense most sense for our shareholders. And obviously, we'll update you every quarter on that. But some things just keep in mind and consideration. When you look at our cash that's on the balance sheet, 99% of that is permanently invested overseas. We also -- it's important to us to maintain our A rating, so that's a factor that we consider. And then when we rolled out $2 billion to $3 billion initiative, that was in October 2014, we were a $13 billion company then, and that were $11.3 billion. So a number of things have changed. Our cash flow as a percent of sales continue to do very well at 10.5%. We're going to continue to deploy cash as efficiently as we can. We look at the best ways to deploy it and what gives the long-term value creation to our shareholders. On the acquisition side, the pipeline is active. But it's always hard to predict the output there. So it tends to be lumpy. But I would say valuations are still challenging at this point, with pricing probably starting to moderate a little bit. But we are disciplined buyers and we buy things that are in space. We understand the growth rate so we'll continue to be that way. But I think you'll look to see us be as efficient and aggressive with our deployment  of cash as we possibly can, bring all the variables the best we can on long-term behalf of shareholders."

But in particular, the part that I like is that when you look at -- people don't understand what I'm talking about. These marketplaces, see that accelerating growth and decelerating growth, and you got accelerating decline and decelerating decline. I was about to show you this dot map of our end markets in these 4 phases. And you look at it in Q2, you'd see a lot of dots is accelerate decline. And what's moved, and I would say in particular, North America, it's been distribution, ag, semicon, mining, general industrial. But I think the thing that we're still cautious about is that I think we're getting help from comps for the most part. And at this point, still too early I think to see that there's a general market shift. So we're going to continue to look at that data. We need a few more months and another quarter to help confirm that. On the healing process of order entry, step one, is to have a decelerating or moderation of decline. So that's a good thing. We're very happy about that. And to put of the kind of numbers we're putting up on this kind of climate, I think if you look at historic always remarkable.

I can understand your reservations, but this was done with a lot of thought. And here's a big change. Our groups organized the exception of Aerospace, organized around technology and products. And it's easier alignment for our divisions to take and find people that own those product and technologies. So in Europe as an example, we went from a sales force that was maybe heavily dominated alignment to markets to be more product-centric, still not getting of the markets but having that be less situation, so more concentration on technologies and markets so we can have a real good technology discussion with our customers. The other part we did to help simplify our interface with a global OEMs that are regionally OEMs in Europe as we now have a pan-Europe OEM team about, which is very similar to what we have in North America, which had so much success. So we have that, makes us to be calling out OEMs country-by-country that spanned the entire year. So that's been in place for probably 6, 9 months. And we are very encouraged with the kind of market share actions that we're seeing coming out of that or from that team. And then just in Japan, that was the other example that came to mind when I made that comment. In Japan, if you look at it historically, we had a very fragmented sales force. We now have a sales force that is all aligned, and it's kind of combination of acquisitions that we have, joint ventures years ago. Now we have a one Japan sales force with a much better alignment of the operating side. And we're the result of that. Japan's doing very well for us. So the organizational changes, to give you comfort, are showing in the numbers and on the market concentration so we go account-by-account for various regions."

I think some of the guys may have got hit a little by some side effects from oil and gas, but that's fairly normalized. I would say on OEM inventory, where I still see it as kind of a construction equipment, mining markets, especially Asia comes to mind, if you tour some of the equipment yards, I mean, there's just excavators and wheel loaders going for miles.

In any environment, that 19, in our history, in our company, is a very impressive number. But it is distinguished from North America. I believe it has something to do with the level and depth of some of the restructuring that we're doing, a little bit of a quicker payback in restructuring in North America versus internationally. But in both cases, we're making great progress. And we're kind of -- we are seeing a little bit of a difference. But this is historically in North America and in our industrial businesses, the best we've ever done in a downturn like this, especially considering the magnitude of this downturn that we're talking about of a negative 9, 9.5 for the quarter and our guidance of negative 7 here coming up. So the short answer is very quick actions; quick recovery; dedication on the part of our management teams, both in internationally and in North America; and our ability to be resilient and adaptable as a company today versus maybe in some of the prior downturns in the past periods."

Good morning, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation. So today, we're going to cover 4 key topics with you. First, I'll summarize the third quarter results; second, some commentary on key market trends; give you",1246,"Thanks, Jon. Good morning, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation. So today, we're going to cover 4 key topics with you. First, I'll summarize the third quarter results; second, some commentary on key market trends; give you an update on the revised full year guidance; and finally, I'll highlight some of the progress we're making on the key initiatives with the new Win Strategy.
So beginning with the third quarter results. Sales declined 10.6%, as the effects of the strong dollar negatively impacted us by 1.5%, and organic sales declined approximately 9.4%. Total order rates for the third quarter declined 6% compared with the same quarter last year. This is a sequential improvement from the second quarter.
Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.37 or $1.51 adjusted for business realignment, which was ahead of our expectations. Operating cash flow year-to-date includes a $200 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. pension plan. Excluding the contribution year-to-date, operating cash to sales was 10.5%.
During the second quarter, we repurchased $50 million in shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $450 million. We have now repurchased $1.8 billion in shares since October 2014.
However, the most impressive accomplishment of the third quarter was our margin performance. I am very pleased we delivered total segment operating margins of 13.8% or 14.7% on an adjusted basis. This represents a 30 basis point improvement year-over-year in adjusted margins, which is a significant accomplishment given the difficult economic conditions we are facing.
During the third quarter, we delivered decremental margin return on sales of 17% or 11.8% adjusted for business realignment expenses. This demonstrates excellent performance by our global team.
This quarter marks the fifth consecutive quarter with decremental MRO less of less than 30%. This is both on a reported and an adjusted basis. Year-to-date, we have also held SG&A flat at 12.1% of sales despite a $1.2 billion drop in sales, another significant accomplishments by our team. 
Our performance during such a sustained period of lower sales and order rates is unprecedented. It demonstrates Parker's ability to create a more adaptable cost structure and deliver a less cyclical financial performance.
So now a few brief comments on key end markets. So reflecting on order rates over the past year, we're encouraged with the point of moderating rate of decline. More specifically, from Q2 to Q3, we saw a number of end markets move from what we'd classify as accelerating decline to a decelerating decline, which is a good sign. We will continue to monitor additional data points in the coming months to help solidify our interpretation of the direction of the macroeconomic trends and provide you an update in our August call.
As usual, we'll provide more details on our specific end markets during the Q&A portion of this call.
Switching to the outlook. For fiscal year 2016, we are increasing our guidance for earnings to the range of $6.20 to $6.40 per share on an adjusted basis, which results in an earnings midpoint of $6.30 per share. Adjusted guidance represents a $0.20 increase from our previous estimate at the midpoint. The increase can be attributed to the third quarter beat and incremental savings we are now seeing from the realignment actions we've taken year-to-date.
We also now anticipate higher business realignment expenses, which, for the full year, will go from $100 million to $120 million or $0.63 per share. 
As we move deeper into the new Win Strategy initiatives, our global teams have identified additional near-term actions that will generate attractive return on investment. These actions will position us well for future growth and profitability.
Now I'd like to give you some highlights from the new Win Strategy. We continue to make meaningful progress with our Win Strategy initiatives to increase team member engagement, deliver premier customer experience and drive overall growth and financial performance.
Take a moment to update you on progress in a couple of select areas, starting with safety. We have seen a 29% reduction in our reportable injuries comparing the third quarter of fiscal 2016 with the same period a year ago on a rolling 12-month basis. This reflects safety engagement across the organization and the progress of our safety-focused, high-performance teams. Our goal is to reach 0 accidents. The significance for our shareholders is that safe operations are productive operations, which translate to excellent financial results.
Our simplification initiative is gaining tremendous momentum throughout the organization. It focuses on 4 key areas: revenue complexity, organizational structure and processes, division consolidations and bureaucracy. It's a strategic review of our overhead, but also a strategic review of our organization and process to improve our customers experience with Parker and also to drive growth. I'll give you a few examples of that. 
Our division consolidations have yielded cost savings and will generate technology and product synergies for future growth. Our sales force organization redesign is providing more effective alignment between our customers, distributors and divisions.
And another example, normally at this time of year, we are working through an extensive annual planning process. This year, we greatly simplified that process and dramatically reduced the amount of time that goes into developing our annual plan. What used to take 5 months now takes 8 weeks. In August, we will share the output from this process in the form of our guidance for fiscal year 2017.
Innovation activity continues to be strong and will position us well when the macro conditions stabilize. I'll give you 3 examples on the innovation front. Several years ago, we commercialized a series of thermally conductive dispensable gels that help cool delicate, electronic components in mobile devices and automotive applications, such as collision avoidance. That product series continues to do well for us today in these fast-growing markets.
Turning to the third quarter. We were particularly pleased to receive FDA approval of our groundbreaking exoskeleton technology, Indego. Indego was approved for clinical and personal use by individuals with spinal cord injury, which allows them to walk again. With approvals now in the U.S. and Europe, we're positioned for a full commercial launch of Indego. Remarkably, we went from an idea to launch in less than 3 years and already generating initial sales in FY 2016.
Planned for launch next year is a CNG fuel regulator modular, which optimizes fuel emissions for Class 5 to 8 trucks. This module is a one-piece design and integrates multiple products into a central compact system. We're optimistic about the commercial viability of this important product.
These examples showcase just some of the highlights from the past, present and future innovations that create vitality and growth from new products and technologies.
So in summary, by executing the new Win Strategy, we are confident we will achieve our key financial objectives by end of fiscal 2020, which includes targeted sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production. We're also targeting 17% segment operating margins, and progress towards these goals is expected to drive a compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this 5-year period.
I am very pleased at how far we have come in such a short period of time and continue to be excited about the opportunities we have for the future, as we strive to make Parker a top-quartile performance company as compared to our proxy peers.
So for now I'll hand things back to Jon to review more details on the quarter."

And at this time, please refer to Slide #5. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter.Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.51 versus $2.06 for the same quarter a year ago. This excludes business realignment",1406,"Thanks, Tom. And at this time, please refer to Slide #5. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.51 versus $2.06 for the same quarter a year ago. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.14 and compares to $0.04 for the same quarter last year.
On Slide #6, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $2.06 for the third quarter FY '15 to $1.51 for the third quarter of this year.
Increases to adjusted per share income include the impact of fewer shares outstanding equating to an increase of $0.05 per share and lower corporate G&A and interest expense equating to $0.04 due to reduction of long-term incentive accruals and our simplification efforts.
Reductions to adjusted per share income include increased other expense that totals $0.33 per share as compared to the prior year, in which, last year, sizable onetime favorable currency adjustments were recognized, lower adjustment segment operating income of $0.21 per share due to the impact of the weakened end markets and $0.10 from an increased effective tax rate, driven by various discrete items booked in the quarter.
Moving to Slide #7. With the review of total company sales and segment operating margin for the third quarter, total company organic sales in the third quarter decreased by 9.4% over the same quarter last year. There was a 3% contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was relatively in line with our guidance equating to a negative impact on reported sales of 1.5% in the quarter.
Total company segment operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter, was 14.7% versus 14.4% for the same quarter last year. We are especially pleased with this performance given the end market softness.
Realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $25 million versus $8 million last year. As forecasted previously, the lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $417 million versus $456 million last year reflects the impact of the reduced volume and the unfavorable mix from the weakening of industrial end markets.
Moving to Slide #8. I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the third quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 12.7% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a modest impact from acquisitions and a negative impact from currency of 0.8% in the quarter. Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was an impressive 16.9% of sales versus 16.4% in the prior year.
Realignment expenses incurred totaled $9 million as compared to $1 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $211 million as compared to $237 million, driven by reduced volume as a result of the weakening in our key end markets.
On Slide #9, I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on this slide. Organic sales for the third quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 8.7%. Currency negatively impacted sales by 3.1%. Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 11.9% of sales versus 12.7% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $16 million as compared to $7 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $121 million as compared to $146 million, which reflects the impact of weaker end markets.
I'll now move to Slide # 10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues decreased 2% for the quarter. Currency impact was negligible. Sales for the period was impacted by some softness in helicopter and business jets.
Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 15.1% of sales versus 12.9% in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $85 million as compared to $74 million last year, reflecting combination of higher aftermarket sales volume mix, reduced development costs as a percent of sales and implementation of the new Win Strategy.
Moving to Slide #11 with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segment report on a 3-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders were a negative 6% for the quarter end, reflecting less negative order rates in Industrial segments and Aerospace segment, where order is turning positive. Diversified Industrial North American orders improved to negative 9. Diversified Industrial International orders improved to negative 6 for the quarter. Aerospace System orders improved to a positive one for the quarter.
Now turning to Slide # 12 on cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities year-to-date was $681 million. When adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, cash from operating activities was $881 million or 10.5% of sales. This compares to 8.3% of sales for the same period last year.
In addition to the pension contribution discussed earlier, the significant uses of cash year-to-date were $707 million returned to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends, $68 million for acquisitions closed during Q1. No acquisitions were announced in Q3. $111 million for CapEx equating to 1.3% of sales year-to-date.
The revised full year earnings guidance for FY '16 is outlined on Slide # 13. Guidance is being provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of approximately $120 million, the balance of which are forecasted to be incurred in Q4 of FY '16.
Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 11.9% to negative 9.9% or negative 10.9% at the midpoint as compared to last year.
Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is negative 8.2. Currency in the guidance negatively impacts sales by 3, the majority of which is attributed to the Industrial International segment. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of March 31, 2016. And we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the balance of '16.
The total Parker adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.7% and 14.9% or 14.8% at the midpoint. This compares to 14.9% for FY '15 on an adjusted basis. As Tom mentioned, we are very pleased to be guiding to this level of adjusted segment operating margins given the magnitude of the end market declines.
The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate admin, interest and other, is $478 million for the year at the midpoint. The full year tax rate is projected at approximately 28%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in our full year guidance is 137 million.
And for the full year, guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis has been increased to $6.20 to $6.40 or $6.30 at the midpoint. The guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $120 million to be incurred in FY '16. Savings for these business realignment initiatives are projected in the amount of $85 million, which are reflected in the segment operating margins.
Slide #14, you'll find a reconciliation of major components of the revised FY '16 as reported EPS guidance of $5.67 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY '16 EPS of $5.60 per share. Increases include $0.18 in segment operating income as a result of simplification efforts and increased savings from restructuring actions taken to date and $0.08 from reduced corporate G&A interest share count; the company's decision to increase full year realignment cost to $120 million, resulting in an additional expense of $0.13 per share. Income taxes and other expense projected comprise additional expense of $0.06, reflecting discrete items in current projections.
On Slide #15, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of revised FY '16 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 per share at the midpoint from prior FY '16 EPS of $6.10. As previously detailed, increases include $0.18 in segment operating income and $0.08 from reduced corporate G&A, interest and share count. This is partially offset by $0.06 increase in other expense and taxes.
Please remember that the forecast excludes any future acquisitions, divestitures that might be closed during FY '16.
For consistency purposes, we ask that you exclude restructuring expenses from your published estimates.
This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary comments."

One, Tom, I guess everyone's interested in sort of the order of sales trends that you saw throughout the first quarter and potentially what you're seeing in the month of April. Are there any markets that you sort of see bottoming or perhaps even seeing some green shoots without being too optimistic? And then, I guess, just my second question to you is with one quarter left within the year, you upped your restructuring again. As we're thinking about 2017, do we think we've done enough restructuring given your view on the markets, that this should be -- we just have to execute on what's already out there?

So orders during the quarter sequentially got better as we saw January moving through March. Obviously, what we saw in April is consistent with the guidance that we gave you. As far as the markets go, I'll finish all my comments, and I'll let give you some deeper color. But I made a comment about we saw a number of markets move from accelerating decline to decelerating decline. So I think the theme of what we're seeing is this moderation of decline. And the movers from accelerating to decelerating have really lead to charge for distribution, general industrial, ag, mining and semicon. And you asked for some of the positive markets, the positive markets are refrigeration and air-conditioning, rail, turf, aerospace, commercial, MRO and power gen. And I'll let Lee go into more details here in a minute on all the market color. On the restructuring, we moved it from $100 million to $120 million. And just to clear the air with people listening on the phone, this isn't because we saw some market change or worsening of orders that we felt we needed to do this. It really was we saw more opportunities as we started to unpeel the new Win Strategy being implemented within the company. There were just more opportunities that our team members around the world identified and traditional restructuring and simplification, et cetera, that we thought would be very good to take now and that will put us in a good position in FY '17. But you asked about '17 now. In my opening comments, I've talked about where it moves us to an 8-week process, but we're only 3 weeks into it, so I won't comment about 17, as you might imagine commenting about '17 in April is harder to commenting about it in August. However, I will give you some color on the restructuring. So restructuring this year is, I would call, a high water market, $120 million. And if you look at us traditionally before kind of the restructuring we've done in the last several years, we're more in a $20 million to $25 million range. Now while the restructuring is not finalized for what we think year and rolling about halfway through our reviews, I think we're looking at something that's in between the traditional $20 million to $25 million and the $120 million that we did this year. So that's my take in your comments, Jamie. If it's okay, I'll let Lee take over with giving you a lot more color on the markets, which I'm sure other people will have questions on as well."

So as Tom talked about, sequentially, total Parker organic growth moved to a better direction during the quarter. If you look at it, it was largely a result of North America followed by EMEA.

If you look at it, it was largely a result of North America followed by EMEA. I'm going to walk you through the different regions and try and give you as much color as I can. So starting with North America industrial distribution. Total North American distribution still is annualizing at a high single-digit year-over-year decline for FY '16. Now this is mostly, as we have talked about in the past, impacted by oil and gas. So we continue to see tightening of CapEx and OpEx budgets, which has really been a drag for distribution. It's most aligned with those end markets. If you get away from that, we continue to see real positive growth out of distribution in the Great Lakes, Midwest areas and cover auto plants, Tier 1 machine builders, et cetera. So it's a couple different tales depending on where -- to the story depending on where you are in the country. Tom mentioned air conditioning and refrigeration, that's really a bright spot for us. We continue to experience really strong residential air conditioning growth. Much of that growth can be attributed to some product introductions we've done. It's really giving us a strong market participation. Commercial air conditioner refrigeration business is up low single digits, and our aftermarket business organically with the market and with some new product introductions continues to be real strong. The story around oil and gas, I guess, major OEMs really continue to indicate no significant improvement until the end of calendar 2016, early 2017 and really massive. And I'm sure you've covered this restructuring plans taking place. It looks like everybody's trying to restructure and work to be profitable around $40 per barrel. And we look at some of those different segments, the consensus appears that really the offshore rig market for new builds can take years to recover. I think the land base will come back sooner. But on the positive side, you've heard us talk about this. We continue to increase demand for solar aftermarket service capabilities, such as our Parker tracking system that enables asset integrity management in the field. We've had a good traction with that. In agriculture, we expect sales of farm equipment down industry-wide, and our demand continues to be consistent with that. I'm focusing on energy. We continue to increase our market position with a large-frame turbine OEMs, and this has been a plus because there's been a -- continues to be a strong conversion of power plants from coal to natural gas in the U.S. So it's allowed us to participate in that. And we did see benefits from our wind and solar business to get a boost with the production tax credits and investment tax grants that were extended. So that was a positive for us in the quarter. Turning to heavy truck in North America. Current forecast -- ACT forecast is now 275,000 units, which is really up from the November forecast. And our North America transportation business is down high single digits, better than industry build rate declines. And I would attribute this to some new product introductions, and really our aftermarket exposure there kind of softens some of that downturn. On the mobile markets, I think a real positive. Tom mentioned Turf. It's a North American central market, but continues to be a real strong highlight for us. And then with all the major construction equipment, that continues to experience topline declines. But there doesn't seem to be a lot of industry commentary about finding a bottom here, which I'll comment more later on. And then in-plant automotive, really, this is a key North American distribution that covers that. We're up Q3 versus prior and continue to do well there. Just touching on Europe. Distribution trends are consistent with really last quarter. Distribution tied the industrial MRO. Automotive markets continue to be flat to slightly positive. And then anything tied to oil and gas, as I mentioned before, continues to be weak. I think one of the bright spots for us and really contained in our Win Strategy initiatives is distribution is up in emerging markets, Eastern Europe, Africa. These are high single digits, a combination of organic growth within the region, but plus a fact of increased market participation by us. Oil and gas demand across all those related markets continue to contract. We've talked about North Sea investment, and that really is still at a standstill. But then, again, this is another area where we've had sort of really decent experience with our aftermarket integrity management initiatives offsetting some of the contraction that we see at our first field level. And then on ag, we have seen sequential growth quarter-to-quarter, still flat year-over-year, but the production we're seeing now, I would call increased normal seasonality. On heavy truck, stronger demand continues in the quarter, and this is really following a strong fiscal Q2. We saw demand sequentially from Q2 to Q3. In mobile, demand has stabilized at current activity level. We did have a large exhibit at the recent [indiscernible] Show, and I think all of us were encouraged by, one, the attendance, but also the favorable sentiment taking place at the show. So maybe it just creates some positive going forward. Turning to Asia now. Really, distribution then is flat to moderately down year-over-year. China is the biggest issue. It's the most sluggish. It's down high single digits year-over-year. If I take that out, we're up across the region. I give this -- a lot of credit to what our guys are doing, expansion that we've talked to you about, such as ASEAN and some of these developing markets. So we continue to expand there. Energy across the region, we still see increased activity in renewable, which wind, solar and hydro and traditional thermal energy, coal, gas and nuclear still are taking a major share and were participating in the numbers. Rail, we've talked about, Tom mentioned that, is an some accelerating growth. It continues to be a great story. We've commented for sometime on the strength of this market in China. And China has really become a preferred builder. We've recently signed high-speed rail contracts with [indiscernible], Thailand and Indonesia. And we continue to have strong exposure to those build rates. And then, in mobile construction, we've seen some modest growth in China. And I heard some industry comments regarding that. I will tell you that for the most part, the OEM inventory is still extremely high. So I think it'll take some time for us to see that, but our business has stabilized at current levels. And then lastly, just touching on Latin America. I think it's really dominated by the Brazil story. Construction equipment, ag markets, et cetera, are still very soft. But there is decent activity if you get outside of Brazil, but the whole story in Latin America is really dwarfed by Brazil. So taken all together, total Parker organic growth sequentially moved in a better direction, largely as a result, as I mentioned, North America and EMEA. And I think moderately declining and the words will keep coming to our minds, [indiscernible] were seeing on of a year-over-year basis."

I still think my characterization of being somewhere between the $120 million and the $20 million to $25 million is probably a good indicator. I still think that, for the most part, this restructuring is a pretty good payback from a time period standpoint. Usually, a 12-month indicator, obviously, some of the more traditional or international orientating type of restructuring will take longer, probably 18 to 24 months. But in general, it would still be aimed at the more strategic restructuring we've been talking about, which is at -- ahead of the company.

So on the buyback, we continue to look at that on a dynamic basis, looking at what makes the most sense for our shareholders. And obviously, we'll update you every quarter on that. But some things just keep in mind from consideration. When you look at our cash that's on the balance sheet, 99% of that is permanently invested overseas. We also -- it's important for us to maintain our A rating, so that's a factor that we consider. And then when we rolled out the $2 billion to $3 billion initiative, that was in October 2014, we were a $13 billion company then, and now we're $11.3 billion. So a number of things have changed. Our cash flow as a percent of sales continues to do very well at 10.5%. We're going to continue to deploy cash as efficiently as we can. We look at the best ways to deploy it and what gives the best long-term value creation to our shareholders. On the acquisition side, the pipeline is active. But it's always hard to predict the output there, so it tends to be lumpy. But I would say valuations are still challenging at this point with pricing probably starting to moderate a little bit. But we are disciplined buyers, and we buy things that are in spaces that we understand, and we understand the growth rate. So we'll continue to be that way. But I think you'll look to see us be as efficient and aggressive with our deployment of cash as we possibly can, weighing all the variables and try to do the best thing we can on a long-term behalf of shareholders."

But in North America, when you look at it sequentially, almost everything was positive in North America. Some of that, [indiscernible] from the calendar helping us. But in particular, the part that I like is that when you look at -- in case people don't understand what I'm talking about, these market phases, you got accelerating growth and decelerating growth, and you got accelerating decline and decelerating decline. And if I was to show you this dot map of our end markets in these 4 phases, and you look at it in Q2, you'd see a lot of dots in the accelerating decline. And what's moved, and I would say in particular, in North America, it's been distribution, ag, semicon, mining, general industrial. But I think the thing that we're still cautious about is that I think we're getting help from comps for the most part. And at this point, it's still too early, I think, to say that there's a general market shift. So we're going to continue to look at that data. We need a few more months and another quarter to help confirm that. But in a healing process of order entry, step one is to have a decelerating or moderation of decline. So that's a good thing. We're very happy about that. And to put up the kind of numbers we're putting up in this kind of climate, I think, if you look at us historically, it's remarkable. And I've told a lot of people when we get to flat, you're going to love the numbers because flat will be the new high, and then we'll continue to grow from there."

I can understand your reservations, but this was done with a lot of thought. And here's the big change. So our groups are organized -- with the exception of Aerospace, we're organized around technology and products. And it's easier alignment for our divisions to take and find people that own those same kind of products and technologies. So in Europe, as an example, we went from a sales force that was maybe heavily dominated on alignment with the markets to be more product-centric, but still not giving up the markets, but having that be less of concentration, so more concentration on technologies and markets so we can have a real good technology discussion with our customers. The other part we did to help simplify our interface with the global OEMs and the regional OEMs, in Europe, as we now have a pan-Europe OEM team, which is very similar to what we had in North America, which had so much success. So we have that, too, because it makes us to be calling out OEMs country-by-country that span the entire year. So that's been in place for probably 6 to 9 months. And we are very encouraged with the kind of market share actions that we're seeing coming out of that and from that team. And then just in Japan, that was the other example that came to mind when I made that comment. In Japan, if you look at it historically, we had a very fragmented sales force. We now have a sales force that is all aligned. It was kind of because of the combination of acquisitions that we had and joint ventures years ago. Now we have a one Japan sales force with a much better alignment on the operating side, and we're the results of that. Japan's doing very well for us. So the organizational changes, to give you comfort, are showing in the numbers and on the market concentration when we go account-by-account in the various regions."

I would say on OEM inventory, where I still see it as kind of a construction equipment, mining markets, especially Asia comes to mind, if you tour some of the equipment yards, I mean, there's just excavators and wheel loaders that go on for miles.

On the deployment, it's the same priorities that I've mentioned, we're just trying to make the best decision. I won't read one thing too aggressively in 1 quarter on this. We're going to -- because the buyback announcement is going to expire and my preference is to tell you every quarter what we're doing as opposed to making big announcement is what we're going to do going forward. There are some natural considerations given the amount of cash that's permanently invested overseas, our desire to keep an A rating and the fact that this program was rolled out 2 years ago, and lot's changed in 2 years -- approximately 2 years ago. But we like all those avenues, and we want to be as great at deploying cash as we're great at generating the cash. And I would look for us to do that.

But in both cases, we're making great progress. And we're kind of -- we're seeing a little bit of a difference, but this is historically in North America and in our industrial businesses, the best we've ever done in a downturn like this, especially considering the magnitude of this downturn that we're talking about of a negative 9, 9.5 for the quarter and our guidance of negative 7 here coming up. So the short answer is very quick actions, quick recovery, dedication on the part of our management teams, both in internationally and in North America, and our ability to be resilient and adaptable as a company today versus maybe in some of the prior downturns in the past periods."

Good morning, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation. So today, we're going to cover 4 key topics with you. First, I'll summarize the third quarter results; second, some commentary on key market trends; give you",1248,"Thanks, Jon. Good morning, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation. So today, we're going to cover 4 key topics with you. First, I'll summarize the third quarter results; second, some commentary on key market trends; give you an update on the revised full year guidance; and finally, I'll highlight some of the progress we're making on the key initiatives with the new Win Strategy.
So beginning with the third quarter results. Sales declined 10.6%, as the effects of the strong dollar negatively impacted us by 1.5%, and organic sales declined approximately 9.4%. Total order rates for the third quarter declined 6% compared with the same quarter last year. This is a sequential improvement from the second quarter.
Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.37 or $1.51 adjusted for business realignment, which was ahead of our expectations. Operating cash flow year-to-date includes a $200 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. pension plan. Excluding the contribution year-to-date, operating cash to sales was 10.5%.
During the second quarter, we repurchased $50 million in shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $450 million. We have now repurchased $1.8 billion in shares since October 2014.
However, the most impressive accomplishment of the third quarter was our margin performance. I am very pleased we delivered total segment operating margins of 13.8% or 14.7% on an adjusted basis. This represents a 30 basis point improvement year-over-year in adjusted margins, which is a significant accomplishment given the difficult economic conditions we are facing.
During the third quarter, we delivered decremental margin return on sales of 17% or 11.8% adjusted for business realignment expenses. This demonstrates excellent performance by our global team.
This quarter marks the fifth consecutive quarter with decremental MRO less -- of less than 30%. This is both on a reported and an adjusted basis. Year-to-date, we have also held SG&A flat at 12.1% of sales despite a $1.2 billion drop in sales, another significant accomplishments by our team. 
Our performance during such a sustained period of lower sales and order rates is unprecedented. It demonstrates Parker's ability to create a more adaptable cost structure and deliver a less cyclical financial performance.
So now a few brief comments on key end markets. So reflecting on order rates over the past year, we're encouraged that they point to a moderating rate of decline. More specifically, from Q2 to Q3, we saw a number of end markets move from what we'd classify as accelerating decline to a decelerating decline, which is a good sign. We will continue to monitor additional data points in the coming months to help solidify our interpretation of the direction of the macroeconomic trends and provide you an update in our August call.
As usual, we'll provide more details on our specific end markets during the Q&A portion of this call.
Switching to the outlook. For fiscal year 2016, we are increasing our guidance for earnings to the range of $6.20 to $6.40 per share on an adjusted basis, which results in an earnings midpoint of $6.30 per share. Adjusted guidance represents a $0.20 increase from our previous estimate at the midpoint. The increase can be attributed to the third quarter beat and incremental savings we are now seeing from the realignment actions we've taken year-to-date.
We also now anticipate higher business realignment expenses, which, for the full year, will go from $100 million to $120 million or $0.63 per share. 
As we move deeper into the new Win Strategy initiatives, our global teams have identified additional near-term actions that will generate attractive return on investment. These actions will position us well for future growth and profitability.
Now I'd like to give you some highlights from the new Win Strategy. We continue to make meaningful progress with our Win Strategy initiatives to increase team member engagement, deliver premier customer experience and drive overall growth and financial performance.
Take a moment to update you on progress in a couple of select areas, starting with safety. We have seen a 29% reduction in our reportable injuries comparing the third quarter of fiscal 2016 with the same period a year ago on a rolling 12-month basis. This reflects safety engagement across the organization and the progress of our safety-focused, high-performance teams. Our goal is to reach 0 accidents. The significance for our shareholders is that safe operations are productive operations, which translate to excellent financial results.
Our simplification initiative is gaining tremendous momentum throughout the organization. It focuses on 4 key areas: revenue complexity, organizational structure and processes, division consolidations and bureaucracy. It's a strategic review of our overhead, but also a strategic review of our organization and process to improve our customers' experience with Parker and also to drive growth. I'll give you a few examples of that. 
Our division consolidations have yielded cost savings and will generate technology and product synergies for future growth. Our sales force organization redesign is providing more effective alignment between our customers, distributors and divisions.
And another example, normally at this time of year, we are working through an extensive annual planning process. This year, we greatly simplified that process and dramatically reduced the amount of time that goes into developing our annual plan. What used to take 5 months now takes 8 weeks. In August, we will share the output from this process in the form of our guidance for fiscal year 2017.
Innovation activity continues to be strong and will position us well when the macro conditions stabilize. I'll give you 3 examples on the innovation front. Several years ago, we commercialized a series of thermally conductive dispensable gels that help cool delicate, electronic components in mobile devices and automotive applications, such as collision avoidance. That product series continues to do well for us today in these fast-growing markets.
During the third quarter, we were particularly pleased to receive FDA approval of our groundbreaking exoskeleton technology, Indego. Indego was approved for clinical and personal use by individuals with spinal cord injury, which allows them to walk again. With approvals now in the U.S. and Europe, we're positioned for a full commercial launch of Indego. Remarkably, we went from an idea to launch in less than 3 years and are already generating initial sales in FY 2016.
Planned for launch next year is a CNG fuel regulator modular, which optimizes fuel emissions for Class 5 to 8 trucks. This module is a one-piece design and integrates multiple products into a central compact system. We're optimistic about the commercial viability of this important product.
These examples showcase just some of the highlights from the past, present and future innovations that create vitality and growth from new products and technologies.
So in summary, by executing the new Win Strategy, we are confident we will achieve our key financial objectives by end of fiscal 2020, which includes targeted sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production. We're also targeting 17% segment operating margins, and progress towards these goals is expected to drive a compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this 5-year period.
I am very pleased at how far we have come in such a short period of time and continue to be excited about the opportunities we have for the future, as we strive to make Parker a top-quartile performing company as compared to our proxy peers.
So for now I'll hand things back to Jon to review more details on the quarter."

Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.51 versus $2.06 for the same quarter a year ago. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.14 and compares to $0.04 for the same quarter last year.
On Slide #6, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $2.06 for the third quarter FY '15 to $1.51 for the third quarter of this year.
Increases to adjusted per share income include the impact of fewer shares outstanding equating to an increase of $0.05 per share and lower corporate G&A and interest expense equating to $0.04 due to reduction of long-term incentive accruals and our simplification efforts.
Reductions to adjusted per share income include increased other expense that totals $0.33 per share as compared to the prior year, in which, last year, sizable onetime favorable currency adjustments were recognized, lower adjustment segment operating income of $0.21 per share due to the impact of the weakened end markets and $0.10 from an increased effective tax rate, driven by various discrete items booked in the quarter.
Moving to Slide #7. With the review of total company sales and segment operating margin for the third quarter, total company organic sales in the third quarter decreased by 9.4% over the same quarter last year. There was a 3% contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was relatively in line with our guidance equating to a negative impact on reported sales of 1.5% in the quarter.
Total company segment operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter, was 14.7% versus 14.4% for the same quarter last year. We are especially pleased with this performance given the end market softness.
Realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $25 million versus $8 million last year. As forecasted previously, the lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $417 million versus $456 million last year reflects the impact of the reduced volume and the unfavorable mix from the weakening of industrial end markets.
Moving to Slide #8. I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the third quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 12.7% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a modest impact from acquisitions and a negative impact from currency of 0.8% in the quarter. Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was an impressive 16.9% of sales versus 16.4% in the prior year.
Realignment expenses incurred totaled $9 million as compared to $1 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $211 million as compared to $237 million, driven by reduced volume as a result of the weakening in our key end markets.
On Slide #9, I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on this slide. Organic sales for the third quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 8.7%. Currency negatively impacted sales by 3.1%. Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 11.9% of sales versus 12.7% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $16 million as compared to $7 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $121 million as compared to $146 million, which reflects the impact of weaker end markets.
I'll now move to Slide # 10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues decreased 2% for the quarter. Currency impact was negligible. Sales for the period was impacted by some softness in helicopter and business jets.
Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 15.1% of sales versus 12.9% in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $85 million as compared to $74 million last year, reflecting combination of higher aftermarket sales volume mix, reduced development costs as a percent of sales and implementation of the new Win Strategy.
Moving to Slide #11 with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segment report on a 3-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders were a negative 6% for the quarter end, reflecting less negative order rates in Industrial segments and Aerospace segment order is turning positive. Diversified Industrial North American orders improved to negative 9. Diversified Industrial International orders improved to negative 6 for the quarter. Aerospace System orders improved to a positive 1 for the quarter.
Now turning to Slide #12 on cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities year-to-date was $681 million. When adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, cash from operating activities was $881 million or 10.5% of sales. This compares to 8.3% of sales for the same period last year.
In addition to the pension contribution discussed earlier, the significant uses of cash year-to-date were $707 million returned to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends; $68 million for acquisitions closed during Q1. No acquisitions were announced in Q3. $111 million for CapEx equating to 1.3% of sales year-to-date.
The revised full year earnings guidance for FY '16 is outlined on Slide #13. Guidance is being provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of approximately $120 million, the balance of which are forecasted to be incurred in Q4 of FY '16.
Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 11.9% to negative 9.9% or negative 10.9% at the midpoint as compared to last year.
Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is negative 8.2. Currency in the guidance negatively impacts sales by 3, the majority of which is attributed to the Industrial International segment. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of March 31, 2016. And we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the balance of '16.
The total Parker adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.7% and 14.9% or 14.8% at the midpoint. This compares to 14.9% for FY '15 on an adjusted basis. As Tom mentioned, we are very pleased to be guiding to this level of adjusted segment operating margins given the magnitude of the end market declines.
The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate admin, interest and other, is $478 million for the year at the midpoint. The full year tax rate is projected at approximately 28%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in our full year guidance is 137 million.
And for the full year, guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis has been increased to $6.20 to $6.40 or $6.30 at the midpoint. The guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $120 million to be incurred in FY '16. Savings for these business realignment initiatives are projected in the amount of $85 million, which are reflected in the segment operating margins.
Slide #14, you'll find a reconciliation of major components of the revised FY '16 as reported EPS guidance of $5.67 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY '16 EPS of $5.60 per share. Increases include $0.18 in segment operating income as a result of simplification efforts and increased savings from restructuring actions taken to date and $0.08 from reduced corporate G&A interest share count; the company's decision to increase full year realignment cost to $120 million, resulting in an additional expense of $0.13 per share. Income taxes and other expense projected comprise additional expense of $0.06, reflecting discrete items in current projections.
On Slide #15, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of revised FY '16 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 per share at the midpoint from prior FY '16 EPS of $6.10. As previously detailed, increases include $0.18 in segment operating income and $0.08 from reduced corporate G&A, interest and share count. This is partially offset by $0.06 increase in other expense and taxes.
Please remember that the forecast excludes any future acquisitions, divestitures that might be closed during FY '16.
For consistency's purposes, we ask that you exclude restructuring expenses from your published estimates.
This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary comments."

One, Tom, I guess everyone's interested in sort of the order of sales trends that you saw throughout the first quarter and potentially what you're seeing in the month of April. Are there any markets that you sort of see bottoming or perhaps even seeing some green shoots without being too optimistic? And then, I guess, just my second question to you is with one quarter left within the year, you upped your restructuring again. As we're thinking about 2017, do we think we've done enough restructuring given your view on the markets, that this should be -- we just have to execute on what's already out there? Or could there be potential for more as we think about 2017?"

So orders during the quarter sequentially got better as we saw January moving through March. Obviously, what we saw in April is consistent with the guidance that we gave you. As far as the markets go, I'll finish all my comments, and I'll let Lee give you some deeper color. But I made a comment about we saw a number of markets move from accelerating decline to decelerating decline. So I think the theme of what we're seeing is this moderation of decline. And the movers from accelerating to decelerating that have really led the charge for distribution, general industrial, ag, mining and semicon. And you asked for some of the positive markets. The positive markets are refrigeration and air-conditioning, rail, turf, aerospace, commercial, MRO and power gen. And I'll let Lee go into more details here in a minute on all the market color. On the restructuring, we moved it from $100 million to $120 million. And just to clear the air with people listening on the phone, this isn't because we saw some market change or worsening of orders that we felt we needed to do this. It really was we saw more opportunities as we started to unpeel the new Win Strategy being implemented within the company. There were just more opportunities that our team members around the world identified in traditional restructuring and simplification, et cetera, that we thought would be very good to take now and that will put us in a good position in FY '17. But you asked about '17 now. In my opening comments, I've talked about where it moves us to an 8-week process, but we're only 3 weeks into it, so I won't comment about 17, as you might imagine commenting about '17 in April is harder than commenting about it in August. However, I will give you some color on the restructuring. So restructuring this year is, I would call, a high watermark at $120 million. And if you look at us traditionally before kind of the restructuring we've done in the last several years, we're more in a $20 million to $25 million range. Now while the restructuring is not finalized for what we think year and we're only about halfway through our reviews, I think we're looking at something that's in between the traditional $20 million to $25 million and the $120 million that we did this year. So that's my take in your comments, Jamie. If it's okay, I'll let Lee take over with giving you a lot more color on the markets, which I'm sure other people on the phone will have questions on as well."

So as Tom talked about, sequentially, total Parker organic growth moved to a better direction during the quarter. If you look at it, it was widely a result of North America followed by EMEA.

If you look at it, it was widely a result of North America followed by EMEA. I'm going to walk you through the different regions and try and give you as much color as I can. So starting with North America industrial distribution. Total North American distribution still is annualizing at a high single-digit year-over-year decline for FY '16. Now this is mostly, as we have talked about in the past, impacted by oil and gas. So we continue to see tightening of CapEx and OpEx budgets, which has really been a drag for distribution that's most aligned with those end markets. If you get away from that, we continue to see real positive growth out of distribution in the Great Lakes, Midwest areas and cover auto plants, Tier 1 machine builders, et cetera. So it's a couple different tales depending on where -- to the story depending on where you are in the country. Tom mentioned air conditioning and refrigeration, that's really a bright spot for us. We continue to experience really strong residential air conditioning growth. Much of that growth can be attributed to some product introductions we've done. It's really giving us a strong market participation. Commercial air conditioner refrigeration business is up low single digits, and our aftermarket business organically with the market and with some new product introductions continues to be real strong. The story around oil and gas, I guess, major OEMs really continue to indicate no significant improvement until the end of calendar 2016, early 2017 and they're really massive. And I'm sure you've covered this, restructuring plans taking place. It looks like everybody's trying to restructure and work to be profitable around $40 per barrel. And when we look at some of those different segments, the consensus appears that really the offshore rig market for new builds can take years to recover. I think the land base will come back sooner. But on the positive side, you've heard us talk about this. We continue to increase demand for some of our aftermarket service capabilities, such as our Parker tracking system that enables asset integrity management in the field. We've had a good traction with that. On agriculture, we expect sales of farm equipment down industry-wide, and our demand continues to be consistent with that. And focusing on energy. We continue to increase our market position with our large-frame turbine OEMs, and this has been a plus because there's been a -- continues to be a strong conversion of power plants from coal to natural gas in the U.S. So it's allowed us to participate in that. And we did see benefits from our wind and solar business. They did get a boost with the production tax credits and investment tax grants that were extended. So that was a positive for us in the quarter. Turning to heavy truck in North America. Current forecast -- ACT forecast is now 275,000 units, which is really up from the November forecast. And our North America transportation business is down high single digits, better than industry build rate declines. And I would attribute this to some new product introductions, and really our aftermarket exposure there kind of softens some of that downturn. On the mobile markets, I think a real positive. Tom mentioned Turf. It's a North American central market, but continues to be a real strong highlight for us. And then with all the major construction equipment, that continues to experience top line declines. But there does seem to be a lot of industry commentary about finding a bottom here, which I'll comment more later on. And then in-plant automotive, really, this is a key North American distribution that covers that. We're up Q3 versus prior and continue to do well there. Just touching on Europe. Distribution trends are consistent with really last quarter. Distribution tied the industrial MRO. Automotive markets continue to be flat to slightly positive. And then anything tied to oil and gas, as I mentioned before, continues to be weak. I think one of the bright spots for us and really contained in our Win Strategy initiatives is distribution is up in emerging markets, Eastern Europe, Africa. These are high single digits, a combination of organic growth within the region, but plus a fact of increased market participation by us. Oil and gas demand across all those related markets continue to contract. We've talked about North Sea investment, and that really is still at a standstill. But then, again, this is another area where we've had sort of really decent experience with our aftermarket integrity management initiatives offsetting some of the contraction that we see at our first field level. And then on ag, we have seen sequential growth quarter-to-quarter, still flat year-over-year, but the production we're seeing now, I would call increased normal seasonality. On heavy truck, stronger demand continues in the quarter, and this is really following a strong fiscal Q2. We saw demand sequentially from Q2 to Q3. In mobile, demand has stabilized at current activity level. We did have a large exhibit at the recent BOMA [ph] Show, and I think all of us were encouraged by, one, the attendance, but also the favorable sentiment taking place at the show. So maybe it just creates some positive going forward. Turning to Asia now. Really, distribution then is flat to moderately down year-over-year. China is the biggest issue. It's the most sluggish. It's down high single digits year-over-year. If I take that out, we're up across the region. I give this -- a lot of credit to what our guys are doing, expansion that we've talked to you about, such as ASEAN and some of these developing markets. So we continue to expand there. Energy across the region, we still see increased activity in renewable, which wind, solar and hydro and traditional thermal energy, coal, gas and nuclear still are taking a major share and we're participating in the numbers. Rail, we've talked about, Tom mentioned that, is an some accelerating growth. It continues to be a great story. We've commented for some time on the strength of this market in China. And China has really become a preferred builder. We've recently signed high-speed rail contracts with Laos, Thailand and Indonesia. And we continue to have strong exposure to those build rates. And then, in mobile construction, we've seen some modest growth in China. And I heard some industry comments regarding that. I will tell you that for the most part, the OEM inventory is still extremely high. So I think it'll take some time for us to see that, but our business has stabilized at current levels. And then lastly, just touching on Latin America. I think it's really dominated by the Brazil story. Construction equipment, ag markets, et cetera, are still very soft. But there is decent activity if you get outside of Brazil, but the whole story in Latin America is really dwarfed by Brazil. So taken all together, total Parker organic growth sequentially moved in a better direction, largely as a result, as I mentioned, North America and EMEA. And I think moderately declining are the words that keep coming to our minds, describing what we are seeing on of a year-over-year basis."

And that's been a big part of -- the timeliness of that has been a big part of what's helped our margins perform this year. As far as next year, we're still going through it. I still think my characterization of being somewhere between the $120 million and the $20 million to $25 million is probably a good indicator. I still think that, for the most part, this restructuring is a pretty good payback from a time period standpoint. Usually, a 12-month indicator, obviously, some of the more traditional or international orientating type of restructuring will take longer, probably 18 to 24 months. But in general, it would still be aimed at the more strategic restructuring we've been talking about, which is at the overhead of the company.

But some things just keep in mind from consideration. When you look at our cash that's on the balance sheet, 99% of that is permanently invested overseas. We also know it's important for us to maintain our A rating, so that's a factor that we consider. And then when we rolled out the $2 billion to $3 billion initiative, that was in October 2014, we were a $13 billion company then, and now we're $11.3 billion. So a number of things have changed. Our cash flow as a percent of sales continues to do very well at 10.5%. We're going to continue to deploy cash as efficiently as we can. We look at the best ways to deploy it and what gives the best long-term value creation to our shareholders. On the acquisition side, the pipeline is active. But it's always hard to predict the output there, so it tends to be lumpy. But I would say valuations are still challenging at this point with pricing probably starting to moderate a little bit. But we are disciplined buyers, and we buy things that are in spaces that we understand, and we understand the growth rate. So we'll continue to be that way. But I think you'll look to see us be as efficient and aggressive with our deployment of cash as we possibly can, weighing all the variables and try to do the best thing we can on a long-term behalf of shareholders."

And what's moved, and I would say in particular, in North America, it's been distribution, ag, semicon, mining, general industrial. But I think the thing that we're still cautious about is that I think we're getting help from comps for the most part. And at this point, it's still too early, I think, to say that there's a general market shift. So we're going to continue to look at that data. We need a few more months and another quarter to help confirm that. But in a healing process of order entry, step one is to have a decelerating or moderation of decline. So that's a good thing. We're very happy about that. And to put up the kind of numbers we're putting up in this kind of climate, I think, if you look at us historically, it's remarkable. And I've told a lot of people when we get to flat, you're going to love the numbers because flat will be the new high, and then we'll continue to grow from there."

I can understand your reservations, but this was done with a lot of thought. And here's the big change. So our groups are organized -- with the exception of Aerospace, we're organized around technology and products. And it's easier alignment for our divisions if they can find people that own those same kind of products and technologies. So in Europe, as an example, we went from a sales force that was maybe heavily dominated on alignment with the markets to be more product-centric, but still not giving up the markets, but having that be less of concentration, so more concentration on technologies and markets so we can have a real good technology discussion with our customers. The other part we did to help simplify our interface with the global OEMs and the regional OEMs, in Europe, as we now have a pan-Europe OEM team, which is very similar to what we had in North America, which had so much success. So we have that, too, because it makes us to be calling out OEMs country-by-country that span the entire year [ph]. So that's been in place for probably 6 to 9 months. And we are very encouraged with the kind of market share actions that we're seeing coming out of that and from that team. And then just in Japan, that was the other example that came to mind when I made that comment. In Japan, if you look at it historically, we had a very fragmented sales force. We now have a sales force that is all aligned. It was kind of because of the combination of acquisitions that we had and joint ventures years ago. Now we have a one Japan sales force with a much better alignment on the operating side, and we're the results of that. Japan's doing very well for us. So the organizational changes, to give you comfort, are showing in the numbers and on the market concentration when we go account-by-account in the various regions."

I would say on OEM inventory, where I still see it as kind of a construction equipment, mining markets, especially Asia comes to mind, if you tour some of the equipment yards, I mean, there's just excavators and wheel loaders that go on for miles. But in North American distribution, I'm most comfortable that outside of oil and gas, it's not a big issue. And then your second question on pricing, I can't really comment on that.

Now, in any environment, that 19, in our history, in our company, is a very impressive number, but it is distinguished from North America. I believe it has something to do with the level and depth of some of the restructuring that we're doing, a little bit of a quicker payback in restructuring in North America versus internationally. But in both cases, we're making great progress. And we're kind of -- we're seeing a little bit of a difference, but this is historically in North America and in our industrial businesses, the best we've ever done in a downturn like this, especially considering the magnitude of this downturn that we're talking about of a negative 9, 9.5 for the quarter and our guidance of negative 7 here coming up. So the short answer is very quick actions, quick recovery, dedication on the part of our management teams, both in internationally and in North America, and our ability to be resilient and adaptable as a company today versus maybe in some of the prior downturns in the past periods."

Good morning, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation. So today, we're going to cover 4 key topics with you. First, I'll summarize the third quarter results; second, some commentary on key market trends; give you",1248,"Thanks, Jon. Good morning, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation. So today, we're going to cover 4 key topics with you. First, I'll summarize the third quarter results; second, some commentary on key market trends; give you an update on the revised full year guidance; and finally, I'll highlight some of the progress we're making on the key initiatives with the new Win Strategy.
So beginning with the third quarter results. Sales declined 10.6%, as the effects of the strong dollar negatively impacted us by 1.5%, and organic sales declined approximately 9.4%. Total order rates for the third quarter declined 6% compared with the same quarter last year. This is a sequential improvement from the second quarter.
Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.37 or $1.51 adjusted for business realignment, which was ahead of our expectations. Operating cash flow year-to-date includes a $200 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. pension plan. Excluding the contribution year-to-date, operating cash to sales was 10.5%.
During the second quarter, we repurchased $50 million in shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $450 million. We have now repurchased $1.8 billion in shares since October 2014.
However, the most impressive accomplishment of the third quarter was our margin performance. I am very pleased we delivered total segment operating margins of 13.8% or 14.7% on an adjusted basis. This represents a 30 basis point improvement year-over-year in adjusted margins, which is a significant accomplishment given the difficult economic conditions we are facing.
During the third quarter, we delivered decremental margin return on sales of 17% or 11.8% adjusted for business realignment expenses. This demonstrates excellent performance by our global team.
This quarter marks the fifth consecutive quarter with decremental MRO less -- of less than 30%. This is both on a reported and an adjusted basis. Year-to-date, we have also held SG&A flat at 12.1% of sales despite a $1.2 billion drop in sales, another significant accomplishments by our team. 
Our performance during such a sustained period of lower sales and order rates is unprecedented. It demonstrates Parker's ability to create a more adaptable cost structure and deliver a less cyclical financial performance.
So now a few brief comments on key end markets. So reflecting on order rates over the past year, we're encouraged that they point to a moderating rate of decline. More specifically, from Q2 to Q3, we saw a number of end markets move from what we'd classify as accelerating decline to a decelerating decline, which is a good sign. We will continue to monitor additional data points in the coming months to help solidify our interpretation of the direction of the macroeconomic trends and provide you an update in our August call.
As usual, we'll provide more details on our specific end markets during the Q&A portion of this call.
Switching to the outlook. For fiscal year 2016, we are increasing our guidance for earnings to the range of $6.20 to $6.40 per share on an adjusted basis, which results in an earnings midpoint of $6.30 per share. Adjusted guidance represents a $0.20 increase from our previous estimate at the midpoint. The increase can be attributed to the third quarter beat and incremental savings we are now seeing from the realignment actions we've taken year-to-date.
We also now anticipate higher business realignment expenses, which, for the full year, will go from $100 million to $120 million or $0.63 per share. 
As we move deeper into the new Win Strategy initiatives, our global teams have identified additional near-term actions that will generate attractive return on investment. These actions will position us well for future growth and profitability.
Now I'd like to give you some highlights from the new Win Strategy. We continue to make meaningful progress with our Win Strategy initiatives to increase team member engagement, deliver premier customer experience and drive overall growth and financial performance.
Take a moment to update you on progress in a couple of select areas, starting with safety. We have seen a 29% reduction in our reportable injuries comparing the third quarter of fiscal 2016 with the same period a year ago on a rolling 12-month basis. This reflects safety engagement across the organization and the progress of our safety-focused, high-performance teams. Our goal is to reach 0 accidents. The significance for our shareholders is that safe operations are productive operations, which translate to excellent financial results.
Our simplification initiative is gaining tremendous momentum throughout the organization. It focuses on 4 key areas: revenue complexity, organizational structure and processes, division consolidations and bureaucracy. It's a strategic review of our overhead, but also a strategic review of our organization and process to improve our customers' experience with Parker and also to drive growth. I'll give you a few examples of that. 
Our division consolidations have yielded cost savings and will generate technology and product synergies for future growth. Our sales force organization redesign is providing more effective alignment between our customers, distributors and divisions.
And another example, normally at this time of year, we are working through an extensive annual planning process. This year, we greatly simplified that process and dramatically reduced the amount of time that goes into developing our annual plan. What used to take 5 months now takes 8 weeks. In August, we will share the output from this process in the form of our guidance for fiscal year 2017.
Innovation activity continues to be strong and will position us well when the macro conditions stabilize. I'll give you 3 examples on the innovation front. Several years ago, we commercialized a series of thermally conductive dispensable gels that help cool delicate, electronic components in mobile devices and automotive applications, such as collision avoidance. That product series continues to do well for us today in these fast-growing markets.
During the third quarter, we were particularly pleased to receive FDA approval of our groundbreaking exoskeleton technology, Indego. Indego was approved for clinical and personal use by individuals with spinal cord injury, which allows them to walk again. With approvals now in the U.S. and Europe, we're positioned for a full commercial launch of Indego. Remarkably, we went from an idea to launch in less than 3 years and are already generating initial sales in FY 2016.
Planned for launch next year is a CNG fuel regulator modular, which optimizes fuel emissions for Class 5 to 8 trucks. This module is a one-piece design and integrates multiple products into a central compact system. We're optimistic about the commercial viability of this important product.
These examples showcase just some of the highlights from the past, present and future innovations that create vitality and growth from new products and technologies.
So in summary, by executing the new Win Strategy, we are confident we will achieve our key financial objectives by end of fiscal 2020, which includes targeted sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production. We're also targeting 17% segment operating margins, and progress towards these goals is expected to drive a compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this 5-year period.
I am very pleased at how far we have come in such a short period of time and continue to be excited about the opportunities we have for the future, as we strive to make Parker a top-quartile performing company as compared to our proxy peers.
So for now I'll hand things back to Jon to review more details on the quarter."

And at this time, please refer to Slide #5. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter.Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.51 versus $2.06 for the same quarter a year ago. This excludes business realignment",1403,"Thanks, Tom. And at this time, please refer to Slide #5. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.51 versus $2.06 for the same quarter a year ago. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.14 and compares to $0.04 for the same quarter last year.
On Slide #6, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $2.06 for the third quarter FY '15 to $1.51 for the third quarter of this year.
Increases to adjusted per share income include the impact of fewer shares outstanding equating to an increase of $0.05 per share and lower corporate G&A and interest expense equating to $0.04 due to reduction of long-term incentive accruals and our simplification efforts.
Reductions to adjusted per share income include increased other expense that totals $0.33 per share as compared to the prior year, in which, last year, sizable onetime favorable currency adjustments were recognized, lower adjustment segment operating income of $0.21 per share due to the impact of the weakened end markets and $0.10 from an increased effective tax rate, driven by various discrete items booked in the quarter.
Moving to Slide #7. With the review of total company sales and segment operating margin for the third quarter, total company organic sales in the third quarter decreased by 9.4% over the same quarter last year. There was a 3% contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was relatively in line with our guidance equating to a negative impact on reported sales of 1.5% in the quarter.
Total company segment operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter, was 14.7% versus 14.4% for the same quarter last year. We are especially pleased with this performance given the end market softness.
Realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $25 million versus $8 million last year. As forecasted previously, the lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $417 million versus $456 million last year reflects the impact of the reduced volume and the unfavorable mix from the weakening of industrial end markets.
Moving to Slide #8. I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the third quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 12.7% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a modest impact from acquisitions and a negative impact from currency of 0.8% in the quarter. Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was an impressive 16.9% of sales versus 16.4% in the prior year.
Realignment expenses incurred totaled $9 million as compared to $1 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $211 million as compared to $237 million, driven by reduced volume as a result of the weakening in our key end markets.
On Slide #9, I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on this slide. Organic sales for the third quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 8.7%. Currency negatively impacted sales by 3.1%. Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 11.9% of sales versus 12.7% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $16 million as compared to $7 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $121 million as compared to $146 million, which reflects the impact of weaker end markets.
I'll now move to Slide # 10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues decreased 2% for the quarter. Currency impact was negligible. Sales for the period was impacted by some softness in helicopter and business jets.
Operating margin for the third quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 15.1% of sales versus 12.9% in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $85 million as compared to $74 million last year, reflecting combination of higher aftermarket sales volume mix, reduced development costs as a percent of sales and implementation of the new Win Strategy.
Moving to Slide #11 with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segment report on a 3-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. Total orders were a negative 6% for the quarter end, reflecting less negative order rates in Industrial segments and Aerospace segment order is turning positive. Diversified Industrial North American orders improved to negative 9. Diversified Industrial International orders improved to negative 6 for the quarter. Aerospace System orders improved to a positive 1 for the quarter.
Now turning to Slide #12 on cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities year-to-date was $681 million. When adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, cash from operating activities was $881 million or 10.5% of sales. This compares to 8.3% of sales for the same period last year.
In addition to the pension contribution discussed earlier, the significant uses of cash year-to-date were $707 million returned to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends; $68 million for acquisitions closed during Q1. No acquisitions were announced in Q3. $111 million for CapEx equating to 1.3% of sales year-to-date.
The revised full year earnings guidance for FY '16 is outlined on Slide #13. Guidance is being provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of approximately $120 million, the balance of which are forecasted to be incurred in Q4 of FY '16.
Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 11.9% to negative 9.9% or negative 10.9% at the midpoint as compared to last year.
Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is negative 8.2. Currency in the guidance negatively impacts sales by 3, the majority of which is attributed to the Industrial International segment. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of March 31, 2016. And we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the balance of '16.
The total Parker adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.7% and 14.9% or 14.8% at the midpoint. This compares to 14.9% for FY '15 on an adjusted basis. As Tom mentioned, we are very pleased to be guiding to this level of adjusted segment operating margins given the magnitude of the end market declines.
The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate admin, interest and other, is $478 million for the year at the midpoint. The full year tax rate is projected at approximately 28%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in our full year guidance is 137 million.
And for the full year, guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis has been increased to $6.20 to $6.40 or $6.30 at the midpoint. The guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $120 million to be incurred in FY '16. Savings for these business realignment initiatives are projected in the amount of $85 million, which are reflected in the segment operating margins.
Slide #14, you'll find a reconciliation of major components of the revised FY '16 as reported EPS guidance of $5.67 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY '16 EPS of $5.60 per share. Increases include $0.18 in segment operating income as a result of simplification efforts and increased savings from restructuring actions taken to date and $0.08 from reduced corporate G&A interest share count; the company's decision to increase full year realignment cost to $120 million, resulting in an additional expense of $0.13 per share. Income taxes and other expense projected comprise additional expense of $0.06, reflecting discrete items in current projections.
On Slide #15, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of revised FY '16 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 per share at the midpoint from prior FY '16 EPS of $6.10. As previously detailed, increases include $0.18 in segment operating income and $0.08 from reduced corporate G&A, interest and share count. This is partially offset by $0.06 increase in other expense and taxes.
Please remember that the forecast excludes any future acquisitions, divestitures that might be closed during FY '16.
For consistency's purposes, we ask that you exclude restructuring expenses from your published estimates.
This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I'll turn the call back to you for your summary comments."

Are there any markets that you sort of see bottoming or perhaps even seeing some green shoots without being too optimistic? And then, I guess, just my second question to you is with one quarter left within the year, you upped your restructuring again. As we're thinking about 2017, do we think we've done enough restructuring given your view on the markets, that this should be -- we just have to execute on what's already out there?

So orders during the quarter sequentially got better as we saw January moving through March. Obviously, what we saw in April is consistent with the guidance that we gave you. As far as the markets go, I'll finish all my comments, and I'll let Lee give you some deeper color. But I made a comment about we saw a number of markets move from accelerating decline to decelerating decline. So I think the theme of what we're seeing is this moderation of decline. And the movers from accelerating to decelerating that have really led the charge for distribution, general industrial, ag, mining and semicon. And you asked for some of the positive markets. The positive markets are refrigeration and air-conditioning, rail, turf, aerospace, commercial, MRO and power gen. And I'll let Lee go into more details here in a minute on all the market color. On the restructuring, we moved it from $100 million to $120 million. And just to clear the air with people listening on the phone, this isn't because we saw some market change or worsening of orders that we felt we needed to do this. It really was we saw more opportunities as we started to unpeel the new Win Strategy being implemented within the company. There were just more opportunities that our team members around the world identified in traditional restructuring and simplification, et cetera, that we thought would be very good to take now and that will put us in a good position in FY '17. But you asked about '17 now. In my opening comments, I've talked about where it moves us to an 8-week process, but we're only 3 weeks into it, so I won't comment about 17, as you might imagine commenting about '17 in April is harder than commenting about it in August. However, I will give you some color on the restructuring. So restructuring this year is, I would call, a high watermark at $120 million. And if you look at us traditionally before kind of the restructuring we've done in the last several years, we're more in a $20 million to $25 million range. Now while the restructuring is not finalized for what we think year and we're only about halfway through our reviews, I think we're looking at something that's in between the traditional $20 million to $25 million and the $120 million that we did this year. So that's my take in your comments, Jamie. If it's okay, I'll let Lee take over with giving you a lot more color on the markets, which I'm sure other people on the phone will have questions on as well."

If you look at it, it was widely a result of North America followed by EMEA. I'm going to walk you through the different regions and try and give you as much color as I can. So starting with North America industrial distribution. Total North American distribution still is annualizing at a high single-digit year-over-year decline for FY '16. Now this is mostly, as we have talked about in the past, impacted by oil and gas. So we continue to see tightening of CapEx and OpEx budgets, which has really been a drag for distribution that's most aligned with those end markets. If you get away from that, we continue to see real positive growth out of distribution in the Great Lakes, Midwest areas and cover auto plants, Tier 1 machine builders, et cetera. So it's a couple different tales depending on where -- to the story depending on where you are in the country. Tom mentioned air conditioning and refrigeration, that's really a bright spot for us. We continue to experience really strong residential air conditioning growth. Much of that growth can be attributed to some product introductions we've done. It's really giving us a strong market participation. Commercial air conditioner refrigeration business is up low single digits, and our aftermarket business organically with the market and with some new product introductions continues to be real strong. The story around oil and gas, I guess, major OEMs really continue to indicate no significant improvement until the end of calendar 2016, early 2017 and they're really massive. And I'm sure you've covered this, restructuring plans taking place. It looks like everybody's trying to restructure and work to be profitable around $40 per barrel. And when we look at some of those different segments, the consensus appears that really the offshore rig market for new builds can take years to recover. I think the land base will come back sooner. But on the positive side, you've heard us talk about this. We continue to increase demand for some of our aftermarket service capabilities, such as our Parker tracking system that enables asset integrity management in the field. We've had a good traction with that. On agriculture, we expect sales of farm equipment down industry-wide, and our demand continues to be consistent with that. And focusing on energy. We continue to increase our market position with our large-frame turbine OEMs, and this has been a plus because there's been a -- continues to be a strong conversion of power plants from coal to natural gas in the U.S. So it's allowed us to participate in that. And we did see benefits from our wind and solar business. They did get a boost with the production tax credits and investment tax grants that were extended. So that was a positive for us in the quarter. Turning to heavy truck in North America. Current forecast -- ACT forecast is now 275,000 units, which is really up from the November forecast. And our North America transportation business is down high single digits, better than industry build rate declines. And I would attribute this to some new product introductions, and really our aftermarket exposure there kind of softens some of that downturn. On the mobile markets, I think a real positive. Tom mentioned Turf. It's a North American central market, but continues to be a real strong highlight for us. And then with all the major construction equipment, that continues to experience top line declines. But there does seem to be a lot of industry commentary about finding a bottom here, which I'll comment more later on. And then in-plant automotive, really, this is a key North American distribution that covers that. We're up Q3 versus prior and continue to do well there. Just touching on Europe. Distribution trends are consistent with really last quarter. Distribution tied the industrial MRO. Automotive markets continue to be flat to slightly positive. And then anything tied to oil and gas, as I mentioned before, continues to be weak. I think one of the bright spots for us and really contained in our Win Strategy initiatives is distribution is up in emerging markets, Eastern Europe, Africa. These are high single digits, a combination of organic growth within the region, but plus a fact of increased market participation by us. Oil and gas demand across all those related markets continue to contract. We've talked about North Sea investment, and that really is still at a standstill. But then, again, this is another area where we've had sort of really decent experience with our aftermarket integrity management initiatives offsetting some of the contraction that we see at our first field level. And then on ag, we have seen sequential growth quarter-to-quarter, still flat year-over-year, but the production we're seeing now, I would call increased normal seasonality. On heavy truck, stronger demand continues in the quarter, and this is really following a strong fiscal Q2. We saw demand sequentially from Q2 to Q3. In mobile, demand has stabilized at current activity level. We did have a large exhibit at the recent BOMA [ph] Show, and I think all of us were encouraged by, one, the attendance, but also the favorable sentiment taking place at the show. So maybe it just creates some positive going forward. Turning to Asia now. Really, distribution then is flat to moderately down year-over-year. China is the biggest issue. It's the most sluggish. It's down high single digits year-over-year. If I take that out, we're up across the region. I give this -- a lot of credit to what our guys are doing, expansion that we've talked to you about, such as ASEAN and some of these developing markets. So we continue to expand there. Energy across the region, we still see increased activity in renewable, which wind, solar and hydro and traditional thermal energy, coal, gas and nuclear still are taking a major share and we're participating in the numbers. Rail, we've talked about, Tom mentioned that, is an some accelerating growth. It continues to be a great story. We've commented for some time on the strength of this market in China. And China has really become a preferred builder. We've recently signed high-speed rail contracts with Laos, Thailand and Indonesia. And we continue to have strong exposure to those build rates. And then, in mobile construction, we've seen some modest growth in China. And I heard some industry comments regarding that. I will tell you that for the most part, the OEM inventory is still extremely high. So I think it'll take some time for us to see that, but our business has stabilized at current levels. And then lastly, just touching on Latin America. I think it's really dominated by the Brazil story. Construction equipment, ag markets, et cetera, are still very soft. But there is decent activity if you get outside of Brazil, but the whole story in Latin America is really dwarfed by Brazil. So taken all together, total Parker organic growth sequentially moved in a better direction, largely as a result, as I mentioned, North America and EMEA. And I think moderately declining are the words that keep coming to our minds, describing what we are seeing on of a year-over-year basis."

And that's been a big part of -- the timeliness of that has been a big part of what's helped our margins perform this year. As far as next year, we're still going through it. I still think my characterization of being somewhere between the $120 million and the $20 million to $25 million is probably a good indicator. I still think that, for the most part, this restructuring is a pretty good payback from a time period standpoint. Usually, a 12-month indicator, obviously, some of the more traditional or international orientating type of restructuring will take longer, probably 18 to 24 months. But in general, it would still be aimed at the more strategic restructuring we've been talking about, which is at the overhead of the company. But we'll continue to look at it as we just traditionally have the footprint optimization, as it makes sense."

So on the buyback, we continue to look at that on a dynamic basis, looking at what makes the most sense for our shareholders. And obviously, we'll update you every quarter on that. But some things just keep in mind from consideration. When you look at our cash that's on the balance sheet, 99% of that is permanently invested overseas. We also know it's important for us to maintain our A rating, so that's a factor that we consider. And then when we rolled out the $2 billion to $3 billion initiative, that was in October 2014, we were a $13 billion company then, and now we're $11.3 billion. So a number of things have changed. Our cash flow as a percent of sales continues to do very well at 10.5%. We're going to continue to deploy cash as efficiently as we can. We look at the best ways to deploy it and what gives the best long-term value creation to our shareholders. On the acquisition side, the pipeline is active. But it's always hard to predict the output there, so it tends to be lumpy. But I would say valuations are still challenging at this point with pricing probably starting to moderate a little bit. But we are disciplined buyers, and we buy things that are in spaces that we understand, and we understand the growth rate. So we'll continue to be that way. But I think you'll look to see us be as efficient and aggressive with our deployment of cash as we possibly can, weighing all the variables and try to do the best thing we can on a long-term behalf of shareholders."

But in North America, when you look at it sequentially, almost everything was positive in North America. Some of that we get just from the calendar helping us. But in particular, the part that I like is that when you look at -- in case people don't understand what I'm talking about, these market phases, you got accelerating growth and decelerating growth, and you got accelerating decline and decelerating decline. And if I was to show you this dot map of our end markets in these 4 phases, and you were to look at it in Q2, you'd see a lot of dots in the accelerating decline. And what's moved, and I would say in particular, in North America, it's been distribution, ag, semicon, mining, general industrial. But I think the thing that we're still cautious about is that I think we're getting help from comps for the most part. And at this point, it's still too early, I think, to say that there's a general market shift. So we're going to continue to look at that data. We need a few more months and another quarter to help confirm that. But in a healing process of order entry, step one is to have a decelerating or moderation of decline. So that's a good thing. We're very happy about that. And to put up the kind of numbers we're putting up in this kind of climate, I think, if you look at us historically, it's remarkable. And I've told a lot of people when we get to flat, you're going to love the numbers because flat will be the new high, and then we'll continue to grow from there."

So our groups are organized -- with the exception of Aerospace, we're organized around technology and products. And it's easier alignment for our divisions if they can find people that own those same kind of products and technologies. So in Europe, as an example, we went from a sales force that was maybe heavily dominated on alignment with the markets to be more product-centric, but still not giving up the markets, but having that be less of concentration, so more concentration on technologies and markets so we can have a real good technology discussion with our customers. The other part we did to help simplify our interface with the global OEMs and the regional OEMs, in Europe, as we now have a pan-Europe OEM team, which is very similar to what we had in North America, which had so much success. So we have that, too, because it makes us to be calling out OEMs country-by-country that span the entire year [ph]. So that's been in place for probably 6 to 9 months. And we are very encouraged with the kind of market share actions that we're seeing coming out of that and from that team. And then just in Japan, that was the other example that came to mind when I made that comment. In Japan, if you look at it historically, we had a very fragmented sales force. We now have a sales force that is all aligned. It was kind of because of the combination of acquisitions that we had and joint ventures years ago. Now we have a one Japan sales force with a much better alignment on the operating side, and we're the results of that. Japan's doing very well for us. So the organizational changes, to give you comfort, are showing in the numbers and on the market concentration when we go account-by-account in the various regions."

I would say on OEM inventory, where I still see it as kind of a construction equipment, mining markets, especially Asia comes to mind, if you tour some of the equipment yards, I mean, there's just excavators and wheel loaders that go on for miles.

It's going to be fully aligned with the end market progress that Lee and Tom have been making. And we are gaining market share. We are watching the end markets. And as Tom said, I think our best characterization is that it's -- moderately -- the decline is obviously moderating. But we'll be coming up with that answer when we do our guidance in August.

We're going to -- because the buyback announcement is going to expire and my preference is to tell you every quarter what we're doing as opposed to making big announcement is what we're going to do for the period going forward. There are some natural considerations given the amount of cash that's permanently invested overseas, our desire to keep an A rating and the fact that this program was rolled out 2 years ago, and lot's changed in 2 years -- approximately 2 years ago.

But in both cases, we're making great progress. And we're kind of -- we're seeing a little bit of a difference, but this is historically in North America and in our industrial businesses, the best we've ever done in a downturn like this, especially considering the magnitude of this downturn that we're talking about of a negative 9, 9.5 for the quarter and our guidance of negative 7 here coming up.

We appreciate your participation this morning.

We appreciate your participation this morning. 
Today Indego, I'd like to cover the following key topics: our fourth quarter results, fiscal year 2017 guidance, and finally, I'll highlight the progress we are making with the new Win Strategy. 
Let me start with the fourth quarter and full year results, which demonstrate the progress we are making in a difficult growth environment. Fourth quarter sales were $2.96 billion or a 6% decline compared with same quarter a year ago. This represents the second consecutive quarter that we saw sequential improvement in sales and a decelerating rate of decline in sales on a year-over-year basis. 
Total order rates for the fourth quarter declined 1% compared with the same quarter last year and represented a sequential improvement from the third quarter level. 
By segment, North America's still week, but our Aerospace Systems segment and International business order rates were positive on a year-over-year basis. Net income for the fourth quarter increased 35% to $242 million on an as-reported basis or 29% increase to $260 million on an adjusted basis. 
Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.77 as reported or $1.90 on an adjusted basis. That represents a 33% increase compared to the same quarter last year on an adjusted basis. 
Despite ongoing weakness in our end markets this quarter, we were able to achieve total segment operating margins of 14.8% or 15.6% adjusted. This is tremendous performance that represents a 70 basis point improvement year-over-year in adjusted segment operating margins. 
Our adjusted decremental MRO was 2.9% for the fourth quarter. This is the sixth consecutive quarter that our adjusted decrementals have been below 25%, which is the best level performance I can remember in any previous downturn. 
Just a few other full year highlights that I'd like to note. Cash flow was strong in the quarter and also the year, with cash flow from operations, excluding the discretionary pension contribution, exceeding 12% of sales, reflecting the stability of our cash generation during the downturn. We also held inventories as a percent of sales essentially flat at 10.3% in fiscal 2016 versus 10.2% in the prior year. We executed very efficiently on the $109 million worth of business realignment. Even including this restructuring, our as-reported decremental MROS was 19.5% for the full year. And notably, we accomplished all this while sales dropped $1.35 billion, which is very difficult to do. 
Moving on to capital allocation. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $108 million of Parker shares, bringing our total share repurchases for the fiscal year to $558 million. So we have now purchased $1.9 billion of Parker shares since our shares plan was announced in October 2014. We are on track to meet our commitments on capital deployment. Regarding FY '17 guidance. We are forecasting a year of sales being flat compared with fiscal 2016. Our expectations that organic growth will be soft in the first quarter, becoming essentially flat in quarter 2, with the second half showing 1% to 2% organic growth on a year-over-year basis. 
For fiscal year 2017, we're issuing guidance for as-reported earnings in the range of $6.15 to $6.95 [ph] per share or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $6.40 to $7.10 for a midpoint of $6.75. 
Business realignment expenses are anticipated to be approximately $48 million or $0.25 per share. 
So now just a few comments about our progress with the Win Strategy. We continue to make meaningful progress with initials across 4 broad goals: engage people, premier customer experience, profitable growth and financial performance. 
Regarding our first goal, engage people. During this past year, we saw a 33% reduction in recordable injuries. We continue to target a 0-accident safety goal, not only because it's our responsibility to our team members, but also because improved safety performance can be a leading indicator of improved financial performance. 
Our high-performance teams are driving this improvement in safety as well as quality, cost and delivery. 
Now on the second goal, premier customer experience. On July 1 of this year, we launched our [indiscernible] recommend initiative, which is designed to get direct feedback from customers and distributors on areas where we can improve. Importantly, we're gathering this feedback in a way that every site of Parker can understand and track their performance and make improvements. This is a significant initiative because a better customer experience will drive fast organic growth for Parker. 
We're also making good progress in building our e-business capabilities and deliver best-in-class online experience for customers. And we are making progress developing our pipeline of Internet of Things applications across groups and product lines to enhance the value we bring to customers. 
Now moving to the third goal, profitable growth. We continue to drive innovative products and systems, expand distribution and build our service business as part of our sales growth strategy that. Acquisitions will play a role in our growth plans. We recently closed a transaction in Europe to acquire certain businesses of the Jaeger Group [ph] to strengthen our position in worldwide TV markets as part of our Engineering Materials Group. 
And lastly, our financial performance goal. Profitability in Aerospace is improving, as we benefit from lower nonrecurring engineering costs that were associated with some of the large program wins that we had and improved operational efficiencies. Our simplification initiative is also gaining momentum across the company as we discover more ways to stream and operations and better serve our customers. The best way to illustrate this is to look at our employment trends. The total number of Parker team members employed at the end of FY '16 is at 2004 levels or approximately 48,000 people. In fiscal 2004, our reported sales were $6.9 billion, whereas today our sales are $11.3 billion with the same number of team members. This is attributed to our global team members who are working together to find better and more efficient ways to accomplish their jobs and serve our customers. 
The combination of our simplification and lean enterprise initiatives is amplifying our ability to improve processes and make significant structural cost improvements. 
In addition, our strategic supply chain and value pricing initiatives give us sufficient horsepower to propel us to our profit margin goals in the future. 
So in summary, by executing the new Win Strategy, we are confident we'll achieve our key financial objectives by the end of fiscal 2020, and this includes targeting sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production. We're also targeting 17% segment operating margins, and progress towards these goals is expected to drive a compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this 5-year period. I am very pleased with how far we've come in such a short period of time and continue to be excited about the opportunities we have for the future as we strive to make Parker a top-quartile performing company as compared to our proxy peers. 
So for now, I'm going to hand things back to Jon, let him give you more details on the quarter, the full year and 2017 guidance."

I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.90 versus $1.43 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of $0.47. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.13 and compares to -- which compares to $0.16 for the same quarter last year. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2016 were $6.46 versus $7.25 for the full year 2015. Total realignment expenses and pension termination costs were $0.57 for the full year 2016, and that compares to adjustments for business realignment and voluntary retirement expenses of $0.28 for the full year 2015.
On Slide #7, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.43 for the fourth quarter 2015 to $1.90 for the fourth quarter of this year. Increases to adjusted per-share income include a reduction of corporate G&A, interest and other expense equating to $0.14 per share, which is a result of savings realized from FY '16 simplification efforts, as Tom just mentioned; one-time credits booked in Q4 FY '16; and the comparison to a higher expense in Q4 '15 from early retirement expenses incurred; and a lower effective tax rate in FY '16 of 28% versus 40.9% in Q4 of '15. This all contributed to $0.30 per share. The impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the company share repurchase activity equated to an increase of $0.05 per share. A reduction of $0.02 in adjusted per share income was a result of lower adjusted segment operating income, which is driven by the strengthened U.S. dollar, currency translation and weakened end markets, which approximates a little bit more than $200 million quarter-to-quarter. 
On Slide #8, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $7.25 for the full year 2015 to $6.46 for the full year 2016. For the full year 2016, increases to adjusted earnings per share include reduced corporate G&A expense equating to $0.20 per share; $0.13 per share due to a lower effective tax rate of 27 6 [ph] in FY '16 versus 29 3 [ph] in FY '15, which is due to favorable discrete benefits booked during FY '16; and $0.36 from fewer shares outstanding reflecting the full year impact of Parker's enhanced share repurchase program. Decreases to adjusted earnings per share for FY '16 were: lower segment operating income of $1 per share due to the impact of the weakened end markets and higher interest and other expense equating to $0.48 per share, which compares to a sizable one-time favorable currency adjustment recognized in FY '15 and the full year impact of interest expense on incremental debt issued in November of 2014. 
Moving to Slide #9, with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margins for the fourth quarter and full year. Total company organic sales in the fourth quarter decreased by 5.3% over the same quarter last year. There was minimal contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was slightly higher than our guide, equating to a negative impact on reported sales of $31 million or 1% in the quarter. 
Total segment operating margin for the fourth quarter adjustment for realignment costs incurred in the quarter was 15.6% versus 14.9% for the same quarter last year. Business realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $25 million versus $27 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $462 million versus $468 million last year reflects the meaningful impact of the weakened industrial end markets, partially offset by the savings realized from our very large simplification and restructuring actions taken throughout the year. 
For the full year, organic sales in fiscal year '17 decreased by 7.7%. Contributions to sales from acquisitions were minimal. The effect of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $404 million or 3.2% of sales for the full year. 
Total company segment operating margin for fiscal year '16, adjusted for realignment costs incurred during the year, was 14.8% versus 14.9% in fiscal year '15. Business realignment expenses incurred in FY '16 was $107 million. 
Slide #10 discusses the business segments, and I'll start first with the Diversified Industrial North America segment. For the fourth quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 10.3% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a nominal impact from acquisitions and a negative impact from currency of 0.6% in the quarter. Operating margin for the fourth quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 18% of sales versus 17.3% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $5 million as compared to $15 million in the same prior year. Adjusted operating income was $226 million as compared to $244 million, which is driven by the reduced volume as a result of the key industrial weak markets. 
For the full year, organic sales for the fiscal year 2016 decreased by 12.4%. Contribution to sales from acquisitions were minimal. The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $60 million or 1% of sales for the full year. For the full year 2016, operating margin adjusted for realignment costs was 16.8% of sales versus 17% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $42 million as compared to $16 million and -- at fiscal '15. Adjusted operating income for fiscal '16 was $832 million as compared to $972 million in the prior year. 
Now turning to Slide #11. I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segments. Organic sales for the Diversified Industrial International segment, organic sales for the fourth quarter in the segment decreased by 3%. Currency translation negatively impacted sales by 2%. Operating margin for the fourth quarter, adjusted for business realignment costs, was 12.6% of sales versus 10.9% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $18 million as compared to $6 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $137 million as compared to $124 million, which, despite the weakened top line, reflects the offsetting savings resulting from realignment actions taken in the current year as well as the prior fiscal years. 
For the full year, organic sales for fiscal year '16 decreased by 6%. The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $339 million or negative 7.1% of sales for the year. For the full year 2016, operating margin adjusted realignment costs was 12.3% of sales versus 12.9% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses totaled $61 million as compared to $27 million in fiscal '15. Adjusted operating income for fiscal '16 was $509 million as compared to $611 million last year. 
And I'll now move to Slide #12 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues increased 2.2% for the quarter. Neither acquisitions nor currency really impacted revenues. Strong growth in military OEM and military aftermarket sales were the drivers of the quarterly performance. Operating margin for the fourth quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 16.4% of sales versus 16.9% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $1 million as compared to $6 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was flat at $99 million for both Q4 '16 and the prior year, reflecting the impact of the reduced commercial sales volume in the quarter, albeit partially offset by reduced development costs as a percentage of sales. 
For the full year, organic sales for fiscal year '16 increased by 0.5% of sales. For the full year '16, operating margin, adjusted for realignment costs, was 15.1% of sales versus 13.5% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $4 million as compared to $6 million related in the prior year. And adjusted operating income for the fiscal year was $341 million as compared to $305 million last year, which was largely attributed to the reduction of development costs to slightly less than 8% of sales, together with the savings from the business realignment activities. 
Going to Slide #13. Moving to that slide is a detail of our orders changes by segment. As a reminder, our orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a 3-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. 
Total orders improved to a negative 1 for the quarter-end, reflecting a decelerating rate of decline in key industrial end markets, including oil and gas, construction and agriculture. Diversified Industrial North America orders decreased to a negative 10%. Diversified Industrial International orders improved to a positive 3% for the quarter. Aerospace System orders increased to plus 14 for the quarter. 
Looking at Slide #14. We report the cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter cash from our sales, which compares to 16.2% of sales for the same period last year. For the full year, cash flow from operating activities for fiscal '16 was $1,170,000,000 or 10.3% of sales as compared to 10.2% last year. When adjusted for that $200 million voluntary pension contribution made during the year, adjusted cash flow from operating activities was $1,370,000,000 or 12.1% of sales as compared to 10.2% in fiscal '15. There was no pension contribution made during FY '15. The significant uses of cash during the year included $458 million [ph] for the company's repurchase of common shares and $342 million for the payment of shareholders dividends. And there was $149 million for CapEx equating to 1.3% of sales for FY '16. 
Now turning to guidance for FY '17. Full year earnings guidance for FY '17 is outlined here. Guidance is provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of $48 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY 2017. Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 1.5% to positive 2.1% as compared to the prior year. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is flat. Currency in the guidance is not forecasted to impact sales. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of June 30, 2016, and we hold those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming FY '17. 
Total Parker adjusted segment operating margin's forecast to be between 15.2% and 15.6%. This compares to 14.8% for FY '16 on an adjusted basis. The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate G&A, interest and other expense, is $469 million for the year at the midpoint. The full year tax rate is projected at 29%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full year guidance is 135.5 million. And for the full year guidance on an adjusted earnings per share is $6.40 to $7.10 or $6.75 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $48 million to be included in FY '17. This is the only adjustments that we make to our guidance. It's just realignment expenses. The effect of this restructuring on EPS is approximately $0.25 savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected to be $30 million on our fully reflected in the adjusted operating margin guidance range. 
Some additional key assumptions for the fiscal year guidance are: sales are divided 48% first half, 52% second half, which is a normal distribution of a split for a year for us; adjusted segment operating income is divided 46% in the first half, 54% in the second half; EPS in the first half versus the second half is $2.93 and $3.82 for the second half; Q1 FY '17 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.52 at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.09 of business realignment expenses. 
On Slide #16, just some influences on EPS for '17 as compared to '16. On Slide 16, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of FY '17 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.75 per share to midpoint from the prior FY '16 EPS of $6.40 per share. Increases include $0.40 from an increased segment operating income and $0.11 from fewer shares outstanding and reduced interest expense. Key components of the decrease, including $0.13 per share reduction in taxes, reflecting a rate from continuing operations of 29% and $0.09 per share reduction from increased corporate G&A and other expenses as a result of normalized levels, not including one-time favorable settlements realized in the prior year, primarily in Q4, in part by reduced pension expense due to the company's adoption of the spot rate methodology for calculating annual pension expense. This has a total impact of $0.11 for FY '17. 
Please remember that the forecast excludes any acquisition and divestitures that might close during FY '17. For consistency, we ask that you exclude only the restructuring expenses from your published estimates. This concludes my prepared comments. 
Tom, I'll turn the call back over to you for your summary comments."

The topics are kind of interwoven, so I'll start with the guide, what was behind it. And I'll start with, in case those of you that were on the phone didn't hear my opening comments, this is going to be a year of sales leveling off, which after the sharp reduction that we had last year is going to be a very refreshing change for all of our people around the world. But the way we forecast this is Q1's going to be soft, going to essentially flat in Q2 with 1% to 2% sales growth in the second half. So our thoughts behind the numbers, the natural resource related end markets, so construction, ag, mining and oil and gas, are moderating. And they're going to continue to be year-over-year when we finish '17 negative, but they're going to get to be less of a drag, especially in the second half. When you look at order entries that we had in Q4, in particular, what drove our thoughts within international is that we had a positive international of plus 3. And that was made up of Europe being basically flat, minus 1 in that area; Asia, plus 6; and Latin America, plus 19. So what's really driving our international sales forecast is a forecast of Europe being relatively flat and Asia Pacific and Latin America being up a little bit, driving an international forecast of plus 2. Now you talked about North America. Now what we saw in Q4, I would characterize as continued choppiness around what we saw from Q3 to Q4. I mean, during the quarter, people started of a little bit softer than we would have liked, and then May and June were a little bit better. What we're seeing for North America for the full year, to give you some context as to the negative 3 that we have out there, is that we have a first half of minus 5 and a second half of minus 1. And what's driving that is, if you look at the natural resource related end markets that I described, they really bottomed in North America in our second half of the year. So we're not really anticipating any new catalyst, any new activity that's going to drive growth for sustainability beyond our current levels for natural resources. What you're seeing in North America is easier comps in the second half. And we do have growth in North America in non-natural resource related markets, like machine tools, telecom, Life Sciences, turf, refrigeration that is going to now help to offset some of that, not completely, because we'll still end North America at a minus 3. Now if I could, I'm just going to give you context, our view for the total end markets for the whole fiscal '17. And I want to put it an asterisk on this. I'm not trying to describe the entire end market. I'm just trying to describe our performance in that end market. I have them in 3 buckets: positive, neutral, negative. So on the positive side, what makes up our forecast is Aerospace, turf, passenger rail, refrigeration and air-conditioning, semicon and telecom. And the neutral areas, automotive, distribution and Life Sciences and power generation. Now of significance is distribution and neutral about some end markets the channel for us and the fact that this revision of the neutral helps the year stabilize quite a bit. And then on a negative is construction, pharma and ag, forestry, general industrial, heavy-duty truck, Marine, mining and oil and gas. So that's the landscape, and I probably gave you more than you wanted to know. But that's what we think for '17."

North America, half, international.

So distribution being up mid-single digits, which is a big part of North America, machine tools, telecom, Life Sciences, turf, refrigeration has been very strong for us in automotive. About flat, slightly positive. So that was really the mix that helped us can about the North America forecast. The other parts that we do now is the natural resource comes in those markets gets much easier in the second half, which is why our quarter for North America, we're not anticipating anything different than what we saw in the current quarter maybe the year better that the comps get easier in the second half as what we forecasted other comp in the second half."

But now the recounts our stabilized in the last several weeks, minus maybe a week or 2, have actually improved. We're not forecasting them to get any better. But just by the comps and the fact that they decelerated are starting to hold that level, it makes our second half naturally a little bit better. And we're still not -- I don't think we're out on a limb with North America at minus 1 in the second half, given that we normally have a second half a little bit better and the fact that, I think, we've seen the worst behind us in the natural resource area.

The all-in reported MROS, 19.5%, so that's all the restructuring, $109 million, which is the highest restructuring we've done in the history of the company, even with all that, you put up a 19.5% of MROS.

Our pension expense for next year, as I was trying to mention in my comments, was going to be impacted positively, in total, all together, by $0.11 impacting FY '17 due to the spot rate methodology that we've adopted as well as many other puts and takes that go into making that -- making those estimates and doing the accounting for that.

We only have one quarter left in the share repurchase plant. It was October to October 14 [ph] to 16 [ph]. So we'll come in at that $2 billion level of that range that we said. And what's really kind of the factors that we have considered with that is that 99% of our cash is permanently invested overseas. We do have a desire to maintain that 8 [ph] rating. And we're -- our debt-to-total capital is around almost 40%. And when we started the program, we were a $13 billion company and now we're 11.4 [ph]. Now we are very proud of the double-digit cash flow that we've been able to generate but it's double digits of a smaller number. So that's what is kind of framing where we're going to come in at the lower end of the range. Now going forward, our desire -- let me first state that we want to be great generators of cash, and I think we've done a great job there. We're going to continue to do an even better job and we want to be known as a company that relates spends off a lot of cash. On the flipside, we want to be known as a company that deploys it very effectively on the behalf of the shareholders. And you've heard me say this before but in those maybe it's not out repeated. First and foremost, as far as our priorities is to continue our dividend, track record. Then we're going to fund organic growth because it's the most efficient growth that you can fund. And really it's a dynamic reviewed and a case-by-case basis between share repurchase and acquisitions and really with the goal of generating the best long-term value for our shareholders. On the share repurchase, you won't see us do another announcement type of process. I think what's better for shareholders is to be active, to have a muscular balance sheet, but to tell you after the fact that when we announced, our brains our own wind and I don't think that helps shareholders. So I think we want to do it as the most effective way to use our cash and to help shareholders. Regarding acquisitions, the pipeline is active, but I talked last quarter's evaluations continue to be, I would call it, historically high. And I do think time's on our side here because we buy properties and spaces that we understand so we understand the growth rates. I think sellers' expectations on growth rate is going to start to temper as they recognize that this is the growth rates that they think their business is going to do is not been actually come to fruition. And I think you'll see our pipeline become more actionable. We've always been disciplined buyers. We've always been able to pull this continue to bear properties we know we can deliver on for our shareholders. So we look at all that. And again, that does have a muscular balance sheet and do what's best for our shareholders."

And we have all the countries across Asia growing, with the exception and of Korea, and Korea just has more exposure to some of those global OEMs. So that will start to recover as well. So that's what's behind our thoughts on Asia. And I'll Jon talk about Brexit."

And like I mentioned in my opening comments, the combination of lean simplification with our lean enterprise efforts news really giving us an amplification of being able to look at cost and processes differently than we have in the past. But as I've mentioned before, and I'll kind of give you some comments as to where I think we can go on these, there's 4 big areas and we are focus of Rick the first is that all revenue complexity our maybe another way say is that product once of litigation, the tail of revenue [indiscernible] the last couple of percent of revenue. We are very early days in that. That is probably our biggest opportunity going forward, and that will be a multi-year journey as we continue to find more efficient ways to service that tail, take care of our customers, work on that SG&A, the speed at which we can handle those type of orders for speed at which we can service customers. A lot of organization design activity will happen related to that. So that will be a net win for our customers as well as us. But very early days in that, that starter part because there's thousands and thousands to go through. That's the more complicated part of it. We've done a lot of work organizationally and process-wise. That's the second bullet. And I still see a lot of opportunities there I think you'll see of focus on number of levels within the company, standard controls, just putting together organization design that is the most effective design for our customers and for our people. On the consolidations, I think we've taken a pretty good step already and that these. We went from 20 -- we had 28 divisions so basically 1/4 of all our divisions going through some kind of consolidation down the 14. So that dropped our total kind of divisions from 1 -- 115 to 101. Lee is working with the presidents on that. And we don't have anything to announce because in fairness to our people, not announced that in the public formally like this but you've already taken a big step I think we'll see just more fine-tuning of that as we go. And then on bureaucracy, there's lots and lots of our opportunities with our companies, old and will plan that we are did was a huge upside for people as far as free up their time to do other things. So I will say we are very pleased with what we've come so far but there's a lot more to go on that and if you have anything else, Steve? I'll be happy to answer anymore."

Of course, those are lumpy and they can come sporadically. And so that's really the driver there, Andy. Now from a -- breaking those numbers down a little bit in terms of the sales, we are basically essentially flat in the commercial market. That's being kind of impacted by the ability for us to be in a position where our [indiscernible] reduction is being overcome by our normal commercial increase. There's not been a significant change in the aftermarket there, and it's been basically flat for us. From a military standpoint, both OE and commercial, that has been up low double digits for us in the quarter. And that would be reflected not only in our sales but on our orders. And again, all of these data that I give to you tends to be -- because it's such a long-term business, tends to be very lumpy. Our perfect world, we would be 50% commercial, 50% military. We're not now. I mean, we are 65% commercial and the balance of military right now. And in a perfect world, we'll be 50-50 OEM versus aftermarket, and we're at 66% OEM right now. So that would be indicative of further aftermarket revenues to come as we are successful in our entry into service or on the commercial aircraft and as the military ramps up over the next several years on some of the key programs that we're on. And so we have a lot of very high expectations for our performance and our growth in Aerospace. And it's been a key to our successful FY '16 and key to our guidance in FY '17, too.

We appreciate your participation this morning. 
Today, I have to cover I'd like to cover the following key topics: our fourth quarter results, [indiscernible] fiscal year 2017 guidance; and finally, I'll highlight the progress we are making with the new Win Strategy. 
Let me start with the fourth quarter and full year results, which demonstrate the progress we are making in a difficult growth environment. Fourth quarter sales were $2.96 billion or a 6% decline compared with same quarter a year ago. This represents the second consecutive quarter that we saw sequential improvement in sales and a decelerating rate of decline in sales on a year-over-year basis. 
Total order rates for the fourth quarter declined 1% compared with the same quarter last year and represented a sequential improvement from the third quarter level. 
By segment, North America is still week, but our Aerospace Systems segment and International business order rates were positive on a year-over-year basis. Net income for the fourth quarter increased 35% to $242 million on an as-reported basis or 29% increase to $260 million on an adjusted basis. 
Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.77 as reported or $1.90 on an adjusted basis. That represents a 33% increase compared to the same quarter last year on an adjusted basis. 
Despite ongoing weakness in our end markets this quarter, we were able to achieve total segment operating margins of 14.8% or 15.6% adjusted. This is tremendous performance that represents a 70 basis point improvement year-over-year in adjusted segment operating margins. 
Our adjusted decremental MROS was 2.9% for the fourth quarter. This is the sixth consecutive quarter that our adjusted decrementals have been below 25%, which is the best level performance I can remember in any previous downturn. 
Just a few other full year highlights that I'd like to note. Cash flow was strong in the quarter and also the year, with cash flow from operations, excluding the discretionary pension contributions, exceeding 12% of sales, reflecting the stability of our cash generation during the downturn. We also held inventories as a percent of sales essentially flat at 10.3% in fiscal 2016 versus 10.2% in the prior year. We executed very efficiently on the $109 million worth of business realignment. Even including this restructuring, our as-reported decremental MROS was 19.5% for the full year. And notably, we accomplished all this while sales dropped $1.35 billion, which is very difficult to do. 
Moving on to capital allocation. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $108 million of Parker shares, bringing our total share repurchases for the fiscal year to $558 million. So we have now purchased $1.9 billion of Parker shares since our share repurchase plan was announced in October 2014. We are on track to meet our commitments on capital deployment. Regarding FY '17 guidance. We are forecasting a year of sales being flat compared with fiscal 2016. Our expectations that organic growth will be soft in the first quarter, becoming essentially flat in quarter 2, with the second half showing 1% to 2% organic growth on a year-over-year basis. 
For fiscal year 2017, we're issuing guidance for as-reported earnings in the range of $6.15 to $6.85 per share or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $6.40 to $7.10 for a midpoint of $6.75. 
Business realignment expenses are anticipated to be approximately $48 million or $0.25 per share. 
So now just a few comments about our progress with the Win Strategy. We continue to make meaningful progress with initials across 4 broad goals: engage people, premier customer experience, profitable growth and financial performance. 
Regarding our first goal, engage people. During this past year, we saw a 33% reduction in recordable injuries. We continue to target a 0-accident safety goal, not only because it's our responsibility to our team members, but also because improved safety performance can be a leading indicator of improved financial performance. Our high-performance teams are driving this improvement in safety as well as quality, cost and delivery. 
Now on the second goal, premier customer experience. On July 1 of this year, we launched our Lakewood recommend initiative, which is designed to get direct feedback from customers and distributors on areas where we can improve. Importantly, we're gathering this feedback in a way that every site of Parker can understand and track their performance and make improvements. This is a significant initiative because a better customer experience will drive fast organic growth for Parker. 
We're also making good progress in building our e-business capabilities and to deliver best-in-class online experience for customers. And we are making progress developing our pipeline of Internet of Things applications across groups and product lines to enhance the value we bring to customers. 
Now moving to the third goal, profitable growth. We continue to drive innovative products and systems, expand distribution and build our service business as part of our sales growth strategy. Acquisitions will play a role in our growth plans. We recently closed a transaction in Europe to acquire certain businesses of the Jäger Group to strengthen our position in worldwide sealing markets as part of our engineering materials Group. 
And lastly, our financial performance goal. Profitability in Aerospace is improving as we benefit from lower nonrecurring engineering costs that were associated with some of the large program wins that we had and improved operational efficiencies. Our simplification initiative is also gaining momentum across the company as we discover more ways to streamline operations and better serve our customers. The best way to illustrate this is to look at our employment trends. The total number of Parker team members employed at the end of FY '16 is at 2004 levels or approximately 48,000 people. In fiscal 2004, our reported sales were $6.9 billion, whereas today, our sales are $11.3 billion with the same number of team members. This is attributed to our global team members who are working together to find better and more efficient ways to accomplish their jobs and serve our customers. The combination of our simplification and lean enterprise initiatives is amplifying our ability to improve processes and make significant structural cost improvements. In addition, our strategic supply chain and value pricing initiatives give us sufficient horsepower to propel us to our profit margin goals in the future. 
So in summary, by executing the new Win Strategy, we are confident we will achieve our key financial objectives by the end of fiscal 2020, and this includes targeting sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production. We're also targeting 17% segment operating margins, and progress towards these goals is expected to drive a compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this 5-year period. I am very pleased with how far we've come in such a short period of time and continue to be excited about the opportunities we have for the future as we strive to make Parker a top-quartile performing company as compared to our proxy peers. 
So for now, I'm going to hand things back to Jon, let him give you more details on the quarter, the full year and 2017 guidance."
295170,377731169,1025519,"Parker-Hannifin Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Parker-Hannifin Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tom. And at this time, please refer to Slide #6. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.90 versus $1.43 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of",2174,"Thank you, Tom. And at this time, please refer to Slide #6. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.90 versus $1.43 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of $0.47. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.13 and compares to -- which compares to $0.16 for the same quarter last year. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2016 were $6.46 versus $7.25 for the full year 2015. Total realignment expenses and pension termination costs were $0.57 for the full year 2016, and that compares to adjustments for business realignment and voluntary retirement expenses of $0.28 for the full year 2015.
On Slide #7, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.43 for the fourth quarter 2015 to $1.90 for the fourth quarter of this year. Increases to adjusted per-share income include a reduction of corporate G&A, interest and other expense equating to $0.14 per share, which is a result of savings realized from FY '16 simplification efforts, as Tom just mentioned; one-time credits booked in Q4 FY '16; and the comparison to a higher expense in Q4 '15 from early retirement expenses incurred; and a lower effective tax rate in FY '16 of 28% versus 40.9% in Q4 of '15. This all contributed to $0.30 per share. The impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the company share repurchase activity equated to an increase of $0.05 per share. A reduction of $0.02 in adjusted per share income was a result of lower adjusted segment operating income, which is driven by the strengthened U.S. dollar, currency translation and weakened end markets, which approximates a little bit more than $200 million quarter-to-quarter. 
On Slide #8, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $7.25 for the full year 2015 to $6.46 for the full year 2016. For the full year 2016, increases to adjusted earnings per share include: Reduced corporate G&A expense equating to $0.20 per share; $0.13 per share due to a lower effective tax rate of 27.6% in FY '16 versus 29.3% in FY '15, which is due to favorable discrete benefits booked during FY '16; and $0.36 from fewer shares outstanding reflecting the full year impact of Parker's enhanced share repurchase program. Decreases to adjusted earnings per share for FY '16 were: lower segment operating income of $1 per share due to the impact of the weakened end markets and higher interest and other expense equating to $0.48 per share, which compares to a sizable one-time favorable currency adjustment recognized at FY '15 and the full year impact of interest expense on incremental debt issued in November of 2014. 
Moving to Slide #9. With a review of the total company sales and segment operating margins for the fourth quarter and full year, total company organic sales in the fourth quarter decreased by 5.3% over the same quarter last year. There was minimal contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was slightly higher than our guide, equating to a negative impact on reported sales of $31 million or 1% in the quarter. 
Total segment operating margin for the fourth quarter adjustment for realignment costs incurred in the quarter was 15.6% versus 14.9% for the same quarter last year. Business realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $25 million versus $27 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $462 million versus $468 million last year reflects the meaningful impact of the weakened industrial end markets, partially offset by the savings realized from our very large simplification and restructuring actions taken throughout the year. 
For the full year, organic sales in fiscal year '17 decreased by 7.7%. Contributions to sales from acquisitions were minimal. The effect of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $404 million or 3.2% of sales for the full year. 
Total company segment operating margin for fiscal year '16, adjusted for realignment costs incurred during the year, was 14.8% versus 14.9% in fiscal year '15. Business realignment expenses incurred in FY '16 was $107 million. 
Slide #10 discusses the business segments, and I'll start first with the Diversified Industrial North America segment. For the fourth quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 10.3% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a nominal impact from acquisitions and a negative impact from currency of 0.6% in the quarter. Operating margin for the fourth quarter adjusted for realignment costs was 18% of sales versus 17.3% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $5 million as compared to $15 million in the same prior year. Adjusted operating income was $226 million as compared to $244 million, which is driven by the reduced volume as a result of the key industrial weak markets. 
For the full year, organic sales for the fiscal year 2016 decreased by 12.4%. Contributions to sales from acquisitions were minimal. The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $60 million or 1% of sales for the full year. For the full year 2016, operating margin adjusted for realignment costs was 16.8% of sales versus 17% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $42 million as compared to $16 million and -- at fiscal '15. Adjusted operating income for fiscal '16 was $832 million as compared to $972 million in the prior year. 
Now turning to Slide #11. I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segments. Organic sales for the Diversified Industrial International segment, organic sales for the fourth quarter in the segment decreased by 3%. Currency translation negatively impacted sales by 2%. Operating margin for the fourth quarter adjusted for business realignment costs was 12.6% of sales versus 10.9% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $18 million as compared to $6 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $137 million as compared to $124 million, which, despite the weakened top line, reflects the offsetting savings resulting from realignment actions taken in the current year as well as the prior fiscal years. 
For the full year, organic sales for fiscal year '16 decreased by 6%. The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $339 million or negative 7.1% of sales for the year. For the full year 2016, operating margin adjusted realignment costs was 12.3% of sales versus 12.9% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses totaled $61 million as compared to $27 million in fiscal '15. Adjusted operating income for fiscal '16 was $509 million as compared to $611 million last year. 
And I'll now move to Slide #12 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues increased 2.2% for the quarter. Neither acquisitions nor currency really impacted revenues. Strong growth in military OEM and military aftermarket sales were the drivers for the quarterly performance. Operating margin for the fourth quarter adjusted for realignment costs was 16.4% of sales versus 16.9% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $1 million as compared to $6 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was flat at $99 million for both Q4 '16 and the prior year, reflecting the impact of the reduced commercial sales volume in the quarter, albeit partially offset by reduced development costs as a percentage of sales. 
For the full year, organic sales for fiscal year '16 increased by 0.5% of sales. For the full year '16, operating margin adjusted for realignment costs was 15.1% of sales versus 13.5% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $4 million as compared to $6 million related in the prior year. And adjusted operating income for the fiscal year was $341 million as compared to $305 million last year, which was largely attributed to the reduction of development costs to slightly less than 8% of sales, together with the savings from the business realignment activities. 
Going to Slide #13. Moving to that slide is a detail of our orders changes by segment. As a reminder, our orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a 3-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. 
Total orders improved to a negative 1% for the quarter-end, reflecting a decelerating rate of decline in key industrial end markets, including oil and gas, construction and agriculture. Diversified Industrial North America orders decreased to a negative 10%. Diversified Industrial International orders improved to a positive 3% for the quarter. Aerospace System orders increased to plus 14% for the quarter. 
Looking at Slide #14. On -- we report the cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter cash from our sales, which compares to 16.2% of sales for the same period last year. For the full year, cash flow from operating activities for fiscal '16 was $1,170,000,000 or 10.3% of sales as compared to 10.2% last year. When adjusted for that $200 million voluntary pension contribution made during the year, adjusted cash flow from operating activities was $1,370,000,000 or 12.1% of sales as compared to 2 -- 10.2% in fiscal '15. There was no pension contribution made during FY '15. The significant uses of cash during the year included $558 million for the company's repurchase of common shares and $342 million for the payment of shareholders' dividends. And there was $149 million for CapEx equating to 1.3% of sales for FY '16. 
Now turning to guidance for FY '17. Full year earnings guidance for FY '17 is outlined here. Guidance is provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of $48 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY 2017. Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 1.5% to positive 2.1% as compared to the prior year. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is flat. Currency in the guidance is not forecasted to impact sales. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of June 30, 2016, and we hold those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming FY '17. 
Total Parker adjusted segment operating margin's forecast to be between 15.2% and 15.6%. This compares to 14.8% for FY '16 on an adjusted basis. The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate G&A, interest and other expense, is $469 million for the year at the midpoint. The full year tax rate is projected at 29%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full year guidance is 135.5 million. And for the full year guidance on an adjusted earnings per share is $6.40 to $7.10 or $6.75 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $48 million to be included in FY '17. This is the only adjustments that we make to our guidance. It's just realignment expenses. The effect of this restructuring on EPS is approximately $0.25 savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected to be $30 million on our fully reflected in the adjusted operating margin guidance range. 
Some additional key assumptions for the fiscal year guidance are: sales are divided 48% first half, 52% second half, which is a normal distribution of a split for a year for us; adjusted segment operating income is divided 46% in the first half, 54% in the second half; EPS in the first half versus the second half is $2.93 and $3.82 for the second half; Q1 FY '17 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.52 at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.09 of business realignment expenses. 
On Slide #16, just some influences on EPS for '17 as compared to '16. On Slide 16, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of FY '17 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.75 per share to midpoint from the prior FY '16 EPS of $6.46 per share. Increases include $0.40 from an increased segment operating income and $0.11 from fewer shares outstanding and reduced interest expense. Key components of the decrease, including $0.13 per share reduction from taxes, reflecting a rate from continuing operations of 29% and $0.09 per share reduction from increased corporate G&A and other expenses as a result of normalized levels, not including one-time favorable settlements realized in the prior year, primarily in Q4, in part by reduced pension expense due to the company's adoption of the spot rate methodology for calculating annual pension expense. This has a total impact of $0.11 for FY '17. 
Please remember that the forecast excludes any acquisition and divestitures that might close during FY '17. For consistency, we ask that you exclude only the restructuring expenses from your published estimates. This concludes my prepared remarks. 
Tom, I'll turn the call back over to you for your summary comments."

And I'll start with, in case those of you that were on the phone didn't hear my opening comments, this is going to be a year of sale",637,"Okay, Jamie. It's Tom. Let me just -- the topics are kind of interwoven, so I'll start with the guide, what was behind it. And I'll start with, in case those of you that were on the phone didn't hear my opening comments, this is going to be a year of sales leveling off, which, after the sharp reduction that we had last year, is going to be a very refreshing change for all of our people around the world. But the way we forecast this is Q1's going to be soft, moving to essentially flat in Q2 with 1% to 2% sales growth in the second half. So our thoughts behind the numbers, the natural resource related end-markets, so construction, ag, mining and oil and gas, are moderating. And now they're continuing -- going to continue to be year-over-year when we finish '17 negative, but they're going to get to be less and less of a drag, especially in the second half. When you look at order entries that we had in Q4, in particular, what drove our thoughts within international is that we had a positive international of plus 3%. And that was made up of Europe being basically flat, minus 1% in that area; Asia, plus 6%; and Latin America, plus 19%. So what's really driving our international sales forecast is a forecast of Europe being relatively flat and Asia Pacific and Latin America being up a little bit, driving an international forecast of plus 2%. 
Now you talked about North America. Now what we saw in Q4, I would characterize as continued choppiness around what we saw from Q3 to Q4. I mean, during the quarter, people started off a little bit softer than we would have liked, and then May and June were a little bit better. What we're seeing for North America for the full year, to give you some context as to the negative 3% that we have out there, is that we have a first half of minus 5% and a second half of minus 1%. And what's driving that is, if you look at the natural resource related end-markets that I've described, they really bottomed in North America in our second half of the year. So we're not really anticipating any new catalyst, any new activity that's going to drive growth or sustainability beyond our current levels for natural resources. But what you're seeing in North America is easier comps in the second half. And we do have growth in North America in non-natural resource related markets, like machine tools, telecom, Life Sciences, turf, refrigeration that is going to now help to offset some of that, not completely, because we'll still end North America at a minus 3%. 
Now if I could, I'm just going to give you context, our view for the total end markets for the whole fiscal '17. And I want to put an asterisk on this. I'm not trying to describe the entire end market. I'm just trying to describe our performance in that end market. So just -- I have them in 3 buckets: positive, neutral, negative. 
So on the positive side, what makes up our forecast is Aerospace, [indiscernible] turf, passenger rail, refrigeration and air-conditioning, semicon and telecom. And the neutral areas, automotive, distribution and Life Sciences and power generation. Now of significance is the distribution in neutral, and although that's not a new market, it's a big channel for us. And the fact that distribution mves to neutral helps the year stabilize quite a bit. And then on our negative is construction, pharma and ag, forestry, general industrial, heavy-duty truck, marine, mining and oil and gas. So that's the landscape, and I probably gave you more than you wanted to know. But that's our -- that's what we think for '17."

But what gives us confidence is when you look at the nonnatural resource-related end markets in Q4, those saw anywhere from flat to a plus 15%. So distribution being up mid-single digits, which is a big part of North America, machine tools, telecom, life sciences, turf, refrigeration has been very -- and air-conditioning is very strong for us and automotive about flat, slightly positive. So that was really the mix that felt -- that's good about the North America forecast. The other part is that we do know that the natural resource comps and those particular markets gets much easier in the second half, which is why our first quarter for North America, we're not anticipating anything much differently than what we saw in the current quarter, maybe a hair better, but because the comps get easier in the second half is why we forecasted a better comp in the second half."

Tom, you mentioned in your prepared comments that you've had historically low decrementals during this down cycle, which is obviously a tribute to the business. Does it also change the profile of the incremental margins that we should be thinking about when volume returns? Is the cost structure structurally changed to the point where you would expect higher incremental margins on volume as volume comes back?"

And then as you get deeper into, a gross segment here in the 20s, potentially probably bottoming out in the upper teens. But I think what we've done structurally and the fact that we are simpler, leaner and have a much better cost structure, we would never have been able to put up the MROSes that we've put up without doing actions that we've taken. And just -- it's worth repeating again. The all-in reported MROS, 19.5%, so that's all the restructuring, $109 million, which is the highest restructuring we've done in the history of the company. Even with all that, you put up a 19.5% MROS. So yes, I think it can be higher. Could I peg a number? No, that would be difficult to do, but I would expect it to be higher than we've done historically."

Our pension expense for next year, as I tried to mention in my comments, was going to be impacted positively in total, altogether, by $0.11 impacting FY '17 due to the spot rate methodology that we've adopted as well as many other puts and takes that go into making that -- making those estimates and doing the accounting for that.

We only have one more quarter left in the share repurchase plan. It was October to October, '14 to '16. So we'll come in at the $2 billion level of that range that we said. And what's really kind of the factors that we have considered with that is that 99% of our cash is permanently invested overseas. We do have a desire to maintain that A rating. And we're -- our debt-to-total cap is around almost 40%. And when we started the program, we were a $13 billion company and now we're $11.4 billion. Now we're very proud of the double-digit cash flow that we've been able to generate, but it's double digits off of a smaller number. So that's what is kind of framing why we're going to come in at the low end of the range. Now going forward, our desire -- let me first state that we want to be great generators of cash, and I think we've done a great job there. We're going to continue to do an even better job. And we want to be known as a company that really spins off a lot of cash. On the flip side, we want to be known as a company that deploys it very effectively on behalf of the shareholders. And you've heard me say this before, but those maybe who've not, I'll repeat it. First and foremost, as far as our priorities is to continue our dividend track record. Then we're going to fund organic growth because it's the most efficient growth that you can fund. And then really it's a dynamic review on a case-by-case basis between share repurchase and acquisitions and really with the goal of generating the best long-term value for our shareholders. On the share repurchase, you won't see us do another announcement type of process. I think what's better for shareholders is to be active, to have a muscular balance sheet, but to tell you after the fact because when we announce in advance, we're buying into our own wind, and I don't think that helps shareholders. I think we want to do it after the fact. That's the most effective way to use our cash and to help shareholders. Regarding acquisitions, the pipeline is active, but I talked last quarter -- and evaluations continue to be, I would call it, historically high. And -- but I do think time is on our side here because we buy properties in spaces that we understand, so we understand the growth rates. I think sellers' expectations on growth rates is going to start to temper as they recognize that this is -- that the growth rates that they think their business is going to do is not going to actually come to fruition. And I think you'll see our pipeline become more actionable. We've always been disciplined buyers. We'll always be able to -- we'll always continue to buy properties we know we can deliver on for our shareholders. So we'll look at all that. And again, the goal is to have a muscular balance sheet and do what's best for our shareholders."

We started to see some signs of life in mobile construction, in particular, India and Japan. But the good thing is Japan -- China has finally flattened out, and we actually saw some new incremental orders in China. And we have all the countries across Asia growing with the exception of Korea. And Korea just has a little more exposure to some of those global OEMs. So that will start to recover as well.

I think there's really been great momentum for us across the company on simplification. And again, I mentioned in my opening comments the combination of putting simplification with our lean enterprise efforts is really giving us an amplification of being able to look at cost and processes differently than maybe we have in the past. But as I've mentioned before, and I'll kind of give you some comments as to where I think we can go on these. There's 4 big areas that we are focused on. The first is that whole revenue complexity or maybe another way of saying it is that product line simplification, that tail of revenue at the last couple percent of revenue. We are very early days in that. That is probably our biggest opportunity going forward. And that will be a multiyear journey as we continue to find more efficient ways to service that tail, take care of our customers, work on the SG&A, the speed at which we can handle those type of orders, speed at which we can service customers. A lot of organization design activity will happen related to that. So that will be a net win for our customers as well as us. But very early days in that. That's the harder part because there's thousands and thousands of partners to go through. That's the more complicated part of it. We've done a lot of work organizationally and process-wise. That's the second bullet. And I still see lots of opportunities there. I think you'll see a focus on number of levels within the company, span of controls, just putting together an organizational design that is the most effective design for our customers and for our people. On the division consolidations, I think we have taken a pretty big step already on that piece. We went from 20 -- we had 20 divisions, so basically 1/4 of all of our divisions going through some kind of consolidation down to 14. So that dropped our total count of divisions from 1 -- 115 to 101. Lee is working with the presidents on that. And we don't have anything to announce because in fairness to our people, we would not announce that in a public forum like this. But we've already taken a big step there. I think you'll see just more fine-tuning on that as we go. And then on bureaucracy, there's lots and lots of opportunities within the company. The whole annual plan process that we redid was a huge upside for people as far as being able to free up their time to do other things. So I would say we're very pleased with where we've come so far, but there's a lot more to go on that. And then if you have anything else, Steve, I'd be happy to answer any more."

Of course, those are lumpy and they can come sporadically. And so that's really the driver there, Andy. Now from a -- breaking those numbers down a little bit in terms of the sales, we are basically essentially flat in the commercial market. That's being kind of impacted by the ability for us to be in a position where our biz jet reduction is being overcome by our normal commercial increase. There's not been a significant change in the aftermarket there, and it's been basically flat for us. From a military standpoint, both OE and commercial, that has been up low double digits for us in the quarter. And that would be reflected not only in our sales but in our orders. And again, all of these data that I give to you, it tends to be -- because it's such a long-term business, tends to be very lumpy. Our perfect world, we would be 50% commercial, 50% military. We're not now. I mean, we are 65% commercial and the balance military right now. And in a perfect world, we'll be 50-50 OEM versus aftermarket, and we're at 66% OEM right now. So that would be indicative of further aftermarket revenues to come as we are successful in our entry into service or on the commercial aircraft and as the military ramps up over the next several years on some of the key programs that we're on. And so we have a lot of very high expectations for our performance and our growth there in Aerospace. And it's been key to our successful FY '16 and key to our guidance in FY '17, too. So I hope that gives you some color there, Andy."

We appreciate your participation this morning. Today, I’d like to cover I'd like to cover the following key topics: our fourth quarter results, review our fiscal year 2017 guidance; and finally, I'll",1210,"Thanks, Jon, and welcome to everybody on the call. We appreciate your participation this morning. 
Today, I’d like to cover I'd like to cover the following key topics: our fourth quarter results, review our fiscal year 2017 guidance; and finally, I'll highlight the progress we are making with the new Win Strategy. 
Let me start with the fourth quarter and full year results, which demonstrate the progress we are making in a difficult growth environment. Fourth quarter sales were $2.96 billion or a 6% decline compared with the same quarter a year ago. This represents the second consecutive quarter that we saw sequential improvement in sales and a decelerating rate of decline in sales on a year-over-year basis. 
Total order rates for the fourth quarter declined 1% compared with the same quarter last year and represented a sequential improvement from the third quarter level.
By segment, North America is still week, but our Aerospace Systems segment and International business order rates were positive on a year-over-year basis. Net income for the fourth quarter increased 35% to $242 million on an as-reported basis or 29% increase to $260 million on an adjusted basis. 
Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.77 as reported or $1.90 on an adjusted basis. That represents a 33% increase compared to the same quarter last year on an adjusted basis. 
Despite ongoing weakness in our end markets this quarter, we were able to achieve total segment operating margins of 14.8% or 15.6% adjusted. This is tremendous performance that represents a 70 basis point improvement year-over-year in adjusted segment operating margins. 
Our adjusted decremental MROS was 2.9% for the fourth quarter. This is the sixth consecutive quarter that our adjusted decrementals have been below 25%, which is the best level performance I can remember in any previous downturn. 
Just a few other full year highlights that I'd like to note. Cash flow was strong in the quarter and also the year, with cash flow from operations, excluding the discretionary pension contribution, exceeding 12% of sales, reflecting the stability of our cash generation during the downturn. We also held inventories as a percent of sales essentially flat at 10.3% in fiscal 2016 versus 10.2% in the prior year. We executed very efficiently on the $109 million worth of business realignment. Even including this restructuring, our as-reported decremental MROS was 19.5% for the full year. And notably, we accomplished all this while sales dropped $1.35 billion, which is very difficult to do. 
Moving on to capital allocation. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $108 million of Parker shares, bringing our total share repurchases for the fiscal year to $558 million. So we have now purchased $1.9 billion of Parker shares since our share repurchase plan was announced in October 2014. We are on track to meet our commitments on capital deployment. Regarding FY '17 guidance, we are forecasting a year of sales being flat compared with fiscal 2016. Our expectations that organic growth will be soft in the first quarter, becoming essentially flat in quarter 2, with the second half showing 1% to 2% organic growth on a year-over-year basis. 
For fiscal year 2017, we're issuing guidance for as-reported earnings in the range of $6.15 to $6.85 per share or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $6.40 to $7.10 for a midpoint of $6.75. 
Business realignment expenses are anticipated to be approximately $48 million or $0.25 per share. 
So now just a few comments about our progress with the Win Strategy. We continue to make meaningful progress with initiatives across 4 broad goals: engage people, premier customer experience, profitable growth and financial performance. 
Regarding our first goal, engage people. During this past year, we saw a 33% reduction in recordable injuries. We continue to target a 0 accident safety goal, not only because it's our responsibility to our team members, but also because improved safety performance can be a leading indicator of improved financial performance. Our high-performance teams are driving this improvement in safety as well as quality, cost and delivery. 
Now on the second goal, premier customer experience. On July 1 of this year, we launched our likely to recommend initiative, which is designed to get direct feedback from customers and distributors on areas where we can improve. Importantly, we're gathering this feedback in a way that every site at Parker can understand and track their performance and make improvements. This is a significant initiative because a better customer experience will drive fast organic growth for Parker. 
We're also making good progress in building our e-business capabilities and to deliver best-in-class online experience for customers. And we are making progress developing our pipeline of Internet of Things applications across groups and product lines to enhance the value we bring to customers. 
Now moving to the third goal, profitable growth. We continue to drive innovative products and systems, expand distribution and build our service business as part of our sales growth strategy. Acquisitions will play a role in our growth plans. We recently closed a transaction in Europe to acquire certain businesses of the Jäger Group to strengthen our position in worldwide sealing markets as part of our Engineered Materials Group. 
And lastly, our financial performance goal. Profitability in Aerospace is improving as we benefit from lower nonrecurring engineering costs that were associated with some of the large program wins that we had and improved operational efficiencies. Our simplification initiative is also gaining momentum across the company as we discover more ways to streamline operations and better serve our customers. The best way to illustrate this is to look at our employment trends. The total number of Parker team members employed at the end of FY '16 is at 2004 levels or approximately 48,000 people. In fiscal 2004, our reported sales were $6.9 billion, whereas today, our sales are $11.3 billion with the same number of team members. This is a tribute to our global team members who are working together to find better and more efficient ways to accomplish their jobs and serve our customers. The combination of our simplification and lean enterprise initiatives is amplifying our ability to improve processes and make significant structural cost improvements. In addition, our strategic supply chain and value pricing initiatives give us sufficient horsepower to propel us to our profit margin goals in the future. 
So in summary, by executing the new Win Strategy, we are confident we will achieve our key financial objectives by the end of fiscal 2020, and this includes targeting sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production. We're also targeting 17% segment operating margins, and progress towards these goals is expected to drive a compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this 5-year period. I am very pleased with how far we've come in such a short period of time and continue to be excited about the opportunities we have for the future as we strive to make Parker a top-quartile performing company as compared to our proxy peers. 
So for now, I'm going to hand things back to Jon, let him give you more details on the quarter, the full year and 2017 guidance."

And at this time, please refer to Slide #6. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.90 versus $1.43 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of",2176,"Thank you, Tom. And at this time, please refer to Slide #6. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.90 versus $1.43 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of $0.47. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.13 and compares to -- which compares to $0.16 for the same quarter last year. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2016 were $6.46 versus $7.25 for the full year 2015. Total realignment expenses and pension termination costs were $0.57 for the full year 2016, and that compares to adjustments for business realignment and voluntary retirement expenses of $0.28 for the full year 2015.
On Slide #7, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.43 for the fourth quarter 2015 to $1.90 for the fourth quarter of this year. Increases to adjusted per-share income include a reduction of corporate G&A, interest and other expense equating to $0.14 per share, which is a result of savings realized from FY '16 simplification efforts, as Tom just mentioned; one-time credits booked in Q4 FY '16; and the comparison to a higher expense in Q4 '15 from early retirement expenses incurred; and a lower effective tax rate in FY '16 of 28% versus 40.9% in Q4 of '15. This all contributed to $0.30 per share. The impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the company share repurchase activity equated to an increase of $0.05 per share. A reduction of $0.02 in adjusted per share income was a result of lower adjusted segment operating income, which is driven by the strengthened U.S. dollar currency translation and weakened end markets, which approximates a little bit more than $200 million quarter-to-quarter. 
On Slide #8, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $7.25 for the full year 2015 to $6.46 for the full year 2016. For the full year 2016, increases to adjusted earnings per share include reduced corporate G&A expense equating to $0.20 per share; $0.13 per share due to a lower effective tax rate of 27.6% in FY '16 versus 29.3% in FY '15, which is due to favorable discrete benefits booked during FY '16; and $0.36 from fewer shares outstanding reflecting the full year impact of Parker's enhanced share repurchase program. Decreases to adjusted earnings per share for FY '16 were lower segment operating income of $1 per share due to the impact of the weakened end markets and higher interest and other expense equating to $0.48 per share, which compares to a sizable onetime favorable currency adjustment recognized at FY '15 and the full year impact of interest expense on incremental debt issued in November of 2014. 
Moving to Slide #9. With a review of the total company sales and segment operating margins for the fourth quarter and full year, total company organic sales in the fourth quarter decreased by 5.3% over the same quarter last year. There was minimal contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was slightly higher than our guide, equating to a negative impact on reported sales of $31 million or 1% in the quarter. 
Total segment operating margin for the fourth quarter adjustment for realignment costs incurred in the quarter was 15.6% versus 14.9% for the same quarter last year. Business realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $25 million versus $27 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $462 million versus $468 million last year reflects the meaningful impact of the weakened industrial end markets, partially offset by the savings realized from our very large simplification and restructuring actions taken throughout the year. 
For the full year, organic sales in fiscal year '17 decreased by 7.7%. Contributions to sales from acquisitions were minimal. The effect of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $404 million or 3.2% of sales for the full year. 
Total company segment operating margin for fiscal year '16, adjusted for realignment costs incurred during the year, was 14.8% versus 14.9% in fiscal year '15. Business realignment expenses incurred in FY '16 was $107 million. 
Slide #10 discusses the business segments, and I'll start first with the Diversified Industrial North America segment. For the fourth quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 10.3% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a nominal impact from acquisitions and a negative impact from currency of 0.6% in the quarter. Operating margin for the fourth quarter adjusted for realignment costs was 18% of sales versus 17.3% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $5 million as compared to $15 million in the same prior year. Adjusted operating income was $226 million as compared to $244 million, which is driven by the reduced volume as a result of the key industrial weak markets. 
For the full year, organic sales for the fiscal year 2016 decreased by 12.4%. Contributions to sales from acquisitions were minimal. The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $60 million or 1% of sales for the full year. For the full year 2016, operating margin adjusted for realignment costs was 16.8% of sales versus 17% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $42 million as compared to $16 million and -- at fiscal '15. Adjusted operating income for fiscal '16 was $832 million as compared to $972 million in the prior year. 
Now turning to Slide #11. I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segments. Organic sales for the Diversified Industrial International segment, organic sales for the fourth quarter in the segment decreased by 3%. Currency translation negatively impacted sales by 2%. Operating margin for the fourth quarter adjusted for business realignment costs was 12.6% of sales versus 10.9% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $18 million as compared to $6 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $137 million as compared to $124 million, which, despite the weakened top line, reflects the offsetting savings resulting from realignment actions taken in the current year as well as the prior fiscal years. 
For the full year, organic sales for fiscal year '16 decreased by 6%. The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $339 million or negative 7.1% of sales for the year. For the full year 2016, operating margin adjusted for realignment costs was 12.3% of sales versus 12.9% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses totaled $61 million as compared to $27 million in fiscal '15. Adjusted operating income for fiscal '16 was $509 million as compared to $611 million last year. 
And I'll now move to Slide #12 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues increased 2.2% for the quarter. Neither acquisitions nor currency really impacted revenues. Strong growth in military OEM and military aftermarket sales were the drivers for the quarterly performance. Operating margin for the fourth quarter adjusted for realignment costs was 16.4% of sales versus 16.9% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $1 million as compared to $6 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was flat at $99 million for both Q4 '16 and the prior year, reflecting the impact of the reduced commercial sales volume in the quarter, albeit partially offset by reduced development costs as a percentage of sales. 
For the full year, organic sales for fiscal year '16 increased by 0.5% of sales. For the full year '16, operating margin adjusted for realignment costs was 15.1% of sales versus 13.5% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $4 million as compared to $6 million related in the prior year. And adjusted operating income for the fiscal year was $341 million as compared to $305 million last year, which was largely attributed to the reduction of development costs to slightly less than 8% of sales, together with the savings from the business realignment activities. 
Going to Slide #13. Moving to that slide is a detail of our orders changes by segment. As a reminder, our orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a 3-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. 
Total orders improved to a negative 1% for the quarter-end, reflecting a decelerating rate of decline in key industrial end markets, including oil and gas, construction and agriculture. Diversified Industrial North America orders decreased to a negative 10%. Diversified Industrial International orders improved to a positive 3% for the quarter. Aerospace System orders increased to plus 14% for the quarter. 
Looking at Slide #14. On -- we report the cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter cash from our sales, which compares to 16.2% of sales for the same period last year. For the full year, cash flow from operating activities for fiscal '16 was $1,170,000,000 or 10.3% of sales as compared to 10.2% last year. When adjusted for that $200 million voluntary pension contribution made during the year, adjusted cash flow from operating activities was $1,370,000,000 or 12.1% of sales as compared to 2 -- 10.2% in fiscal '15. There was no pension contribution made during FY '15. The significant uses of cash during the year included $558 million for the company's repurchase of common shares and $342 million for the payment of shareholders' dividends. And there was $149 million for CapEx equating to 1.3% of sales for FY '16. 
Now turning to guidance for FY '17. Full year earnings guidance for FY '17 is outlined here. Guidance is provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of $48 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY 2017. Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 1.5% to positive 2.1% as compared to the prior year. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is flat. Currency in the guidance is not forecasted to impact sales. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of June 30, 2016, and we hold those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming FY '17. 
Total Parker adjusted segment operating margin's forecast to be between 15.2% and 15.6%. This compares to 14.8% for FY '16 on an adjusted basis. The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate G&A, interest and other expense, is $469 million for the year at the midpoint. The full year tax rate is projected at 29%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full year guidance is 135.5 million. And for the full year guidance on an adjusted earnings per share is $6.40 to $7.10 or $6.75 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $48 million to be included in FY '17. This is the only adjustments that we make to our guidance. It's just realignment expenses. The effect of this restructuring on EPS is approximately $0.25 savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected to be $30 million on our fully reflected in the adjusted operating margin guidance range. 
Some additional key assumptions for the fiscal year guidance are: sales are divided 48% first half, 52% second half, which is a normal distribution of a split for a year for us; adjusted segment operating income is divided 46% in the first half, 54% in the second half; EPS in the first half versus the second half is $2.93 and $3.82 for the second half; Q1 FY '17 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.52 at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.09 of business realignment expenses. 
On Slide #16, just some influences on EPS for '17 as compared to '16. On Slide 16, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of FY '17 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.75 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY '16 EPS of $6.46 per share. Increases include $0.40 from an increased segment operating income and $0.11 from fewer shares outstanding and reduced interest expense. Key components of the decrease, including $0.13 per share reduction from taxes, reflecting a rate from continuing operations of 29% and $0.09 per share reduction from increased corporate G&A and other expenses as a result of normalized levels, not including onetime favorable settlements realized in the prior year, primarily in Q4, in part by reduced pension expense due to the company's adoption of the spot rate methodology for calculating annual pension expense. This has a total impact of $0.11 for FY '17. 
Please remember that the forecast excludes any acquisition and divestitures that might close during FY '17. For consistency, we ask that you exclude only the restructuring expenses from your published estimates. This concludes my prepared remarks. 
Tom, I'll turn the call back over to you for your summary comments."

Let me just -- the topics are kind of interwoven, so I'll start with the guide, what was behind it. And I'll start with, in case those of you that were on the phone didn't hear my opening comments, this is going to be a year of sales leveling off, which, after the sharp reduction that we had last year, is going to be a very refreshing change for all of our people around the world. But the way we forecast this is Q1's going to be soft, moving to essentially flat in Q2 with 1% to 2% sales growth in the second half. So our thoughts behind the numbers, the natural resource related end-markets, so construction, ag, mining and oil and gas, are moderating. And now they're continuing -- going to continue to be year-over-year when we finish '17 negative, but they're going to get to be less and less of a drag, especially in the second half. When you look at order entries that we had in Q4, in particular, what drove our thoughts within international is that we had a positive international of plus 3%. And that was made up of Europe being basically flat, minus 1% in that area; Asia, plus 6%; and Latin America, plus 19%. So what's really driving our international sales forecast is a forecast of Europe being relatively flat and Asia Pacific and Latin America being up a little bit, driving an international forecast of plus 2%. 
Now you talked about North America. Now what we saw in Q4, I would characterize as continued choppiness around what we saw from Q3 to Q4. I mean, during the quarter, people started off a little bit softer than we would have liked, and then May and June were a little bit better. What we're seeing for North America for the full year, to give you some context as to the negative 3% that we have out there, is that we have a first half of minus 5% and a second half of minus 1%. And what's driving that is, if you look at the natural resource related end-markets that I've described, they really bottomed in North America in our second half of the year. So we're not really anticipating any new catalyst, any new activity that's going to drive growth or sustainability beyond our current levels for natural resources. But what you're seeing in North America is easier comps in the second half. And we do have growth in North America in non-natural resource related markets, like machine tools, telecom, Life Sciences, turf, refrigeration that is going to now help to offset some of that. Not completely, because we'll still end North America at a minus 3%. 
Now if I could, I'm just going to give you context, our view for the total end markets for the whole fiscal '17. And I want to put an asterisk by this. I'm not trying to describe the entire end market. I'm just trying to describe our performance in that end market. So just -- I have them in 3 buckets: positive, neutral, negative. 
So on the positive side, what makes up our forecast is Aerospace, lawn and turf, passenger rail, refrigeration and air-conditioning, semicon and telecom. And the neutral areas, automotive, distribution and Life Sciences and power generation. Now of significance is the distribution in neutral, and although that's not a new market, it's a big channel for us. And the fact that distribution moves to neutral helps the year stabilize quite a bit. And then on our negative is construction, farm and ag, forestry, general industrial, heavy-duty truck, marine, mining and oil and gas. So that's the landscape, and I probably gave you more than you wanted to know. But that's our -- that's what we think for '17."

So distribution being up mid-single digits, which is a big part of North America, machine tools, telecom, life sciences, turf, refrigeration has been very -- and air-conditioning is very strong for us and automotive about flat, slightly positive. So that was really the mix that felt -- that's good about the North America forecast.

And I think that from a capital standpoint here, from a CapEx, we would be at about 2% of sales. And those are the kind of the big drivers here for us. Our pension expense for next year, as I tried to mention in my comments, was going to be impacted positively in total, altogether, by $0.11 impacting FY '17 due to the spot rate methodology that we've adopted as well as many other puts and takes that go into making that -- making those estimates and doing the accounting for that. So the CapEx of 2%, we never forecast acquisitions, of course. And from a pension expense standpoint, it's quite possible that we would have a normal contribution there.

We only have one more quarter left in the share repurchase plan. It was October to October, '14 to '16. So we'll come in at the $2 billion level of that range that we said. And what's really kind of the factors that we have considered with that is that 99% of our cash is permanently invested overseas. We do have a desire to maintain that A rating. And we're -- our debt-to-total cap is around almost 40%. And when we started the program, we were a $13 billion company and now we're $11.4 billion. Now we're very proud of the double-digit cash flow that we've been able to generate, but it's double digits off of a smaller number. So that's what is kind of framing why we're going to come in at the low end of the range. Now going forward, our desire -- let me first state that we want to be great generators of cash, and I think we've done a great job there. We're going to continue to do an even better job. And we want to be known as a company that really spins off a lot of cash. On the flip side, we want to be known as a company that deploys it very effectively on behalf of the shareholders. And you've heard me say this before, but those maybe who've not, I'll repeat it. First and foremost, as far as our priorities is to continue our dividend track record. Then we're going to fund organic growth because it's the most efficient growth that you can fund. And then really it's a dynamic review on a case-by-case basis between share repurchase and acquisitions and really with the goal of generating the best long-term value for our shareholders. On the share repurchase, you won't see us do another announcement type of process. I think what's better for shareholders is to be active, to have a muscular balance sheet, but to tell you after the fact because when we announce in advance, we're buying into our own wind, and I don't think that helps shareholders. I think we want to do it after the fact. That's the most effective way to use our cash and to help shareholders. Regarding acquisitions, the pipeline is active, but I talked last quarter -- and evaluations continue to be, I would call it, historically high. And -- but I do think time is on our side here because we buy properties in spaces that we understand, so we understand the growth rates. I think sellers' expectations on growth rates is going to start to temper as they recognize that this is -- that the growth rates that they think their business is going to do is not going to actually come to fruition. And I think you'll see our pipeline become more actionable. We've always been disciplined buyers. We'll always be able to -- we'll always continue to buy properties we know we can deliver on for our shareholders. So we'll look at all that. And again, the goal is to have a muscular balance sheet and do what's best for our shareholders."

We started to see some signs of life in mobile construction, in particular, India and Japan. But the good thing is Japan -- China has finally flattened out, and we actually saw some new incremental orders in China. And we have all the countries across Asia growing with the exception of Korea. And Korea just has a little more exposure to some of those global OEMs. So that will start to recover as well.

I think there's really been great momentum for us across the company on simplification. And again, I mentioned in my opening comments the combination of putting simplification with our lean enterprise efforts is really giving us an amplification of being able to look at cost and processes differently than maybe we have in the past. But as I've mentioned before, and I'll kind of give you some comments as to where I think we can go on these. There's 4 big areas that we are focused on. The first is that whole revenue complexity or maybe another way of saying it is that product line simplification, that tail of revenue at the last couple percent of revenue. We are in very early days in that. That is probably our biggest opportunity going forward. And that will be a multiyear journey as we continue to find more efficient ways to service that tail, take care of our customers, work on the SG&A, the speed at which we can handle those type of orders, speed at which we can service customers. A lot of organization design activity will happen related to that. So that will be a net win for our customers as well as us. But very early days in that. That's the harder part because there's thousands and thousands of partners to go through. That's the more complicated part of it. We've done a lot of work organizationally and process-wise. That's the second bullet. And I still see lots of opportunities there. I think you'll see a focus on number of levels within the company, span of controls, just putting together an organizational design that is the most effective design for our customers and for our people. On the division consolidations, I think we have taken a pretty big step already on that piece. We went from 28 -- we had 28 divisions, so basically 1/4 of all of our divisions going through some kind of consolidation down to 14. So that dropped our total count of divisions from 1 -- 115 to 101. Lee is working with the presidents on that. And we don't have anything to announce because in fairness to our people, we would not announce that in a public forum like this. But we've already taken a big step there. I think you'll see just more fine-tuning on that as we go. And then on bureaucracy, there's lots and lots of opportunities within the company. The whole annual plan process that we redid was a huge upside for people as far as being able to free up their time to do other things. So I would say we're very pleased with where we've come so far, but there's a lot more to go on that. And then if you have anything else, Steve, I'd be happy to answer any more."

Now from a -- breaking those numbers down a little bit in terms of the sales, we are basically essentially flat in the commercial market. That's being kind of impacted by the ability for us to be in a position where our biz jet reduction is being overcome by our normal commercial increase. There's not been a significant change in the aftermarket there, and it's been basically flat for us. From a military standpoint, both OE and commercial, that has been up low double digits for us in the quarter. And that would be reflected not only in our sales but in our orders. And again, all of these data that I give to you, it tends to be -- because it's such a long-term business, tends to be very lumpy. Our perfect world, we would be 50% commercial, 50% military. We're not now. I mean, we are 65% commercial and the balance military right now. And in a perfect world, we'll be 50-50 OEM versus aftermarket, and we're at 66% OEM right now. So that would be indicative of further aftermarket revenues to come as we are successful in our entry into service or on the commercial aircraft and as the military ramps up over the next several years on some of the key programs that we're on. And so we have a lot of very high expectations for our performance and our growth there in Aerospace. And it's been key to our successful FY '16 and key to our guidance in FY '17, too. So I hope that gives you some color there, Andy."

We appreciate your participation this morning. 
Today, I’d like to cover I'd like to cover the following key topics: our fourth quarter results, review our fiscal year 2017 guidance; and finally, I'll highlight the progress we are making with the new Win Strategy. 
Let me start with the fourth quarter and full year results, which demonstrate the progress we are making in a difficult growth environment. Fourth quarter sales were $2.96 billion or a 6% decline compared with the same quarter a year ago. This represents the second consecutive quarter that we saw sequential improvement in sales and a decelerating rate of decline in sales on a year-over-year basis. 
Total order rates for the fourth quarter declined 1% compared with the same quarter last year and represented a sequential improvement from the third quarter level.
By segment, North America is still week, but our Aerospace Systems segment and International business order rates were positive on a year-over-year basis. Net income for the fourth quarter increased 35% to $242 million on an as-reported basis or 29% increase to $260 million on an adjusted basis. 
Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.77 as reported or $1.90 on an adjusted basis. That represents a 33% increase compared to the same quarter last year on an adjusted basis. 
Despite ongoing weakness in our end markets this quarter, we were able to achieve total segment operating margins of 14.8% or 15.6% adjusted. This is tremendous performance that represents a 70 basis point improvement year-over-year in adjusted segment operating margins. 
Our adjusted decremental MROS was 2.9% for the fourth quarter. This is the sixth consecutive quarter that our adjusted decrementals have been below 25%, which is the best level performance I can remember in any previous downturn. 
Just a few other full year highlights that I'd like to note. Cash flow was strong in the quarter and also the year, with cash flow from operations, excluding the discretionary pension contribution, exceeding 12% of sales, reflecting the stability of our cash generation during the downturn. We also held inventories as a percent of sales essentially flat at 10.3% in fiscal 2016 versus 10.2% in the prior year. We executed very efficiently on the $109 million worth of business realignment. Even including this restructuring, our as-reported decremental MROS was 19.5% for the full year. And notably, we accomplished all this while sales dropped $1.35 billion, which is very difficult to do. 
Moving on to capital allocation. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $108 million of Parker shares, bringing our total share repurchases for the fiscal year to $558 million. So we have now purchased $1.9 billion of Parker shares since our share repurchase plan was announced in October 2014. We are on track to meet our commitments on capital deployment. Regarding FY '17 guidance, we are forecasting a year of sales being flat compared with fiscal 2016. Our expectations that organic growth will be soft in the first quarter, becoming essentially flat in quarter 2, with the second half showing 1% to 2% organic growth on a year-over-year basis. 
For fiscal year 2017, we're issuing guidance for as-reported earnings in the range of $6.15 to $6.85 per share or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $6.40 to $7.10 for a midpoint of $6.75. 
Business realignment expenses are anticipated to be approximately $48 million or $0.25 per share. 
So now just a few comments about our progress with the Win Strategy. We continue to make meaningful progress with initiatives across 4 broad goals: engage people, premier customer experience, profitable growth and financial performance. 
Regarding our first goal, engage people. During this past year, we saw a 33% reduction in recordable injuries. We continue to target a 0 accident safety goal, not only because it's our responsibility to our team members, but also because improved safety performance can be a leading indicator of improved financial performance. Our high-performance teams are driving this improvement in safety as well as quality, cost and delivery. 
Now on the second goal, premier customer experience. On July 1 of this year, we launched our likely to recommend initiative, which is designed to get direct feedback from customers and distributors on areas where we can improve. Importantly, we're gathering this feedback in a way that every site at Parker can understand and track their performance and make improvements. This is a significant initiative because a better customer experience will drive fast organic growth for Parker. 
We're also making good progress in building our e-business capabilities and to deliver best-in-class online experience for customers. And we are making progress developing our pipeline of Internet of Things applications across groups and product lines to enhance the value we bring to customers. 
Now moving to the third goal, profitable growth. We continue to drive innovative products and systems, expand distribution and build our service business as part of our sales growth strategy. Acquisitions will play a role in our growth plans. We recently closed a transaction in Europe to acquire certain businesses of the Jäger Group to strengthen our position in worldwide sealing markets as part of our Engineered Materials Group. 
And lastly, our financial performance goal. Profitability in Aerospace is improving as we benefit from lower nonrecurring engineering costs that were associated with some of the large program wins that we had and improved operational efficiencies. Our simplification initiative is also gaining momentum across the company as we discover more ways to streamline operations and better serve our customers. The best way to illustrate this is to look at our employment trends. The total number of Parker team members employed at the end of FY '16 is at 2004 levels or approximately 48,000 people. In fiscal 2004, our reported sales were $6.9 billion, whereas today, our sales are $11.3 billion with the same number of team members. This is a tribute to our global team members who are working together to find better and more efficient ways to accomplish their jobs and serve our customers. The combination of our simplification and lean enterprise initiatives is amplifying our ability to improve processes and make significant structural cost improvements. In addition, our strategic supply chain and value pricing initiatives give us sufficient horsepower to propel us to our profit margin goals in the future. 
So in summary, by executing the new Win Strategy, we are confident we will achieve our key financial objectives by the end of fiscal 2020, and this includes targeting sales growth of 150 basis points higher than the rate of global industrial production. We're also targeting 17% segment operating margins, and progress towards these goals is expected to drive a compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this 5-year period. I am very pleased with how far we've come in such a short period of time and continue to be excited about the opportunities we have for the future as we strive to make Parker a top-quartile performing company as compared to our proxy peers. 
So for now, I'm going to hand things back to Jon, let him give you more details on the quarter, the full year and 2017 guidance."

And at this time, please refer to Slide #6. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.90 versus $1.43 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of",2176,"Thank you, Tom. And at this time, please refer to Slide #6. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.90 versus $1.43 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of $0.47. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.13 and compares to -- which compares to $0.16 for the same quarter last year. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2016 were $6.46 versus $7.25 for the full year 2015. Total realignment expenses and pension termination costs were $0.57 for the full year 2016, and that compares to adjustments for business realignment and voluntary retirement expenses of $0.28 for the full year 2015.
On Slide #7, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.43 for the fourth quarter 2015 to $1.90 for the fourth quarter of this year. Increases to adjusted per-share income include a reduction of corporate G&A, interest and other expense equating to $0.14 per share, which is a result of savings realized from FY '16 simplification efforts, as Tom just mentioned; one-time credits booked in Q4 FY '16; and the comparison to a higher expense in Q4 '15 from early retirement expenses incurred; and a lower effective tax rate in FY '16 of 28% versus 40.9% in Q4 of '15. This all contributed to $0.30 per share. The impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the company share repurchase activity equated to an increase of $0.05 per share. A reduction of $0.02 in adjusted per share income was a result of lower adjusted segment operating income, which is driven by the strengthened U.S. dollar currency translation and weakened end markets, which approximates a little bit more than $200 million quarter-to-quarter. 
On Slide #8, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $7.25 for the full year 2015 to $6.46 for the full year 2016. For the full year 2016, increases to adjusted earnings per share include reduced corporate G&A expense equating to $0.20 per share; $0.13 per share due to a lower effective tax rate of 27.6% in FY '16 versus 29.3% in FY '15, which is due to favorable discrete benefits booked during FY '16; and $0.36 from fewer shares outstanding reflecting the full year impact of Parker's enhanced share repurchase program. Decreases to adjusted earnings per share for FY '16 were lower segment operating income of $1 per share due to the impact of the weakened end markets and higher interest and other expense equating to $0.48 per share, which compares to a sizable onetime favorable currency adjustment recognized at FY '15 and the full year impact of interest expense on incremental debt issued in November of 2014. 
Moving to Slide #9. With a review of the total company sales and segment operating margins for the fourth quarter and full year, total company organic sales in the fourth quarter decreased by 5.3% over the same quarter last year. There was minimal contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact as a percentage of sales was slightly higher than our guide, equating to a negative impact on reported sales of $31 million or 1% in the quarter. 
Total segment operating margin for the fourth quarter adjustment for realignment costs incurred in the quarter was 15.6% versus 14.9% for the same quarter last year. Business realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $25 million versus $27 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $462 million versus $468 million last year reflects the meaningful impact of the weakened industrial end markets, partially offset by the savings realized from our very large simplification and restructuring actions taken throughout the year. 
For the full year, organic sales in fiscal year '17 decreased by 7.7%. Contributions to sales from acquisitions were minimal. The effect of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $404 million or 3.2% of sales for the full year. 
Total company segment operating margin for fiscal year '16, adjusted for realignment costs incurred during the year, was 14.8% versus 14.9% in fiscal year '15. Business realignment expenses incurred in FY '16 was $107 million. 
Slide #10 discusses the business segments, and I'll start first with the Diversified Industrial North America segment. For the fourth quarter, North American organic sales decreased by 10.3% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was a nominal impact from acquisitions and a negative impact from currency of 0.6% in the quarter. Operating margin for the fourth quarter adjusted for realignment costs was 18% of sales versus 17.3% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $5 million as compared to $15 million in the same prior year. Adjusted operating income was $226 million as compared to $244 million, which is driven by the reduced volume as a result of the key industrial weak markets. 
For the full year, organic sales for the fiscal year 2016 decreased by 12.4%. Contributions to sales from acquisitions were minimal. The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $60 million or 1% of sales for the full year. For the full year 2016, operating margin adjusted for realignment costs was 16.8% of sales versus 17% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $42 million as compared to $16 million and -- at fiscal '15. Adjusted operating income for fiscal '16 was $832 million as compared to $972 million in the prior year. 
Now turning to Slide #11. I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segments. Organic sales for the Diversified Industrial International segment, organic sales for the fourth quarter in the segment decreased by 3%. Currency translation negatively impacted sales by 2%. Operating margin for the fourth quarter adjusted for business realignment costs was 12.6% of sales versus 10.9% in the prior year. Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $18 million as compared to $6 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $137 million as compared to $124 million, which, despite the weakened top line, reflects the offsetting savings resulting from realignment actions taken in the current year as well as the prior fiscal years. 
For the full year, organic sales for fiscal year '16 decreased by 6%. The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in a negative impact to reported sales of $339 million or negative 7.1% of sales for the year. For the full year 2016, operating margin adjusted for realignment costs was 12.3% of sales versus 12.9% in the prior year. Restructuring expenses totaled $61 million as compared to $27 million in fiscal '15. Adjusted operating income for fiscal '16 was $509 million as compared to $611 million last year. 
And I'll now move to Slide #12 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues increased 2.2% for the quarter. Neither acquisitions nor currency really impacted revenues. Strong growth in military OEM and military aftermarket sales were the drivers for the quarterly performance. Operating margin for the fourth quarter adjusted for realignment costs was 16.4% of sales versus 16.9% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $1 million as compared to $6 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was flat at $99 million for both Q4 '16 and the prior year, reflecting the impact of the reduced commercial sales volume in the quarter, albeit partially offset by reduced development costs as a percentage of sales. 
For the full year, organic sales for fiscal year '16 increased by 0.5% of sales. For the full year '16, operating margin adjusted for realignment costs was 15.1% of sales versus 13.5% in the prior year. Business realignment expenses incurred totaled $4 million as compared to $6 million related in the prior year. And adjusted operating income for the fiscal year was $341 million as compared to $305 million last year, which was largely attributed to the reduction of development costs to slightly less than 8% of sales, together with the savings from the business realignment activities. 
Going to Slide #13. Moving to that slide is a detail of our orders changes by segment. As a reminder, our orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a 3-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. 
Total orders improved to a negative 1% for the quarter-end, reflecting a decelerating rate of decline in key industrial end markets, including oil and gas, construction and agriculture. Diversified Industrial North America orders decreased to a negative 10%. Diversified Industrial International orders improved to a positive 3% for the quarter. Aerospace System orders increased to plus 14% for the quarter. 
Looking at Slide #14. On -- we report the cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter cash from our sales, which compares to 16.2% of sales for the same period last year. For the full year, cash flow from operating activities for fiscal '16 was $1,170,000,000 or 10.3% of sales as compared to 10.2% last year. When adjusted for that $200 million voluntary pension contribution made during the year, adjusted cash flow from operating activities was $1,370,000,000 or 12.1% of sales as compared to 2 -- 10.2% in fiscal '15. There was no pension contribution made during FY '15. The significant uses of cash during the year included $558 million for the company's repurchase of common shares and $342 million for the payment of shareholders' dividends. And there was $149 million for CapEx equating to 1.3% of sales for FY '16. 
Now turning to guidance for FY '17. Full year earnings guidance for FY '17 is outlined here. Guidance is provided on an adjusted basis. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of $48 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY 2017. Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 1.5% to positive 2.1% as compared to the prior year. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is flat. Currency in the guidance is not forecasted to impact sales. We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of June 30, 2016, and we hold those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming FY '17. 
Total Parker adjusted segment operating margin's forecast to be between 15.2% and 15.6%. This compares to 14.8% for FY '16 on an adjusted basis. The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate G&A, interest and other expense, is $469 million for the year at the midpoint. The full year tax rate is projected at 29%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full year guidance is 135.5 million. And for the full year guidance on an adjusted earnings per share is $6.40 to $7.10 or $6.75 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $48 million to be included in FY '17. This is the only adjustments that we make to our guidance. It's just realignment expenses. The effect of this restructuring on EPS is approximately $0.25 savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected to be $30 million on our fully reflected in the adjusted operating margin guidance range. 
Some additional key assumptions for the fiscal year guidance are: sales are divided 48% first half, 52% second half, which is a normal distribution of a split for a year for us; adjusted segment operating income is divided 46% in the first half, 54% in the second half; EPS in the first half versus the second half is $2.93 and $3.82 for the second half; Q1 FY '17 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.52 at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.09 of business realignment expenses. 
On Slide #16, just some influences on EPS for '17 as compared to '16. On Slide 16, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of FY '17 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.75 per share at the midpoint from the prior FY '16 EPS of $6.46 per share. Increases include $0.40 from an increased segment operating income and $0.11 from fewer shares outstanding and reduced interest expense. Key components of the decrease, including $0.13 per share reduction from taxes, reflecting a rate from continuing operations of 29% and $0.09 per share reduction from increased corporate G&A and other expenses as a result of normalized levels, not including onetime favorable settlements realized in the prior year, primarily in Q4, in part by reduced pension expense due to the company's adoption of the spot rate methodology for calculating annual pension expense. This has a total impact of $0.11 for FY '17. 
Please remember that the forecast excludes any acquisition and divestitures that might close during FY '17. For consistency, we ask that you exclude only the restructuring expenses from your published estimates. This concludes my prepared remarks. 
Tom, I'll turn the call back over to you for your summary comments."

So I'm trying to bridge that with your sales guidance in North America, which seems more optimistic. And then at the same time, on a down sales year-over-year, you're expecting margin improvement on an adjusted basis. So if you could address those issues, I'd appreciate it."

Let me just -- the topics are kind of interwoven, so I'll start with the guide, what was behind it. And I'll start with, in case those of you that were on the phone didn't hear my opening comments, this is going to be a year of sale",638,"Okay, Jamie. It's Tom. Let me just -- the topics are kind of interwoven, so I'll start with the guide, what was behind it. And I'll start with, in case those of you that were on the phone didn't hear my opening comments, this is going to be a year of sales leveling off, which, after the sharp reduction that we had last year, is going to be a very refreshing change for all of our people around the world. But the way we forecast this is Q1's going to be soft, moving to essentially flat in Q2 with 1% to 2% sales growth in the second half. So our thoughts behind the numbers, the natural resource related end-markets, so construction, ag, mining and oil and gas, are moderating. And now they're continuing -- going to continue to be year-over-year when we finish '17 negative, but they're going to get to be less and less of a drag, especially in the second half. When you look at order entries that we had in Q4, in particular, what drove our thoughts within international is that we had a positive international of plus 3%. And that was made up of Europe being basically flat, minus 1% in that area; Asia, plus 6%; and Latin America, plus 19%. So what's really driving our international sales forecast is a forecast of Europe being relatively flat and Asia Pacific and Latin America being up a little bit, driving an international forecast of plus 2%. 
Now you talked about North America. Now what we saw in Q4, I would characterize as continued choppiness around what we saw from Q3 to Q4. I mean, during the quarter, people started off a little bit softer than we would have liked, and then May and June were a little bit better. What we're seeing for North America for the full year, to give you some context as to the negative 3% that we have out there, is that we have a first half of minus 5% and a second half of minus 1%. And what's driving that is, if you look at the natural resource related end-markets that I've described, they really bottomed in North America in our second half of the year. So we're not really anticipating any new catalyst, any new activity that's going to drive growth or sustainability beyond our current levels for natural resources. But what you're seeing in North America is easier comps in the second half. And we do have growth in North America in non-natural resource related markets, like machine tools, telecom, Life Sciences, turf, refrigeration that is going to now help to offset some of that. Not completely, because we'll still end North America at a minus 3%. 
Now if I could, I'm just going to give you context, our view for the total end markets for the whole fiscal '17. And I want to put an asterisk by this. I'm not trying to describe the entire end market. I'm just trying to describe our performance in that end market. So just -- I have them in 3 buckets: positive, neutral, negative. 
So on the positive side, what makes up our forecast is Aerospace, lawn and turf, passenger rail, refrigeration and air-conditioning, semicon and telecom. And the neutral areas, automotive, distribution and Life Sciences and power generation. Now of significance is the distribution in neutral, and although that's not a new market, it's a big channel for us. And the fact that distribution moves to neutral helps the year stabilize quite a bit. And then on our negative is construction, farm and ag, forestry, general industrial, heavy-duty truck, marine, mining and oil and gas. So that's the landscape, and I probably gave you more than you wanted to know. But that's our -- that's what we think for '17."

But what gives us confidence is when you look at the non-natural resource-related end markets in Q4, those saw anywhere from flat to a plus 15%. So distribution being up mid-single digits, which is a big part of North America, machine tools, telecom, life sciences, turf, refrigeration has been very -- and air-conditioning is very strong for us and automotive about flat, slightly positive. So that was really the mix that felt -- that's good about the North America forecast. The other part is that we do know that the natural resource comps in those particular markets gets much easier in the second half, which is why our first quarter for North America, we're not anticipating anything much differently than what we saw in the current quarter, maybe a hair better, but because the comps get easier in the second half is why we forecasted a better comp in the second half."

Our pension expense for next year, as I tried to mention in my comments, was going to be impacted positively in total, altogether, by $0.11 impacting FY '17 due to the spot rate methodology that we've adopted as well as many other puts and takes that go into making that -- making those estimates and doing the accounting for that. So the CapEx of 2%, we never forecast acquisitions, of course. And from a pension expense standpoint, it's quite possible that we would have a normal contribution there. And that's about what I can give you right now. Is there any more color that you would want at this point?"

Our inventories are with a -- with this kind of a decline in sales, are at a historic low as a percent of sales. We expect our ability to manage through inventories to more than offset the drag that we might have from the AR as our Q4 shows a little bit better. Our funded status right now for our pension plans is at 65%, which is a little bit lower than we would want it to be. And that's pure assets to liabilities. Of course, regulatorily, we're well over 100% required. But there would be an argument to make that from a voluntary contribution standpoint, that it would make sense given our assets and liability funded status at 64 -- 65% right now."

We only have one more quarter left in the share repurchase plan. It was October to October, '14 to '16. So we'll come in at the $2 billion level of that range that we said. And what's really kind of the factors that we have considered with that is that 99% of our cash is permanently invested overseas. We do have a desire to maintain that A rating. And we're -- our debt-to-total cap is around almost 40%. And when we started the program, we were a $13 billion company and now we're $11.4 billion. Now we're very proud of the double-digit cash flow that we've been able to generate, but it's double digits off of a smaller number. So that's what is kind of framing why we're going to come in at the low end of the range. Now going forward, our desire -- let me first state that we want to be great generators of cash, and I think we've done a great job there. We're going to continue to do an even better job. And we want to be known as a company that really spins off a lot of cash. On the flip side, we want to be known as a company that deploys it very effectively on behalf of the shareholders. And you've heard me say this before, but those maybe who've not, I'll repeat it. First and foremost, as far as our priorities is to continue our dividend track record. Then we're going to fund organic growth because it's the most efficient growth that you can fund. And then really it's a dynamic review on a case-by-case basis between share repurchase and acquisitions and really with the goal of generating the best long-term value for our shareholders. On the share repurchase, you won't see us do another announcement type of process. I think what's better for shareholders is to be active, to have a muscular balance sheet, but to tell you after the fact because when we announce in advance, we're buying into our own wind, and I don't think that helps shareholders. I think we want to do it after the fact. That's the most effective way to use our cash and to help shareholders. Regarding acquisitions, the pipeline is active, but I talked last quarter -- and evaluations continue to be, I would call it, historically high. And -- but I do think time is on our side here because we buy properties in spaces that we understand, so we understand the growth rates. I think sellers' expectations on growth rates is going to start to temper as they recognize that this is -- that the growth rates that they think their business is going to do is not going to actually come to fruition. And I think you'll see our pipeline become more actionable. We've always been disciplined buyers. We'll always be able to -- we'll always continue to buy properties we know we can deliver on for our shareholders. So we'll look at all that. And again, the goal is to have a muscular balance sheet and do what's best for our shareholders."

We started to see some signs of life in mobile construction, in particular, India and Japan. But the good thing is Japan -- China has finally flattened out, and we actually saw some new incremental orders in China. And we have all the countries across Asia growing with the exception of Korea. And Korea just has a little more exposure to some of those global OEMs. So that will start to recover as well.

I think there's really been great momentum for us across the company on simplification. And again, I mentioned in my opening comments the combination of putting simplification with our lean enterprise efforts is really giving us an amplification of being able to look at cost and processes differently than maybe we have in the past. But as I've mentioned before, and I'll kind of give you some comments as to where I think we can go on these. There's 4 big areas that we are focused on. The first is that whole revenue complexity or maybe another way of saying it is that product line simplification, that tail of revenue at the last couple percent of revenue. We are in very early days in that. That is probably our biggest opportunity going forward. And that will be a multiyear journey as we continue to find more efficient ways to service that tail, take care of our customers, work on the SG&A, the speed at which we can handle those type of orders, speed at which we can service customers. A lot of organization design activity will happen related to that. So that will be a net win for our customers as well as us. But very early days in that. That's the harder part because there's thousands and thousands of partners to go through. That's the more complicated part of it. We've done a lot of work organizationally and process-wise. That's the second bullet. And I still see lots of opportunities there. I think you'll see a focus on number of levels within the company, span of controls, just putting together an organizational design that is the most effective design for our customers and for our people. On the division consolidations, I think we have taken a pretty big step already on that piece. We went from 28 -- we had 28 divisions, so basically 1/4 of all of our divisions going through some kind of consolidation down to 14. So that dropped our total count of divisions from 1 -- 115 to 101. Lee is working with the presidents on that. And we don't have anything to announce because in fairness to our people, we would not announce that in a public forum like this. But we've already taken a big step there. I think you'll see just more fine-tuning on that as we go. And then on bureaucracy, there's lots and lots of opportunities within the company. The whole annual plan process that we redid was a huge upside for people as far as being able to free up their time to do other things. So I would say we're very pleased with where we've come so far, but there's a lot more to go on that. And then if you have anything else, Steve, I'd be happy to answer any more."

Of course, those are lumpy and they can come sporadically. And so that's really the driver there, Andy. Now from a -- breaking those numbers down a little bit in terms of the sales, we are basically essentially flat in the commercial market. That's being kind of impacted by the ability for us to be in a position where our biz jet reduction is being overcome by our normal commercial increase. There's not been a significant change in the aftermarket there, and it's been basically flat for us. From a military standpoint, both OE and commercial, that has been up low double digits for us in the quarter. And that would be reflected not only in our sales but in our orders. And again, all of these data that I give to you, it tends to be -- because it's such a long-term business, tends to be very lumpy. Our perfect world, we would be 50% commercial, 50% military. We're not now. I mean, we are 65% commercial and the balance military right now. And in a perfect world, we'll be 50-50 OEM versus aftermarket, and we're at 66% OEM right now. So that would be indicative of further aftermarket revenues to come as we are successful in our entry into service or on the commercial aircraft and as the military ramps up over the next several years on some of the key programs that we're on. And so we have a lot of very high expectations for our performance and our growth there in Aerospace. And it's been key to our successful FY '16 and key to our guidance in FY '17, too.

I think that it is a reflection of our ability to implement lean. There is an uptick and of course, the incremental returns that we're going to get because, as Tom and Lee have kind of described, we're going to see an upturn in sequential revenues as the year goes on, especially in Industrial International. That's our best estimate right now. And so we will see some marginal returns there. That 20% number, it seems, off the top of my head, reasonable. But I don't want to give you the impression that there's not also a lot of favorable disposition in our international industrial margins because of our ability to continue to penetrate markets, gain market share and grow in ways that are really quite favorable for the company here and helping us with our guidance in '17.

We appreciate your participation this morning. Today, I'd like to share highlights of our first quarter results, comment on our fiscal year 2017 guidance and finally, share progress we are making with th",772,"Thanks, Jon, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation this morning. 
Today, I'd like to share highlights of our first quarter results, comment on our fiscal year 2017 guidance and finally, share progress we are making with the new Win Strategy. 
Before I get into the financial highlights of the quarter, I'd first like to talk about safety. Keeping people safe is our first priority, and as such, we start our meetings at Parker with a discussion on safety. So I thought I'd start our earnings call with safety as well. 
During the first quarter of 2017, we were able to reduce our recordable injuries by 35% compared to the prior year. This builds upon a 33% year-over-year improvement we posted comparing 2016 versus 2015. Naturally, we have a long way to go to reach our goal of 0 accidents, but I'm very pleased with the progress we are making. Safety is important because not only does it protect our people, but also because great safety performance typically leads to great financial performance. 
Now to the financial highlights of our first quarter results. First quarter sales were $2.74 billion, a 4% decline compared with the same quarter a year ago. This represents the third consecutive quarter we saw a decelerating rate of decline in sales on a year-over-year basis. Nearly all the decline in sales this quarter was organic. 
Total order rates for the first quarter increased 2% compared with the same quarter last year on easier comparisons. This represented the first quarterly increase in orders since December 2014. By segment, North America is still weak but slowly recovering, and our Aerospace Systems segment and international business order rates were positive. These order rates reinforce our previously communicated view that we are progressing towards stabilization in many of our key markets. However, we will continue to monitor order trends closely to ensure that this outlook is holding up.
Net income for the first quarter increased 8% to $210 million on an as-reported basis or $280 million on an adjusted basis. Earnings per share were $1.55 as-reported or $1.61 on an adjusted basis, a 6% increase in adjusted earnings per share compared with the same quarter last year. Despite soft market conditions, we're able to achieve total segment operating margins of 15.0% or 15.4% adjusted. This is another quarter of solid performance and represents a 10 basis point improvement year-over-year in adjusted segment operating margins.
Our decremental marginal return on sales or MROS was 3.9% in the first quarter or 12.7% on an adjusted basis. This really is outstanding performance and marks the seventh consecutive quarter that our adjusted decrementals have been below 30%. It was another strong quarter for cash flow. Cash flow from operations, excluding a discretionary pension contribution, was 12% of sales, reflecting our ability to be a consistent generator of cash through economic cycles.
During the quarter, we repurchased $115 million of Parker stock. This completes the previously announced commitment to buy back a minimum of $2 billion in Parker shares by October 2016. Going forward, our plan is to be a great generator of cash and a great deployer of cash in a way that generates increased long-term returns for our shareholders. 
Now regarding FY '17 guidance. We continue to forecast a year of flat sales compared with 2016. For 2017, we are maintaining guidance for as-reported earnings in the range of $6.15 to $6.85 per share or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $6.40 to $7.10 or a midpoint of $6.75. Business realignment expenses are still anticipated to be approximately $0.25 per share in fiscal 2017. 
So now just a few comments about our progress with the Win Strategy. We continue to make meaningful progress across initiatives across 4 broad goals: engage people, premier customer experience, profitable growth and financial performance. Our ongoing execution of the new Win Strategy through its first full year of implementation gives me even more confidence that we can achieve our key financial objectives by the end of fiscal 2020, which includes targeted sales growth of 150 basis points, higher than the rate of global industrial production. We are also targeting 17% segment operating margins. And progress towards these goals is expected to drive a compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this 5-year period.
These performance targets will allow us to deliver sustainable long-term value for Parker team members, our customers and our shareholders. 
I'll now hand things back to Jon to review more details in the quarter and fiscal 2017 guidance."

And at this time, please refer to Slide #5. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.61 versus $1.52 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase",1463,"Thanks, Tom. And at this time, please refer to Slide #5. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.61 versus $1.52 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of $0.09. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.06, which compares to $0.11 for the same quarter last year.
On Slide #6, we review the influences on the adjusted earnings per share for Q1 versus Q1 of FY '16. We had earnings per share of $1.52 for the first quarter FY '16 and $1.61 for first quarter of this year. Increases to adjusted earnings per share include: a reduction of corporate G&A expense, which totaled $0.11 per share; a lower effective tax rate of 28.1% versus 29.2% in Q1 of FY '16; lower interest expense; and the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the company's share repurchase activity, which equated to an increase of $0.07 per share. A reduction of $0.08 per share in income was a result of lower adjusted segment operating income, driven by weakened end market top line demand as projected, while higher other expense equated to a reduction of $0.01 per share. 
Moving to Slide #7 with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the first quarter. Total company organic sales in the first quarter decreased by 4.6% over the same quarter last year. There was nominal contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions and minimal currency impact. 
Total company segment operating margins for the first quarter, adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter, was 15.4% versus 15.3% for the same quarter last year.
Business realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $11 million versus $22 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $422 million versus $438 million last year reflects the impact of the weakened industrial end markets, partially offset by the savings realized from the company's simplification and restructuring actions.
Moving to Slide #8. I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the first quarter, North America organic sales decreased by 9% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was no impact from acquisitions and nominal impact from currency in the quarter. 
Operating margin for the first quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 17.5% of sales versus 17.2% in the prior year. Business realignment expense incurred totaled $4 million as compared to $8 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $205 million as compared to $221 million, driven by the reduced volume as a result of those same key industrial end markets.
I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on Slide # sales -- Slide #9. Organic sales for the first quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 3.2%. Acquisitions positively impacted sales by 0.9%, while there was no impact from currency. Operating margin for the first quarter, adjusted for business realignment costs, was 14.2% of sales versus 13.6% in the prior year. 
Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $7 million as compared to $12 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $144 million as compared to $141 million, which, despite the weakened top line, reflects the offsetting savings resulting from the realignment actions taken in the current and prior fiscal years.
I'll now move to Slide #10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues increased 3.1% for the quarter. Neither acquisitions nor currency impacted revenues. Growth in military OEM, commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket sales were the drivers for the quarterly performance as compared to the prior year. Operating margin for the first quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 13.1% of sales versus 13.9% in the prior year. No business realignment expenses were incurred in the quarter compared to $2 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $73 million as compared to $76 million, reflecting the timing impact of higher development costs during the quarter.
Moving to Slide #11 with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a 3-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. 
Total orders improved to positive 2% for the quarter-end, reflecting easing year-ago comparisons and a decelerating rate of decline in key industrial end markets. Diversified Industrial North America orders decreased year-over-year to negative 4%. Diversified Industrial International orders increased modestly year-over-year to a positive 3%, and Aerospace Systems orders increased year-over-year to a positive 14%.
On Slide #12, we report cash flow from operations. For the first quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $114 million or 4.2% of sales. This compares to 0.7% of sales for the same period last year. When adjusted for the $220 million discretionary pension contribution we made in the quarter, cash from operating activities was 12.2% of sales. This compares to 7.7% of sales for the same period last year, adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made last year. 
The significant uses of cash during the quarter were the $220 million for the discretionary pension plan contribution, $115 million for the company's repurchase of common shares and $85 million for the payment of shareholder dividends. $33 million for CapEx, equating to 1.2% of sales for the quarter, is also called out.
Turning to Slide #13. The full year earnings guidance for '17 is outlined. The guidance is being provided on both an as-reported and an adjusted basis. Adjusted segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of $48 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY '17. This is the only item for which we are adjusting.
Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 1.5% to 2.1% as compared to the prior year. Organic growth at the midpoint is nearly flat. Acquisitions in the guidance are expected to positively impact sales by 0.4%. Currency in the guidance is expected to have a modestly positive 0.3% impact on sales. We've calculated the impact on currency to spot rates as of September 30, 2016, and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming balance of FY '17.
For total Parker, as-reported segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.8% and 15.2%, while adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be 15.2% -- to be between 15.2% and 15.6%. The guided midpoint on each range compares favorably to FY '16 margins, 13.9% on an as-reported basis and 14.8% on an adjusted basis in FY '16. 
The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate G&A, interest and other expense, is $478 million for the year at the midpoint. The full year tax rate is projected at 28.5%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full year guidance is 135.5 million. 
For the full year, the guidance range on an as-reported earnings per share basis is $6.15 to $6.85 or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted earnings per share basis, the guidance range is $6.40 to $7.10 or $6.75 at the midpoint. This as-reported EPS guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $48 million to be incurred in FY '17. The effect of this restructuring on EPS is approximately $0.25. Savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected to be $30 million and are fully reflected in both the as-reported and the adjusted operating margin guidance ranges.
We would ask that you continue to publish your estimates using adjusted guidance for purposes of representing a more consistent year-over-year comparison. 
Some additional key assumptions for fiscal year 2017 guidance are: sales divided 48% first half, 52% second half; adjusted segment operating income is divided 45% first half, 55% second half; EPS first half is $2.96 and $3.79 at the midpoint, that's first half versus second half; and Q2 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.36 per share at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.10 of business realignment expenses expected to be incurred in our Q2.
On Slide 14, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of FY '17 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.75 per share at the midpoint from prior FY '17 EPS of $6.75 per share. Increases include $0.05 from lower corporate G&A and $0.05 from the lower tax rate. The key component of the decrease includes a $0.10 per share reduction from higher other and interest expense. Please remember that this forecast excludes any acquisitions and divestitures that might close during FY '17. 
This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I'll turn the call back over to you for your summary comments."

So we obviously look at both of those all the time on a dynamic basis with the goal of making the best long-term value-creation decision for our shareholders. So I would characterize the pipeline right now, as far as acquisitions, being fairly active. As always, acquisitions are lumpy and hard to predict as far as the output. And I think what is normally -- what historically, the last couple of years, has slowed us down as far as converting more acquisitions has been the price valuation gap. And what we're seeing now, and I would hope over the next couple of years, we'll continue to see this even more, is I think sellers' expectation is coming closer to reality. And I think that price gap that we experienced will become closer, and I think properties will become more actionable. So we will continue to look at share repurchase and acquisitions and make the best decision every quarter on behalf of our shareholders. On the share repurchase, just as opposed to preannouncing, we'll continue to be active. And as I've said before on these calls, what we'll do is we'll communicate after the fact. We think that's the best value creation for our shareholders. We won't be buying into our own wind. And you'll see us be active. Like I mentioned in my opening comments, our goal is to be great generators of cash, and we'll continue to be even better at that. But we want to be great deployers of cash and put it to work. Now the $2 billion that you mentioned, Nathan, that's sitting there are just for order buying. [ph] I think most people realize this, is that 99% of that is permanently invested overseas. And so there's certain constraints or factors that you've got to weigh when you think about how to deploy that and try to deploy that in the most tax-efficient manner on the benefit of our shareholders. So we'll look at that. We obviously want to put it to work, but there's factors yet to consider on the cash that's sitting overseas."

One, Tom or Jon, I'm just trying to get, one, get a better understanding of the margin guidance in international given the performance that you put up in the first quarter, given the sales -- given that you actually had a sales decline and your sales for the year assuming positive growth. So I would assume you would get more leverage there, so if you could just give a little color there. And  then my second question is just on the order front. I guess I was pleasantly surprised that North American declines are lessening, and we saw another positive order number out of international on a tougher comp. So can you give a sense of your comfort level that the OE channel is clear or when North American orders should start to inflect positively? Is that in the second half of the year? And then whether you expect the strength in international to continue or when that starts to inflect even better."

I'm going to answer your question and pivot on that, too, and give some color on the markets around the world. I think it's important, too, for just everybody the call to just go back a quarter and how we characterized the macro environment as we gave guidance in FY '17. And what we talked about was basically, we figured this to be a year where most of our markets, declines that we saw would decelerate and eventually make it back or closer to flat. And we forecasted growth to be soft in Q1, as you remember, essentially flat in Q2. And then we'd see some small organic growth in year-over-year basis in the second half of the year. When we gave guidance last quarter, we put the markets in 3 buckets: positive, which would be positive year-over-year growth for our FY '17; neutral and then -- which would be neutral; and then negative. So there really hasn't been much change from any of that. When I think about positive, we're still bullish on Aerospace. We talked about refrigeration, air-conditioning, Semicon and telecom. We continue to see strong activity in all those areas. On a neutral front, we talked about automotive, we talked about power generation and rail. And I think the one thing that we talked about, which it really was a positive in our mind that we saw distribution moving to neutral. And what we see, we're on track to do that. And I'll comment on North America, too, for you when I get there. And the negative year-over-year, which is consistent, it's decelerating for sure. But whole natural resource end markets construction, farm and ag, forestry, marine, mining, oil and gas, all have still have headwinds to them and then heavy-duty truck, which we talked about. So having said that, the organic growth for the quarter really largely moves in the direction as we expected from the last call. Just touching on North America and distribution. We saw it's down low single digits. It's really in line with the expectation that we saw. It's definitely regional. Those people impacted by natural resource end markets are still suffering, and there's still some tough comps, if you remember back Q1 last year this time for some of these people. What I was encouraged about is roughly every 4 years, we hold a channel meeting in North America with our fluid power channel. And I just came back from a meeting with 400 principals representing this channel across North America. And I have to tell you, I spent 2 days just going from top to bottom networking with everybody there. And I left mildly encouraged, certainly not depressed, about prospects moving forward. As you would expect, areas like the Great Lakes regions are having positive year-over-year growth. People in the oil patch are still suffering. But it's not that accelerating rate of decline. There's more talk about some positive trends, positively happening here in FY '17, so that was good. If I talk about industrial markets in North America, you have to talk about oil & gas, and I would say major OEMs continue to indicate no significant investment, but you do get a sense that there's a limit of light at the end of the tunnel, and there's some talks about some projects happening going forward. Energy markets is another one that we like. Overall, the large frame turbines was flat year-over-year, but I've talked about this in the past that we've had some good specification wins there. Our content is up, so we've seen some strong numbers from that sector for us. And then in the mobile markets in North America, we continue to see year-over-year declines in off-highway construction, equipment, off-highway farm and ag, industrial trucks, material handling and real-world equipment. I'd say one market that was a little worse than we forecasted was heavy trucks and trailers. That was a little bit of a headwind for us. And then I would say, in the automotive markets, a little worse. I'm talking about light truck there. And I think a lot of it has to do was there was some extended summer shutdowns in some of those sectors that impacted us. But when we look at it going forward, we still feel very positive about it for the year. I'm going to get to international orders, Jamie. I haven't forgotten you here. So when I talk about EMEA distribution, I would say, again, it's a same story. If you talk about oil & gas regions, it had a large negative year-over-year impact. We continue to see great growth in some of the emerging regions, but I will tell you a little bit of headwind from some of the political unrest in Turkey, which causes in the quarter. We see that coming back. And then oil & gas, still tough year-over-year comps, but we are seeing some positive activity on some project business outside of Western Europe. [indiscernible] industrial Middle East has been strong for us. There's a lot of projects going on, resolved their economic diversification efforts. We've had some great project wins there. And then in the mobile sector, we are seeing some positive news in Europe with off-highway construction equipment and heavy trucks and just getting some positive year-over-year input from our customers. So Europe, largely from an international order standpoint, largely moved in the direction that we thought it would for the quarter. For Asia Pacific, we were encouraged by another strong quarter of year-over-year entry. So it accelerated from last quarter, moved in the direction that we thought. Distribution was strong. We've got a big footprint expansion going on as part of our new Win Strategy, and we like what's happening there. And we've really seen very strong growth in India and Southeast Asia. Industrially, we were up in almost all end markets. So if I highlight machinery, power generation, semiconductor, telecom, all real positive in Asia Pacific. And then in mobile, I've highlighted this before in the past, but high-speed rail continues to be a bright spot for us through some specification wins we're doing very well there and really increases most segments in mobile, off-highway construction, again, very low levels, obviously, heavy-duty truck, farm and ag. And then Latin America and other international component, again, another second quarter of strong order entry year-over-year from an extremely depressed level, but we're encouraged by what's happening there. It's been the first positive move in some time. So when we think about countries like Brazil coming back, that's a positive for us. So international order entry accelerated and stayed relative in line with what we thought. And Europe accelerated, and Asia accelerated Latin America."

And as far as keeping it insistent, when you look at what happened to the quarter, so we met the guide at the operating income level. And the good thing about what happened in the quarter is we had slightly less sales, but we had better operating margin so we ended up delivering the operating income to our guide, which was a testament ready to the team around the world doing up in plastic job on it. We got some help below the lines with some discrete, one-off things that are not going to repeat.

And that is something that, over the next 3- or 4- or 5-year time frame, we feel very confident in saying. So I want to just caution you that to not expect a 14% increase going forward.

For us, I think the biggest poll in the tent of the sophistication is the whole revenue complexity. And when you look at our divisions and you do a histogram of their sales and you look at that last couple of percent of revenue, it has a significant, and I would underlie significant amount of partner numbers, code activity and SG&A that's tied up in a relatively small percent of revenue. Now we don't want to lock away from that revenue but the want to do it significantly more efficiently. So that's a big element. And because of the size of the company and just the share of magnitude of part numbers, that is something will take time, but it's going to be probably the biggest contributor to savings in the future on simplification. And we've just now started scratching the surface on that. Related to that is organization design and process. So as we go through that product line complexity and simplify, it's the old 80-20 type of concept, we're going to change organization design and processes associated, and then there will be speed, efficiencies, costs, et cetera and, in general, an improvement in the ability to serve customers and ease of doing business with us. That's the other big part of the simplification is to make it easier to do business with Parker. We'll look at traditional things and organization design like span of controls, number of layers, all those type of things. And we'll look at good old-fashioned we are perceived, which Lee and I have talked in the past if you were to do what you used to be called internally in the company, the black book or process, which is our annual planning process. It was a process that would take 5 months, 28 financial schedules and literally thousands and thousands of people hours tied up in that process, and we drove that down to 8 weeks, 8 schedules and significantly freed up time for people. So those are just some examples and color on that. We're early days, and I would say it's got great momentum on the company. So I'll let Lee take over tool distribution internationally."

We appreciate your participation this morning. Today, I'd like to share highlights of our first quarter results, comment on our fiscal year 2017 guidance and finally, share progress we are making with th",772,"Thanks, Jon, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation this morning. 
Today, I'd like to share highlights of our first quarter results, comment on our fiscal year 2017 guidance and finally, share progress we are making with the new Win Strategy. 
Before I get into the financial highlights of the quarter, I'd first like to talk about safety. Keeping people safe is our first priority, and as such, we start our meetings at Parker with a discussion on safety. So I thought I'd start our earnings call with safety as well. 
During the first quarter of 2017, we were able to reduce our recordable injuries by 35% compared to the prior year. This builds upon a 33% year-over-year improvement we posted comparing 2016 versus 2015. Naturally, we have a long way to go to reach our goal of 0 accidents, but I'm very pleased with the progress we are making. Safety is important because not only does it protect our people, but also because great safety performance typically leads to great financial performance. 
Now to the financial highlights of our first quarter results. First quarter sales were $2.74 billion, a 4% decline compared with the same quarter a year ago. This represents the third consecutive quarter we saw a decelerating rate of decline in sales on a year-over-year basis. Nearly all the decline in sales this quarter was organic. 
Total order rates for the first quarter increased 2% compared with the same quarter last year on easier comparisons. This represented the first quarterly increase in orders since December 2014. By segment, North America is still weak but slowly recovering, and our Aerospace Systems segment and international business order rates were positive. These order rates reinforce our previously communicated view that we are progressing towards stabilization in many of our key markets. However, we will continue to monitor order trends closely to ensure that this outlook is holding up.
Net income for the first quarter increased 8% to $210 million on an as-reported basis or $280 million on an adjusted basis. Earnings per share were $1.55 as-reported or $1.61 on an adjusted basis, a 6% increase in adjusted earnings per share compared with the same quarter last year. Despite soft market conditions, we're able to achieve total segment operating margins of 15.0% or 15.4% adjusted. This is another quarter of solid performance and represents a 10 basis point improvement year-over-year in adjusted segment operating margins.
Our decremental marginal return on sales or MROS was 3.9% in the first quarter or 12.7% on an adjusted basis. This really is outstanding performance and marks the seventh consecutive quarter that our adjusted decrementals have been below 30%. It was another strong quarter for cash flow. Cash flow from operations, excluding a discretionary pension contribution, was 12% of sales, reflecting our ability to be a consistent generator of cash through economic cycles.
During the quarter, we repurchased $115 million of Parker stock. This completes the previously announced commitment to buy back a minimum of $2 billion in Parker shares by October 2016. Going forward, our plan is to be a great generator of cash and a great deployer of cash in a way that generates increased long-term returns for our shareholders. 
Now regarding FY '17 guidance. We continue to forecast a year of flat sales compared with 2016. For 2017, we are maintaining guidance for as-reported earnings in the range of $6.15 to $6.85 per share or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $6.40 to $7.10 or a midpoint of $6.75. Business realignment expenses are still anticipated to be approximately $0.25 per share in fiscal 2017. 
So now just a few comments about our progress with the Win Strategy. We continue to make meaningful progress across initiatives across 4 broad goals: engage people, premier customer experience, profitable growth and financial performance. Our ongoing execution of the new Win Strategy through its first full year of implementation gives me even more confidence that we can achieve our key financial objectives by the end of fiscal 2020, which includes targeted sales growth of 150 basis points, higher than the rate of global industrial production. We are also targeting 17% segment operating margins. And progress towards these goals is expected to drive a compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this 5-year period.
These performance targets will allow us to deliver sustainable long-term value for Parker team members, our customers and our shareholders. 
I'll now hand things back to Jon to review more details in the quarter and fiscal 2017 guidance."

Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.61 versus $1.52 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase",1463,"Thanks, Tom. And at this time, please refer to Slide #5. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.61 versus $1.52 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of $0.09. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.06, which compares to $0.11 for the same quarter last year.
On Slide #6, we review the influences on the adjusted earnings per share for Q1 versus Q1 of FY '16. We had earnings per share of $1.52 for the first quarter FY '16 and $1.61 for first quarter of this year. Increases to adjusted earnings per share include: a reduction of corporate G&A expense, which totaled $0.11 per share; a lower effective tax rate of 28.1% versus 29.2% in Q1 of FY '16; lower interest expense; and the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the company's share repurchase activity, which equated to an increase of $0.07 per share. A reduction of $0.08 per share in income was a result of lower adjusted segment operating income, driven by weakened end market top line demand as projected, while higher other expense equated to a reduction of $0.01 per share. 
Moving to Slide #7 with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the first quarter. Total company organic sales in the first quarter decreased by 4.6% over the same quarter last year. There was nominal contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions and minimal currency impact. 
Total company segment operating margins for the first quarter, adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter, was 15.4% versus 15.3% for the same quarter last year.
Business realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $11 million versus $22 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $422 million versus $438 million last year reflects the impact of the weakened industrial end markets, partially offset by the savings realized from the company's simplification and restructuring actions.
Moving to Slide #8. I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the first quarter, North America organic sales decreased by 9% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was no impact from acquisitions and nominal impact from currency in the quarter. 
Operating margin for the first quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 17.5% of sales versus 17.2% in the prior year. Business realignment expense incurred totaled $4 million as compared to $8 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $205 million as compared to $221 million, driven by the reduced volume as a result of those same key industrial end markets.
I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on Slide # sales -- Slide #9. Organic sales for the first quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 3.2%. Acquisitions positively impacted sales by 0.9%, while there was no impact from currency. Operating margin for the first quarter, adjusted for business realignment costs, was 14.2% of sales versus 13.6% in the prior year. 
Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $7 million as compared to $12 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $144 million as compared to $141 million, which, despite the weakened top line, reflects the offsetting savings resulting from the realignment actions taken in the current and prior fiscal years.
I'll now move to Slide #10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues increased 3.1% for the quarter. Neither acquisitions nor currency impacted revenues. Growth in military OEM, commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket sales were the drivers for the quarterly performance as compared to the prior year. Operating margin for the first quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 13.1% of sales versus 13.9% in the prior year. No business realignment expenses were incurred in the quarter compared to $2 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $73 million as compared to $76 million, reflecting the timing impact of higher development costs during the quarter.
Moving to Slide #11 with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a 3-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average. 
Total orders improved to positive 2% for the quarter-end, reflecting easing year-ago comparisons and a decelerating rate of decline in key industrial end markets. Diversified Industrial North America orders decreased year-over-year to negative 4%. Diversified Industrial International orders increased modestly year-over-year to a positive 3%, and Aerospace Systems orders increased year-over-year to a positive 14%.
On Slide #12, we report cash flow from operations. For the first quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $114 million or 4.2% of sales. This compares to 0.7% of sales for the same period last year. When adjusted for the $220 million discretionary pension contribution we made in the quarter, cash from operating activities was 12.2% of sales. This compares to 7.7% of sales for the same period last year, adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made last year. 
The significant uses of cash during the quarter were the $220 million for the discretionary pension plan contribution, $115 million for the company's repurchase of common shares and $85 million for the payment of shareholder dividends. $33 million for CapEx, equating to 1.2% of sales for the quarter, is also called out.
Turning to Slide #13. The full year earnings guidance for '17 is outlined. The guidance is being provided on both an as-reported and an adjusted basis. Adjusted segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of $48 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY '17. This is the only item for which we are adjusting.
Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 1.5% to 2.1% as compared to the prior year. Organic growth at the midpoint is nearly flat. Acquisitions in the guidance are expected to positively impact sales by 0.4%. Currency in the guidance is expected to have a modestly positive 0.3% impact on sales. We've calculated the impact on currency to spot rates as of September 30, 2016, and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming balance of FY '17.
For total Parker, as-reported segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.8% and 15.2%, while adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be 15.2% -- to be between 15.2% and 15.6%. The guided midpoint on each range compares favorably to FY '16 margins, 13.9% on an as-reported basis and 14.8% on an adjusted basis in FY '16. 
The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate G&A, interest and other expense, is $478 million for the year at the midpoint. The full year tax rate is projected at 28.5%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full year guidance is 135.5 million. 
For the full year, the guidance range on an as-reported earnings per share basis is $6.15 to $6.85 or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted earnings per share basis, the guidance range is $6.40 to $7.10 or $6.75 at the midpoint. This as-reported EPS guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $48 million to be incurred in FY '17. The effect of this restructuring on EPS is approximately $0.25. Savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected to be $30 million and are fully reflected in both the as-reported and the adjusted operating margin guidance ranges.
We would ask that you continue to publish your estimates using adjusted guidance for purposes of representing a more consistent year-over-year comparison. 
Some additional key assumptions for fiscal year 2017 guidance are: sales divided 48% first half, 52% second half; adjusted segment operating income is divided 45% first half, 55% second half; EPS first half is $2.96 and $3.79 at the midpoint, that's first half versus second half; and Q2 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.36 per share at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.10 of business realignment expenses expected to be incurred in our Q2.
On Slide 14, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of FY '17 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.75 per share at the midpoint from prior FY '17 EPS of $6.75 per share. Increases include $0.05 from lower corporate G&A and $0.05 from the lower tax rate. The key component of the decrease includes a $0.10 per share reduction from higher other and interest expense. Please remember that this forecast excludes any acquisitions and divestitures that might close during FY '17. 
This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I'll turn the call back over to you for your summary comments."

So we obviously look at both of those all the time on a dynamic basis with the goal of making the best long-term value-creation decision for our shareholders. So I would characterize the pipeline right now, as far as acquisitions, being fairly active. As always, acquisitions are lumpy and hard to predict as far as the output. And I think what is normally -- what historically, the last couple of years, has slowed us down as far as converting more acquisitions has been the price valuation gap. And what we're seeing now, and I would hope over the next couple of years, we'll continue to see this even more, is I think sellers' expectation is coming closer to reality. And I think that price gap that we experienced will become closer, and I think properties will become more actionable. So we will continue to look at share repurchase and acquisitions and make the best decision every quarter on behalf of our shareholders. On the share repurchase, just as opposed to preannouncing, we'll continue to be active. And as I've said before on these calls, what we'll do is we'll communicate after the fact. We think that's the best value creation for our shareholders. We won't be buying into our own wind. And you'll see us be active. Like I mentioned in my opening comments, our goal is to be great generators of cash, and we'll continue to be even better at that. But we want to be great deployers of cash and put it to work. Now the $2 billion that you mentioned, Nathan, that's sitting there, I'd just remind, I think most people realize this, is that 99% of that is permanently invested overseas. And so there's certain constraints or factors that you've got to weigh when you think about how to deploy that and try to deploy that in the most tax-efficient manner on the benefit of our shareholders. So we'll look at that. We obviously want to put it to work, but there's factors yet to consider on the cash that's sitting overseas."

I see that disconnect getting closer, which will allow things to be more actionable. Now your point as far as how we decide to look at the financing side of things, we're disciplined. We do a discounted cash flow. We have a certain discount rate that we look at. We have return criteria that we consider.

I'm going to answer your question and pivot on that, too, and just give some color on the markets around the world. I think it's important, too, for just everybody on the call to just go back a quarter and how we characterized the macro environment as we gave guidance in FY '17. And what we talked about was basically, we figured this to be a year where most of our markets -- declines that we saw would decelerate and eventually make it back or closer to flat. And we forecasted growth to be soft in Q1, as you remember, essentially flat in Q2. And then we'd see some small organic growth in -- year-over-year basis in the second half of the year. When we gave guidance last quarter, we put the markets in 3 buckets: positive, which would be positive year-over-year growth for our FY '17; neutral and then -- which would be neutral; and then negative. So there really hasn't been much change from any of that. When I think about positive, we're still bullish on Aerospace. We talked about refrigeration, air-conditioning, semicon and telecom. We continue to see strong activity in all those areas. On a neutral front, we talked about automotive. We talked about power generation and rail. And I think the one thing that we talked about which really was a positive in our mind, that we saw distribution moving to neutral. And what we see, we're on track to do that. And I'll comment on North America, too, for you when I get there. And then negative year-over-year, which is consistent, decelerating, for sure. But whole natural resource end markets, construction, farm and ag, forestry, marine, mining, oil and gas, all have -- still have headwinds to them, and then heavy-duty truck, which we talked about. So having said that, the organic growth for the quarter really largely moved in the direction as we expected from the last call. Just touching on North America and distribution. We saw it's down low single digits. It's really in line with the expectations that we saw. It's definitely regional. Those people impacted by natural resource end markets are still suffering, and there's still some tough comps, if you remember back Q1 last year this time, for some of these people. What I was encouraged about is roughly every 4 years, we hold a channel meeting in North America with our fluid power channel. And I just came back from a meeting with 400 principals representing this channel across North America. And I have to tell you, I spent 2 days just going from top to bottom, networking with everybody there. And I left mildly encouraged, certainly not depressed, about prospects moving forward. As you would expect, areas like the Great Lakes regions are having positive year-on-year growth. People in the oil patch are still suffering. But it's not that accelerating rate of decline. There's more talk about some positive trends possibly happening here in FY '17, so that was good. If I talk about industrial markets in North America, you have to talk about oil and gas, and I would say major OEMs continue to indicate no significant investment, but you do get a sense that there's a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel, and there's some talks about some projects happening going forward. Energy markets is another one that we like. Overall, the large-frame turbines was flat year-over-year, but I've talked about this in the past that we've had some good specification wins there. Our content is up, so we've seen some strong numbers from that sector for us. And then in the mobile markets in North America, we continue to see year-over-year declines in off-highway construction equipment, off-highway farm and ag, industrial trucks, material handling and real-world equipment. I'd say one market that was a little worse than we forecasted was heavy trucks and trailers. That was a little bit of a headwind for us. And then I would say in the automotive markets, a little worse. And really, I'm talking about light truck there. And I think a lot of that has to do with there was some extended summer shutdowns in some of those sectors that impacted us. But when we look at it going forward, we still feel very positive about it for the year. I'm going to get to international orders, Jamie. I haven't forgotten you here. So when I talk about EMEA distribution, I would say, again, it's a same story. If you talk about oil and gas regions, they had a large negative year-over-year impact. We continue to see great growth in some of the emerging regions, but I will tell you a little bit of headwind from some of the political unrest in Turkey, which cost us in the quarter. We see that coming back. And then oil and gas, still tough year-over-year comps, but we are seeing some positive activity on some project business outside of Western Europe. General industrial Middle East has been strong for us. There's a lot of projects going on, resolved their economic diversification efforts, so we've had some great project wins there. And then in the mobile sector, we are seeing some positive news in Europe with off-highway construction equipment and with heavy trucks and just getting some positive year-over-year input from our customers. So Europe, largely, from an international order standpoint, largely moved in the direction that we thought it would for the quarter. For Asia Pacific, we were encouraged by  another strong quarter of year-over-year entry. So it accelerated from last quarter, moved in the direction that we thought. Distribution was strong. We've got a big footprint expansion going on as part of our new Win Strategy, and we like what's happening there. And we've really seen very strong growth in India and Southeast Asia. Industrially, we were up in almost all end markets. So if I -- I'll highlight machinery, power generation, semiconductor, telecom, all real positive in Asia Pacific. And then in mobile, I've highlighted this before in the past, but high-speed rail continues to be a bright spot for us through some specification wins. We're doing very well there. And really, increases in most segments in mobile. Off-highway construction, again, very low levels, obviously, heavy-duty truck, farm and ag. And then Latin America and other international component, again, another second quarter of strong order entry year-over-year from an extremely depressed level, but we're encouraged by what's happening there. It's been the first positive move in some time. So when we think about countries like Brazil coming back, that's a positive for us. So international order entry accelerated and stayed relatively in line with what we thought. And Europe accelerated, and Asia accelerated, Latin America."

Maybe people didn't pick up on it, but we start -- we did this year in August different than what we've done historically.

So we started off the year with a more narrow than traditional range in August, and we just kept that the same for the third quarter. So that's -- part of it is really the starting point. And as far as keeping it consistent, when you look at what happened to the quarter, so we met the guide at the operating income level. And the good thing about what happened in the quarter is we had slightly less sales, but we had better operating margin, so we ended up delivering the operating income to our guide, which was a testament really to the team around the world doing a fantastic job on it. We got some help below the line with some discrete one-off things that are not going to repeat. So we felt that with that mix, holding it flat made sense. And holding it flat, especially in today's environment, with the macro environment being, I would still say, fairly uncertain -- but we're encouraged with the fact that our orders turned positive.

It is good old-fashioned bureaucracy. So we are very encouraged because, if you remember, simplification is geared more at the strategic SG&A type of restructuring. So we made a lot of progress, but I think this is very early days.

Now on the 14% for 2 quarters in a row, I want to -- again, as you know and everybody on the call knows, we're reporting these numbers, because it's a long-cycle business, at a rolling 12-month average. Now the long-term growth rate that we can expect is what we have seen almost in Q1 from Aerospace, their sales up 3.1%. And our long-term growth rate with them is -- going forward is going to be in the 4% range. And that is something that, over a next 3- or 4- or 5-year time frame, we feel very confident in saying. So I want to just caution you that -- to not expect a 14% increase going forward. This has to do with the lumpiness of the orders and how they come in from our military and commercial customers. And the long-term prospects are fantastic, but they're not translating to sales at a 14% per year annum rate."

For us, I think the biggest pole in the tent on simplification is the whole revenue complexity. And when you look at our divisions and you do a histogram of their sales and you look at that last couple of percent of revenue, it has a significant, and I would underline significant, amount of part numbers, quote activity and SG&A that's tied up in a relatively small percent of revenue. Now we don't want to walk away from that revenue, but we want to do it significantly more efficiently. So that's a big element. And because of the size of the company and just the sheer magnitude of part numbers, that is something that will take time, but it's going to be probably the biggest contributor to savings in the future on simplification. And we've just now started scratching the surface on that. Related to that is organization design and process. So as we go through that product line complexity and simplify, it's the old 80-20 type of concept. We're going to change organization design and process associated, and there will be speed, efficiencies, costs, et cetera, and in general, an improvement in the ability to serve customers and ease of doing business with us. That's the other big part of the simplification, is to make it easier to do business with Parker. We'll look at traditional things in organization design like span of controls, number of layers, all those type of things. And we'll look at good old-fashioned bureaucracy, which Lee and I have talked about in the past, that if you were to do what used to be called internally in the company, the black book process, which is our annual planning process, it was a process that would take 5 months, 28 financial schedules and literally thousands and thousands of people hours tied up in that process. And we drove that down to 8 weeks, 8 schedules and significantly freed up time for people. So those are just some examples and color on that. We're early days in this, but I would say it's got great momentum in the company. So I'll let Lee take over on what we're doing on distribution internationally."

Naturally, we have a long way to go to reach our goal of 0 accidents, but I am very pleased with the progress we are making. Safety is important because not only does it protect our people, but also because great safety performance typically leads to great financial performance. 
Now to the financial highlights of our first quarter results. First quarter sales were $2.74 billion, a 4% decline compared with the same quarter a year ago. This represents the third consecutive quarter we saw a decelerating rate of decline in sales on a year-over-year basis. Nearly all the decline in sales this quarter was organic. 
Total order rates for the first quarter increased 2% compared with the same quarter last year on easier comparisons. This represented the first quarterly increase in orders since December 2014. By segment, North America is still weak but slowly recovering, and our Aerospace Systems segment and international business order rates were positive. These order rates reinforce our previously communicated view that we are progressing towards stabilization in many of our key markets. However, we will continue to monitor order trends closely to ensure that this outlook is holding up.
Net income for the first quarter increased 8% to $210 million on an as-reported basis or $218 million on an adjusted basis. Earnings per share were $1.55 as-reported or $1.61 on an adjusted basis, a 6% increase in adjusted earnings per share compared with the same quarter last year. Despite soft market conditions, we were able to achieve total segment operating margins of 15.0% or 15.4% adjusted. This is another quarter of solid performance and represents a 10 basis point improvement year-over-year in adjusted segment operating margins.
Our decremental marginal return on sales or MROS was 3.9% in the first quarter or 12.7% on an adjusted basis. This really is outstanding performance and marks the seventh consecutive quarter that our adjusted decrementals have been below 30%. It was another strong quarter for cash flow. Cash flow from operations, excluding a discretionary pension contribution, was 12% of sales, reflecting our ability to be a consistent generator of cash through economic cycles. During the quarter, we repurchased $115 million of Parker stock. This completes the previously announced commitment to buy back a minimum of $2 billion in Parker shares by October 2016. Going forward, our plan is to be a great generator of cash and a great deployer of cash in a way that generates increased long-term returns for our shareholders. 
Now regarding FY '17 guidance. We continue to forecast a year of flat sales compared with 2016. For 2017, we are maintaining guidance for as-reported earnings in the range of $6.15 to $6.85 per share or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $6.40 to $7.10 or a midpoint of $6.75. Business realignment expenses are still anticipated to be approximately $0.25 per share in fiscal 2017. 
So now just a few comments about our progress with the Win Strategy. We continue to make meaningful progress across initiatives across 4 broad goals: engaged people, premier customer experience, profitable growth and financial performance. Our ongoing execution of the new Win Strategy through its first full year of implementation gives me even more confidence that we can achieve our key financial objectives by the end of fiscal 2020, which includes targeted sales growth of 150 basis points, higher than the rate of global industrial production. We are also targeting 17% segment operating margins. And progress towards these goals is expected to drive a compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this 5-year period. These performance targets will allow us to deliver sustainable long-term value for Parker team members, our customers and our shareholders. 
I'll now hand things back to Jon to review more details in the quarter and fiscal 2017 guidance."

And at this time, please refer to Slide #5. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter.  Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.61 versus $1.52 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of $0.09. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.06, which compares to $0.11 for the same quarter last year.
On Slide #6, we review the influences on the adjusted earnings per share for Q1 versus Q1 of FY '16. We had earnings per share of $1.52 for the first quarter FY '16 and $1.61 for first quarter of this year. Increases to adjusted earnings per share include: a reduction of corporate G&A expense, which totaled $0.11 per share; a lower effective tax rate of 28.1% versus 29.2% in Q1 of FY '16; lower interest expense; and the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the company's share repurchase activity, which equated to an increase of $0.07 per share. A reduction of $0.08 per share in income was a result of lower adjusted segment operating income, driven by weakened end market top line demand as projected, while higher other expense equated to a reduction of $0.01 per share. 
Moving to Slide #7 with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the first quarter. Total company organic sales in the first quarter decreased by 4.6% over the same quarter last year. There was nominal contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions and minimal currency impact.  Total company segment operating margins for the first quarter, adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter, was 15.4% versus 15.3% for the same quarter last year.
Business realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $11 million versus $22 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $422 million versus $438 million last year reflects the impact of the weakened industrial end markets, partially offset by the savings realized from the company's simplification and restructuring actions.
Moving to Slide #8. I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the first quarter, North America organic sales decreased by 9% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was no impact from acquisitions and nominal impact from currency in the quarter.  Operating margin for the first quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 17.5% of sales versus 17.2% in the prior year. Business realignment expense incurred totaled $4 million as compared to $8 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $205 million as compared to $221 million, driven by the reduced volume as a result of those same key industrial end markets.
I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on Slide # sales -- Slide #9. Organic sales for the first quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 3.2%. Acquisitions positively impacted sales by 0.9%, while there was no impact from currency. Operating margin for the first quarter, adjusted for business realignment costs, was 14.2% of sales versus 13.6% in the prior year.  Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $7 million as compared to $12 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $144 million as compared to $141 million, which, despite the weakened top line, reflects the offsetting savings resulting from the realignment actions taken in the current and prior fiscal years.
I'll now move to Slide #10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues increased 3.1% for the quarter. Neither acquisitions nor currency impacted revenues. Growth in military OEM, commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket sales were the drivers for the quarterly performance as compared to the prior year. Operating margin for the first quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 13.1% of sales versus 13.9% in the prior year. No business realignment expenses were incurred in the quarter compared to $2 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $73 million as compared to $76 million, reflecting the timing impact of higher development costs during the quarter.
Moving to Slide #11 with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a 3-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average.  Total orders improved to positive 2% for the quarter-end, reflecting easing year-ago comparisons and a decelerating rate of decline in key industrial end markets. Diversified Industrial North America orders decreased year-over-year to negative 4%. Diversified Industrial International orders increased modestly year-over-year to a positive 3%, and Aerospace Systems orders increased year-over-year to a positive 14%.
On Slide #12, we report cash flow from operations. For the first quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $114 million or 4.2% of sales. This compares to 0.7% of sales for the same period last year. When adjusted for the $220 million discretionary pension contribution we made in the quarter, cash from operating activities was 12.2% of sales. This compares to 7.7% of sales for the same period last year, adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made last year.  The significant uses of cash during the quarter were the $220 million for the discretionary pension plan contribution, $115 million for the company's repurchase of common shares and $85 million for the payment of shareholder dividends. $33 million for CapEx, equating to 1.2% of sales for the quarter, is also called out.
Turning to Slide #13. The full year earnings guidance for '17 is outlined. The guidance is being provided on both an as-reported and an adjusted basis. Adjusted segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of $48 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY '17. This is the only item for which we are adjusting. Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 1.5% to 2.1% as compared to the prior year. Organic growth at the midpoint is nearly flat. Acquisitions in the guidance are expected to positively impact sales by 0.4%. Currency in the guidance is expected to have a modestly positive 0.3% impact on sales. We have calculated the impact on currency to spot rates as of September 30, 2016, and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming balance of FY '17.
For total Parker, as-reported segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.8% and 15.2%, while adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be 15.2% -- to be between 15.2% and 15.6%. The guided midpoint on each range compares favorably to FY '16 margins, 13.9% on an as-reported basis and 14.8% on an adjusted basis in FY '16.  The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate G&A, interest and other expense, is $478 million for the year at the midpoint. The full year tax rate is projected at 28.5%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full year guidance is 135.5 million. 
For the full year, the guidance range on an as-reported earnings per share basis is $6.15 to $6.85 or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted earnings per share basis, the guidance range is $6.40 to $7.10 or $6.75 at the midpoint. This as-reported EPS guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $48 million to be incurred in FY '17. The effect of this restructuring on EPS is approximately $0.25. Savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected to be $30 million and are fully reflected in both the as-reported and the adjusted operating margin guidance ranges. We would ask that you continue to publish your estimates using adjusted guidance for purposes of representing a more consistent year-over-year comparison. 
Some additional key assumptions for fiscal year 2017 guidance are: sales divided 48% first half, 52% second half; adjusted segment operating income is divided 45% first half, 55% second half; EPS first half is $2.96 and $3.79 at the midpoint, that's first half versus second half; and Q2 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.36 per share at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.10 of business realignment expenses expected to be incurred in our Q2.
On Slide 14, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of FY '17 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.75 per share at the midpoint from prior FY '17 EPS of $6.75 per share. Increases include $0.05 from lower corporate G&A and $0.05 from the lower tax rate. The key component of the decrease includes a $0.10 per share reduction from higher other and interest expense. Please remember that this forecast excludes any acquisitions and divestitures that might close during FY '17. 
This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I'll turn the call back over to you for your summary comments."

So we obviously look at both of those all the time on a dynamic basis with the goal of making the best long-term value-creation decision for our shareholders. So I would characterize the pipeline right now, as far as acquisitions, being fairly active. As always, acquisitions are lumpy and hard to predict as far as the output. And I think what is normally -- what historically, the last couple years, has slowed us down as far as converting more acquisitions has been the price valuation gap. And what we're seeing now, and I would hope over the next couple years, we'll continue to see this even more, is I think sellers' expectations coming closer to reality. And I think that price gap that we experienced will become closer, and I think properties will become more actionable. So we will continue to look at share repurchase and acquisitions and make the best decision every quarter on behalf of our shareholders. On the share repurchase, just as opposed to preannouncing, we'll continue to be active. And as I've said before on these calls, what we'll do is we'll communicate after the fact. We think that's the best value creation for our shareholders. We won't be buying into our own wind. And you'll see us be active. Like I mentioned in my opening comments, our goal is to be great generators of cash, and we'll continue to be even better at that. But we want to be great deployers of cash and put it to work. Now the $2 billion that you mentioned, Nathan, that's sitting there, I just would remind, I think most people realize this, is that 99% of that is permanently invested overseas. And so there's certain constraints or factors that you have to weigh when you think about how to deploy that and try to deploy it in the most tax-efficient manner on the benefit of our shareholders. So we'll look at that. We obviously want to put it to work, but there's factors yet to consider on the cash that's sitting overseas."

I'm going to answer your question and pivot on that, too, and just give some color on the markets around the world. I think it's important, too, for just everybody on the call to just go back a quarter and how we characterized the macro environment as we gave guidance in FY '17. And what we talked about was basically, we figured this to be a year where most of our markets -- declines that we saw would decelerate and eventually make it back or closer to flat. And we forecasted growth to be soft in Q1, as you remember, essentially flat in Q2. And then we'd see some small organic growth in -- year-over-year basis in the second half of the year. When we gave guidance last quarter, we put the markets in 3 buckets: positive, which would be positive year-over-year growth for our FY '17; neutral and then -- which would be neutral; and then negative. So there really hasn't been much change from any of that. When I think about positive, we're still bullish on Aerospace. We talked about refrigeration, air-conditioning, semicon and telecom. We continue to see strong activity in all those areas. On a neutral front, we talked about automotive. We talked about power generation and rail. And I think the one thing that we talked about which really was a positive in our mind, that we saw distribution moving to neutral. And what we see, we're on track to do that. And I'll comment on North America, too, for you when I get there. And then negative year-over-year, which is consistent, decelerating, for sure. But whole natural resource end markets, construction, farm and ag, forestry, marine, mining, oil and gas, all have -- still have headwinds to them, and then heavy-duty truck, which we talked about. So having said that, the organic growth for the quarter really largely moved in the direction as we expected from the last call. Just touching on North America and distribution. We saw it's down low single digits. It's really in line with the expectations that we saw. It's definitely regional. Those people impacted by natural resource end markets are still suffering, and there's still some tough comps, if you remember back Q1 last year this time, for some of these people. What I was encouraged about is roughly every 4 years, we hold a channel meeting in North America with our fluid power channel. And I just came back from a meeting with 400 principals representing this channel across North America. And I have to tell you, I spent 2 days just going from top to bottom, networking with everybody there. And I left mildly encouraged, certainly not depressed, about prospects moving forward. As you would expect, areas like the Great Lakes regions are having positive year-on-year growth. People in the oil patch are still suffering. But it's not that accelerating rate of decline. There's more talk about some positive trends possibly happening here in FY '17, so that was good. If I talk about industrial markets in North America, you have to talk about oil and gas, and I would say major OEMs continue to indicate no significant investment, but you do get a sense that there's a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel, and there's some talks about some projects happening going forward. Energy markets is another one that we like. Overall, the large-frame turbines was flat year-over-year, but I've talked about this in the past that we've had some good specification wins there. Our content is up, so we've seen some strong numbers from that sector for us. And then in the mobile markets in North America, we continue to see year-over-year declines in off-highway construction equipment, off-highway farm and ag, industrial trucks, material handling and real-world equipment. I'd say one market that was a little worse than we forecasted was heavy trucks and trailers. That was a little bit of a headwind for us. And then I would say in the automotive markets, a little worse. And really, I'm talking about light truck there. And I think a lot of that has to do with there was some extended summer shutdowns in some of those sectors that impacted us. But when we look at it going forward, we still feel very positive about it for the year. I'm going to get to international orders, Jamie. I haven't forgotten you here. So when I talk about EMEA distribution, I would say, again, it's the same story. If you talk about oil and gas regions, it had a large negative year-over-year impact. We continue to see great growth in some of the emerging regions, but I will tell you a little bit of headwind from some of the political unrest in Turkey, which cost us in the quarter. We see that coming back. And then oil and gas, still tough year-over-year comps, but we are seeing some positive activity on some project business outside of Western Europe. General industrial Middle East has been strong for us. There's a lot of projects going on, result of their economic diversification efforts, so we've had some great project wins there. And then in the mobile sector, we are seeing some positive news in Europe with off-highway construction equipment and with heavy trucks and just getting some positive year-over-year input from our customers. So Europe, largely, from an international order standpoint, largely moved in the direction that we thought it would for the quarter. For Asia Pacific, we were encouraged by  another strong quarter of year-over-year entry. So it accelerated from last quarter, moved in the direction that we thought. Distribution was strong. We've got a big footprint expansion going on as part of our new Win Strategy, and we like what's happening there. And we've really seen very strong growth in India and Southeast Asia. Industrially, we were up in almost all end markets. So if I highlight machinery, power generation, semiconductor, telecom, all real positive in Asia Pacific. And then in mobile, I've highlighted this before in the past, but high-speed rail continues to be a bright spot for us through some specification wins. We're doing very well there. And really, increases in most segments in mobile. Off-highway construction, again, very low levels, obviously, heavy-duty truck, farm and ag. And then Latin America, another international component, again, another second quarter of strong order entry year-over-year from an extremely depressed level, but we're encouraged by what's happening there. It's been the first positive move in some time. So when we think about countries like Brazil coming back, that's a positive for us. So international order entry accelerated and stayed relatively in line with what we thought in Europe, accelerated in Asia, accelerated Latin America."

Maybe people didn't pick up on it, but we did this year in August different than what we've done historically. If you go back and look at our August guidance, typically had a much wider range. So we started off the year with a more narrow than traditional range in August, and we just kept that the same for the third quarter. So that's -- part of it is really the starting point. And as far as keeping it consistent, when you look at what happened to the quarter, so we met the guide at the operating income level. And the good thing about what happened in the quarter is we had slightly less sales, but we had better operating margin, so we ended up delivering the operating income to our guide, which was a testament really to the team around the world doing a fantastic job on it. We got some help below the line with some discrete one-off things that are not going to repeat. So we felt that with that mix, holding it flat made sense. And holding it flat, especially in today's environment, with the macro environment being, I would still say, fairly uncertain -- but we're encouraged with the fact that our orders turned positive.

But the bigger part of simplification was underneath that, is going to be product line complexity, revenue complexity, organization design work, process changes that we'll do related to that revenue complexity. It is good old-fashioned bureaucracy. So we are very encouraged because, if you remember, simplification is geared more at the strategic SG&A type of restructuring. So we made a lot of progress, but I think this is very early days in this. And that's part of why you've seen, from an operating margin standpoint, why we've performed so efficiently the last several quarters and why our decrementals have held up so well.

By the time we get to FY '20, our expectations to grow 150 basis points faster than the market based on FY '20 as an exit rate. When you do the CAGR through that period of time, that's a 1.5% CAGR. So as a background, as long as the CAGR from '15 to '20 is a 1.5% CAGR, we think we can get to 17% operating margin. Obviously, if it's lower than that, that's going to put challenges on it.

So I want to just caution you that -- to not expect a 14% increase going forward. This has to do with the lumpiness of the orders and how they come in from our military and commercial customers. And the long-term prospects are fantastic, but they're not translating to sales at a 14% per year annum rate."

For us, I think the biggest pole in the tent on simplification is the whole revenue complexity. And when you look at our divisions and you do a histogram of their sales and you look at that last couple percent of revenue, it has a significant, and I would underline significant, amount of part numbers, quote activity and SG&A that's tied up in a relatively small percent of revenue. Now we don't want to walk away from that revenue, but we want to do it significantly more efficiently. So that's a big element. And because of the size of the company and just the sheer magnitude of part numbers, that is something that will take time, but it's going to be probably the biggest contributor to savings in the future on simplification. And we've just now started scratching the surface on that. Related to that is organization design and process. So as we go through that product line complexity and simplify it, it's the old 80-20 type of concept. We're going to change organization design and process associated, and there will be speed, efficiencies, cost, et cetera, and in general, an improvement in the ability to serve customers and ease of doing business with us. That's the other big part of the simplification, is to make it easier to do business with Parker. We'll look at traditional things in organization design like span of controls, number of layers, all those type of things. And we'll look at good old-fashioned bureaucracy, which Lee and I have talked about in the past, that if you were to do what used to be called internally in the company, the black book process, which is our annual planning process, was a process that would take 5 months, 28 financial schedules and literally thousands and thousands of people hours tied up in that process. And we drove that down to 8 weeks, 8 schedules and significantly freed up time for people. So those are just some examples and color on that. We're early days in this, but I would say it's got great momentum in the company. So I'll let Lee take over on what we're doing on distribution internationally."

We appreciate your participation this morning.  Today, I'd like to share highlights of our first quarter results, comment on our fiscal year 2017 guidance and finally, share progress we are making with the",774,"Thanks, Jon, and welcome to everyone on the call. We appreciate your participation this morning.  Today, I'd like to share highlights of our first quarter results, comment on our fiscal year 2017 guidance and finally, share progress we are making with the new Win Strategy. 
Before I get into the financial highlights of the quarter, I'd first like to talk about safety. Keeping people safe is our first priority, and as such, we start our meetings at Parker with a discussion on safety. So I thought I'd start our earnings call with safety as well.  During the first quarter of 2017, we were able to reduce our recordable injuries by 35% compared to the prior year. This builds upon a 33% year-over-year improvement we posted comparing 2016 versus 2015. Naturally, we have a long way to go to reach our goal of 0 accidents, but I am very pleased with the progress we are making. Safety is important because not only does it protect our people, but also because great safety performance typically leads to great financial performance. 
Now to the financial highlights of our first quarter results. First quarter sales were $2.74 billion, a 4% decline compared with the same quarter a year ago. This represents the third consecutive quarter we saw a decelerating rate of decline in sales on a year-over-year basis. Nearly all the decline in sales this quarter was organic. 
Total order rates for the first quarter increased 2% compared with the same quarter last year on easier comparisons. This represented the first quarterly increase in orders since December 2014. By segment, North America is still weak but slowly recovering, and our Aerospace Systems segment and international business order rates were positive. These order rates reinforce our previously communicated view that we are progressing towards stabilization in many of our key markets. However, we will continue to monitor order trends closely to ensure that this outlook is holding up.
Net income for the first quarter increased 8% to $210 million on an as-reported basis or $218 million on an adjusted basis. Earnings per share were $1.55 as-reported or $1.61 on an adjusted basis, a 6% increase in adjusted earnings per share compared with the same quarter last year. Despite soft market conditions, we were able to achieve total segment operating margins of 15.0% or 15.4% adjusted. This is another quarter of solid performance and represents a 10 basis point improvement year-over-year in adjusted segment operating margins.
Our decremental marginal return on sales or MROS was 3.9% in the first quarter or 12.7% on an adjusted basis. This really is outstanding performance and marks the seventh consecutive quarter that our adjusted decrementals have been below 30%. It was another strong quarter for cash flow. Cash flow from operations, excluding a discretionary pension contribution, was 12% of sales, reflecting our ability to be a consistent generator of cash through economic cycles. During the quarter, we repurchased $115 million of Parker stock. This completes the previously announced commitment to buy back a minimum of $2 billion in Parker shares by October 2016. Going forward, our plan is to be a great generator of cash and a great deployer of cash in a way that generates increased long-term returns for our shareholders. 
Now regarding FY '17 guidance. We continue to forecast a year of flat sales compared with 2016. For 2017, we are maintaining guidance for as-reported earnings in the range of $6.15 to $6.85 per share or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $6.40 to $7.10 or a midpoint of $6.75. Business realignment expenses are still anticipated to be approximately $0.25 per share in fiscal 2017. 
So now just a few comments about our progress with the Win Strategy. We continue to make meaningful progress across initiatives across 4 broad goals: engaged people, premier customer experience, profitable growth and financial performance. Our ongoing execution of the new Win Strategy through its first full year of implementation gives me even more confidence that we can achieve our key financial objectives by the end of fiscal 2020, which includes targeted sales growth of 150 basis points, higher than the rate of global industrial production. We are also targeting 17% segment operating margins. And progress towards these goals is expected to drive a compound annual growth rate in earnings per share of 8% over this 5-year period. These performance targets will allow us to deliver sustainable long-term value for Parker team members, our customers and our shareholders. 
I'll now hand things back to Jon to review more details in the quarter and fiscal 2017 guidance."

And at this time, please refer to Slide #5. I'll begin by addressing earnings per share for the quarter.  Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.61 versus $1.52 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of $0.09. This excludes business realignment expenses of $0.06, which compares to $0.11 for the same quarter last year.
On Slide #6, we review the influences on the adjusted earnings per share for Q1 versus Q1 of FY '16. We had earnings per share of $1.52 for the first quarter FY '16 and $1.61 for first quarter of this year. Increases to adjusted earnings per share include: a reduction of corporate G&A expense, which totaled $0.11 per share; a lower effective tax rate of 28.1% versus 29.2% in Q1 of FY '16; lower interest expense; and the impact of fewer shares outstanding due to the company's share repurchase activity, which equated to an increase of $0.07 per share. A reduction of $0.08 per share in income was a result of lower adjusted segment operating income, driven by weakened end market top line demand as projected, while higher other expense equated to a reduction of $0.01 per share. 
Moving to Slide #7 with a review of the total company sales and segment operating margin for the first quarter. Total company organic sales in the first quarter decreased by 4.6% over the same quarter last year. There was nominal contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions and minimal currency impact.  Total company segment operating margins for the first quarter, adjusted for realignment costs incurred in the quarter, was 15.4% versus 15.3% for the same quarter last year.
Business realignment costs incurred in the quarter were $11 million versus $22 million last year. The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $422 million versus $438 million last year reflects the impact of the weakened industrial end markets, partially offset by the savings realized from the company's simplification and restructuring actions.
Moving to Slide #8. I'll discuss the business segments, starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the first quarter, North America organic sales decreased by 9% as compared to the same quarter last year. There was no impact from acquisitions and nominal impact from currency in the quarter.  Operating margin for the first quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 17.5% of sales versus 17.2% in the prior year. Business realignment expense incurred totaled $4 million as compared to $8 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $205 million as compared to $221 million, driven by the reduced volume as a result of those same key industrial end markets.
I'll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on Slide # sales -- Slide #9. Organic sales for the first quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 3.2%. Acquisitions positively impacted sales by 0.9%, while there was no impact from currency. Operating margin for the first quarter, adjusted for business realignment costs, was 14.2% of sales versus 13.6% in the prior year.  Realignment expenses incurred in the quarter totaled $7 million as compared to $12 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $144 million as compared to $141 million, which, despite the weakened top line, reflects the offsetting savings resulting from the realignment actions taken in the current and prior fiscal years.
I'll now move to Slide #10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues increased 3.1% for the quarter. Neither acquisitions nor currency impacted revenues. Growth in military OEM, commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket sales were the drivers for the quarterly performance as compared to the prior year. Operating margin for the first quarter, adjusted for realignment costs, was 13.1% of sales versus 13.9% in the prior year. No business realignment expenses were incurred in the quarter compared to $2 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $73 million as compared to $76 million, reflecting the timing impact of higher development costs during the quarter.
Moving to Slide #11 with the detail of orders changes by segment. As a reminder, Parker orders represent a trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a 3-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average.  Total orders improved to positive 2% for the quarter-end, reflecting easing year-ago comparisons and a decelerating rate of decline in key industrial end markets. Diversified Industrial North America orders decreased year-over-year to negative 4%. Diversified Industrial International orders increased modestly year-over-year to a positive 3%, and Aerospace Systems orders increased year-over-year to a positive 14%.
On Slide #12, we report cash flow from operations. For the first quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $114 million or 4.2% of sales. This compares to 0.7% of sales for the same period last year. When adjusted for the $220 million discretionary pension contribution we made in the quarter, cash from operating activities was 12.2% of sales. This compares to 7.7% of sales for the same period last year, adjusted for the $200 million discretionary pension contribution made last year.  The significant uses of cash during the quarter were the $220 million for the discretionary pension plan contribution, $115 million for the company's repurchase of common shares and $85 million for the payment of shareholder dividends. $33 million for CapEx, equating to 1.2% of sales for the quarter, is also called out.
Turning to Slide #13. The full year earnings guidance for '17 is outlined. The guidance is being provided on both an as-reported and an adjusted basis. Adjusted segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude expected business realignment charges of $48 million, which are forecasted to be incurred throughout FY '17. This is the only item for which we are adjusting. Total sales are expected to be in the range of negative 1.5% to 2.1% as compared to the prior year. Organic growth at the midpoint is nearly flat. Acquisitions in the guidance are expected to positively impact sales by 0.4%. Currency in the guidance is expected to have a modestly positive 0.3% impact on sales. We have calculated the impact on currency to spot rates as of September 30, 2016, and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming balance of FY '17.
For total Parker, as-reported segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.8% and 15.2%, while adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be 15.2% -- to be between 15.2% and 15.6%. The guided midpoint on each range compares favorably to FY '16 margins, 13.9% on an as-reported basis and 14.8% on an adjusted basis in FY '16.  The guidance for below-the-line items, which includes corporate G&A, interest and other expense, is $478 million for the year at the midpoint. The full year tax rate is projected at 28.5%. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full year guidance is 135.5 million. 
For the full year, the guidance range on an as-reported earnings per share basis is $6.15 to $6.85 or $6.50 at the midpoint. On an adjusted earnings per share basis, the guidance range is $6.40 to $7.10 or $6.75 at the midpoint. This as-reported EPS guidance excludes business realignment expenses of approximately $48 million to be incurred in FY '17. The effect of this restructuring on EPS is approximately $0.25. Savings from these business realignment initiatives are projected to be $30 million and are fully reflected in both the as-reported and the adjusted operating margin guidance ranges. We would ask that you continue to publish your estimates using adjusted guidance for purposes of representing a more consistent year-over-year comparison. 
Some additional key assumptions for fiscal year 2017 guidance are: sales divided 48% first half, 52% second half; adjusted segment operating income is divided 45% first half, 55% second half; EPS first half is $2.96 and $3.79 at the midpoint, that's first half versus second half; and Q2 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $1.36 per share at the midpoint, and this excludes $0.10 of business realignment expenses expected to be incurred in our Q2.
On Slide 14, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of FY '17 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.75 per share at the midpoint from prior FY '17 EPS of $6.75 per share. Increases include $0.05 from lower corporate G&A and $0.05 from the lower tax rate. The key component of the decrease includes a $0.10 per share reduction from higher other and interest expense. Please remember that this forecast excludes any acquisitions and divestitures that might close during FY '17. 
This concludes my prepared comments. Tom, I'll turn the call back over to you for your summary comments."

So we obviously look at both of those all the time on a dynamic basis with the goal of making the best long-term value-creation decision for our shareholders. So I would characterize the pipeline right now, as far as acquisitions, being fairly active. As always, acquisitions are lumpy and hard to predict as far as the output. And I think what is normally -- what historically, the last couple years, has slowed us down as far as converting more acquisitions has been the price valuation gap. And what we're seeing now, and I would hope over the next couple years, we'll continue to see this even more, is I think sellers' expectations coming closer to reality. And I think that price gap that we experienced will become closer, and I think properties will become more actionable. So we will continue to look at share repurchase and acquisitions and make the best decision every quarter on behalf of our shareholders. On the share repurchase, just as opposed to preannouncing, we'll continue to be active. And as I've said before on these calls, what we'll do is we'll communicate after the fact. We think that's the best value creation for our shareholders. We won't be buying into our own wind. And you'll see us be active. Like I mentioned in my opening comments, our goal is to be great generators of cash, and we'll continue to be even better at that. But we want to be great deployers of cash and put it to work. Now the $2 billion that you mentioned, Nathan, that's sitting there, I just would remind, I think most people realize this, is that 99% of that is permanently invested overseas. And so there's certain constraints or factors that you have to weigh when you think about how to deploy that and try to deploy it in the most tax-efficient manner on the benefit of our shareholders. So we'll look at that. We obviously want to put it to work, but there's factors yet to consider on the cash that's sitting overseas."

We do a discounted cash flow. We have a certain discount rate that we look at. We have return criterias [ph] that we consider.

I'm going to answer your question and pivot on that, too, and just give some color on the markets around the world. I think it's important, too, for just everybody on the call to just go back a quarter and how we characterized the macro environment as we gave guidance in FY '17. And what we talked about was basically, we figured this to be a year where most of our markets -- declines that we saw would decelerate and eventually make it back or closer to flat. And we forecasted growth to be soft in Q1, as you remember, essentially flat in Q2. And then we'd see some small organic growth in -- year-over-year basis in the second half of the year. When we gave guidance last quarter, we put the markets in 3 buckets: positive, which would be positive year-over-year growth for our FY '17; neutral and then -- which would be neutral; and then negative. So there really hasn't been much change from any of that. When I think about positive, we're still bullish on Aerospace. We talked about refrigeration, air-conditioning, semicon and telecom. We continue to see strong activity in all those areas. On a neutral front, we talked about automotive. We talked about power generation and rail. And I think the one thing that we talked about which really was a positive in our mind, that we saw distribution moving to neutral. And what we see, we're on track to do that. And I'll comment on North America, too, for you when I get there. And then negative year-over-year, which is consistent, decelerating, for sure. But whole natural resource end markets, construction, farm and ag, forestry, marine, mining, oil and gas, all have -- still have headwinds to them, and then heavy-duty truck, which we talked about. So having said that, the organic growth for the quarter really largely moved in the direction as we expected from the last call. Just touching on North America and distribution. We saw it's down low single digits. It's really in line with the expectations that we saw. It's definitely regional. Those people impacted by natural resource end markets are still suffering, and there's still some tough comps, if you remember back Q1 last year this time, for some of these people. What I was encouraged about is roughly every 4 years, we hold a channel meeting in North America with our fluid power channel. And I just came back from a meeting with 400 principals representing this channel across North America. And I have to tell you, I spent 2 days just going from top to bottom, networking with everybody there. And I left mildly encouraged, certainly not depressed, about prospects moving forward. As you would expect, areas like the Great Lakes regions are having positive year-on-year growth. People in the oil patch are still suffering. But it's not that accelerating rate of decline. There's more talk about some positive trends possibly happening here in FY '17, so that was good. If I talk about industrial markets in North America, you have to talk about oil and gas, and I would say major OEMs continue to indicate no significant investment, but you do get a sense that there's a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel, and there's some talks about some projects happening going forward. Energy markets is another one that we like. Overall, the large-frame turbines was flat year-over-year, but I've talked about this in the past that we've had some good specification wins there. Our content is up, so we've seen some strong numbers from that sector for us. And then in the mobile markets in North America, we continue to see year-over-year declines in off-highway construction equipment, off-highway farm and ag, industrial trucks, material handling and real-world equipment. I'd say one market that was a little worse than we forecasted was heavy trucks and trailers. That was a little bit of a headwind for us. And then I would say in the automotive markets, a little worse. And really, I'm talking about light truck there. And I think a lot of that has to do with there was some extended summer shutdowns in some of those sectors that impacted us. But when we look at it going forward, we still feel very positive about it for the year. I'm going to get to international orders, Jamie. I haven't forgotten you here. So when I talk about EMEA distribution, I would say, again, it's the same story. If you talk about oil and gas regions, it had a large negative year-over-year impact. We continue to see great growth in some of the emerging regions, but I will tell you a little bit of headwind from some of the political unrest in Turkey, which cost us in the quarter. We see that coming back. And then oil and gas, still tough year-over-year comps, but we are seeing some positive activity on some project business outside of Western Europe. General industrial Middle East has been strong for us. There's a lot of projects going on, result of their economic diversification efforts, so we've had some great project wins there. And then in the mobile sector, we are seeing some positive news in Europe with off-highway construction equipment and with heavy trucks and just getting some positive year-over-year input from our customers. So Europe, largely, from an international order standpoint, largely moved in the direction that we thought it would for the quarter. For Asia Pacific, we were encouraged by  another strong quarter of year-over-year entry. So it accelerated from last quarter, moved in the direction that we thought. Distribution was strong. We've got a big footprint expansion going on as part of our new Win Strategy, and we like what's happening there. And we've really seen very strong growth in India and Southeast Asia. Industrially, we were up in almost all end markets. So if I highlight machinery, power generation, semiconductor, telecom, all real positive in Asia Pacific. And then in mobile, I've highlighted this before in the past, but high-speed rail continues to be a bright spot for us through some specification wins. We're doing very well there. And really, increases in most segments in mobile. Off-highway construction, again, very low levels, obviously, heavy-duty truck, farm and ag. And then Latin America, another international component, again, another second quarter of strong order entry year-over-year from an extremely depressed level, but we're encouraged by what's happening there. It's been the first positive move in some time. So when we think about countries like Brazil coming back, that's a positive for us. So international order entry accelerated and stayed relatively in line with what we thought in Europe, accelerated in Asia, accelerated Latin America."

Maybe people didn't pick up on it, but we did this year in August different than what we've done historically. If you go back and look at our August guidance, typically had a much wider range. So we started off the year with a more narrow than traditional range in August, and we just kept that the same for the third quarter. So that's -- part of it is really the starting point. And as far as keeping it consistent, when you look at what happened to the quarter, so we met the guide at the operating income level. And the good thing about what happened in the quarter is we had slightly less sales, but we had better operating margin, so we ended up delivering the operating income to our guide, which was a testament really to the team around the world doing a fantastic job on it. We got some help below the line with some discrete one-off things that are not going to repeat. So we felt that with that mix, holding it flat made sense. And holding it flat, especially in today's environment, with the macro environment being, I would still say, fairly uncertain -- but we're encouraged with the fact that our orders turned positive.

But the bigger part of simplification was underneath that, is going to be product line complexity, revenue complexity, organization design work, process changes that we'll do related to that revenue complexity. It is good old-fashioned bureaucracy. So we are very encouraged because, if you remember, simplification is geared more at the strategic SG&A type of restructuring. So we made a lot of progress, but I think this is very early days in this. And that's part of why you've seen, from an operating margin standpoint, why we've performed so efficiently the last several quarters and why our decrementals have held up so well.

By the time we get to FY '20, our expectations to grow 150 basis points faster than the market based on FY '20 as an exit rate. When you do the CAGR through that period of time, that's a 1.5% CAGR. So as a background, as long as the CAGR from '15 to '20 is a 1.5% CAGR, we think we can get to 17% operating margin. Obviously, if it's lower than that, that's going to put challenges on it.

For us, I think the biggest pole in the tent on simplification is the whole revenue complexity. And when you look at our divisions and you do a histogram of their sales and you look at that last couple percent of revenue, it has a significant, and I would underline significant, amount of part numbers, quote activity and SG&A that's tied up in a relatively small percent of revenue. Now we don't want to walk away from that revenue, but we want to do it significantly more efficiently. So that's a big element. And because of the size of the company and just the sheer magnitude of part numbers, that is something that will take time, but it's going to be probably the biggest contributor to savings in the future on simplification. And we've just now started scratching the surface on that. Related to that is organization design and process. So as we go through that product line complexity and simplify it, it's the old 80-20 type of concept. We're going to change organization design and process associated, and there will be speed, efficiencies, cost, et cetera, and in general, an improvement in the ability to serve customers and ease of doing business with us. That's the other big part of the simplification, is to make it easier to do business with Parker. We'll look at traditional things in organization design like span of controls, number of layers, all those type of things. And we'll look at good old-fashioned bureaucracy, which Lee and I have talked about in the past, that if you were to do what used to be called internally in the company, the black book process, which is our annual planning process, was a process that would take 5 months, 28 financial schedules and literally thousands and thousands of people hours tied up in that process. And we drove that down to 8 weeks, 8 schedules and significantly freed up time for people. So those are just some examples and color on that. We're early days in this, but I would say it's got great momentum in the company. So I'll let Lee take over on what we're doing on distribution internationally."
