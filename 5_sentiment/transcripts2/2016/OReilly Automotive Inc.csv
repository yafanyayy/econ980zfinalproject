Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Shaw, our Executive Vice President and Store Operations in the Sales; David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman and Greg Johnson, our Executive Vice President in Supply Chain, are also present.
It's my great pressure to congratulate Team O'Reilly on our incredible performance in 2015. We had simply an outstanding year. Our fourth quarter comparable store sales increase of 7.7% completes a year where we generated comparable store sales increases in excess of 7% all 4 quarters and generated an industry-leading annual comparable store sales growth of 7.5%. 
These outstanding results are the direct result of our team of over 71,000 dedicated team members earning market share by providing consistently excellent levels of customer service.
Our considerable 2015 market share gains, or even more impressive when 1 considers our 4 consecutive quarters of 7-plus percent comp comparable store sales growth, comes on top of our strong 2014 results when we generated comparative sales growth in excess of 5% each quarter and a 6% comparable store sales growth for the full year of 2014. This consistently robust top line performance is the direct result of our team's dedication to living the O'Reilly culture of providing incredible levels of service to each of our valued customers, and I want to thank each of our team members for their continued contribution to our company's long-term success.
For the fourth quarter, we robustly grew sales by 10.5% and for the full year, we generated 10.4% total sales growth. With our focus on growing sales profitably and controlling our expenses, we generated a fourth quarter operating profit of 18.6%. 
For the full year, we generated a record operating profit of 19%, which was 140-basis-point improvement over 2014.
During the quarter, we generated earnings per share of $2.19, which represents an increase of 24% over the prior year. This quarter represents the 28th consecutive quarter we have grown EPS in excess of 15%.
For the year, we generated EPS of $9.17 a share, which was an increase of 25% over the prior year.
This year represents the seventh straight year we generated annual EPS growth in excess of 20%, and I couldn't be more pleased with our team's consistent efforts all the way down our income statement starting with the always critical top line, driven by our team's effort to provide unsurpassed service and earn our customers' business year-after-year.
When we look at our sales performance for the quarter, it was relatively consistent on a month-to-month basis. November was a little slower on the DIY side of the business as the warmer-than-normal temperatures across many of our winter sensitive markets created a headwind to some of the cold-weather related categories. However, with the onset of colder temperatures, we were able to capture this deferred demand in December and finished the year on a high note.
The composition of our comparable store sales growth in the fourth quarter was very similar to the whole year. Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were strong contributors to our comparable store sales growth, with professional being slightly higher.
Increases in comparable transaction count and ticket average contributed equally to our growth, with a larger contribution from our professional account although our DIY ticket count growth continues to be strong.
The increase in average ticket continues to be driven by the secular industry driver of parts complexity with no help from increases in selling price as inflation remains muted. 
Our performance for the quarter, as we've seen over the past 1.5 years, was driven by key hard part categories, such as brakes, driveline, chassis and batteries. Through November, the latest data available miles driven were up 3.5% year-to-date, representing 21 straight months of year-over-year increases. We feel this positive trend, driven by low gas prices and improving employment, has been an important factor in fueling our robust comparable store sales growth.
For 2016, we expect to see positive tailwinds from continued modest improvements and total employment and low gas prices, which will continue to support further increases in miles driven and demand in our industry although at a lesser degree on a year-over-year basis compared to the significant tailwinds we had in 2015.
We also remain extremely confident in our team's ability to provide industry-leading customer service and gain market share and our first quarter is off to a solid start. However, after generating comparable store sales gains of 7.5% and 6% the last 2 years, we face difficult comparisons on a 2  and 3-year stock basis. Taking all these factors into account, we're establishing both our first quarter and full year comparable store sales guidance at 3% to 5%. We will exclude the additional Leap Day from our 2016 comparable store sales when we report our first quarter results and have accordingly excluded it from our sales guidance ranges.
We are establishing our full year 2016 operating profit guidance at a range of 19.3% to 19.7% of sales. The increase over the prior year is driven by further gross margin improvements and reduced legal costs, which Jeff and Tom will discuss in more detail.
For earnings per share, we are establishing our first quarter guidance at $2.41 to $2.51. And for the full year, our guidance is $10.10 to $10.50.
Our guidance includes all the shares we purchased through this call that does not include any future share repurchases.
Before I finish up my prepared comments, I would like to again thank our team for a record-breaking 2015 results. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe we are very well positioned to capitalize on this demand by consistently providing industry-leading service to our customers everyday. Again, congratulations to Team O'Reilly for the record year and the great start we have to our first quarter through this point in February. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw. Jeff?"

I'd like to begin my remarks by congratulating Team O'Reilly on your phenomenal execution in 2015. Our team members take auto pride in O'Reilly Auto Parts, our culture and our customer service. With the 7% plus",918,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin my remarks by congratulating Team O'Reilly on your phenomenal execution in 2015. Our team members take auto pride in O'Reilly Auto Parts, our culture and our customer service. 
With the 7% plus comparable store sales growth we generated in all 4 quarters of 2015, there's certainly a lot to be proud of. Once again, our teams are focused on providing top-notch customer service allowed us to generate comparable store sales that led our industry. 
For the quarter, we grew total revenues 10.5% and total gross margin dollars by 12.7%. For the year, we grew sales by 10.4% and gross margin dollars by 12.2%. Our ability to generate sustainable and profitable growth is the direct result of our ability to provide exceptional service, a wide product offering at competitive prices and superior parts availability. This growth doesn't happen without the dedication of our store, DC and office support teams. 
Now we'll spend a little time talking about our SG&A expense in 2015 and our outlook for 2016. For the fourth quarter, we levered SG&A by 41 basis points and 55 basis points for the year, both driven by extremely strong sales results. As a reminder, included in the second quarter of 2015 was an adverse judgment in a long-term dispute with a former service provider, which negatively impacted our full year SG&A by 24 basis points.
Looking ahead to 2016, we expect SG&A leverage to benefit from the comparison to this item and more modest leverage on sales guidance that is not as robust as the extremely strong sales we generated in 2015.
At the beginning of 2015, our guidance for the increase in average SG&A per store was 1.5%. Well, we came in at a 2.8% increase, which is in line with our expectations, given our extremely strong sales performance. 
With comparable store sales of 7.5% versus our beginning of the year guidance of 3% to  5%, our SG&A exceeded our expectations, driven by higher variable compensation at every level, higher variable cost associated with the increased customer counts and, as we've discussed on previous calls, our commitment to aggressively staff our stores to take better advantage of the favorable market conditions.
Looking forward to 2016, we expect per store SG&A to grow at approximately 2% for the year. This is a little higher than our typical expectation of 1.5%. Three areas that are raising our expectations are: higher expected medical costs, a somewhat more aggressive advertising campaign and additional investments in our internal information systems capability.
As we saw in 2015, this is our current plan, but it could change as we'll continue to prudently manage SG&A expenses both up and down based on ongoing sales trends and the opportunities we see in the marketplace. 
For the quarter, we opened 48 net new stores including our first 2 stores in Connecticut and achieved our goal of opening 205 new stores for the year. Opening new stores is a long process that involves every area of our company, and I'd like to thank the entire team for their outstanding job in opening 205 great stores during 2015. 
As we discussed on our last call, our plan is to open 210 net new stores in 2016.
We'll open stores all across our footprint, 38 states in all. Areas of concentration will be Texas as the new San Antonio, DC will free up a much-needed capacity across our existing 3 Texas DCs; the Upper Great Lakes as we continue to leverage capacity added with our new Chicago DC; Florida, as we continue to expand south with the support of our Lakeland DC; the Western half of the country as we continue the long process of backfilling markets; and the Northeast, as we begin ramping up openings in New England supported by our Boston DC.
Also in 2016, we'll begin the planned expansion of our Greensboro, North Carolina DC, adding 200,000 square feet, which will allow additional capacity for growth as we backfill those markets.
I'd like to finish up today by very quickly talking about our recent Annual Managers Conference held in St. Louis earlier this month. Each year, we get all of our store managers, district managers, regional managers and divisional vice presidents as well as our sales and DC management team members together in one place at one time to build the leadership skills, enhance product knowledge and share best practices across our company. The theme of this year's conference was committed to service, then, now and always. And it perfectly summarize our current and past success has built on our unwavering commitment to our customer and how our future is dependent on continually identifying, mentoring and promoting the next generation of leadership to live the O'Reilly culture of customer service.
This conference always serves us a great springboard for the new year and this year's conference was the best one yet. 
I'll close my comments by again congratulating Team O'Reilly on their strong performance in 2015. Our team set the bar high this past year, but we can never rest on our laurels. Everyday we must provide unwavering customer service that surpasses expectations and continues to earn our customers' business.
2014 and 2015 were great years for our company, and I'm confident that we have the team in place to roll up our sleeve and out-service our competition, taking market share in 2016. 
Once again, great job Team O'Reilly. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Now we'll take a closer look at our quarterly results and provide some additional guidance for 2016. For the quarter, sales increased $185 million comprised of $134 million increase in comp store sales, a $52 million increase in noncomp store sales, flat nonstore sales and a $1 million decrease from closed stores. 
For 2016, we're establishing our full year total revenue guidance at a range of $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion. For the quarter, gross margin was 52.7% of sales and improved 103 basis points over the prior year. This exceeded our expectations as we benefited from the mix of sales and leveraged on distribution cost, driven by the strong sales, offset in part by minor LIFO headwinds. 
For the year, gross margin was 52.3% of sales, an improvement of 85 basis points over the prior year. This was slightly above our beginning of the year guidance of 51.8% to 52.2% as we benefited from better-than-expected acquisition cost improvements and leverage on distribution cost, offset in part by full year LIFO headwinds of $28 million.
Looking forward to 2016, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 52.3% to 52.7% of sales. The improvement is the result of lower-than-expected life headwind and annual edition of costs -- excuse me, of acquisition cost improvement from the last year, partially offset by pressure on DC leverage.
We also assume pricing in the industry will remain rational.
Our effective tax rate for the year was 36.2% of pretax income. Excluding the third quarter, nontypical taxes adjustment related to a previous acquisition, our effective tax rate met our expectations. 
Looking at 2016, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 36.7% of pretax income, with the increase driven by the comparison to the favorable prior year nontypical tax reserve adjustment. 
On a quarterly basis, we expect the rate to be relatively consistent throughout the year, with the exception of the third quarter when we adjust our tax reserves for the tax periods. These estimates are subject to resolution of open audits and our success in qualifying for existing job tax credit programs.
For the year, free cash flow was $867 million, which is $107 million increase from the prior year, driven by increased income, partially offset by a lower decrease in net inventory. 
Our guidance for 2016 is $750 million to $800 million, which is below our strong 2015 results as we expect a decrease in our net inventory investment on a year-over-year basis will be less, offset in part by our planned increase net income.
Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was $576,000, which is a 1.5% decrease from the end of 2014. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we grow per store inventory at the lower rates than the comparable store sales growth we generate, and we definitely accomplished that goal in 2015. However, part of the 2015 decrease in per store inventories timing related to a very strong 2015 sales. And accordingly, for 2016, we expect our per store inventory to increase approximately 1.5%.
This growth rate is still below our comparable store sales growth, and we expect to continue our success of effectively deploying inventory.
Our AP to inventory ratio finished the forth quarter at 99%, which is an increase of 4% of the prior year as we benefited from incremental improved terms and high sales volumes. 
For year end in 2016, we expect AP to inventory ratio of approximately 100% as we incrementally improve our vendor terms but face the headwinds of lower expected sales growth.
Capital expenditures for the year were $414 million, which is right in the middle of our guidance. 
For 2016, we're forecasting CapEx at $460 million to $490 million. The increase is driven primarily by more new stores, a higher mix of owned stores, newer stores tending to be higher cost areas and store technology infrastructure upgrades.
Moving on to debt. We finished the fourth quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.52x, still well below our target ratio of 2 to 2.25x. We're pleased to report that during the quarter, our rating with Moody's was increased to BAA1 as our debt ratings are critical to our overall capital structure. We continue to believe our stated range is appropriate for our business, and we will move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
We continue to execute our share repurchase program. And from the date of our last conference call through today, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for an aggregate investment of $398 million at an average share price of $252.88. 
Since the inception of our buyback program, we've repurchased 51.8 million shares for an aggregate investment of $5.5 billion at an average share price of $106.10. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means for returning available cash to shareholders after we take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business at a high rate of return, and we will prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns to our shareholders.
As Greg mentioned earlier, our EPS guidance for the year is $10.10 to $10.50. Our guidance includes all this year's repurchased through this call, but does not include any future share repurchases. One point I'd like to add. We will see some lumpiness in our year-over-year comparisons. The comparison in the second quarter will benefit from the 2015 chart for the adverse judgment in a long-term dispute of former service provider, and the comparison in the third quarter will suffer from the 2015 favorable nontypical tax reserve adjustment related to a previous acquisition. These 2 unusual items net out in the  full year comparison, but will create some noise in the second and third quarters. 
Finally, I would once again like to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued dedication on the company's success. 
Congratulations on another outstanding year. This concludes our prepared comments. And at this time, I'd like to ask Adrian, the operator, to the line who will be happy to answer your questions."

Real",350,"Yes, well, the comment that I made related to November was primarily driven by some of the maintenance things that people do to their cars with the onset of cold weather. And if it's cool and related our antifreeze coolant did poorly during November. Really it did poorly for the quarter, but November was the driver of that poor quarterly performance. We picked up a lot of that business that we would've expected in November and December. I think that the weather has -- can have an impact in some of the Northeast markets that may be are subject to big potholes on the road that can do chassis and steering wear and damage on a car in many markets. It's just not that big of a factor. But I think that in many of our markets, it's kind of turned into more of a normal winter. Not an extreme winter, but a normal winter. Although I know that if you look at the average of temperatures, it would tell you that it's been abnormally warm in winter and, obviously, that is true. But I wouldn't look at weather to be a big factor in hurting this year's sales or driving this year's sales. Summer is always an important factor because HVAC sales in the summertime are dependent to a large degree on hot weather. And then, of course, battery failures are driven by hot weather. When you replace a battery in cold weather, it's a generally a symptom of the battery just being worn out and done. But the damage that cost the battery to fail in cold weather was most likely done during the extreme heat. So we've obviously would have some deferred lack of battery sales if we didn't have high heat into some of them do we obviously don't expect that to be the case. So I would just say is kind of weather neutral. I wish we were better. We really don't. As we make our plans internally, we don't put a lot of consideration into weather, and we're expecting to have a solid year."

If history -- if we do go on the recession and history repeats itself, I think it's kind of an initial shock that consumers go through as they realize that some of their retirement investments, things like that, aren't doing as well. Unemployment, of course, goes up, which is hurtful. But generally speaking, those things cause people to hang on to their cars longer and make decisions to maintain a car that they may have been considering trading off.

And in markets where you don't have major corrosion issues like up in the Northeast where cars just get a lot of salt and corrode more than they would in some markets, I would expect that I these cars will stay on the road longer than what most of us have foreseen. And it will continue to sell for us for years to come, but I don't know if you have an additional comments on the vehicle population issue?"

It's my great pressure to congratulate Team O'Reilly on our incredible performance in 2015. We had simply an outstanding year. Our fourth quarter comparable store sales increase of 7.7% completes a year where we generated comparable store sales increases in excess of 7% all 4 quarters and generated an industry-leading annual comparable store sales growth of 7.5%. These outstanding results are the direct result of our team of over 71,000 dedicated team members earning market share by providing consistently excellent levels of customer service.
Our considerable 2015 market share gains are even more impressive when one considers our 4 consecutive quarters of 7-plus percent comparable store sales growth comes on top of our strong 2014 results when we generated comparative sales growth in excess of 5% each quarter and a 6% comparable store sales growth for the full year of 2014. This consistently robust top line performance is the direct result of our team's dedication to living the O'Reilly culture of providing incredible levels of service to each of our valued customers. And I want to thank each of our team members for their continued contribution to our company's long-term success.
For the fourth quarter, we robustly grew sales by 10.5%. And for the full year, we generated 10.4% total sales growth. With our focus on growing sales profitably and controlling our expenses, we generated a fourth quarter operating profit of 18.6%. For the full year, we generated a record operating profit of 19%, which was a 140 basis point improvement over 2014.
During the quarter, we generated earnings per share of $2.19, which represents an increase of 24% over the prior year. This quarter represents the 28th consecutive quarter we have grown EPS in excess of 15%. For the year, we generated EPS of $9.17 a share, which was an increase of 25% over the prior year.
This year represents the seventh straight year we have generated annual EPS growth in excess of 20%. And I couldn't be more pleased with our team's consistent efforts all the way down our income statement, starting with the always critical top line driven by our team's effort to provide unsurpassed service and earn our customers' business year after year.
When we look at our sales performance for the quarter, it was relatively consistent on a month-to-month basis. November was a little slower on the DIY side of the business as the warmer-than-normal temperatures across many of our winter-sensitive markets created a headwind to some of the cold weather-related categories. However, with the onset of colder temperatures, we were able to capture this deferred demand in December and finish the year on a high note.
The composition of our comparable store sales growth in the fourth quarter was very similar to the whole year. Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were strong contributors to our comparable store sales growth, with professional being slightly higher.
Increases in comparable transaction count and ticket average contributed equally to our growth, with a larger contribution from our professional ticket count, although our DIY ticket count growth continues to be strong.
The increase in average ticket continues to be driven by the secular industry driver, parts complexity, with no help from increases in selling price as inflation remains muted. 
Our performance for the quarter, as we've seen over the past 1.5 years, was driven by key hard part categories such as brakes, driveline, chassis and batteries. Through November, the latest data available, miles driven were up 3.5% year-to-date, representing 21 straight months of year-over-year increases. We feel this positive trend, driven by low gas prices and improving employment, has been an important factor in fueling our robust comparable store sales growth.
For 2016, we expect to see positive tailwinds from continued modest improvements in total employment and low gas prices, which will continue to support further increases in miles driven and demand in our industry, although at a lesser degree on a year-over-year basis compared to the significant tailwinds we had in 2015.
We also remain extremely confident in our team's ability to provide industry-leading customer service and gain market share. And our first quarter is off to a solid start. However, after generating comparable store sales gains of 7.5% and 6% the last 2 years, we face difficult comparisons on a 2- and 3-year stack basis. Taking all these factors into account, we are establishing both our first quarter and full year comparable store sales guidance at 3% to 5%. We will exclude the additional Leap Day from our 2016 comparable store sales when we report our first quarter results and have accordingly excluded it from our sales guidance ranges.
We are establishing our full year 2016 operating profit guidance at a range of 19.3% to 19.7% of sales. The increase over the prior year is driven by further gross margin improvements and reduced legal costs, which Jeff and Tom will discuss in more detail. For earnings per share, we are establishing our first quarter guidance at $2.41 to $2.51. And for the full year, our guidance is $10.10 to $10.50.
Our guidance includes all the shares repurchased through this call that does not include any future share repurchases.
Before I finish up my prepared comments, I would like to again thank our team for a record-breaking 2015 results. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry. And we believe we are very well positioned to capitalize on this demand by consistently providing industry-leading service to our customers every day. Again, congratulations to Team O'Reilly for the record year and the great start we have to our first quarter through this point in February.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw. Jeff?"

I'd like to begin my remarks by congratulating Team O'Reilly on your phenomenal execution in 2015. Our team members take a lot of pride in O'Reilly Auto Parts, our culture and our customer service.
With the 7% plus comparable store sales growth we generated in all 4 quarters of 2015, there's certainly a lot to be proud of. Once again, our team's focus on providing top-notch customer service allowed us to generate comparable store sales that led our industry.
For the quarter, we grew total revenues 10.5% and total gross margin dollars by 12.7%. For the year, we grew sales by 10.4% and gross margin dollars by 12.2%. Our ability to generate sustainable, profitable growth is the direct result of our ability to provide exceptional service, a wide product offering at competitive prices and superior parts availability. This growth doesn't happen without the dedication of our store, DC and office support teams.
Now we'll spend a little time talking about our SG&A expense in 2015 and our outlook for 2016. For the fourth quarter, we levered SG&A by 41 basis points and 55 basis points for the year, both driven by our extremely strong sales results. As a reminder, included in the second quarter of 2015 was an adverse judgment in a long-term dispute with a former service provider, which negatively impacted our full year SG&A by 24 basis points. Looking ahead to 2016, we expect SG&A leverage to benefit from the comparison to this item and more modest leverage on sales guidance that is not as robust as the extremely strong sales we generated in 2015.
At the beginning of 2015, our guidance for the increase in average SG&A per store was 1.5%. Well, we came in at a 2.8% increase, which is in line with our expectations, given our extremely strong sales performance.
With comparable store sales of 7.5% versus our beginning-of-the-year guidance of 3% to 5%, our SG&A exceeded our expectations, driven by higher variable compensation at every level, higher variable costs associated with the increased customer counts and, as we've discussed on previous calls, our commitment to aggressively staff our stores to take better advantage of the favorable market conditions.
Looking forward to 2016, we expect per-store SG&A to grow at approximately 2% for the year. This is a little higher than our typical expectation of 1.5%. 3 areas that are raising our expectations are: higher expected medical costs; a somewhat more aggressive advertising campaign; and additional investments in our internal information systems capability.
As we saw in 2015, this is our current plan, but it could change as we'll continue to prudently manage SG&A expenses both up and down based on ongoing sales trends and the opportunities we see in the marketplace.
For the quarter, we opened 48 net new stores, including our first 2 stores in Connecticut, and achieved our goal of opening 205 new stores for the year. Opening new stores is a long process that involves every area of our company. And I'd like to thank the entire team for their outstanding job in opening 205 great stores during 2015.
As we discussed on our last call, our plan is to open 210 net new stores in 2016. We'll open stores all across our footprint, 38 states in all. Areas of concentration will be Texas, as the new San Antonio DC will free up much needed capacity across our existing 3 Texas DCs; the Upper Great Lakes, as we continue to leverage capacity added with our new Chicago DC; Florida, as we continue to expand south with the support of our Lakeland DC; the western half of the country, as we continue the long process of backfilling markets; and the Northeast, as we begin ramping up openings in New England, supported by our Boston DC.
Also, in 2016, we'll begin the planned expansion of our Greensboro, North Carolina DC, adding 200,000 square feet, which will allow additional capacity for growth as we backfill those markets.
I'd like to finish up today by very quickly talking about our recent annual managers' conference held in St. Louis earlier this month. Each year, we get all of our store managers, district managers, regional managers and divisional vice presidents as well as our sales and DC management team members together in one place at one time to build leadership skills, enhance product knowledge and share best practices across our company. The theme of this year's conference was ""Committed to service: Then, Now and Always"". And it perfectly summarized our current and past success has built on our unwavering commitment to our customer and how our future is dependent on continually identifying, mentoring and promoting the next generation of leadership to live the O'Reilly culture of customer service.
This conference always serves as a great springboard for the new year. And this year's conference was the best one yet. 
I'll close my comments by again congratulating Team O'Reilly on their strong performance in 2015. Our team set the bar high this past year, but we can never rest on our laurels. Every day, we must provide unwavering customer service that surpasses expectations and continues to earn our customers' business.
2014 and 2015 were great years for our company. And I'm confident that we have the team in place to roll up our sleeves and outservice our competition, taking market share in 2016. 
Once again, great job, Team O'Reilly. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Now we'll take a closer look at our quarterly results and provide some additional guidance for 2016. 
For the quarter, sales increased $185 million comprised of: a $134 million increase in comp store sales; a $52 million increase in noncomp store sales; flat noncomp, nonstore sales; and a $1 million decrease from closed stores.
For 2016, we're establishing our full year total revenue guidance at a range of $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion. 
For the quarter, gross margin was 52.7% of sales and improved 103 basis points over the prior year. This exceeded our expectations as we benefited from the mix of sales and leveraged on distribution costs driven by the strong sales, offset in part by minor LIFO headwinds.
For the year, gross margin was 52.3% of sales, an improvement of 85 basis points over the prior year. This was slightly above our beginning-of-the-year guidance of 51.8% to 52.2% as we benefited from better-than-expected acquisition cost improvements and leverage on distribution costs, offset in part by full year LIFO headwinds of $28 million.
Looking forward to 2016, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 52.3% to 52.7% of sales. The improvement is the result of lower expected LIFO headwinds and annualization of costs -- excuse me, of acquisition cost improvements from the last year, partially offset by pressure on DC leverage. We also assume pricing in the industry will remain rational.
Our effective tax rate for the year was 36.2% of pretax income. Excluding the third quarter nontypical tax reserve adjustment related to a previous acquisition, our effective tax rate met our expectations.
Looking at 2016, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 36.7% of pretax income, with the increase driven by the comparison to the favorable prior year nontypical tax reserve adjustment.
On a quarterly basis, we expect the rate to be relatively consistent throughout the year with the exception of the third quarter when we adjust our tax reserves for the tolling of open tax periods. These estimates are subject to resolution of open audits and our success in qualifying for existing job tax credit programs.
For the year, free cash flow was $867 million, which is a $107 million increase from the prior year, driven by increased income, partially offset by a lower decrease in net inventory.
Our guidance for 2016 is $750 million to $800 million, which is below our strong 2015 results, as we expect a decrease in our net inventory investment on a year-over-year basis will be less, offset in part by our planned increased net income.
Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was $576,000, which is a 1.5% decrease from the end of 2014. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we grow per-store inventory at a lower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generate. And we definitely accomplished that goal in 2015. However, part of the 2015 decrease in per-store inventory is timing related to our very strong 2015 sales. And accordingly, for 2016, we expect our per-store inventory to increase approximately 1.5%. This growth rate is still below our comparable store sales growth. And we expect to continue our success of effectively deploying inventory.
Our AP-to-inventory ratio finished the fourth quarter at 99%, which is an increase of 4% over the prior year, as we benefited from incrementally improved terms and high sales volumes. For year-end in 2016, we expect an AP-to-inventory ratio of approximately 100% as we incrementally improve our vendor terms, but face the headwinds of lower expected sales growth.
Capital expenditures for the year were $414 million, which is right in the middle of our guidance. For 2016, we're forecasting CapEx at $460 million to $490 million. The increase is driven primarily by more new stores, a higher mix of owned stores, newer stores tending to be in higher-cost areas and store technology infrastructure upgrades.
Moving on to debt. We finished the fourth quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.52x, still well below our targeted ratio of 2x to 2.25x. 
We're pleased to report that during the quarter, our rating with Moody's was increased to Baa1 as our debt ratings are critical to our overall capital structure. We continue to believe our stated range is appropriate for our business, and we will move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
We continue to execute our share repurchase program. And from the date of our last conference call through today, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for an aggregate investment of $398 million at an average share price of $252.88. Since the inception of our buyback program, we've repurchased 51.8 million shares for an aggregate investment of $5.5 billion at an average share price of $106.10. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to shareholders after we take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business at a high rate of return. And we will prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns to our shareholders.
As Greg mentioned earlier, our EPS guidance for the year is $10.10 to $10.50. Our guidance includes all this year's repurchased through this call, but does not include any future share repurchases. One point I'd like to add, we will see some lumpiness in our year-over-year comparisons. The comparison in the second quarter will benefit from the 2015 charge for the adverse judgment in the long-term dispute of a former service provider. And the comparison in the third quarter will suffer from the 2015 favorable nontypical tax reserve adjustment related to a previous acquisition. These 2 unusual items net out in the full year comparison, but will create some noise in the second and third quarters. 
Finally, I would once again like to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued dedication on the company's success. Congratulations on another outstanding year. 
This concludes our prepared comments. And at this time, I'd like to ask Adrianne, the operator, to return to the line, and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

Well, the comment that I made related to November was primarily driven by some of the maintenance things that people do to their cars with the onset of cold weather. Antifreeze, coolant related -- our antifreeze coolant did poorly during November. Really, it did poorly for the quarter, but November was the driver of that poor quarterly performance. We picked up a lot of that business that we would have expected in November and December. I think that the weather has -- can have an impact in some of the Northeast markets that maybe are subject to big potholes on the road that can do chassis and steering wear and damage on a car. In many markets, it's just not that big of a factor. But I think that in many of our markets, it's kind of turned into more of a normal winter. Not an extreme winter, but a normal winter, I know -- although I know that if you look at the average of temperatures, it would tell you that it's been an abnormally warm in winter. And obviously, that is true. But I wouldn't look at weather to be a big factor in hurting this year's sales or driving this year's sales. Summer is always an important factor because HVAC sales in the summertime are dependent, to a large degree, on hot weather. And then, of course, battery failures are driven by hot weather. When you replace a battery in cold weather, it's a generally a symptom of the battery just being worn out and done. But the damage that caused the battery to fail in cold weather was most likely done during the extreme heat. So we obviously would have some deferred lack of battery sales if we didn't have high heat in summertime, though we obviously don't expect that to be the case. So I would just say it's kind of weather neutral. I wish we were better at weather, we really don't. As we make our plans internally, we don't put a lot of consideration into weather. And we're expecting to have a solid year."

So I wouldn't be able to apply a percentage to that, but it's a combination of both. If history -- if we do go under recession and history repeats itself, I think there's that kind of initial shock that consumers go through as they realize that some of their retirement investments, things like that, aren't doing as well. Unemployment, of course, goes up, which is hurtful.

I can tell you that there are a lot of older cars on the road that, back a few years ago, would not be cars that we would be selling the volume of parts for that we do today. So I think that it's a little bit of an unknown as to how long people will continue to drive some of these vehicles that are in the 13-, 14-, 15-, 16-year age range. But you see a lot of them around. And in markets where you don't have major corrosion issues, like up in the Northeast where cars just get a lot of salt and corrode more than they would in some markets, I would expect that these cars will stay on the road longer than what most of us have foreseen.

And our expectation is that it will continue to get back on a growth track. And that's what we saw in 2015, we'll see in 2016.

It's my great pleasure to congratulate Team O'Reilly on our incredible performance in 2015. We had simply an outstanding year. Our fourth quarter comparable store sales increase of 7.7% completes a year where we generated comparable store sales increases in excess of 7% all 4 quarters and generated an industry-leading annual comparable store sales growth of 7.5%. These outstanding results are the direct result of our team of over 71,000 dedicated team members earning market share by providing consistently excellent levels of customer service.
Our considerable 2015 market share gains are even more impressive when one considers our 4 consecutive quarters of 7-plus percent comparable store sales growth comes on top of our strong 2014 results when we generated comparative sales growth in excess of 5% each quarter and a 6% comparable store sales growth for the full year of 2014. This consistently robust top line performance is the direct result of our team's dedication to living the O'Reilly culture of providing incredible levels of service to each of our valued customers. And I want to thank each of our team members for their continued contribution to our company's long-term success.
For the fourth quarter, we robustly grew sales by 10.5%. And for the full year, we generated 10.4% total sales growth. With our focus on growing sales profitably and controlling our expenses, we generated a fourth quarter operating profit of 18.6%. For the full year, we generated a record operating profit of 19%, which was a 140 basis point improvement over 2014.
During the quarter, we generated earnings per share of $2.19, which represents an increase of 24% over the prior year. This quarter represents the 28th consecutive quarter we have grown EPS in excess of 15%. For the year, we generated EPS of $9.17 a share, which was an increase of 25% over the prior year.
This year represents the seventh straight year we have generated annual EPS growth in excess of 20%. And I couldn't be more pleased with our team's consistent efforts all the way down our income statement, starting with the always critical top line driven by our team's effort to provide unsurpassed service and earn our customers' business year after year.
When we look at our sales performance for the quarter, it was relatively consistent on a month-to-month basis. November was a little slower on the DIY side of the business as the warmer-than-normal temperatures across many of our winter-sensitive markets created a headwind to some of the cold weather-related categories. However, with the onset of colder temperatures, we were able to capture this deferred demand in December and finish the year on a high note.
The composition of our comparable store sales growth in the fourth quarter was very similar to the whole year. Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were strong contributors to our comparable store sales growth, with professional being slightly higher.
Increases in comparable transaction count and ticket average contributed equally to our growth, with a larger contribution from our professional ticket count, although our DIY ticket count growth continues to be strong.
The increase in average ticket continues to be driven by the secular industry driver, parts complexity, with no help from increases in selling price as inflation remains muted. 
Our performance for the quarter, as we've seen over the past 1.5 years, was driven by key hard part categories such as brakes, driveline, chassis and batteries. Through November, the latest data available, miles driven were up 3.5% year-to-date, representing 21 straight months of year-over-year increases. We feel this positive trend, driven by low gas prices and improving employment, has been an important factor in fueling our robust comparable store sales growth.
For 2016, we expect to see positive tailwinds from continued modest improvements in total employment and low gas prices, which will continue to support further increases in miles driven and demand in our industry, although at a lesser degree on a year-over-year basis compared to the significant tailwinds we had in 2015.
We also remain extremely confident in our team's ability to provide industry-leading customer service and gain market share. And our first quarter is off to a solid start. However, after generating comparable store sales gains of 7.5% and 6% the last 2 years, we face difficult comparisons on a 2- and 3-year stack basis. Taking all these factors into account, we are establishing both our first quarter and full year comparable store sales guidance at 3% to 5%. We will exclude the additional Leap Day from our 2016 comparable store sales when we report our first quarter results and have accordingly excluded it from our sales guidance ranges.
We are establishing our full year 2016 operating profit guidance at a range of 19.3% to 19.7% of sales. The increase over the prior year is driven by further gross margin improvements and reduced legal costs, which Jeff and Tom will discuss in more detail. For earnings per share, we are establishing our first quarter guidance at $2.41 to $2.51. And for the full year, our guidance is $10.10 to $10.50.
Our guidance includes all the shares repurchased through this call that does not include any future share repurchases.
Before I finish up my prepared comments, I would like to again thank our team for a record-breaking 2015 results. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry. And we believe we are very well positioned to capitalize on this demand by consistently providing industry-leading service to our customers every day. Again, congratulations to Team O'Reilly for the record year and the great start we have to our first quarter through this point in February.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw. Jeff?"

I'd like to begin my remarks by congratulating Team O'Reilly on your phenomenal execution in 2015. Our team members take a lot of pride in O'Reilly Auto Parts, our culture and our customer service.
With the 7% plus comparable store sales growth we generated in all 4 quarters of 2015, there's certainly a lot to be proud of. Once again, our team's focus on providing top-notch customer service allowed us to generate comparable store sales that led our industry.
For the quarter, we grew total revenues 10.5% and total gross margin dollars by 12.7%. For the year, we grew sales by 10.4% and gross margin dollars by 12.2%. Our ability to generate sustainable, profitable growth is the direct result of our ability to provide exceptional service, a wide product offering at competitive prices and superior parts availability. This growth doesn't happen without the dedication of our store, DC and office support teams.
Now we'll spend a little time talking about our SG&A expense in 2015 and our outlook for 2016. For the fourth quarter, we levered SG&A by 41 basis points and 55 basis points for the year, both driven by our extremely strong sales results. As a reminder, included in the second quarter of 2015 was an adverse judgment in a long-term dispute with a former service provider, which negatively impacted our full year SG&A by 24 basis points. Looking ahead to 2016, we expect SG&A leverage to benefit from the comparison to this item and more modest leverage on sales guidance that is not as robust as the extremely strong sales we generated in 2015.
At the beginning of 2015, our guidance for the increase in average SG&A per store was 1.5%. Well, we came in at a 2.8% increase, which is in line with our expectations, given our extremely strong sales performance.
With comparable store sales of 7.5% versus our beginning-of-the-year guidance of 3% to 5%, our SG&A exceeded our expectations, driven by higher variable compensation at every level, higher variable costs associated with the increased customer counts and, as we've discussed on previous calls, our commitment to aggressively staff our stores to take better advantage of the favorable market conditions.
Looking forward to 2016, we expect per-store SG&A to grow at approximately 2% for the year. This is a little higher than our typical expectation of 1.5%. 3 areas that are raising our expectations are: higher expected medical costs; a somewhat more aggressive advertising campaign; and additional investments in our internal information systems capability.
As we saw in 2015, this is our current plan, but it could change as we'll continue to prudently manage SG&A expenses both up and down based on ongoing sales trends and the opportunities we see in the marketplace.
For the quarter, we opened 48 net new stores, including our first 2 stores in Connecticut, and achieved our goal of opening 205 new stores for the year. Opening new stores is a long process that involves every area of our company. And I'd like to thank the entire team for their outstanding job in opening 205 great stores during 2015.
As we discussed on our last call, our plan is to open 210 net new stores in 2016. We'll open stores all across our footprint, 38 states in all. Areas of concentration will be Texas, as the new San Antonio DC will free up much needed capacity across our existing 3 Texas DCs; the Upper Great Lakes, as we continue to leverage capacity added with our new Chicago DC; Florida, as we continue to expand south with the support of our Lakeland DC; the western half of the country, as we continue the long process of backfilling markets; and the Northeast, as we begin ramping up openings in New England, supported by our Boston DC.
Also, in 2016, we'll begin the planned expansion of our Greensboro, North Carolina, DC, adding 200,000 square feet, which will allow additional capacity for growth as we backfill those markets.
I'd like to finish up today by very quickly talking about our recent annual managers' conference held in St. Louis earlier this month. Each year, we get all of our store managers, district managers, regional managers and divisional vice presidents as well as our sales and DC management team members together in one place at one time to build leadership skills, enhance product knowledge and share best practices across our company. The theme of this year's conference was ""Committed to service: Then, Now and Always"". And it perfectly summarized our current and past success has built on our unwavering commitment to our customer and how our future is dependent on continually identifying, mentoring and promoting the next generation of leadership to live the O'Reilly culture of customer service.
This conference always serves as a great springboard for the new year. And this year's conference was the best one yet. 
I'll close my comments by again congratulating Team O'Reilly on their strong performance in 2015. Our team set the bar high this past year, but we can never rest on our laurels. Every day, we must provide unwavering customer service that surpasses expectations and continues to earn our customers' business.
2014 and 2015 were great years for our company. And I'm confident that we have the team in place to roll up our sleeves and outservice our competition, taking market share in 2016. 
Once again, great job, Team O'Reilly. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Now we'll take a closer look at our quarterly results and provide some additional guidance for 2016. 
For the quarter, sales increased $185 million comprised of: a $134 million increase in comp store sales; a $52 million increase in noncomp store sales; flat noncomp, nonstore sales; and a $1 million decrease from closed stores.
For 2016, we're establishing our full year total revenue guidance at a range of $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion. 
For the quarter, gross margin was 52.7% of sales and improved 103 basis points over the prior year. This exceeded our expectations as we benefited from the mix of sales and leveraged on distribution costs driven by the strong sales, offset in part by minor LIFO headwinds.
For the year, gross margin was 52.3% of sales, an improvement of 85 basis points over the prior year. This was slightly above our beginning-of-the-year guidance of 51.8% to 52.2% as we benefited from better-than-expected acquisition cost improvements and leverage on distribution costs, offset in part by full year LIFO headwinds of $28 million.
Looking forward to 2016, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 52.3% to 52.7% of sales. The improvement is the result of lower expected LIFO headwinds and annualization of costs -- excuse me, of acquisition cost improvements from the last year, partially offset by pressure on DC leverage. We also assume pricing in the industry will remain rational.
Our effective tax rate for the year was 36.2% of pretax income. Excluding the third quarter nontypical tax reserve adjustment related to a previous acquisition, our effective tax rate met our expectations.
Looking at 2016, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 36.7% of pretax income, with the increase driven by the comparison to the favorable prior year nontypical tax reserve adjustment.
On a quarterly basis, we expect the rate to be relatively consistent throughout the year with the exception of the third quarter when we adjust our tax reserves for the tolling [ph] of open tax periods. These estimates are subject to resolution of open audits and our success in qualifying for existing job tax credit programs.
For the year, free cash flow was $867 million, which is a $107 million increase from the prior year, driven by increased income, partially offset by a lower decrease in net inventory.
Our guidance for 2016 is $750 million to $800 million, which is below our strong 2015 results, as we expect a decrease in our net inventory investment on a year-over-year basis will be less, offset in part by our planned increased net income.
Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was $576,000, which is a 1.5% decrease from the end of 2014. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we grow per-store inventory at a lower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generate. And we definitely accomplished that goal in 2015. However, part of the 2015 decrease in per-store inventory is timing related to our very strong 2015 sales. And accordingly, for 2016, we expect our per-store inventory to increase approximately 1.5%. This growth rate is still below our comparable store sales growth. And we expect to continue our success of effectively deploying inventory.
Our AP-to-inventory ratio finished the fourth quarter at 99%, which is an increase of 4% over the prior year, as we benefited from incrementally improved terms and high sales volumes. For year-end in 2016, we expect an AP-to-inventory ratio of approximately 100% as we incrementally improve our vendor terms, but face the headwinds of lower expected sales growth.
Capital expenditures for the year were $414 million, which is right in the middle of our guidance. For 2016, we're forecasting CapEx at $460 million to $490 million. The increase is driven primarily by more new stores, a higher mix of owned stores, newer stores tending to be in higher-cost areas and store technology infrastructure upgrades.
Moving on to debt. We finished the fourth quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.52x, still well below our targeted ratio of 2x to 2.25x. 
We're pleased to report that during the quarter, our rating with Moody's was increased to Baa1 as our debt ratings are critical to our overall capital structure. We continue to believe our stated range is appropriate for our business, and we will move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
We continue to execute our share repurchase program. And from the date of our last conference call through today, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for an aggregate investment of $398 million at an average share price of $252.88. Since the inception of our buyback program, we've repurchased 51.8 million shares for an aggregate investment of $5.5 billion at an average share price of $106.10. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to shareholders after we take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business at a high rate of return. And we will prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns to our shareholders.
As Greg mentioned earlier, our EPS guidance for the year is $10.10 to $10.50. Our guidance includes all this year's repurchased through this call, but does not include any future share repurchases. One point I'd like to add, we will see some lumpiness in our year-over-year comparisons. The comparison in the second quarter will benefit from the 2015 charge for the adverse judgment in the long-term dispute with a former service provider. And the comparison in the third quarter will suffer from the 2015 favorable nontypical tax reserve adjustment related to a previous acquisition. These 2 unusual items net out in the full year comparison, but will create some noise in the second and third quarters. 
Finally, I would once again like to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued dedication on the company's success. Congratulations on another outstanding year. 
This concludes our prepared comments. And at this time, I'd like to ask Adrianne, the operator, to return to the line, and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

Well, the comment that I made related to November was primarily driven by some of the maintenance things that people do to their cars with the onset of cold weather. Antifreeze, coolant related -- our antifreeze coolant did poorly during November. Really, it did poorly for the quarter, but November was the driver of that poor quarterly performance. We picked up a lot of that business that we would have expected in November in December. I think that the weather has -- can have an impact in some of the Northeast markets that maybe are subject to big potholes on the road that can do chassis and steering wear and damage on a car. In many markets, it's just not that big of a factor. But I think that in many of our markets, it's kind of turned into more of a normal winter. Not an extreme winter, but a normal winter, I know -- although I know that if you look at the average of temperatures, it would tell you that it's been an abnormally warm winter. And obviously, that is true. But I wouldn't look at weather to be a big factor in hurting this year's sales or driving this year's sales. Summer is always an important factor because HVAC sales in the summertime are dependent, to a large degree, on hot weather. And then, of course, battery failures are driven by hot weather. When you replace a battery in cold weather, it's a generally a symptom of the battery just being worn out and done. But the damage that caused the battery to fail in cold weather was most likely done during the extreme heat. So we obviously would have some deferred lack of battery sales if we didn't have high heat in summertime, though we obviously don't expect that to be the case. So I would just say it's kind of weather neutral. I wish we were better at weather, we really don't. As we make our plans internally, we don't put a lot of consideration into weather. And we're expecting to have a solid year."

So I -- our do-it-for-me comp growth is a combination of both expanding business with existing customers and just new customers. So I wouldn't be able to apply a percentage to that, but it's a combination of both. If history -- if we do go under recession and history repeats itself, I think there's that kind of initial shock that consumers go through as they realize that some of their retirement investments, things like that, aren't doing as well. Unemployment, of course, goes up, which is hurtful. But generally speaking, those things cause people to hang on to their cars longer and make decisions to maintain a car that they may have been considering trading off. And generally speaking, we performed pretty well during a recession, or at least, we have in the past.

So I think that it's a little bit of an unknown as to how long people will continue to drive some of these vehicles that are in the 13-, 14-, 15-, 16-year age range. But you see a lot of them around. And in markets where you don't have major corrosion issues, like up in the Northeast where cars just get a lot of salt and corrode more than they would in some markets, I would expect that these cars will stay on the road longer than what most of us have foreseen.

Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Shaw, our Executive Vice President of Store Operations and Sales. David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman is also present. 
It is my pleasure to begin our call today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another record-breaking quarter and an excellent start to 2016. We are very pleased with our first quarter comparable store sales increase of 6.1%, which excludes leak day and is on top of an increase of 7.2% in the first quarter of 2015 and 6.3% in the first quarter of 2014. This repeated market-leading performance is the direct result of our outstanding team of over 73,000 dedicated team members and their unwavering commitment to providing inconsistent excellent levels of customer service.
Our experienced and hard-working team has now generated a remarkable 10 consecutive quarters of comparable store sales increases in excess of 5%. These consistently robust results, which is not possible without our team's dedication to living the O'Reilly culture of going above and beyond for each of our valued customers, and I want to thank each of our team members for their continued contributions to our company's long-term success.
For the first quarter, our team rove a total sales increase, excluding leap day, of 8.9%. And our diligent focus on profitable growth and expense control translated this top line performance into a record high first quarter operating margin of 19.9%, also excluding leap day, which possibly impacts first quarter operating margin by approximately 12 basis points as we leverage fixed cost over the extra day of sales.
This operating margin performance was 143-basis-point improvement over the first quarter of 2015, and we are very proud of this record-breaking first quarter results.
During the quarter, we generated earnings per share of $2.59. Our EPS guidance of $2.41 to $2.51 for the first quarter included Leap Day, but on a year-over-year basis, we benefited approximately $0.05 as a result of the extra day. 
On a comparable basis, our EPS of $2.54 represents an increase of 23% over the prior year, which is the 29th consecutive quarter we have grown EPS in excess of 15%. This is a truly remarkable string of outstanding performance, and I couldn't be more pleased with the results of our team's consistent focus on providing outstanding service to our customers.
When you look at the cadence of our sales performance for the first quarter, we saw a solid demand in each month of the quarter, with our strongest out performance coming in the first 2 months when the results came in above our expectations.
March results were in line with our expectations despite the slow start to spring we've seen in some markets. Spring  has now arrived in full force over the past couple of weeks. Trends have strengthened, and to this point in the quarter, comparable store sales are in line with our expectations. However, we face tough comparisons on a 2-year and 3-year stock basis. 
Considering all the factors driving our comparable store sales performance, we feel it's appropriate to set our second quarter comparable store sales growth guidance in the range of 3% to 5% in line with our full year guidance.
The composition of our comparable store sales growth in the first quarter repeated the same trends we saw throughout 2015. Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were strong contributors to our comparable store sales growth with professional being slightly higher. 
We saw solid increases in both comparable transaction count and ticket average, with a larger contribution from our professional ticket count although our DIY ticket growth continues to be solid.
The increase in average ticket continues to be driven by the secular industry driver of parts complexity with no help from increases in selling price as inflation remains muted.
Our performance for the quarter, as we've seen for quite some time now, was largely driven by key hard parts category, such as brakes, chassis and driveline. 
From a macroeconomic standpoint, we continue to benefit from positive tailwinds from modest improvements in employment and low gas prices and miles driven are off to a solid start thus far in 2016.
We feel the positive trend in miles driven has been an important factor in fueling our robust comparable store sales growth, and we'll continue to deliver solid demand in our industry for the remainder of 2016, although at a lesser degree on a year-over-year basis compared to the significant tailwinds in 2015.
As we noted in our press release, our gross profit outlook for the second quarter includes a LIFO headwind of approximately $23 million for anticipated acquisition cost reductions from a specific second quarter supplier deal, which was not contemplated in our initial 2016 guidance.
Tom will discuss this in more detail in a moment, but we view this headwind largely as lumpiness in the timing of our 2016 gross margin, and we still expect to achieve our previously stated full year gross margin range of 52.3% to 52.7%, although potentially on the lower end. 
We are also reiterating our full year 2016 operating profit guidance at 19.3% to 19.7% of sales.
Earnings per share -- per share, we are establishing our second quarter guidance at $2.54 to $2.64, which includes the LIFO pressure, and at the midpoint, would represent a 13% increase over EPS of $2.29 in the second quarter of last year.
As a reminder, our EPS results in the second quarter of last year were negatively impacted by a $19 million charge for an adverse per in the long-term contract dispute with the former service provider. 
On a comparable basis, absent the 2015 charge and the anticipated 2016 LIFO headwind, the midpoint of our earnings per share guidance range would be $2.74, a 14% increase over the prior year, which is consistent with the increase on an adjusted basis.
Our guidance includes incremental interest expense from our $500 million March issuance of senior notes as well as the impact from all the shares we purchased through this call, but does not include any future share repurchases.
Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I would like to again thank our team for our record-breaking first quarter results. We remain very confident in our long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe we are very well positioned to capitalize on this demand by consistently providing industry-leading service to our customers everyday. 
Again, congratulations to team O'Reilly for a very strong start to 2016. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw."

I'd like to begin my remarks by echoing Greg's comments and congratulating team O'Reilly on another  outstanding quarter and a great start to 2016. Our team continued its exceeded the high bar they've set with t",720,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin my remarks by echoing Greg's comments and congratulating team O'Reilly on another  outstanding quarter and a great start to 2016. 
Our team continued its exceeded the high bar they've set with their past performance by once again delivering industry-leading comparable store sales growth and record profitability. The secret to our team's consistent track record of success really isn't a secret. It's our team's dedication of working harder than our competition and providing excellent service to each of our customers. 
For the quarter, we grew total revenues 10.2% and total gross margin dollars by 11.2%. Our incredibly steady run of generating profitable growth is a direct result of our ability to provide exceptional service, a wide product offering at competitive prices and superior parts availability. This growth doesn't happen without the dedication of our store, DC and office support teams.
Now I'd like to spend a little time talking about our SG&A expense for the first quarter. Our team continues to remain fully committed to building strong relationships with our customers and gaining market share, while at the same time, keeping a close eye on expenses. And as a result of their efforts, we levered SG&A by 108 points for the first quarter.
This SG&A performance exceeded our expectations  and is a direct reflection of the discipline our team demonstrates in make sure that every expense dollar is spent to enhance our service to our customers. 
Our significant SG&A leverage is the result of our strong comparable sales results, coupled with an increase in average SG&A per store of 2% in the first quarter, which is well within our expectations especially in light of the higher variable cost associated with strong comps and increased customer counts. 
We continue to expect our full year increase in average SG&A per store to be approximately 2%. However, we will closely monitor our sales volumes and we'll make appropriate adjustments as needed to prudently manage SG&A expenses, both up and down to match business trends and the opportunities we see in the marketplace. 
We successfully opened 52 net new stores during the first quarter, and we continue to be pleased with the performance of our new stores. During the quarter, we opened stores in 22 different states with the highest concentration in some of our newer growth markets in Florida and the Northeast as well as continued growth in exiting markets, such as Texas.
As we've discussed in the past, our ability to continue to drive profitable growth for several years in Texas has strained our DC capacity, but we're excited to report that progress of the construction and stocking of our newest DC in the San Antonio market is right on schedule, and we're on target to open the DC in the next month.
The San Antonio DC will have the capacity to service approximately 250 stores. And over the course of the next few months, we will immediately transfer a significant number of stores to the new DC, bringing up much-needed capacity in our Dallas and Houston DCs. 
Opening new stores and new distribution centers are a long complex processes that involve every area of our company.
Just as importantly, the most critical component of any new store or DC opening is the identification and training of the teams that will lead the O'Reilly culture and provide excellent service to our customers.
Our store and DC leadership teams continue to do a fantastic job in instilling our culture and business philosophy in our newest teams, and I want to thank them for their continued dedication to excellent customer service.
It's always a good thing to start off a new year with a great first quarter, and we are obviously pleased with the outstanding job by Team O'Reilly so far in 2016. 
As I close my comments,I must reiterate that we will never rest on past successes, but we'll continue to outhustled and outservice our competitors to earn our customers' business each and every day. I'm confident we have the right team in place to continue to provide unwavering customer service and take market share the rest of 2016. And I want to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our company's success.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I'd also like to congratulate all of Team O'Reilly on a great start to 2016.

I'd also like to congratulate all of Team O'Reilly on a great start to 2016. 
Now we'll take a closer look at our quarterly results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016.
For the quarter, sales increased to $194 million, comprised of $113 million increase in comp store sales; a $52 million increase in noncomp store sales; a $24 million increase from Leap Day; a $6 million increase in noncomp nonstore sales; and $1 million decrease from closed stores.
For 2016, we continue to expect our total revenue to be $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion.
For the quarter, gross margin was 52.4% of sales and improved 47 basis points over the prior year. This was within the range of our expectations as we benefited from the mix of sales and leverage on distribution cost, driven by strong sales, offset by LIFO headwinds of $13 million, which were above our expectations. Excluding LIFO from both years, gross margin increased 66 basis points year-over-year.
As we described in our press release, and Greg mentioned earlier, we are anticipating significant unplanned LIFO headwinds in the second quarter. Specifically, we expect to see a LIFO charge related solely to a supplier renegotiation for a specific major hard parts line of approximately $23 million. This charge is a result of the macro shipped in the supplier landscape for this product line and will impact margin above and beyond the normal pressure we see on a quarter-to-quarter basis for more routine acquisition cost decreases.
As a refresher, we incurred these noncash LIFO headwinds as a result of our historic success in reducing acquisition costs to the point where we have exhausted our LIFO reserve and further caused decreases required us to reduce our existing inventory value to the lower cumulative acquisition cost.
While this specific new vendor deal will pressure our gross margin in the second quarter, we will realize improved gross margins from the lower acquisition cost on a go-forward basis. And we're reiterating our gross margin guidance of 52.3% to 52.7% of sales for the full year, with the expectation we made in the bottom end of that range.
This assumes pricing in this industry will continue to remain rational.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.0% of pretax income. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 36.7%, with the remaking quarters being relatively consistent with the exception of the third quarter when we adjust our tax reserves for the tolling of open tax periods. These estimates are subject to the resolution of open audits and our success in qualifying for existing jobs tax credit programs.
Now we move onto free cash flow in the components that drove our results. Free cash flow for the quarter was $384 million, which was a $69 million increase from the prior year, driven primarily by increased income. We are reiterating our full year guidance of $750 million to $800 million. 
Inventory per store in the quarter [ph] was $584,000, which is a 1.5% increase from the end of 2015. This growth rate was in line with our expectations for the quarter, and we continue to expect inventory per store to grow approximately 1.5% for the full year. 
Our ongoing goal is to ensure we are growing per store inventory at a lower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generate, and we expect to continue our success with effectively deploying inventory in 2016.
Our AP-to-inventory ratio finished the first quarter to 103%, which exceeded our expectations and represented a new high for this ratio. As we saw through much of 2015, our AP percentage in the first quarter benefited from incrementally improved terms and strong sales. 
As we progress through 2016, we expect our AP-to-inventory ratio to moderate somewhat to closer to 100% as we incrementally improve our vendor terms, but face the headwinds of a lower expected increase in sales based on our current comparable store sales guidance for the remainder of the year.
Capital expenditures for the quarter ended up at $104 million, which is up slightly from 2015 and in line with our expectations. We continue to forecast CapEx at $460 million to $490 million for the full year of 2016. 
Moving on to debt. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.72x, which is still well below our targeted ratio of 2 to 2.25x. However, it is up from the 1.52x at the end of 2015 as a result of our successful issuance of $500 million of senior notes in March. This was our first new debt issuance since the second quarter of 2013, and we are pleased with the execution of the senior notes offering and our ability to secure attractive long-term interest rates as an investment grade borrower.
However, the incremental interest expense from this debt issuance will be a headwind to 2016 earnings per share until we effectively deploy this capital. 
We continue to believe our stated leverage range is appropriate for our business, and we will move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
We also continue to execute our share repurchase program, and year-to-date, we've repurchased 1.5 million shares at an average share price of $256.94 for a total investment of $384 million. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business at a high rate of return. And we will prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns for our shareholders.
To recap our full year earnings per share guidance, we expect a LIFO headwinds in the second quarter in the incremental interest expense from our first quarter debt issuance to be offset by our first quarter EPS beat and the benefits of the shares repurchased since our fourth quarter conference call. As a result, we are reiterating our full year EPS guidance of $10.10 to $10.50. 
In line with our normal practice, our guidance includes all of the shares repurchased through this call, but does not include any future share repurchases.
Finally, I would once again like to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued dedication on the company's success. Congratulations on an outstanding start  to 2016.
This concludes our prepared comments. And at this time, I'd like to ask, Brandon, the operator, to return to the line and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

We had floods down in Texas, which we had stores closed for several days out of Texas at some point during the flood, which that comes back around as a positive in the long term, but it can affect short-term results."

Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Shaw, our Executive Vice Preside",1116,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts first quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Shaw, our Executive Vice President of Store Operations and Sales. David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman, is also present. 
It is my pleasure to begin our call today by congratulating team O'Reilly on another record-breaking quarter and an excellent start to 2016. We are very pleased with our first quarter comparable store sales increase of 6.1%, which excludes leap day and is on top of an increase of 7.2% in the first quarter of 2015 and 6.3% in the first quarter of 2014. This repeated market-leading performance is the direct result of our outstanding team of over 73,000 dedicated team members and their unwavering commitment to providing consistently excellent levels of customer service.
Our experienced and hard-working team has now generated a remarkable 10 consecutive quarters of comparable store sales increases in excess of 5%. These consistently robust results would just not be possible without our team's dedication to living the O'Reilly culture of going above and beyond for each of our valued customers, and I want to thank each of our team members for their continued contributions to our company's long-term success.
For the first quarter, our team drove a total sales increase, excluding leap day, of 8.9%. And our diligent focus on profitable growth and expense control translated this top line performance into a record high first quarter operating margin of 19.9%, also excluding leap day, which positively impacts first quarter operating margin by approximately 12 basis points as we leverage fixed cost over the extra day of sales.
This operating margin performance was 143-basis-point improvement over the first quarter of 2015, and we are very proud of these record-breaking first quarter results.
During the quarter, we generated earnings per share of $2.59. Our EPS guidance of $2.41 to $2.51 for the first quarter included leap day, but on a year-over-year basis, we benefited approximately $0.05 as a result of the extra day. 
On a comparable basis, our EPS of $2.54 represents an increase of 23% over the prior year, which is the 29th consecutive quarter we have grown EPS in excess of 15%. This is a truly remarkable string of outstanding performance, and I couldn't be more pleased with the results of our team's consistent focus on providing outstanding service to our customers.
When we look at the cadence of our sales performance for the first quarter, we saw solid demand in each month of the quarter, with our strongest outperformance coming in the first 2 months when the results came in above our expectations.
March results were in line with our expectations, despite the slow start to spring we've seen in some markets. Spring has now arrived in full force over the past couple of weeks. Trends have strengthened, and to this point in the quarter, comparable store sales are in line with our expectations. However, we face tough comparisons on a 2-year and 3-year stack basis. 
Considering all the factors driving our comparable store sales performance, we feel it is appropriate to set our second quarter comparable store sales growth guidance at a range of 3% to 5%, in line with our full year guidance.
The composition of our comparable store sales growth in the first quarter repeated the same trends we saw throughout 2015. Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were strong contributors to our comparable store sales growth, with professional being slightly higher. 
We saw solid increases in both comparable transaction count and ticket average, with a larger contribution from our professional ticket count, although our DIY ticket growth continues to be solid.
The increase in average ticket continues to be driven by the secular industry driver of parts complexity, with no help from increases in selling price, as inflation remains muted.
Our performance for the quarter, as we've seen for quite some time now, was largely driven by key hard parts category, such as brakes, chassis and driveline. 
From a macroeconomic standpoint, we continue to benefit from positive tailwinds from modest improvements in employment and low gas prices and miles driven are off to a solid start thus far in 2016.
We feel the positive trend in miles driven has been an important factor in fueling our robust comparable store sales growth, and we'll continue to deliver solid demand in our industry for the remainder of 2016, although at a lesser degree on a year-over-year basis compared to the significant tailwinds in 2015.
As we noted in our press release, our gross profit outlook for the second quarter includes a LIFO headwind of approximately $23 million for anticipated acquisition cost reductions from a specific second quarter supplier deal, which was not contemplated in our initial 2016 guidance.
Tom will discuss this in more detail in a moment, but we view this headwind largely as lumpiness in the timing of our 2016 gross margin, and we still expect to achieve our previously stated full year gross margin range of 52.3% to 52.7%, although potentially on the lower end. 
We are also reiterating our full year 2016 operating profit guidance at 19.3% to 19.7% of sales.
Earnings per share -- before earnings per share, we are establishing our second quarter guidance at $2.54 to $2.64, which includes the LIFO pressure, and at the midpoint, would represent a 13% increase over EPS of $2.29 in the second quarter of last year.
As a reminder, our EPS results in the second quarter of last year were negatively impacted by a $19 million charge for an adverse verdict in a long-term contract dispute with a former service provider. 
On a comparable basis, absent the 2015 charge and the anticipated 2016 LIFO headwind, the midpoint of our earnings per share guidance range would be $2.74, a 14% increase over the prior year, which is consistent with the increase on an unadjusted basis.
Our guidance includes incremental interest expense from our $500 million March issuance of senior notes as well as the impact from all the shares we purchased through this call, but does not include any future share repurchases.
Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I would like to again thank our team for our record-breaking first quarter results. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe we are very well-positioned to capitalize on this demand by consistently providing industry-leading service to our customers everyday. 
Again, congratulations to team O'Reilly for a very strong start to 2016. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw."

I'd like to begin my remarks by echoing Greg's comments and congratulating team O'Reilly on another  outstanding quarter and a great start to 2016. 
Our team continued to exceed the high bar they've set with their past performance by once again delivering industry-leading comparable store sales growth and record profitability. The secret to our team's consistent track record of success really isn't a secret. It's our team's dedication of working harder than our competition and providing excellent service to each of our customers. 
For the quarter, we grew total revenues 10.2% and total gross margin dollars by 11.2%. Our incredibly steady run of generating profitable growth is a direct result of our ability to provide exceptional service, a wide product offering at competitive prices and superior parts availability. This growth doesn't happen without the dedication of our store, DC and office support teams.
Now I'd like to spend a little time talking about our SG&A expense for the first quarter. Our team continues to remain fully committed to building strong relationships with our customers and gaining market share, while at the same time, keeping a close eye on expenses. And as a result of their efforts, we levered SG&A by 108 basis points for the first quarter.
This SG&A performance exceeded our expectations and is a direct reflection of the discipline our team demonstrates in making sure that every expense dollar is spent to enhance our service to our customers. 
Our significant SG&A leverage is the result of our strong comparable sales results coupled with an increase in average SG&A per store of 2% in the first quarter, which is well within our expectations, especially in light of the higher variable cost associated with strong comps and increased customer count. 
We continue to expect our full year increase in average SG&A per store to be approximately 2%. However, we will closely monitor our sales volumes and we'll make appropriate adjustments as needed to prudently manage SG&A expenses, both up and down, to match business trends and the opportunities we see in the marketplace. 
We successfully opened 52 net new stores during the first quarter, and we continue to be pleased with the performance of our new stores. During the quarter, we opened stores in 22 different states, with the highest concentration in some of our newer growth markets in Florida and the Northeast as well as continued growth in existing markets, such as Texas.
As we've discussed in the past, our ability to continue to drive profitable growth for several years in Texas has strained our DC capacity, but we're excited to report that progress on the construction and stocking of our newest DC in the San Antonio market is right on schedule, and we're on target to open the DC in the next month.
The San Antonio DC will have the capacity to service approximately 250 stores. And over the course of the next few months, we will immediately transfer a significant number of stores to the new DC, bringing up much needed capacity in our Dallas and Houston DCs. 
Opening new stores and new distribution centers are a long, complex processes that involve every area of our company.
Just as importantly, the most critical component of any new store or DC opening is the identification and training of the teams that will live the O'Reilly culture and provide excellent service to our customers.
Our store and DC leadership teams continue to do a fantastic job instilling our culture and business philosophy in our newest teams, and I want to thank them for their continued dedication to excellent customer service.
It's always a good thing to start off a new year with a great first quarter, and we're obviously pleased with the outstanding job by Team O'Reilly so far in 2016. 
As I close my comments, I must reiterate that we will never rest on past successes, but we'll continue to outhustle and out-service our competitors to earn our customers' business each and every day. I'm confident we have the right team in place to continue to provide unwavering customer service and take market share the rest of 2016. And I want to once again thank team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our company's success.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I'd also like to congratulate all of team O'Reilly on a great start to 2016. Now we'll take a closer look at our quarterly results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016.For the quarter, sales increased to $194 million, compri",1082,"Thanks, Jeff. I'd also like to congratulate all of team O'Reilly on a great start to 2016. 
Now we'll take a closer look at our quarterly results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016.
For the quarter, sales increased to $194 million, comprised of $113 million increase in comp store sales; a $52 million increase in non-comp store sales; a $24 million increase from leap day; a $6 million increase in non-comp non-store sales; and a $1 million decrease from closed stores.
For 2016, we continue to expect our total revenue to be $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion.
For the quarter, gross margin was 52.4% of sales and improved 47 basis points over the prior year. This was within the range of our expectations as we benefited from the mix of sales and leverage on distribution costs, driven by strong sales, offset by LIFO headwinds of $13 million, which were above our expectations. Excluding LIFO from both years, gross margin increased 66 basis points year-over-year.
As we described in our press release, and Greg mentioned earlier, we are anticipating significant unplanned LIFO headwinds in the second quarter. Specifically, we expect to see a LIFO charge related solely to a supplier renegotiation for a specific major hard parts line of approximately $23 million. This charge is the result of a macro shift in the supplier landscape for this product line and will impact margin above and beyond the normal pressure we see on a quarter-to-quarter basis from more routine acquisition cost decreases.
As a refresher, we incurred these noncash LIFO headwinds as a result of our historic success in reducing acquisition costs to the point where we have exhausted our LIFO reserve, and further cost decreases required us to reduce our existing inventory value to the lower cumulative acquisition cost.
While this specific new vendor deal will pressure our gross margin in the second quarter, we will realize improved gross margins from the lower acquisition cost on a go-forward basis. And we're reiterating our gross margin guidance of 52.3% to 52.7% of sales for the full year, with the expectation we may be in the bottom end of that range.
This assumes pricing in the industry will continue to remain rational.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.0% of pretax income. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 36.7%, with the remaining quarters being relatively consistent, with the exception of the third quarter when we adjust our tax reserves for the tolling of open tax periods. These estimates are subject to the resolution of open audits and our success in qualifying for existing job tax credit programs.
Now we move onto free cash flow and the components that drove our results. Free cash flow for the quarter was $384 million, which was a $69 million increase from the prior year, driven primarily by increased income. We are reiterating our full year guidance of $750 million to $800 million. 
Inventory per store in the quarter was $584,000, which is a 1.5% increase from the end of 2015. This growth rate was in line with our expectations for the quarter, and we continue to expect inventory per store to grow approximately 1.5% for the full year. 
Our ongoing goal is to ensure we are growing per store inventory at a lower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generate, and we expect to continue our success of effectively deploying inventory in 2016.
Our AP-to-inventory ratio finished the first quarter at 103%, which exceeded our expectations and represented a new high for this ratio. As we saw through much of 2015, our AP percentage in the first quarter benefited from incrementally improved terms and strong sales. 
As we progress through 2016, we expect our AP-to-inventory ratio to moderate somewhat to closer to 100% as we incrementally improve our vendor terms, but face the headwinds of a lower expected increase in sales based on our current comparable store sales guidance for the remainder of the year.
Capital expenditures for the quarter ended up at $104 million, which is up slightly from 2015 and in line with our expectations. We continue to forecast CapEx at $460 million to $490 million for the full year of 2016. 
Moving on to debt. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.72x, which is still well below our targeted ratio of 2 to 2.25x. However, it is up from the 1.52x at the end of 2015 as a result of our successful issuance of $500 million of senior notes in March. This was our first new debt issuance since the second quarter of 2013, and we were pleased with the execution of the senior notes offering and our ability to secure attractive long-term interest rates as an investment-grade borrower.
However, the incremental interest expense from this debt issuance will be a headwind to 2016 earnings per share until we effectively deploy this capital. 
We continue to believe our stated leverage range is appropriate for our business and we will move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
We also continue to execute our share repurchase program, and year-to-date, we've repurchased 1.5 million shares at an average share price of $256.94 for a total investment of $384 million. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business at a high rate of return. And we will prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns for our shareholders.
To recap our full year earnings per share guidance, we expect the LIFO headwinds in the second quarter and the incremental interest expense from our first quarter debt issuance to be offset by our first quarter EPS beat and the benefit of the shares repurchased since our fourth quarter conference call. As a result, we are reiterating our full year EPS guidance of $10.10 to $10.50. 
In line with our normal practice, our guidance includes all the shares repurchased through this call, but does not include any future share repurchases.
Finally, I would once again like to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued dedication to the company's success. Congratulations on an outstanding start to 2016.
This concludes our prepared comments. And at this time, I'd like to ask Brandon, the operator, to return to the line and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

And we've kind of expected some moderation to the 7%-plus quarterly comp store sales gains that we've been achieving as we continue to stack up these years and quarters of pretty incredible comp store sales growth. So we really don't see it as much of a change. I think, if you look at a 3-year  stack basis, it's actually a little bit of an improvement that I wouldn't relate it to anything specific other than towards the end of the period when we were comparing against real solid spring weather. At the end of the period last year, we had a pretty slow start to spring. We had markets where we had snow in the upper Midwest. When we didn't have snow last year, we shut business down. We had floods down in Texas, which we had stores closed for several days down at Texas at some point during the floods, which that comes back around as a positive in the long term, but it can affect short-term results."

And then, from a service level standpoint, we don't feel like they do quite as well as they could if they were operating at a more optimal store count. So there'll be some benefit there. And then, in addition to that is we offload some of the stores that are supplied by those DCs, we can take advantage of expansion opportunities that we see for new stores in both those markets because those are both very robust markets for us where we have backfill opportunities and have the need and the opportunity to add some stores in those markets that we really don't have the distribution capacity to add today, but we'll have in the future. And then, additionally, with the opening of the San Antonio, both San Antonio and Austin are incredible growth markets. And today, they're serviced by hub stores, which is just not optimal if you want to be the dominant auto parts supplier in those markets, which we do. And by putting that distribution center north of San Antonio, south of Austin, we can touch stores in both markets on a same-day basis and give us a opportunity to increase penetration with existing customers and develop relationships with new customers. And then, as we continue to expand, expand more easily from just the store count perspective because we'll have the capacity to do so out of San Antonio."

And then, secondly, it creates some efficiency for us at the store by not taking a phone call and simply receiving a pick ticket and shipping a part, but the trade-off is you don't maybe develop as close of a personal relationship with the customers you would on a phone call, so there's some trade-offs.

Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Shaw, our Executive Vice President of Store Operations and Sales. David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman, is also present. 
It is my pleasure to begin our call today by congratulating team O'Reilly on another record-breaking quarter and an excellent start to 2016. We are very pleased with our first quarter comparable store sales increase of 6.1%, which excludes leap day and is on top of an increase of 7.2% in the first quarter of 2015 and 6.3% in the first quarter of 2014. This repeated market-leading performance is the direct result of our outstanding team of over 73,000 dedicated team members and their unwavering commitment to providing consistently excellent levels of customer service.
Our experienced and hard-working team has now generated a remarkable 10 consecutive quarters of comparable store sales increases in excess of 5%. These consistently robust results would just not be possible without our team's dedication to living the O'Reilly culture of going above and beyond for each of our valued customers, and I want to thank each of our team members for their continued contributions to our company's long-term success.
For the first quarter, our team drove a total sales increase, excluding leap day, of 8.9%. And our diligent focus on profitable growth and expense control translated this top line performance into a record high first quarter operating margin of 19.9%, also excluding leap day, which positively impacts first quarter operating margin by approximately 12 basis points as we leverage fixed cost over the extra day of sales.
This operating margin performance was 143-basis-point improvement over the first quarter of 2015, and we are very proud of these record-breaking first quarter results.
During the quarter, we generated earnings per share of $2.59. Our EPS guidance of $2.41 to $2.51 for the first quarter included leap day, but on a year-over-year basis, we benefited approximately $0.05 as a result of the extra day. 
On a comparable basis, our EPS of $2.54 represents an increase of 23% over the prior year, which is the 29th consecutive quarter we have grown EPS in excess of 15%. This is a truly remarkable string of outstanding performance, and I couldn't be more pleased with the results of our team's consistent focus on providing outstanding service to our customers.
When we look at the cadence of our sales performance for the first quarter, we saw solid demand in each month of the quarter, with our strongest out-performance coming in the first 2 months when the results came in above our expectations.
March results were in line with our expectations, despite the slow start to spring we've seen in some markets. Spring has now arrived in full force over the past couple of weeks. Trends have strengthened, and to this point in the quarter, comparable store sales are in line with our expectations. However, we face tough comparisons on a 2-year and 3-year stack basis. 
Considering all the factors driving our comparable store sales performance, we feel it is appropriate to set our second quarter comparable store sales growth guidance at a range of 3% to 5%, in line with our full year guidance.
The composition of our comparable store sales growth in the first quarter repeated the same trends we saw throughout 2015. Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were strong contributors to our comparable store sales growth, with professional being slightly higher. 
We saw solid increases in both comparable transaction count and ticket average, with a larger contribution from our professional ticket count, although our DIY ticket growth continues to be solid.
The increase in average ticket continues to be driven by the secular industry driver of parts complexity, with no help from increases in selling price, as inflation remains muted.
Our performance for the quarter, as we've seen for quite some time now, was largely driven by key hard parts category, such as brakes, chassis and driveline. 
From a macroeconomic standpoint, we continue to benefit from positive tailwinds from modest improvements in employment and low gas prices, and miles driven are off to a solid start thus far in 2016.
We feel the positive trend in miles driven has been an important factor in fueling our robust comparable store sales growth, and we'll continue to deliver solid demand in our industry for the remainder of 2016, although at a lesser degree on a year-over-year basis compared to the significant tailwinds in 2015.
As we noted in our press release, our gross profit outlook for the second quarter includes a LIFO headwind of approximately $23 million for anticipated acquisition cost reductions from a specific second quarter supplier deal, which was not contemplated in our initial 2016 guidance.
Tom will discuss this in more detail in a moment, but we view this headwind largely as lumpiness in the timing of our 2016 gross margin, and we still expect to achieve our previously stated full year gross margin range of 52.3% to 52.7%, although potentially on the lower end. 
We are also reiterating our full year 2016 operating profit guidance at 19.3% to 19.7% of sales.
Earnings per share -- before earnings per share, we are establishing our second quarter guidance at $2.54 to $2.64, which includes the LIFO pressure, and at the midpoint, would represent a 13% increase over EPS of $2.29 in the second quarter of last year.
As a reminder, our EPS results in the second quarter of last year were negatively impacted by a $19 million charge for an adverse verdict in a long-term contract dispute with a former service provider. 
On a comparable basis, absent the 2015 charge and the anticipated 2016 LIFO headwind, the midpoint of our earnings per share guidance range would be $2.74, a 14% increase over the prior year, which is consistent with the increase on an unadjusted basis.
Our guidance includes incremental interest expense from our $500 million March issuance of senior notes as well as the impact from all the shares repurchased through this call, but does not include any future share repurchases.
Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I would like to again thank our team for our record-breaking first quarter results. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe we are very well-positioned to capitalize on this demand by consistently providing industry-leading service to our customers everyday. 
Again, congratulations to team O'Reilly for a very strong start to 2016. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw."

I'd like to begin my remarks by echoing Greg's comments and congratulating team O'Reilly on another outstanding quarter and a great start to 2016. 
Our team continued to exceed the high bar they've set with their past performance by once again delivering industry-leading comparable store sales growth and record profitability. The secret to our team's consistent track record of success really isn't a secret. It's our team's dedication of working harder than our competition and providing excellent service to each of our customers. 
For the quarter, we grew total revenues 10.2% and total gross margin dollars by 11.2%. Our incredibly steady run of generating profitable growth is a direct result of our ability to provide exceptional service, a wide product offering at competitive prices and superior parts availability. This growth doesn't happen without the dedication of our store, DC and office support teams.
Now I'd like to spend a little time talking about our SG&A expense for the first quarter. Our team continues to remain fully committed to building strong relationships with our customers and gaining market share, while at the same time, keeping a close eye on expenses. And as a result of their efforts, we levered SG&A by 108 basis points for the first quarter.
This SG&A performance exceeded our expectations and is a direct reflection of the discipline our team demonstrates in making sure that every expense dollar is spent to enhance our service to our customers. 
Our significant SG&A leverage is the result of our strong comparable sales results coupled with an increase in average SG&A per store of 2% in the first quarter, which is well within our expectations, especially in light of the higher variable cost associated with strong comps and increased customer count. 
We continue to expect our full year increase in average SG&A per store to be approximately 2%. However, we will closely monitor our sales volumes and we'll make appropriate adjustments as needed to prudently manage SG&A expenses, both up and down, to match business trends and the opportunities we see in the marketplace. 
We successfully opened 52 net new stores during the first quarter, and we continue to be pleased with the performance of our new stores. During the quarter, we opened stores in 22 different states, with the highest concentration in some of our newer growth markets in Florida and the Northeast as well as continued growth in existing markets, such as Texas.
As we've discussed in the past, our ability to continue to drive profitable growth for several years in Texas has strained our DC capacity, but we're excited to report that progress on the construction and stocking of our newest DC in the San Antonio market is right on schedule, and we're on target to open the DC in the next month.
The San Antonio DC will have the capacity to service approximately 250 stores. And over the course of the next few months, we will immediately transfer a significant number of stores to the new DC, bringing up much needed capacity in our Dallas and Houston DCs. 
Opening new stores and new distribution centers are long, complex processes that involve every area of our company.
Just as importantly, the most critical component of any new store or DC opening is the identification and training of the teams that will live the O'Reilly culture and provide excellent service to our customers.
Our store in DC leadership teams continue to do a fantastic job instilling our culture and business philosophy in our newest teams, and I want to thank them for their continued dedication to excellent customer service.
It's always a good thing to start off a new year with a great first quarter, and we're obviously pleased with the outstanding job by Team O'Reilly so far in 2016. 
As I close my comments, I must reiterate that we will never rest on past successes, but we'll continue to outhustle and out-service our competitors to earn our customers' business each and every day. I'm confident we have the right team in place to continue to provide unwavering customer service and take market share the rest of 2016. And I want to once again thank team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our company's success.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Now we'll take a closer look at our quarterly results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016.For the quarter, sales increased to $194 million, compri",1082,"Thanks, Jeff. I'd also like to congratulate all of team O'Reilly on a great start to 2016. 
Now we'll take a closer look at our quarterly results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016.
For the quarter, sales increased to $194 million, comprised of $113 million increase in comp store sales; a $52 million increase in non-comp store sales; a $24 million increase from leap day; a $6 million increase in non-comp non-store sales; and a $1 million decrease from closed stores.
For 2016, we continue to expect our total revenue to be $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion.
For the quarter, gross margin was 52.4% of sales and improved 47 basis points over the prior year. This was within the range of our expectations as we benefited from the mix of sales and leverage on distribution costs, driven by strong sales, offset by LIFO headwinds of $13 million, which were above our expectations. Excluding LIFO from both years, gross margin increased 66 basis points year-over-year.
As we described in our press release, and Greg mentioned earlier, we are anticipating significant unplanned LIFO headwinds in the second quarter. Specifically, we expect to see a LIFO charge related solely to a supplier renegotiation for a specific major hard parts line of approximately $23 million. This charge is the result of a macro shift in the supplier landscape for this product line and will impact margin above and beyond the normal pressure we see on a quarter-to-quarter basis from more routine acquisition cost decreases.
As a refresher, we incurred these noncash LIFO headwinds as a result of our historic success in reducing acquisition costs to the point where we have exhausted our LIFO reserve, and further cost decreases required us to reduce our existing inventory value to the lower cumulative acquisition cost.
While this specific new vendor deal will pressure our gross margin in the second quarter, we will realize improved gross margins from the lower acquisition cost on a go-forward basis. And we're reiterating our gross margin guidance of 52.3% to 52.7% of sales for the full year, with the expectation we may be in the bottom end of that range.
This assumes pricing in the industry will continue to remain rational.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.0% of pretax income. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 36.7%, with the remaining quarters being relatively consistent, with the exception of the third quarter when we adjust our tax reserves for the tolling of open tax periods. These estimates are subject to the resolution of open audits and our success in qualifying for existing job tax credit programs.
Now we move onto free cash flow and the components that drove our results. Free cash flow for the quarter was $384 million, which was a $69 million increase from the prior year, driven primarily by increased income. We are reiterating our full year guidance of $750 million to $800 million. 
Inventory per store in the quarter was $584,000, which is a 1.5% increase from the end of 2015. This growth rate was in line with our expectations for the quarter, and we continue to expect inventory per store to grow approximately 1.5% for the full year. 
Our ongoing goal is to ensure we are growing per store inventory at a lower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generate, and we expect to continue our success of effectively deploying inventory in 2016.
Our AP-to-inventory ratio finished the first quarter at 103%, which exceeded our expectations and represented a new high for this ratio. As we saw through much of 2015, our AP percentage in the first quarter benefited from incrementally improved terms and strong sales. 
As we progress through 2016, we expect our AP-to-inventory ratio to moderate somewhat to closer to 100% as we incrementally improve our vendor terms, but face the headwinds of a lower expected increase in sales based on our current comparable store sales guidance for the remainder of the year.
Capital expenditures for the quarter ended up at $104 million, which is up slightly from 2015 and in line with our expectations. We continue to forecast CapEx at $460 million to $490 million for the full year of 2016. 
Moving on to debt. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.72x, which is still well below our targeted ratio of 2 to 2.25x. However, it is up from the 1.52x at the end of 2015 as a result of our successful issuance of $500 million of senior notes in March. This was our first new debt issuance since the second quarter of 2013, and we were pleased with the execution of the senior notes offering and our ability to secure attractive long-term interest rates as an investment-grade borrower.
However, the incremental interest expense from this debt issuance will be a headwind to 2016 earnings per share until we effectively deploy this capital. 
We continue to believe our stated leverage range is appropriate for our business and we will move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
We also continue to execute our share repurchase program, and year-to-date, we've repurchased 1.5 million shares at an average share price of $256.94 for a total investment of $384 million. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business at a high rate of return. And we will prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns for our shareholders.
To recap our full year earnings per share guidance, we expect the LIFO headwinds in the second quarter and the incremental interest expense from our first quarter debt issuance to be offset by our first quarter EPS beat and the benefit of the shares repurchased since our fourth quarter conference call. As a result, we are reiterating our full year EPS guidance of $10.10 to $10.50. 
In line with our normal practice, our guidance includes all the shares repurchased through this call, but does not include any future share repurchases.
Finally, I would once again like to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued dedication to the company's success. Congratulations on an outstanding start to 2016.
This concludes our prepared comments. And at this time, I'd like to ask Brandon, the operator, to return to the line and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

So we really don't see it as much of a change. I think, if you look at a 3-year  stack basis, it's actually a little bit of an improvement that I wouldn't relate it to anything specific other than towards the end of the period when we were comparing against real solid spring weather. At the end of the period last year, we had a pretty slow start to spring. We had markets where we had snow in the upper Midwest. When we didn't have snow last year, we shut business down. We had floods down in Texas, which we had stores closed for several days down at Texas at some point during the floods, which that comes back around as a positive in the long term, but it can affect short-term results."

And then, secondly, it creates some efficiency for us at the store by not taking a phone call and simply receiving a pick ticket and shipping a part, but the trade-off is you don't maybe develop as close of a personal relationship with the customers you would on a phone call, so there's some trade-offs.

Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Shaw, our Executive Vice Preside",1115,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts First Quarter Conference Call. Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Shaw, our Executive Vice President of Store Operations and Sales. David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman, is also present. 
It is my pleasure to begin our call today by congratulating team O'Reilly on another record-breaking quarter and an excellent start to 2016. We are very pleased with our first quarter comparable store sales increase of 6.1%, which excludes leap day and is on top of an increase of 7.2% in the first quarter of 2015 and 6.3% in the first quarter of 2014. This repeated market-leading performance is the direct result of our outstanding team of over 73,000 dedicated team members and their unwavering commitment to providing consistently excellent levels of customer service.
Our experienced and hard-working team has now generated a remarkable 10 consecutive quarters of comparable store sales increases in excess of 5%. These consistently robust results would just not be possible without our team's dedication to living the O'Reilly culture of going above and beyond for each of our valued customers, and I want to thank each of our team members for their continued contributions to our company's long-term success.
For the first quarter, our team drove a total sales increase, excluding leap day, of 8.9%. And our diligent focus on profitable growth and expense control translated this top line performance into a record high first quarter operating margin of 19.9%, also excluding leap day, which positively impacts first quarter operating margin by approximately 12 basis points as we leverage fixed cost over the extra day of sales.
This operating margin performance was 143-basis-point improvement over the first quarter of 2015, and we are very proud of these record-breaking first quarter results.
During the quarter, we generated earnings per share of $2.59. Our EPS guidance of $2.41 to $2.51 for the first quarter included leap day, but on a year-over-year basis, we benefited approximately $0.05 as a result of the extra day. 
On a comparable basis, our EPS of $2.54 represents an increase of 23% over the prior year, which is the 29th consecutive quarter we have grown EPS in excess of 15%. This is a truly remarkable string of outstanding performance, and I couldn't be more pleased with the results of our team's consistent focus on providing outstanding service to our customers.
When we look at the cadence of our sales performance for the first quarter, we saw solid demand in each month of the quarter, with our strongest out-performance coming in the first 2 months when the results came in above our expectations.
March results were in line with our expectations, despite the slow start to spring we've seen in some markets. Spring has now arrived in full force over the past couple of weeks. Trends have strengthened, and to this point in the quarter, comparable store sales are in line with our expectations. However, we face tough comparisons on a 2-year and 3-year stack basis. 
Considering all the factors driving our comparable store sales performance, we feel it is appropriate to set our second quarter comparable store sales growth guidance at a range of 3% to 5%, in line with our full year guidance.
The composition of our comparable store sales growth in the first quarter repeated the same trends we saw throughout 2015. Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were strong contributors to our comparable store sales growth, with professional being slightly higher. 
We saw solid increases in both comparable transaction count and ticket average, with a larger contribution from our professional ticket count, although our DIY ticket growth continues to be solid.
The increase in average ticket continues to be driven by the secular industry driver of parts complexity, with no help from increases in selling price, as inflation remains muted.
Our performance for the quarter, as we've seen for quite some time now, was largely driven by key hard parts category, such as brakes, chassis and driveline. 
From a macroeconomic standpoint, we continue to benefit from positive tailwinds from modest improvements in employment and low gas prices, and miles driven are off to a solid start thus far in 2016.
We feel the positive trend in miles driven has been an important factor in fueling our robust comparable store sales growth, and we'll continue to deliver solid demand in our industry for the remainder of 2016, although at a lesser degree on a year-over-year basis compared to the significant tailwinds in 2015.
As we noted in our press release, our gross profit outlook for the second quarter includes a LIFO headwind of approximately $23 million for anticipated acquisition cost reductions from a specific second quarter supplier deal, which was not contemplated in our initial 2016 guidance.
Tom will discuss this in more detail in a moment, but we view this headwind largely as lumpiness in the timing of our 2016 gross margin, and we still expect to achieve our previously stated full year gross margin range of 52.3% to 52.7%, although potentially on the lower end. 
We are also reiterating our full year 2016 operating profit guidance at 19.3% to 19.7% of sales.
Earnings per share -- before earnings per share, we are establishing our second quarter guidance at $2.54 to $2.64, which includes the LIFO pressure, and at the midpoint, would represent a 13% increase over EPS of $2.29 in the second quarter of last year.
As a reminder, our EPS results in the second quarter of last year were negatively impacted by a $19 million charge for an adverse verdict in a long-term contract dispute with a former service provider. 
On a comparable basis, absent the 2015 charge and the anticipated 2016 LIFO headwind, the midpoint of our earnings per share guidance range would be $2.74, a 14% increase over the prior year, which is consistent with the increase on an unadjusted basis.
Our guidance includes incremental interest expense from our $500 million March issuance of senior notes as well as the impact from all the shares repurchased through this call, but does not include any future share repurchases.
Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I would like to again thank our team for our record-breaking first quarter results. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe we are very well-positioned to capitalize on this demand by consistently providing industry-leading service to our customers everyday. 
Again, congratulations to team O'Reilly for a very strong start to 2016. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw."

I'd like to begin my remarks by echoing Greg's comments and congratulating team O'Reilly on another outstanding quarter and a great start to 2016. 
Our team continued to exceed the high bar they've set with their past performance by once again delivering industry-leading comparable store sales growth and record profitability. The secret to our team's consistent track record of success really isn't a secret. It's our team's dedication of working harder than our competition and providing excellent service to each of our customers. 
For the quarter, we grew total revenues 10.2% and total gross margin dollars by 11.2%. Our incredibly steady run of generating profitable growth is a direct result of our ability to provide exceptional service, a wide product offering at competitive prices and superior parts availability. This growth doesn't happen without the dedication of our store, DC and office support teams.
Now I'd like to spend a little time talking about our SG&A expense for the first quarter. Our team continues to remain fully committed to building strong relationships with our customers and gaining market share, while at the same time, keeping a close eye on expenses. And as a result of their efforts, we levered SG&A by 108 basis points for the first quarter.
This SG&A performance exceeded our expectations and is a direct reflection of the discipline our team demonstrates in making sure that every expense dollar is spent to enhance our service to our customers. 
Our significant SG&A leverage is the result of our strong comparable sales results coupled with an increase in average SG&A per store of 2% in the first quarter, which is well within our expectations, especially in light of the higher variable cost associated with strong comps and increased customer count. 
We continue to expect our full year increase in average SG&A per store to be approximately 2%. However, we will closely monitor our sales volumes and we'll make appropriate adjustments as needed to prudently manage SG&A expenses, both up and down, to match business trends and the opportunities we see in the marketplace. 
We successfully opened 52 net new stores during the first quarter, and we continue to be pleased with the performance of our new stores. During the quarter, we opened stores in 22 different states, with the highest concentration in some of our newer growth markets in Florida and the Northeast as well as continued growth in existing markets, such as Texas.
As we've discussed in the past, our ability to continue to drive profitable growth for several years in Texas has strained our DC capacity, but we're excited to report that progress on the construction and stocking of our newest DC in the San Antonio market is right on schedule, and we're on target to open the DC in the next month.
The San Antonio DC will have the capacity to service approximately 250 stores. And over the course of the next few months, we will immediately transfer a significant number of stores to the new DC, bringing up much needed capacity in our Dallas and Houston DCs. 
Opening new stores and new distribution centers are long, complex processes that involve every area of our company.
Just as importantly, the most critical component of any new store or DC opening is the identification and training of the teams that will live the O'Reilly culture and provide excellent service to our customers.
Our store in DC leadership teams continue to do a fantastic job instilling our culture and business philosophy in our newest teams, and I want to thank them for their continued dedication to excellent customer service.
It's always a good thing to start off a new year with a great first quarter, and we're obviously pleased with the outstanding job by Team O'Reilly so far in 2016. 
As I close my comments, I must reiterate that we will never rest on past successes, but we'll continue to outhustle and out-service our competitors to earn our customers' business each and every day. I'm confident we have the right team in place to continue to provide unwavering customer service and take market share the rest of 2016. And I want to once again thank team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our company's success.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I'd also like to congratulate all of team O'Reilly on a great start to 2016. Now we'll take a closer look at our quarterly results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016.For the quarter, sales increased to $194 million, compri",1082,"Thanks, Jeff. I'd also like to congratulate all of team O'Reilly on a great start to 2016. 
Now we'll take a closer look at our quarterly results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016.
For the quarter, sales increased to $194 million, comprised of $113 million increase in comp store sales; a $52 million increase in non-comp store sales; a $24 million increase from leap day; a $6 million increase in non-comp non-store sales; and a $1 million decrease from closed stores.
For 2016, we continue to expect our total revenue to be $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion.
For the quarter, gross margin was 52.4% of sales and improved 47 basis points over the prior year. This was within the range of our expectations as we benefited from the mix of sales and leverage on distribution costs, driven by strong sales, offset by LIFO headwinds of $13 million, which were above our expectations. Excluding LIFO from both years, gross margin increased 66 basis points year-over-year.
As we described in our press release, and Greg mentioned earlier, we are anticipating significant unplanned LIFO headwinds in the second quarter. Specifically, we expect to see a LIFO charge related solely to a supplier renegotiation for a specific major hard parts line of approximately $23 million. This charge is the result of a macro shift in the supplier landscape for this product line and will impact margin above and beyond the normal pressure we see on a quarter-to-quarter basis from more routine acquisition cost decreases.
As a refresher, we incurred these noncash LIFO headwinds as a result of our historic success in reducing acquisition costs to the point where we have exhausted our LIFO reserve, and further cost decreases required us to reduce our existing inventory value to the lower cumulative acquisition cost.
While this specific new vendor deal will pressure our gross margin in the second quarter, we will realize improved gross margins from the lower acquisition cost on a go-forward basis. And we're reiterating our gross margin guidance of 52.3% to 52.7% of sales for the full year, with the expectation we may be in the bottom end of that range.
This assumes pricing in the industry will continue to remain rational.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.0% of pretax income. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 36.7%, with the remaining quarters being relatively consistent, with the exception of the third quarter when we adjust our tax reserves for the tolling of open tax periods. These estimates are subject to the resolution of open audits and our success in qualifying for existing job tax credit programs.
Now we move onto free cash flow and the components that drove our results. Free cash flow for the quarter was $384 million, which was a $69 million increase from the prior year, driven primarily by increased income. We are reiterating our full year guidance of $750 million to $800 million. 
Inventory per store in the quarter was $584,000, which is a 1.5% increase from the end of 2015. This growth rate was in line with our expectations for the quarter, and we continue to expect inventory per store to grow approximately 1.5% for the full year. 
Our ongoing goal is to ensure we are growing per store inventory at a lower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generate, and we expect to continue our success of effectively deploying inventory in 2016.
Our AP-to-inventory ratio finished the first quarter at 103%, which exceeded our expectations and represented a new high for this ratio. As we saw through much of 2015, our AP percentage in the first quarter benefited from incrementally improved terms and strong sales. 
As we progress through 2016, we expect our AP-to-inventory ratio to moderate somewhat to closer to 100% as we incrementally improve our vendor terms, but face the headwinds of a lower expected increase in sales based on our current comparable store sales guidance for the remainder of the year.
Capital expenditures for the quarter ended up at $104 million, which is up slightly from 2015 and in line with our expectations. We continue to forecast CapEx at $460 million to $490 million for the full year of 2016. 
Moving on to debt. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.72x, which is still well below our targeted ratio of 2 to 2.25x. However, it is up from the 1.52x at the end of 2015 as a result of our successful issuance of $500 million of senior notes in March. This was our first new debt issuance since the second quarter of 2013, and we were pleased with the execution of the senior notes offering and our ability to secure attractive long-term interest rates as an investment-grade borrower.
However, the incremental interest expense from this debt issuance will be a headwind to 2016 earnings per share until we effectively deploy this capital. 
We continue to believe our stated leverage range is appropriate for our business and we will move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
We also continue to execute our share repurchase program, and year-to-date, we've repurchased 1.5 million shares at an average share price of $256.94 for a total investment of $384 million. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business at a high rate of return. And we will prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns for our shareholders.
To recap our full year earnings per share guidance, we expect the LIFO headwinds in the second quarter and the incremental interest expense from our first quarter debt issuance to be offset by our first quarter EPS beat and the benefit of the shares repurchased since our fourth quarter conference call. As a result, we are reiterating our full year EPS guidance of $10.10 to $10.50. 
In line with our normal practice, our guidance includes all the shares repurchased through this call, but does not include any future share repurchases.
Finally, I would once again like to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued dedication to the company's success. Congratulations on an outstanding start to 2016.
This concludes our prepared comments. And at this time, I'd like to ask Brandon, the operator, to return to the line and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

And we've kind of expected some moderation to the 7%-plus quarterly comp store sales gains that we've been achieving as we continue to stack up these years and quarters of pretty incredible comp store sales growth. So we really don't see it as much of a change. I think, if you look at a 3-year  stack basis, it's actually a little bit of an improvement that I wouldn't relate it to anything specific other than towards the end of the period when we were comparing against real solid spring weather. At the end of the period last year, we had a pretty slow start to spring. We had markets where we had snow in the upper Midwest. When we didn't have snow last year, we shut business down. We had floods down in Texas, which we had stores closed for several days down at Texas at some point during the floods, which that comes back around as a positive in the long term, but it can affect short-term results."

And then, secondly, it creates some efficiency for us at the store by not taking a phone call and simply receiving a pick ticket and shipping a part, but the trade-off is you don't maybe develop as close of a personal relationship with the customers you would on a phone call, so there's some trade-offs.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts second quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Shaw, our Executive Vice President of Store Operations and Sales.
David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; and Greg Johnson, our Executive Vice President of Supply Chain, are also present.
It is once again my pleasure to begin our call today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another solid quarter and a strong first half of 2016. Our team has proven ability to provide superior value and service, drove on our industry-leading second quarter comparable store sales increase of 4.3%. These solid results were in line with our guidance of 3% to 5%, and we are pleased with our team's ability to generate this level of comparable store sales growth on top of last year's excellent second quarter comparable store sales increase of 7.2%. 
Our company's consistent market-leading performance is the direct result of our outstanding team of over 74,000 dedicated team members and their unwavering commitment to providing consistently excellent levels of customer service.
In total, we grew sales for the quarter by 7%, and combined with our team's relentless focus on profitable growth and expense management, we generated a quarterly operating margin of 19.5%, driving a 16% increase in earnings per share to $2.65.
This represents the 30th consecutive quarter we have grown EPS in excess of 15%, and this remarkable track record of strong earnings growth over such a long period of time is a testament to the effectiveness of our global market strategy in the unwavering commitment of Team O'Reilly to providing the best customer service in the automotive aftermarket.
The composition of our comparable sales growth in the second quarter was very similar to the first quarter. Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were contributors to our comparable store sales growth, with professional being slightly higher. 
We saw solid increases in both comparable ticket average and transaction count, with a larger contribution from our professional ticket count although our DIY ticket account continues to be solid.
The increase in average ticket continues to be driven by the secular industry driver of parts complexity with no help from increases in selling price as inflation on an individual's SKU-by-SKU basis remains muted.
When we look at the cadence of our sales performance for the quarter, results were steady throughout the quarter and within our guidance expectations for each month. We did experience some pressure in April and May due to the wet cool weather from the slow start to summer as well as pull forward of some business into the first quarter as a result of the mild weather especially in our stores in the middle of the country. However, hot weather benefited our businesses summer to cold in June and has continued into July with comparable store sales trends on a 2-year stack basis improved from the results we experienced in the first 2 months of the second quarter. 
On a category basis, we continue to see solid performance in keyword hard parts category, such as brakes, chassis and driveline, especially in our stores in the western and southeastern U.S. which were not impacted by the timing of the weather fluctuations in the first half of the year. 
As one would expect, weather-related categories, such as HVAC and batteries also performed extremely well in the back half of the quarter across the company as temperatures rose.
Looking at the broader aftermarket, we continue to benefit from positive tailwinds from modest improvement in total employment, low gas prices and continued solid growth in miles driven which were up 3.3% year-to-date through May. 
We feel these positive macroeconomic trends have been an important factor in fueling our steady comparable store sales growth, although to a lesser degree compared to the significant year-over-year tailwinds we experienced in 2015.
Considering all the factors driving our comparable store sales performance, and in light of the very tough comparisons we face on a 2-year and 3-year stack basis, we feel it's appropriate to set our third quarter comparable store sales guidance at a range of 3% to 5% in line with our full year guidance.
While we have our toughest comparable store sales comparisons from the third quarter last year in the month of July, we are off to a good start and are currently comping within our guidance range for the quarter. We feel our industry is in a very stable, healthy condition and more importantly, we remain very confident our team will continue to take share and generate results which outperform the overall market.
As we discussed during our first quarter Earnings Conference Call when we provided our gross profit and earnings per share outlook for the second quarter, our second quarter results included LIFO headwinds totaling $23 million, primarily driven by a specific second quarter deal. 
Tom will discuss this in more detail in a moment, but this headwind to margin was in line with our expectations, and we remain confident we will achieve our previously stated full year gross margin range of 52.3% to 52.7%.
As the result of our solid performance thus far in the first half of 2016, we are increasing our full year 2016 operating profit guidance from a range of 19.3% to 19.7%, to a range of 19.5% to 19.9% of sales.
For earnings per share, we're establishing our third quarter guidance at $2.77 to $2.87, which at the midpoint, would represent a 7% increase over EPS of $2.64 in the third quarter of last year.
As a reminder, our EPS results in the third quarter of 2015 included an $0.11 per share greater than typical benefit from the resolution of certain historical tax positions. 
On a comparable basis, the midpoint of our earnings per share guidance range would be an 11% increase over the prior year adjusted earnings per share of $2.53, absent this tax benefit.
We're increasing our full year earnings per share guidance from a range of $10.10 to $10.50 to a range of $10.30 to $10.70. Both the third quarter and full year, this updated guidance includes the impacted -- the impact of shares repurchase today's call but excludes any potential additional share repurchases.
Before I turn it over to Jeff, I would like to again thank our team for another outstanding quarter. We remained very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe we are very well positioned to capitalize on this demand and lead the industry will consist and providing exceptional service our customers everyday.
Again, congratulations Team O'Reilly for a very strong start of 2015. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw."

I'd like to begin today by echoing Greg's comments and congratulating Team O'Reilly on another strong quarter.
I'm extremely proud of our team's execution and the level of consistent top-notch service that we continue to provide to our customers day in and day out. 
Our comparable store sales growth of 4.3% on top of 7.2% in the prior year again outpaced the market. In this industry-leading performance is the direct result of our team's commitment to outhustling and outservicing the competition each and everyday. 
I want to thank each of our team members for their continued hard work and dedication to make it O'Reilly Auto Parts the destination location for all of our customers' auto parts needs. 
For the quarter, we levered SG&A by 80 basis points. As a reminder, included in SG&A in the second quarter of 2015 was a headwind of $19 million from an adverse judgment in a long-term dispute with a former service provider, and our leverage in the second quarter of this year benefited 93 basis points from the comparison to this item.
Excluding the adverse judgment in 2015, we delevered 13 basis points as a result of the tough comparisons to the robust sales we generated in the second quarter of 2015.
As always, our teams remain very focused on expense control, but will be judicious in managing our store staffing levels to ensure we don't jeopardize the excellent customer service that develops and maintains long-term relationships.
Average per store SG&A for the second quarter increased 2.9% over 2015, excluding the adverse judgment in 2015, which was within our expectations and driven by expected higher medical costs and a comparatively more aggressive advertising campaign as we discussed when we established our full year guidance at the beginning of the year.
We continue to expect our full year average SG&A per store to increase approximately 2% over 2015 average SG&A, excluding the adverse judgment. However, we'll closely monitor our sales volumes and will make the appropriate adjustments as needed to prudently manage SG&A expenses, both up and down to match business trends and the opportunities we see in the marketplace.
We successfully opened 89 net new stores in the first half of 2016, and we continue to be pleased with the performance of our new stores. We continue to see heavier concentrations of growth in our expansion markets in Florida and the Northeast, but we're also capitalizing on great growth opportunities across our footprint. And as a result, our store growth so far in 2016 was spread across 28 different states.
Our ability to effectively enter new markets while also selectively expanding our presence in existing markets continues to give us a great advantage in choosing new sites, and more importantly, identifying, hiring and training outstanding store teams to provide excellent customer service in our new stores.
As we've discussed in the past, Texas is one of our long-time markets where we continue to see strong growth opportunities and where our new store growth had stretched our distribution capacity. To this end, we're very pleased to announce the seamless opening in May of our newest DC in Soma, Texas, a Northeastern suburb of the San Antonio market. This new DC will allow us to improve our parts availability in the rapidly growing San Antonio Metro market and will also enhance our service in the Austin market, another strong market for us just an hour drive of the interstate from our new DC. 
The San Antonio DC has a capacity to service approximately 250 stores and has ramped up extremely well by transferring neither replenishment for 166 stores from our existing Texas DCs in Dallas, Houston and Lubbock, creating capacity for new growth across the State of Texas.
As we've said many times in the past, opening a new DC is a long process and is much more difficult and complex than our DC leadership teams make it seem. Opening a backfill DC in such a strong existing market is an especially challenging task since the store service by San Antonio and our customers in those markets have high service expectations because of the great track record we've established over a long period of time. Well, the San Antonio team did an amazing job getting it up and running without missing a beat, and we're extremely proud of the excellent team we have in place, providing outstanding and enhanced service to our customers in Central and Southern Texas.
As I close my comments, I want to thank Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our company's success. We've had a solid year so far. We're also well positioned to continue to provide our customers exceptional service and the best parts availability in the industry, and we intend to finish the year strong.
That said, we will never rest on our past successes. We know we have to go out and win the business each and everyday by outhustling and outservicing our competitors, and I'm very competent our team's ability to do just that.

I'd also like to begin today by thanking Team O'Reilly for another successful quarter.Now we'll take a closer look at our second quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016.For the quarter, sales increased $141 mill",1039,"Thanks, Jeff. I'd also like to begin today by thanking Team O'Reilly for another successful quarter.
Now we'll take a closer look at our second quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016.
For the quarter, sales increased $141 million, comprised of an $85 million increase in comp store sales; a $56 million increase in noncomp store sales;  a $1 million increase in noncomp nonstore sales; and a $1 million decrease from closed stores.
For 2016, we continue to expect our total revenues to be $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion.
For the quarter, gross margin was 51.8% of sales, a 23-basis-point decrease from the prior year. The decrease was driven by a larger-than-typical LIFO headwind of $23 million, which was in line with our previous guidance. And as we've discussed previously, related primarily to a supplier renegotiation for a specific major hard parts line. 
As we've discussed in the past, our success of reducing our acquisition cost overtime has exhausted our LIFO reserve and further cost decreases requires to reduce our existing inventory value to the lower cumulative acquisition cost, creating noncash headwinds to gross margin.
Excluding LIFO from both years, gross margin increased 31 basis points year-over-year. 
Moving forward, we will realize improved gross margins from lower acquisition cost and we reiterating our gross margin guidance of 52.3%  to 52.7% of sales for the full year. This assumes pricing and industry continues to remain rational. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.9% of pretax income. For the full year, we expect our pre-tax rate to be 36.8%.
As is typical for us in most years, we anticipate our third quarter tax rate to be lower as we adjust for the expected tolling of certain historical tax periods. We expect our third quarter rate to be approximately 35.8% of pretax income, which is significantly above the tax rate of 33.6% we saw in the third quarter of 2015 due to the large positive nontypical tax reserve adjustment in the third quarter of 2015 relating to a previous acquisition.
We expect the fourth quarter to return to a more normal rate of 37.3% of pretax income.
These estimates are subject to the resolution of open audits and our success in qualifying for existing job tax credit programs.
Now I'd like to provide some more color on our free cash flow results and provide updated guidance expectations for the full year of 2016.
We generated $194 million in free cash flow for the quarter, which is relatively flat with prior year. Year-to-date, we generated $578 million in free cash flow compared to $512 million in the prior year.
And based on our successful management of working capital, primarily net inventory, we're raising our full year free cash flow guidance from a range of $750 million to $800 million to a range of $800 million to $850 million.
Inventory per store at the end of the second quarter was 588,000, which was a 2.2% increase from the end of 2015. This growth rate was in line with our expectations for the quarter, and we still expect our full year inventory per store to grow approximately 1.5% based on normal seasonal differences.
Our ongoing goal is to ensure we grow per store inventory at a lower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generate, and we expect to continue our success of effectively deploying inventory in 2016.
Our AP-to-inventory ratio finished the second quarter at 106%, which exceeded our expectations and represented a new high ratio. Our AP percentage continues the benefit from incrementally improved terms and strong sales volumes over the past 12 months. However, as we move into the back half of 2016, we expect our AP-to-inventory ratio to moderate somewhat from its current levels to a number slightly above 100% as we incrementally improve our vendor terms but faced the headwinds of seasonality and the lower expected increase in sales based on our current comparable store sales guidance for the remainder of the year. 
Capital expenditures for the first 6 months were $220 million, which was up from 2015 and in line with our expectations. We continue to forecast CapEx at $460 million to $490 million for the full year of 2016.
Moving on to debt. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.69x, down from 1.72x at the end of the first quarter, driven by a strong trailing 12-month operating income performance. We're still well below our targeted ratio of 2 to 2.25x, however, we continue to believe our stated leverage range is appropriate for our business and will move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
We continue to execute our share repurchase program, and during the second quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of our stock at an average cost up $262.17 per share. Year-to-date through yesterday, we repurchased 3.3 million shares at an average share price of $259.19 for a total investment of $861 million. 
We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business at a higher rate of return, and we will prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns for our shareholders.
Based on our results during the first half of the year and the additional share repurchases since our last call, for the full year, we are raising our earnings per share guidance to a range of $10.30 to $10.70 per share, representing an increase of $0.20 per share from the annual guidance we provided during our first quarter earnings release. 
In line with our normal practice, our guidance includes all of the shares repurchased through this call, but does that include any future share repurchases.
Before I turn the call over to our analysts for questions, I would once again like to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued hard work and dedication to providing consistently high levels of service to our customers. Congratulations on another solid quarter. 
This concludes our prepared comments, and at this time, I'd like to ask, Richard, the operator, to return to the line and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

So I think that's part of it. But the big part of it is just advice. A lot of the DIY customers that walk into our stores are doing repairs on their cars not because they're hobbyist or doing so. Because they have economic drivers in their household that require that they work on their own car and were able to have them fix their car in the most efficient, expedient way. And online, they're just unable to do that. So they risk being parts and according to their need. Putting parts in their car that may have fix their car.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts' second quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Shaw, our Executive Vice President of Store Operations & Sales. David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; and Greg Johnson, our Executive Vice President of Supply Chain, are also present.
It is once again my pleasure to begin our call today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another solid quarter and a strong first half of 2016. Our team has proven ability to provide superior value and service, drove our industry-leading second quarter comparable store sales increase of 4.3%. These solid results were in line with our guidance of 3% to 5%, and we are pleased with our team's ability to generate this level of comparable store sales growth on top of last year's excellent second quarter comparable store sales increase of 7.2%. 
Our company's consistent market-leading performance is the direct result of our outstanding team of over 74,000 dedicated team members and their unwavering commitment to providing consistently excellent levels of customer service.
In total, we grew sales for the quarter by 7%. And combined with our team's relentless focus on profitable growth and expense management, we generated a quarterly operating margin of 19.5%, driving a 16% increase in earnings per share to $2.65. This represents the 30th consecutive quarter we have grown EPS in excess of 15%, and this remarkable track record of strong earnings growth over such a long period of time is a testament to the effectiveness of our dual market strategy and the unwavering commitment of Team O'Reilly to providing the best customer service in the automotive aftermarket.
The composition of our comparable store sales growth in the second quarter was very similar to the first quarter. Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were contributors to our comparable store sales growth, with professional being slightly higher. We saw solid increases in both comparable ticket average and transaction count, with a larger contribution from our professional ticket count, although our DIY ticket account continues to be solid. The increase in average ticket continues to be driven by the secular industry driver of parts complexity with no help from increases in selling price, as inflation on an individual SKU-by-SKU basis remains muted.
When we look at the cadence of our sales performance for the quarter, results were steady throughout the quarter and within our guidance expectations for each month. We did experience some pressure in April and May due to the wet, cool weather from the slow start to summer as well as pull forward of some business into the first quarter as a result of the mild winter, especially in our stores in the middle of the country. However, hot weather benefited our businesses summer took hold in June and has continued into July, with comparable store sales trends on a 2-year stack basis improved from the results we experienced in the first 2 months of the second quarter.
On a category basis, we continue to see solid performance in key hard parts categories, such as brakes, chassis and driveline, especially in our stores in the Western and Southeastern U.S. which were not impacted by the timing of the weather fluctuations in the first half of the year. As one would expect, weather-related categories, such as HVAC and batteries, also performed extremely well in the back half of the quarter across the company as temperatures rose.
Looking at the broader aftermarket, we continue to benefit from positive tailwinds from modest improvements in total employment, low gas prices and continued solid growth in miles driven, which were up 3.3% year-to-date through May. We feel these positive macroeconomic trends have been an important factor in fueling our steady comparable store sales growth, although to a lesser degree compared to the significant year-over-year tailwinds we experienced in 2015.
Considering all the factors driving our comparable store sales performance, and in light of the very tough comparisons we face on a 2-year and 3-year stack basis, we feel it's appropriate to set our third quarter comparable store sales guidance at a range of 3% to 5% in line with our full year guidance.
While we have our toughest comparable store sales comparisons from the third quarter last year in the month of July, we are off to a good start and are currently comping within our guidance range for the quarter. We feel our industry is in a very stable, healthy condition and, more importantly, we remain very confident our team will continue to take share and generate results which outperform the overall market.
As we discussed during our first quarter earnings conference call, when we provided our gross profit and earnings per share outlook for the second quarter, our second quarter results included LIFO headwinds totaling $23 million, primarily driven by a specific second quarter deal. Tom will discuss this in more detail in a moment, but this headwind to margin was in line with our expectations, and we remain confident we will achieve our previously stated full year gross margin range of 52.3% to 52.7%. 
As the result of our solid performance thus far in the first half of 2016, we are increasing our full year 2016 operating profit guidance from a range of 19.3% to 19.7%, to a range of 19.5% to 19.9% of sales. For earnings per share, we are establishing our third quarter guidance at $2.77 to $2.87, which, at the midpoint, would represent a 7% increase over EPS of $2.64 in the third quarter of last year. As a reminder, our EPS results in the third quarter of 2015 included an $0.11 per share greater-than-typical benefit from the resolution of certain historical tax positions. 
On a comparable basis, the midpoint of our earnings per share guidance range would be an 11% increase over the prior year adjusted earnings per share of $2.53, absent this tax benefit. We're increasing our full year earnings per share guidance from a range of $10.10 to $10.50, to a range of $10.30 to $10.70. Both for the third quarter and full year, this updated guidance includes the impacted -- the impact of shares repurchased through this call, but excludes any potential additional share repurchases.
Before I turn it over to Jeff, I would like to, again, thank our team for another outstanding quarter. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe we are very well positioned to capitalize on this demand and lead the industry will consist and providing exceptional service our customers every day.
Again, congratulations Team O'Reilly for a very strong start of 2016.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw."

I'd like to begin today by echoing Greg's comments and congratulating Team O'Reilly on another strong quarter. I'm extremely proud of our team's execution and the level of consistent top-notch service that we continue to provide to our customers day in and day out. 
Our comparable store sales growth of 4.3% on top of 7.2% in the prior year again outpaced the market. And this industry-leading performance is the direct result of our team's commitment to outhustling and outservicing the competition each and every day. I want to thank each of our team members for their continued hard work and dedication to making O'Reilly Auto Parts the destination location for all of our customers' auto parts needs. 
For the quarter, we levered SG&A by 80 basis points. As a reminder, included in SG&A in the second quarter of 2015 was a headwind of $19 million from an adverse judgment in a long-term dispute with a former service provider, and our leverage in the second quarter of this year benefited 93 basis points from the comparison to this item. Excluding the adverse judgment in 2015, we delevered 13 basis points as a result of the tough comparisons to the robust sales we generated in the second quarter of 2015.
As always, our teams remain very focused on expense control, but will be judicious in managing our store staffing levels to ensure we don't jeopardize the excellent customer service that develops and maintains long-term relationships. Average per store SG&A for the second quarter increased 2.9% over 2015, excluding the adverse judgment in 2015, which was within our expectations and driven by expected higher medical costs and comparatively more aggressive advertising campaign as we discussed when we established our full year guidance at the beginning of the year.
We continue to expect our full year average SG&A per store to increase approximately 2% over 2015 average SG&A, excluding the adverse judgment. However, we'll closely monitor our sales volumes and will make the appropriate adjustments as needed to prudently manage SG&A expenses, both up and down to match business trends and the opportunities we see in the marketplace.
We successfully opened 89 net new stores in the first half of 2016, and we continue to be pleased with the performance of our new stores. We continue to see heavier concentrations of growth in our expansion markets in Florida and the northeast, but we're also capitalizing on great growth opportunities across our footprint. And as a result, our store growth so far in 2016 was spread across 28 different states.
Our ability to effectively enter new markets, while also selectively expanding our presence in existing markets, continues to give us a great advantage in choosing new sites; and more importantly, identifying, hiring and training outstanding store teams to provide excellent customer service in our new stores.
As we've discussed in the past, Texas is one of our long-time markets where we continue to see strong growth opportunities, and where our new store growth had stretched our distribution capacity. To this end, we're very pleased to announce the seamless opening in May of our newest DC in Selma, Texas, a northeastern suburb of the San Antonio market. This new DC will allow us to improve our parts availability in the rapidly growing San Antonio metro market and will also enhance our service in the Austin market, another strong market for us, just an hour drive off the interstate from our new DC. The San Antonio DC has a capacity to service approximately 250 stores and has ramped up extremely well by transferring neither replenishment for 166 stores from our existing Texas DCs in Dallas, Houston and Lubbock, creating capacity for new growth across the state of Texas.
As we've said many times in the past, opening a new DC is a long process and is much more difficult and complex than our DC leadership teams make it seem. Opening a backfill DC in such a strong existing market is an especially challenging test since the stores serviced by San Antonio and our customers in those markets have high service expectations because of the great track record we've established over a long period of time. Well, the San Antonio team did an amazing job getting it up and running without missing a beat, and we're extremely proud of the excellent team we have in place, providing outstanding and enhanced service to our customers in Central and Southern Texas.
As I close my comments, I want to thank Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our company's success. We've had a solid year so far. We're also well positioned to continue to provide our customers exceptional service and the best parts availability in the industry, and we intend to finish the year strong. That said, we will never rest on our past successes. We know we have to go out and win the business each and every day by outhustling and outservicing our competitors, and I'm very confident in our team's ability to do just that. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."
324289,370662144,1015708,"O'Reilly Automotive Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'd also like to begin today by thanking Team O'Reilly for another successful quarter.Now we'll take a closer look at our second quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016. For the quarter, sales increased $141 milli",1048,"Thanks, Jeff. I'd also like to begin today by thanking Team O'Reilly for another successful quarter.
Now we'll take a closer look at our second quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016. For the quarter, sales increased $141 million, comprised of an $85 million increase in comp store sales; a $56 million increase in noncomp store sales; a $1 million increase in noncomp, nonstore sales; and a $1 million decrease from closed stores. For 2016, we continue to expect our total revenues to be $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion.
For the quarter, gross margin was 51.8% of sales, a 23 basis point decrease from the prior year. The decrease was driven by a larger-than-typical LIFO headwind of $23 million, which was in line with our previous guidance. And as we've discussed previously, related primarily to a supplier renegotiation for a specific major hard parts line. As we've discussed in the past, our success of reducing our acquisition cost overtime has exhausted our LIFO reserve, and further cost decreases requires to reduce our existing inventory value to the lower cumulative acquisition cost, creating noncash headwinds to gross margin. Excluding LIFO from both years, gross margin increased 31 basis points year-over-year. Moving forward, we will realize improved gross margins from lower acquisition cost, and we're reiterating our gross margin guidance of 52.3%  to 52.7% of sales for the full year. This assumes pricing and industry continues to remain rational.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.9% of pretax income. For the full year, we expect our pre-tax rate to be 36.8%. As is typical for us in most years, we anticipate our third quarter tax rate to be lower as we adjust for the expected tolling of certain historical tax periods. We expect our third quarter rate to be approximately 35.8% of pretax income, which is significantly above the tax rate of 33.6% we saw in the third quarter of 2015 due to the large positive nontypical tax reserve adjustment in the third quarter of 2015 relating to a previous acquisition. We expect the fourth quarter to return to a more normal rate of 37.3% of pretax income. These estimates are subject to the resolution of open audits and our success in qualifying for existing job tax credit programs.
Now I'd like to provide some more color on our free cash flow results and provide updated guidance expectations for the full year of 2016. We generated $194 million in free cash flow for the quarter, which is relatively flat with prior year. Year-to-date, we generated $578 million in free cash flow compared to $512 million in the prior year. And based on our successful management of working capital, primarily net inventory, we're raising our full year free cash flow guidance from a range of $750 million to $800 million to a range of $800 million to $850 million.
Inventory per store at the end of the second quarter was 588,000, which was a 2.2% increase from the end of 2015. This growth rate was in line with our expectations for the quarter, and we still expect our full year inventory per store to grow approximately 1.5% based on normal seasonal differences. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we grow per store inventory at a lower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generate, and we expect to continue our success of effectively deploying inventory in 2016.
Our AP-to-inventory ratio finished the second quarter at 106%, which exceeded our expectations and represented a new high ratio. Our AP percentage continues to benefit from incrementally improved terms and strong sales volumes over the past 12 months. However, as we move into the back half of 2016, we expect our AP-to-inventory ratio to moderate somewhat from its current levels to a number slightly above 100%, as we incrementally improve our vendor terms but faced the headwinds of seasonality and the lower expected increase in sales based on our current comparable store sales guidance for the remainder of the year. 
Capital expenditures for the first 6 months were $220 million, which was up from 200 -- excuse me, which was up from 2015 and in line with our expectations. We continue to forecast CapEx at $460 million to $490 million for the full year of 2016.
Moving on to debt. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.69x, down from 1.72x at the end of the first quarter, driven by a strong trailing 12-month operating income performance. We're still well below our targeted ratio of 2 to 2.25x; however, we continue to believe our stated leverage range is appropriate for our business and we'll move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
We continue to execute our share repurchase program, and during the second quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of our stock at an average cost up $262.17 per share. Year-to-date through yesterday, we've repurchased 3.3 million shares at an average share price of $259.19 for a total investment of $861 million. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business at a higher rate of return, and we will prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns for our shareholders.
Based on our results during the first half of the year and the additional share repurchases since our last call, for the full year, we're raising our earnings per share guidance to a range of $10.30 to $10.70 per share, representing an increase of $0.20 per share from the annual guidance we provided during our first quarter earnings release. In line with our normal practice, our guidance includes all of the shares repurchased through this call, but does that include any future share repurchases.
Before I turn the call over to our analysts for questions, I would once again like to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued hard work and dedication to providing consistently high levels of service to our customers. Congratulations on another solid quarter. 
This concludes our prepared comments. And at this time, I'd like to ask, Richard, the operator, to return to the line and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

But you always risk getting the wrong part or the application not being correct, or you're not being able to have something that you might need that a parts specialists will recommend.

While we wouldn't be selling at prices that some of the online retailers would, I don't think we're that far off and wouldn't be far enough off that it would take make sense to take freight and buy the parts online. So I think that's part of it. But the big part of it is just advice. A lot of the DIY customers that walk into our stores are doing repairs on their cars not because they're hobbyist or doing so, because they have economic drivers in their household that require that they work on their own car, and we're able to have them fix their car in the most efficient and expedient way. And online retailers just aren't able to do that. So they risk putting parts in their car they may not need. Putting parts in their car that may not fix their car. And it always helps to get advice when you work on a car, and we have a lot of guys that give great advice."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts' second quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Shaw, our Executive Vice President of Store Operations & Sales. David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; and Greg Johnson, our Executive Vice President of Supply Chain, are also present.
It is once again my pleasure to begin our call today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another solid quarter and a strong first half of 2016. Our team's proven ability to provide superior value and service, drove our industry-leading second quarter comparable store sales increase of 4.3%. These solid results were in line with our guidance of 3% to 5%, and we are pleased with our team's ability to generate this level of comparable store sales growth on top of last year's excellent second quarter comparable store sales increase of 7.2%. 
Our company's consistent market-leading performance is the direct result of our outstanding team of over 74,000 dedicated team members and their unwavering commitment to providing consistently excellent levels of customer service.
In total, we grew sales for the quarter by 7%. And combined with our team's relentless focus on profitable growth and expense management, we generated a quarterly operating margin of 19.5%, driving a 16% increase in earnings per share to $2.65. This represents the 30th consecutive quarter we have grown EPS in excess of 15%, and this remarkable track record of strong earnings growth over such a long period of time is a testament to the effectiveness of our dual market strategy and the unwavering commitment of Team O'Reilly to providing the best customer service in the automotive aftermarket.
The composition of our comparable store sales growth in the second quarter was very similar to the first quarter. Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were contributors to our comparable store sales growth, with professional being slightly higher. We saw solid increases in both comparable ticket average and transaction count, with a larger contribution from our professional ticket count, although our DIY ticket count continues to be solid. The increase in average ticket continues to be driven by the secular industry driver of parts complexity with no help from increases in selling price, as inflation on an individual SKU-by-SKU basis remains muted.
When we look at the cadence of our sales performance for the quarter, results were steady throughout the quarter and within our guidance expectations for each month. We did experience some pressure in April and May due to the wet, cool weather from the slow start to summer as well as pull forward of some business into the first quarter as a result of the mild winter, especially in our stores in the middle of the country. However, hot weather benefited our businesses. Summer took hold in June and has continued into July, with comparable store sales trends on a 2-year stack basis improved from the results we experienced in the first 2 months of the second quarter.
On a category basis, we continue to see solid performance in key hard parts categories, such as brakes, chassis and driveline, especially in our stores in the Western and Southeastern U.S. which were not impacted by the timing of the weather fluctuations in the first half of the year. As one would expect, weather-related categories, such as HVAC and batteries, also performed extremely well in the back half of the quarter across the company as temperatures rose.
Looking at the broader aftermarket, we continue to benefit from positive tailwinds from modest improvements in total employment, low gas prices and continued solid growth in miles driven, which were up 3.3% year-to-date through May. We feel these positive macroeconomic trends have been an important factor in fueling our steady comparable store sales growth, although to a lesser degree compared to the significant year-over-year tailwinds we experienced in 2015.
Considering all the factors driving our comparable store sales performance, and in light of the very tough comparisons we face on a 2-year and 3-year stack basis, we feel it's appropriate to set our third quarter comparable store sales guidance at a range of 3% to 5% in line with our full year guidance.
While we have our toughest comparable store sales comparisons from the third quarter last year in the month of July, we are off to a good start and are currently comping within our guidance range for the quarter. We feel our industry is in a very stable, healthy condition and, more importantly, we remain very confident our team will continue to take share and generate results which outperform the overall market.
As we discussed during our first quarter earnings conference call, when we provided our gross profit and earnings per share outlook for the second quarter, our second quarter results included LIFO headwinds totaling $23 million, primarily driven by a specific second quarter deal. Tom will discuss this in more detail in a moment, but this headwind to margin was in line with our expectations, and we remain confident we will achieve our previously stated full year gross margin range of 52.3% to 52.7%. 
As the result of our solid performance thus far in the first half of 2016, we are increasing our full year 2016 operating profit guidance from a range of 19.3% to 19.7%, to a range of 19.5% to 19.9% of sales. For earnings per share, we are establishing our third quarter guidance at $2.77 to $2.87, which, at the midpoint, would represent a 7% increase over EPS of $2.64 in the third quarter of last year. As a reminder, our EPS results in the third quarter of 2015 included an $0.11 per share greater-than-typical benefit from the resolution of certain historical tax positions. 
On a comparable basis, the midpoint of our earnings per share guidance range would be an 11% increase over the prior year adjusted earnings per share of $2.53, absent this tax benefit. We're increasing our full year earnings per share guidance from a range of $10.10 to $10.50, to a range of $10.30 to $10.70. Both for the third quarter and full year, this updated guidance includes the impacted -- the impact of shares repurchased through this call, but excludes any potential additional share repurchases.
Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I would like to, again, thank our team for another outstanding quarter. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe we are very well positioned to capitalize on this demand and lead the industry by consistently providing exceptional service to our customers every day.
Again, congratulations, Team O'Reilly, for a very strong start to 2016.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw."

As a reminder, included in SG&A in the second quarter of 2015 was a headwind of $19 million from an adverse judgment in a long-term dispute with a former service provider, and our leverage in the second quarter of this year benefited 93 basis points from the comparison to this item. Excluding the adverse judgment in 2015, we delevered 13 basis points as a result of the tough comparisons to the robust sales we generated in the second quarter of 2015.
As always, our teams remain very focused on expense control, but will be judicious in managing our store staffing levels to ensure we don't jeopardize the excellent customer service that develops and maintains long-term relationships. Average per store SG&A for the second quarter increased 2.9% over 2015, excluding the adverse judgment in 2015, which was within our expectations and driven by expected higher medical costs and a comparatively more aggressive advertising campaign, as we discussed when we established our full year guidance at the beginning of the year.
We continue to expect our full year average SG&A per store to increase approximately 2% over 2015 average SG&A, excluding the adverse judgment. However, we'll closely monitor our sales volumes and will make the appropriate adjustments as needed to prudently manage SG&A expenses, both up and down to match business trends and the opportunities we see in the marketplace.
We successfully opened 89 net [ph] new stores in the first half of 2016, and we continue to be pleased with the performance of our new stores. We continue to see heavier concentrations of growth in our expansion markets in Florida and the northeast, but we're also capitalizing on great growth opportunities across our footprint. And as a result, our store growth so far in 2016 was spread across 28 different states.
Our ability to effectively enter new markets, while also selectively expanding our presence in existing markets, continues to give us a great advantage in choosing new sites; and more importantly, identifying, hiring and training outstanding store teams to provide excellent customer service in our new stores.
As we've discussed in the past, Texas is one of our long-time markets where we continue to see strong growth opportunities, and where our new store growth had stretched our distribution capacity. To this end, we're very pleased to announce the seamless opening in May of our newest DC in Selma, Texas, a northeastern suburb of the San Antonio market. This new DC will allow us to improve our parts availability in the rapidly growing San Antonio metro market and will also enhance our service in the Austin market, another strong market for us, just an hour drive of the interstate from our new DC. The San Antonio DC has a capacity to service approximately 250 stores and has ramped up extremely well by transferring neither [ph] replenishment for 166 stores from our existing Texas DCs in Dallas, Houston and Lubbock, creating capacity for new growth across the state of Texas.
As we've said many times in the past, opening a new DC is a long process and is much more difficult and complex than our DC leadership teams make it seem. Opening a backfill DC in such a strong existing market is an especially challenging test since the stores serviced by San Antonio and our customers in those markets have high service expectations because of the great track record we've established over a long period of time. Well, the San Antonio team did an amazing job getting it up and running without missing a beat, and we're extremely proud of the excellent team we have in place, providing outstanding and enhanced service to our customers in Central and Southern Texas.
As I close my comments, I want to thank Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our company's success. We've had a solid year so far. We're also well positioned to continue to provide our customers exceptional service and the best parts availability in the industry, and we intend to finish the year strong. That said, we will never rest on our past successes. We know we have to go out and win the business each and every day by outhustling and outservicing our competitors, and I'm very confident in our team's ability to do just that. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."
324289,370662144,1015926,"O'Reilly Automotive Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'd also like to begin today by thanking Team O'Reilly for another successful quarter.Now we'll take a closer look at our second quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016. For the quarter, sales increased $141 milli",1049,"Thanks, Jeff. I'd also like to begin today by thanking Team O'Reilly for another successful quarter.
Now we'll take a closer look at our second quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016. For the quarter, sales increased $141 million, comprised of an $85 million increase in comp store sales; a $56 million increase in noncomp store sales; a $1 million increase in noncomp, nonstore sales; and a $1 million decrease from closed stores. For 2016, we continue to expect our total revenues to be $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion.
For the quarter, gross margin was 51.8% of sales, a 23 basis point decrease from the prior year. The decrease was driven by a larger-than-typical LIFO headwind of $23 million, which was in line with our previous guidance and, as we've discussed previously, related primarily to a supplier renegotiation for a specific major hard parts line. As we've discussed in the past, our success of reducing our acquisition cost overtime has exhausted our LIFO reserve, and further cost decreases require us to reduce our existing inventory value to the lower cumulative acquisition cost, creating noncash headwinds to gross margin. Excluding LIFO from both years, gross margin increased 31 basis points year-over-year. Moving forward, we will realize improved gross margins from the lower acquisition cost, and we're reiterating our gross margin guidance of 52.3%  to 52.7% of sales for the full year. This assumes pricing in industry continues to remain rational.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.9% of pretax income. For the full year, we expect our pre-tax rate to be 36.8%. As is typical for us in most years, we anticipate our third quarter tax rate to be lower as we adjust for the expected tolling of certain historical tax periods. We expect our third quarter rate to be approximately 35.8% of pretax income, which is significantly above the tax rate of 33.6% we saw in the third quarter of 2015 due to the large, positive, nontypical tax reserve adjustment in the third quarter of 2015 relating to a previous acquisition. We expect the fourth quarter to return to a more normal rate of 37.3% of pretax income. These estimates are subject to the resolution of open audits and our success in qualifying for existing job tax credit programs.
Now I'd like to provide some more color on our free cash flow results and provide updated guidance expectations for the full year of 2016. We generated $194 million in free cash flow for the quarter, which is relatively flat with prior year. Year-to-date, we generated $578 million in free cash flow compared to $512 million in the prior year. And based on our successful management of working capital, primarily net inventory, we're raising our full year free cash flow guidance from a range of $750 million to $800 million to a range of $800 million to $850 million.
Inventory per store at the end of the second quarter was 588,000, which was a 2.2% increase from the end of 2015. This growth rate was in line with our expectations for the quarter, and we still expect our full year inventory per store to grow approximately 1.5% based on normal seasonal differences. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we grow per store inventory at a lower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generate, and we expect to continue our success of effectively deploying inventory in 2016.
Our AP-to-inventory ratio finished the second quarter at 106%, which exceeded our expectations and represented a new high ratio. Our AP percentage continues to benefit from incrementally improved terms and strong sales volumes over the past 12 months. However, as we move into the back half of 2016, we expect our AP-to-inventory ratio to moderate somewhat from its current levels to a number slightly above 100%, as we incrementally improve our vendor terms but face the headwinds of seasonality and the lower expected increase in sales based on our current comparable store sales guidance for the remainder of the year. 
Capital expenditures for the first 6 months were $220 million, which was up 200 -- excuse me, which was up from 2015 and in line with our expectations. We continue to forecast CapEx at $460 million to $490 million for the full year of 2016.
Moving on to debt. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.69x, down from 1.72x at the end of the first quarter, driven by a strong, trailing 12-month operating income performance. We're still well below our targeted ratio of 2 to 2.25x; however, we continue to believe our stated leverage range is appropriate for our business and we'll move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
We continue to execute our share repurchase program, and during the second quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $262.17 per share. Year-to-date through yesterday, we've repurchased 3.3 million shares at an average share price of $259.19 for a total investment of $861 million. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business at a high rate of return, and we will prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns for our shareholders.
Based on our results during the first half of the year and the additional share repurchases since our last call, for the full year, we're raising our earnings per share guidance to a range of $10.30 to $10.70 per share, representing an increase of $0.20 per share from the annual guidance we provided during our first quarter earnings release. In line with our normal practice, our guidance includes all of the shares repurchased through this call, but does not include any future share repurchases.
Before I turn the call over to our analysts for questions, I would once again like to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued hard work and dedication to providing consistently high levels of service to our customers. Congratulations on another solid quarter. 
This concludes our prepared comments. And at this time, I'd like to ask, Richard, the operator, to return to the line and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

Mainly, the immediacy of need -- a car breaks, you need a part. Some of the maintenance stuff you could, of course, order online, maybe wait for a weekend or something. But you always risk getting the wrong part or the application not being correct, or you're not being able to have something that you might need that a parts specialists would recommend. Plus, across the U.S., there's 35,000 parts stores, so there's very few places geographically that there's not a parts store fairly close. I think we're all pretty price competitive. While we wouldn't be selling at prices that some of the online retailers would, I don't think we're that far off and wouldn't be far enough off that it would take make sense to pay freight and buy the parts online. So I think that's part of it. 
But the big part of it is just advice. A lot of the DIY customers that walk into our stores are doing repairs on their cars, not because they're hobbyists. They're doing so because they have economic drivers in their household that require that they work on their own car, and we're able to help them fix their car in the most efficient and expedient way. And online retailers just aren't able to do that. So they risk putting parts in their car they may not need; putting parts in their car that may not fix their car.

The little window that you have when the school starts and you're going to go through fall, and then an abrupt start to a real cold winter, that would be ideal and that would drive good comps for all of us."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts' second quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Shaw, our Executive Vice President",1129,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts' second quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Shaw, our Executive Vice President of Store Operations & Sales. David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; and Greg Johnson, our Executive Vice President of Supply Chain, are also present.
It is once again my pleasure to begin our call today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another solid quarter and a strong first half of 2016. Our team's proven ability to provide superior value and service, drove our industry-leading second quarter comparable store sales increase of 4.3%. These solid results were in line with our guidance of 3% to 5%, and we are pleased with our team's ability to generate this level of comparable store sales growth on top of last year's excellent second quarter comparable store sales increase of 7.2%. 
Our company's consistent market-leading performance is the direct result of our outstanding team of over 74,000 dedicated team members and their unwavering commitment to providing consistently excellent levels of customer service.
In total, we grew sales for the quarter by 7%. And combined with our team's relentless focus on profitable growth and expense management, we generated a quarterly operating margin of 19.5%, driving a 16% increase in earnings per share to $2.65. This represents the 30th consecutive quarter we have grown EPS in excess of 15%, and this remarkable track record of strong earnings growth over such a long period of time is a testament to the effectiveness of our dual market strategy and the unwavering commitment of Team O'Reilly to providing the best customer service in the automotive aftermarket.
The composition of our comparable store sales growth in the second quarter was very similar to the first quarter. Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were contributors to our comparable store sales growth, with professional being slightly higher. We saw solid increases in both comparable ticket average and transaction count, with a larger contribution from our professional ticket count, although our DIY ticket count continues to be solid. The increase in average ticket continues to be driven by the secular industry driver of parts complexity with no help from increases in selling price, as inflation on an individual SKU-by-SKU basis remains muted.
When we look at the cadence of our sales performance for the quarter, results were steady throughout the quarter and within our guidance expectations for each month. We did experience some pressure in April and May due to the wet, cool weather from the slow start to summer as well as pull forward of some business into the first quarter as a result of the mild winter, especially in our stores in the middle of the country. However, hot weather benefited our businesses. Summer took hold in June and has continued into July, with comparable store sales trends on a 2-year stack basis improved from the results we experienced in the first 2 months of the second quarter.
On a category basis, we continue to see solid performance in key hard parts categories, such as brakes, chassis and driveline, especially in our stores in the Western and Southeastern U.S. which were not impacted by the timing of the weather fluctuations in the first half of the year. As one would expect, weather-related categories, such as HVAC and batteries, also performed extremely well in the back half of the quarter across the company as temperatures rose.
Looking at the broader aftermarket, we continue to benefit from positive tailwinds from modest improvements in total employment, low gas prices and continued solid growth in miles driven, which were up 3.3% year-to-date through May. We feel these positive macroeconomic trends have been an important factor in fueling our steady comparable store sales growth, although to a lesser degree compared to the significant year-over-year tailwinds we experienced in 2015.
Considering all the factors driving our comparable store sales performance, and in light of the very tough comparisons we face on a 2-year and 3-year stack basis, we feel it's appropriate to set our third quarter comparable store sales guidance at a range of 3% to 5% in line with our full year guidance.
While we have our toughest comparable store sales comparisons from the third quarter last year in the month of July, we are off to a good start and are currently comping within our guidance range for the quarter. We feel our industry is in a very stable, healthy condition and, more importantly, we remain very confident our team will continue to take share and generate results which outperform the overall market.
As we discussed during our first quarter earnings conference call, when we provided our gross profit and earnings per share outlook for the second quarter, our second quarter results included LIFO headwinds totaling $23 million, primarily driven by a specific second quarter deal. Tom will discuss this in more detail in a moment, but this headwind to margin was in line with our expectations, and we remain confident we will achieve our previously stated full year gross margin range of 52.3% to 52.7%. 
As the result of our solid performance thus far in the first half of 2016, we are increasing our full year 2016 operating profit guidance from a range of 19.3% to 19.7%, to a range of 19.5% to 19.9% of sales. For earnings per share, we are establishing our third quarter guidance at $2.77 to $2.87, which, at the midpoint, would represent a 7% increase over EPS of $2.64 in the third quarter of last year. As a reminder, our EPS results in the third quarter of 2015 included an $0.11 per share greater-than-typical benefit from the resolution of certain historical tax positions. 
On a comparable basis, the midpoint of our earnings per share guidance range would be an 11% increase over the prior year adjusted earnings per share of $2.53, absent this tax benefit. We're increasing our full year earnings per share guidance from a range of $10.10 to $10.50, to a range of $10.30 to $10.70. Both for the third quarter and full year, this updated guidance includes the impacted -- the impact of shares repurchased through this call, but excludes any potential additional share repurchases.
Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I would like to, again, thank our team for another outstanding quarter. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe we are very well positioned to capitalize on this demand and lead the industry by consistently providing exceptional service to our customers every day.
Again, congratulations, Team O'Reilly, for a very strong start to 2016.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw."

I'd like to begin today by echoing Greg's comments and congratulating Team O'Reilly on another strong quarter. I'm extremely proud of our team's execution and the level of consistent top-notch service that we continue to provide to our customers day in and day out. 
Our comparable store sales growth of 4.3% on top of 7.2% in the prior year again outpaced the market. And this industry-leading performance is the direct result of our team's commitment to outhustling and outservicing the competition each and every day. I want to thank each of our team members for their continued hard work and dedication to making O'Reilly Auto Parts the destination location for all of our customers' auto parts needs. 
For the quarter, we levered SG&A by 80 basis points. As a reminder, included in SG&A in the second quarter of 2015 was a headwind of $19 million from an adverse judgment in a long-term dispute with a former service provider, and our leverage in the second quarter of this year benefited 93 basis points from the comparison to this item. Excluding the adverse judgment in 2015, we delevered 13 basis points as a result of the tough comparisons to the robust sales we generated in the second quarter of 2015.
As always, our teams remain very focused on expense control, but will be judicious in managing our store staffing levels to ensure we don't jeopardize the excellent customer service that develops and maintains long-term relationships. Average per store SG&A for the second quarter increased 2.9% over 2015, excluding the adverse judgment in 2015, which was within our expectations and driven by expected higher medical costs and a comparatively more aggressive advertising campaign, as we discussed when we established our full year guidance at the beginning of the year.
We continue to expect our full year average SG&A per store to increase approximately 2% over 2015 average SG&A, excluding the adverse judgment. However, we'll closely monitor our sales volumes and will make the appropriate adjustments as needed to prudently manage SG&A expenses, both up and down to match business trends and the opportunities we see in the marketplace.
We successfully opened 89 net [ph] new stores in the first half of 2016, and we continue to be pleased with the performance of our new stores. We continue to see heavier concentrations of growth in our expansion markets in Florida and the northeast, but we're also capitalizing on great growth opportunities across our footprint. And as a result, our store growth so far in 2016 was spread across 28 different states.
Our ability to effectively enter new markets, while also selectively expanding our presence in existing markets, continues to give us a great advantage in choosing new sites; and more importantly, identifying, hiring and training outstanding store teams to provide excellent customer service in our new stores.
As we've discussed in the past, Texas is one of our long-time markets where we continue to see strong growth opportunities, and where our new store growth had stretched our distribution capacity. To this end, we're very pleased to announce the seamless opening in May of our newest DC in Selma, Texas, a northeastern suburb of the San Antonio market. This new DC will allow us to improve our parts availability in the rapidly growing San Antonio metro market and will also enhance our service in the Austin market, another strong market for us, just an hour drive of the interstate from our new DC. The San Antonio DC has a capacity to service approximately 250 stores and has ramped up extremely well by transferring neither [ph] replenishment for 166 stores from our existing Texas DCs in Dallas, Houston and Lubbock, creating capacity for new growth across the state of Texas.
As we've said many times in the past, opening a new DC is a long process and is much more difficult and complex than our DC leadership teams make it seem. Opening a backfill DC in such a strong existing market is an especially challenging test since the stores serviced by San Antonio and our customers in those markets have high service expectations because of the great track record we've established over a long period of time. Well, the San Antonio team did an amazing job getting it up and running without missing a beat, and we're extremely proud of the excellent team we have in place, providing outstanding and enhanced service to our customers in Central and Southern Texas.
As I close my comments, I want to thank Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our company's success. We've had a solid year so far. We're also well positioned to continue to provide our customers exceptional service and the best parts availability in the industry, and we intend to finish the year strong. That said, we will never rest on our past successes. We know we have to go out and win the business each and every day by outhustling and outservicing our competitors, and I'm very confident in our team's ability to do just that. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."
324289,370662144,1016638,"O'Reilly Automotive Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'd also like to begin today by thanking Team O'Reilly for another successful quarter.Now we'll take a closer look at our second quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016. For the quarter, sales increased $141 milli",1049,"Thanks, Jeff. I'd also like to begin today by thanking Team O'Reilly for another successful quarter.
Now we'll take a closer look at our second quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016. For the quarter, sales increased $141 million, comprised of an $85 million increase in comp store sales; a $56 million increase in noncomp store sales; a $1 million increase in noncomp, nonstore sales; and a $1 million decrease from closed stores. For 2016, we continue to expect our total revenues to be $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion.
For the quarter, gross margin was 51.8% of sales, a 23 basis point decrease from the prior year. The decrease was driven by a larger-than-typical LIFO headwind of $23 million, which was in line with our previous guidance and, as we've discussed previously, related primarily to a supplier renegotiation for a specific major hard parts line. As we've discussed in the past, our success of reducing our acquisition cost overtime has exhausted our LIFO reserve, and further cost decreases require us to reduce our existing inventory value to the lower cumulative acquisition cost, creating noncash headwinds to gross margin. Excluding LIFO from both years, gross margin increased 31 basis points year-over-year. Moving forward, we will realize improved gross margins from the lower acquisition cost, and we're reiterating our gross margin guidance of 52.3%  to 52.7% of sales for the full year. This assumes pricing in industry continues to remain rational.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.9% of pretax income. For the full year, we expect our pre-tax rate to be 36.8%. As is typical for us in most years, we anticipate our third quarter tax rate to be lower as we adjust for the expected tolling of certain historical tax periods. We expect our third quarter rate to be approximately 35.8% of pretax income, which is significantly above the tax rate of 33.6% we saw in the third quarter of 2015 due to the large, positive, nontypical tax reserve adjustment in the third quarter of 2015 relating to a previous acquisition. We expect the fourth quarter to return to a more normal rate of 37.3% of pretax income. These estimates are subject to the resolution of open audits and our success in qualifying for existing job tax credit programs.
Now I'd like to provide some more color on our free cash flow results and provide updated guidance expectations for the full year of 2016. We generated $194 million in free cash flow for the quarter, which is relatively flat with prior year. Year-to-date, we generated $578 million in free cash flow compared to $512 million in the prior year. And based on our successful management of working capital, primarily net inventory, we're raising our full year free cash flow guidance from a range of $750 million to $800 million to a range of $800 million to $850 million.
Inventory per store at the end of the second quarter was 588,000, which was a 2.2% increase from the end of 2015. This growth rate was in line with our expectations for the quarter, and we still expect our full year inventory per store to grow approximately 1.5% based on normal seasonal differences. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we grow per store inventory at a lower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generate, and we expect to continue our success of effectively deploying inventory in 2016.
Our AP-to-inventory ratio finished the second quarter at 106%, which exceeded our expectations and represented a new high ratio. Our AP percentage continues to benefit from incrementally improved terms and strong sales volumes over the past 12 months. However, as we move into the back half of 2016, we expect our AP-to-inventory ratio to moderate somewhat from its current levels to a number slightly above 100%, as we incrementally improve our vendor terms but face the headwinds of seasonality and the lower expected increase in sales based on our current comparable store sales guidance for the remainder of the year. 
Capital expenditures for the first 6 months were $220 million, which was up 200 -- excuse me, which was up from 2015 and in line with our expectations. We continue to forecast CapEx at $460 million to $490 million for the full year of 2016.
Moving on to debt. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.69x, down from 1.72x at the end of the first quarter, driven by a strong, trailing 12-month operating income performance. We're still well below our targeted ratio of 2 to 2.25x; however, we continue to believe our stated leverage range is appropriate for our business and we'll move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
We continue to execute our share repurchase program, and during the second quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $262.17 per share. Year-to-date through yesterday, we've repurchased 3.3 million shares at an average share price of $259.19 for a total investment of $861 million. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business at a high rate of return, and we will prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns for our shareholders.
Based on our results during the first half of the year and the additional share repurchases since our last call, for the full year, we're raising our earnings per share guidance to a range of $10.30 to $10.70 per share, representing an increase of $0.20 per share from the annual guidance we provided during our first quarter earnings release. In line with our normal practice, our guidance includes all of the shares repurchased through this call, but does not include any future share repurchases.
Before I turn the call over to our analysts for questions, I would once again like to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued hard work and dedication to providing consistently high levels of service to our customers. Congratulations on another solid quarter. 
This concludes our prepared comments. And at this time, I'd like to ask, Richard, the operator, to return to the line and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

Mainly, the immediacy of need -- a car breaks, you need a part. Some of the maintenance stuff you could, of course, order online, maybe wait for a weekend or something. But you always risk getting the wrong part or the application not being correct, or you're not being able to have something that you might need that a parts specialists would recommend. Plus, across the U.S., there's 35,000 parts stores, so there's very few places geographically that there's not a parts store fairly close. I think we're all pretty price competitive. While we wouldn't be selling at prices that some of the online retailers would, I don't think we're that far off and wouldn't be far enough off that it would take make sense to pay freight and buy the parts online. So I think that's part of it. 
But the big part of it is just advice. A lot of the DIY customers that walk into our stores are doing repairs on their cars, not because they're hobbyists. They're doing so because they have economic drivers in their household that require that they work on their own car, and we're able to help them fix their car in the most efficient and expedient way. And online retailers just aren't able to do that. So they risk putting parts in their car they may not need; putting parts in their car that may not fix their car. And it always helps to get advice when you work on a car, and we have a lot of guys that give great advice."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts Third Quarter Conference Call. Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Shaw, our Executive Vice President of Store Operations and Sales. David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; and Greg Johnson, our Executive Vice President of Supply Chain, are also present. 
I'm once again pleased to begin our call today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another solid quarter and strong year-to-date results. Our team, made up of over 74,000 dedicated team members, now across 45 states, continues to earn our customers' business and gain market share by consistently providing unsurpassed levels of customer service. This unwavering commitment to customer service drove our third quarter comparable store sales increase of 4.2%, which continues to significantly outpace our industry. These solid results were in line with our guidance of 3% to 5% and were on top of last year's excellent third quarter comparable store sales increase of 7.9%, representing this year's most difficult comparison to the prior year. 
For the first 3 quarters of 2016, our comparable store sales increased 4.8% or 12.2% on a 2-year stack basis, and this consistent market-leading performance is a testament to the quality of our team and the commitment we've made to providing incredible levels of service to our valued customers.
In total, we grew sales for the quarter by 6.8%, and our ongoing focus on profitable growth and expense control translated to solid top line performance into a record third quarter operating margin of 20.2%. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $2.90 is a 10% increase over our reported EPS for the third quarter of 2015 of $2.64. As a reminder, last year, our third quarter EPS results included a larger-than-typical tax benefit of $0.11 from the resolution of certain historical tax positions.
As we called out on the call last year, this benefit, while very positive for our company, was not representative of our expected tax rate going forward or our ongoing operating performance and as appropriate, to focus on our EPS, excluding this benefit from last year.
On this basis, our third quarter 2016 EPS grew 15% compared to adjusted EPS for the third quarter of 2015, representing our 31st consecutive quarter of adjusted EPS growth of 15% or greater.
Our team's track record of strong earnings growth over such a long period of time is a reflection of the effectiveness of our customer service-oriented culture, dual market strategy and focus on profitable, sustainable growth.
The composition of our comparable store sales growth in the third quarter was very balanced, with our professional and DIY sides of our business contributing equally to our comparable store sales growth. We saw solid increases in both comparable ticket average and transaction count with a slightly larger contribution from our professional ticket count, although our DIY ticket count continues to be solid.
As has been the case for several quarters, the increase in average ticket has been driven by increasing parts complexity rather than inflation or pricing, which has remained very static in our industry.
On a category basis, we saw strong performance throughout the quarter in weather-related categories, such as batteries and air conditioning, as a result of the hot summer whether. We also continue to see solid performance in key hard parts category, such as chassis and brakes, against very difficult comparisons for these categories in the third quarter of 2015.
Moving onto the cadence of our comparable store sales growth in the quarter. Our monthly results in 2016 were impacted by a shift in a number of Sundays, our lightest volume day, both in July in August as compared to last year. Adjusting for this calendar shift, our monthly comparable store sales increase was consistently solid throughout the quarter. Overall, the macroeconomic environment continues to be a positive contributor to demand for our industry and was a factor in our continued steady comparable store sales growth for the third quarter.
Unemployment levels have stabilized over the last year at around 5%, and the associated commuter miles, along with the continued low gas prices, have benefited total miles driven in the U.S., which were up 3.1% year-to-date through August. We expect the current stable macroeconomic environment to continue to be a positive for the health of our industry. However, as we continue to lap a strong year-over-year 2015 benefit from these tailwinds, we're also cautious as we look forward to the fourth quarter when our business can be variable based on the holiday season and weather volatility.
In a lot of these factors, in the very tough comparisons we again faced in the fourth quarter, we feel it is appropriate to set our fourth quarter comparable store sales guidance at a range of 3% to 5%. We are focused to finish the year strong and are off to a good start in the fourth quarter as the solid business trends in the third quarter have continued, thus far, in October.
We are also tightening our full year comparable store sales growth guidance to a range of 4% to 5%, which reflects our year-to-date results and our fourth quarter expectations.
Finally, I would like to make a few comments about our announcement in yesterday's press release regarding our definitive agreement to purchase the assets of Bond auto-parts. Bond is a very high quality auto-parts company, headquartered in the state of Vermont and operates 48 stores throughout Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and New York. Bond was actually founded 1 year before we were in 1956. And for the past 60 years, we have known them as the premier part supplier for their markets in New England. Their company standouts for their knowledgeable parts professionals and a culture of excellent customer service, and we are excited about the opportunities we will have together to continue our growth in the Northeast.
We expect this transaction to close before the end of the year, and I want to take this opportunity now to express how excited we are to welcome the Bond team to Team O'Reilly. 
Before I finish up my prepared comments and turn the call over to Jeff, I would like to again thank our team for another outstanding quarter and for their continued hard work and commitment to driving the success of our business. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe we are very well positioned to capitalize on this demand and lead the industry by consistently providing outstanding service to our customers every day. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

I'd like to begin today by also congratulating Team O'Reilly on another strong quarter. This quarter is just another example of our team's steadfast commitment to outhustling the competition to earn our customers' business by providing the best service. Our comparable store sales growth of 4.2% on top of an incredible 7.9% last year once again easily led the industry, and I want to thank each of our key members for their dedication to our ongoing success.
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our SG&A results for the quarter. For the third quarter, we delevered [ph] 12 basis points, which is similar to the second quarter, was primarily the result of the tough comparisons to the robust sales growth we generated in the comparable quarter of 2015 and a few specific items I'll address in a moment. 
Average per store SG&A for the third quarter increased 2.8%. Based on our results so far in 2016 and looking forward into the fourth quarter, we now expect our full year average SG&A per store guidance to increase slightly to approximately 2.5% over 2015 versus our previous expectation of 2% growth.
As a reminder, this average store SG&A comparison excludes the headwind in the second quarter of 2015 from an adverse legal judgment.
As we've discussed many times in the past, our expense control focus is a key component of the Team O'Reilly culture, and each of our managers is held accountable for profitability of their individual store. However, and I know I'm a broken record on this one, we will always manage our store level staffing expense for the long term and won't jeopardize the excellent customer service that develops and maintains long-term relationships. 
In addition to the complexities of managing store payroll, we've seen pressure from healthcare costs as well as higher credit card costs, which should abate when we're fully rolled out with the chip and pin technology in the first quarter of 2017. We will continue to closely monitor our sales volumes, and we'll make appropriate adjustments, as needed, to prudently manage SG&A expenses both up and down to match business trends and the opportunities that we see in the marketplace.
We successfully added 52 new stores during the third quarter, bringing our net new store count to 141 for the year, and we continue to be pleased with the performance of our new stores. So far, this year, we've opened or acquired stores in 35 different states, including our first 2 stores in Rhode Island, our 45th state, during the third quarter.
Also included in our year-to-date new store additions was our acquisition of Frank's Auto Supermarket, a 5-store [ph] chain in Western Pennsylvania, which gives us a jumpstart as we begin to open in the Pittsburgh market. Being able to open stores effectively across our National footprint allows us to balance our growth in our expansion markets in Florida, the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic region, with backfill markets in Texas, California, the Great Lakes and throughout our other existing markets. This flexibility gives us a great advantage in selecting new sites and more importantly, identifying, hiring and training outstanding store teams to provide excellent customer service in our new stores.
As Greg discussed earlier, we have entered into an agreement to acquire the 48 stores of Bond Auto Parts in New England. Assuming Bond closes prior to the end of the year as we anticipate, we expect our full year addition to store count for 2016 to be approximately 258 net new stores, which reflects our previous new store target of 210 stores plus the addition of the Bond stores. 
We've known the Bond family for many years and have a tremendous amount of respect for the quality of their people and their business. Their team members are truly professional parts people. We're extremely excited to welcome them to Team O'Reilly as we look forward to growing on the outstanding foundation they've established in the Northeast.
Over the course of our history, we've proven our ability to very effectively acquire existing store chains, implement our dual-market strategy and instill the O'Reilly culture in the store teams. However, as we've discussed repeatedly in the past, we're very disciplined buyers and will only deploy our shareholders capital when we can identify companies that are a good fit with our culture and can be acquired at the right investments. 
This means that although we work hard on an ongoing basis to identify potential acquisitions, we often pass on potential deals which just don't fit our profile, which makes us that much more excited to reached an agreement this year to add such an outstanding business to Team O'Reilly. 
As we look forward to 2017, we'll continue to execute our profitable new store growth strategy and have established a target of 190 net new store openings for the year, which is below our typical new store target as we plan to devote significant resources to converting the Bond stores. 
Finally, before I close my comments, I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the incredible efforts of our supply chain groups to support our new store growth while also continually enhancing our industry-leading parts availability, and I'd like to thank these teams for the great service levels they provide to our stores.
As we discussed on the last call, these teams very successfully opened the San Antonio distribution center earlier [ph] this year and are on track to complete the expansion of our existing DC in Greensboro, North Carolina in the first half of 2017. This expansion will add approximately 200,000 square feet to this facility and allow us to service an additional 125 stores from this location as we continue to add stores and expansion markets in the Mid-Atlantic. 
Our ability to incrementally add capacity to our supply chain network and provide high levels of inventory availability to our expansion markets is a critical component of our growth strategy, and I'm very proud of the great work these teams do to support our growth. 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our company's success. With 1 quarter left in 2016, we have a solid year so far, but won't rest on our laurels as we push to finish the year strong. As always, the key to our success is providing unwavering customer service that surpasses expectations and continues to earn our customers' business. And I'm confident we have the team in place to outhustle and outservice competition in key taking market share. 
Now I'll turn it over to Tom."
324289,403622074,1063253,"O'Reilly Automotive Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'd also like to begin today by thanking the O'Reilly team for another very profitable and successful quarter. Now we'll take a closer look at our third quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016. For the quarter, sa",1167,"Thanks, Jeff. I'd also like to begin today by thanking the O'Reilly team for another very profitable and successful quarter. Now we'll take a closer look at our third quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016. 
For the quarter, sales increased $141 million, comprised of an $85 million increase in comp store sales; a $50 million -- excuse me, a $54 million increase in noncomp store sales; a $3 million increase in noncomp, non-store sales; and $1 million decrease from closed stores. Based on our results for the first 9 months and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we now expect our total revenue for 2016 to be $8.5 billion to $8.6 billion. 
For the quarter, gross margin was 52.7% of sales, a 32 basis point increase over the prior year. This was in line with our expectations for the third quarter as continued strong U.S. margins offset a higher-than-anticipated LIFO charge of $10 million, which was a 23 -- which was 23 basis points higher than last year, but significantly lower than the second quarter. As we have discussed many times in the past, our success at reducing our acquisition costs over time has exhausted our LIFO reserve and further cost decreases require us to reduce our existing inventory value to the lower cumulative acquisition costs creating noncash headwinds to gross margin. However, these cost reductions benefit our POS margins on a go-forward basis. Excluding the impact of LIFO from both years, gross margin increased 55 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially from the second quarter. Year-to-date, gross margin was 52.3% of sales. However, excluding LIFO from both years, gross margin increased 50 basis points. 
For the year, we are tightening our full year gross margin guidance from a range of 52.3% to 52.7% to a range of 52.4% to 52.6% of sales, with the expectation that our strong POS margin improvement will continue during the fourth quarter as a result of the cost decreases we've secured throughout 2016 and that pricing in the industry will remain rational. 
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 35.5% of pretax income, which is slightly below the 35.8% we expected for the quarter. Our third quarter effective tax rate this year was significantly above the 33.6% we saw in the third quarter of 2015, which, as a reminder, benefited from a larger-than-typical tax reserve adjustment of $11 million related to a previous acquisition. We expect our fourth quarter to return to a more normal rate of approximately 37.3% of pretax income. 
Moving on to our free cash flow results. I'll provide some color to our results and our updated full year free cash flow guidance. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $234 million, which was a $21 million -- which was $21 million less than the prior year. Year-to-date, we generated $812 million in free cash flow, which is $46 million more than the prior year. The year-to-date improvement was primarily, driven by our net income growth and continued success management of working capital, specifically net inventory, partially offset by higher year-over-year capital expenditures. 
Capital expenditure for the first 9 months were $356 million, in line with our expectations and resulted from our continued store growth and distribution expansion projects, as Jeff discussed earlier. We continue to expect capital expenditures will finish the year in the range of $460 million to $490 million. Based on our strong year-to-date free cash flow performance, we're increasing our full year free cash flow guidance to a range of $850 million to $900 million, reflecting an increase of $50 million at both ends of the range.
Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was 592,000, which was a 3% increase from the end of 2015. This growth rate was in line with our expectations for the quarter, but above our full year expectation of inventory per store growth of approximately 1.5%, driven by normal seasonality. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we grow per store inventory at a lower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generate, and we expect to continue our success of effectively deploying inventory.
Our EPD inventory ratio finished the third quarter at 107.5%, which exceeded our expectations and once again represents a new high for this ratio. Our AP percentage continues to benefit from incrementally improved terms and strong sales volumes over the last 12 months. We expect our AP-to-inventory ratio will moderate somewhat during the fourth quarter from its current level, but we expect to finish this year at a ratio strongly above 100% as we [ph] incrementally improve our vendor terms, but pace the headwinds to seasonality.
Moving on to debt. We finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.66x, down from the 1.69x at the end of the second quarter, driven by a strong trailing 12-month operating income performance, but up from the 1.57x at the end of the third quarter last year. We are still well below our targeted range of 2 to 2.25x, however, we continue to believe our stated leverage range is appropriate for our business, and we'll move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
We continue to execute our share repurchase program. And during the third quarter, we repurchased 0.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $281.04 per share. Year-to-date through yesterday, we've repurchased 3.9 million shares at an average share price of $262.32 for a total investment of $1 billion. We continue to [indiscernible] our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of the opportunities to invest in our business at a high rate of return, and we will prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns for our shareholders.
We're establishing our fourth quarter earnings per share guidance at a range of $2.44 to $2.54. Based on our year-to-date results and the additional share repurchases since our last call, for the full year, we are tightening our earnings per share guidance to a range of $10.58 to $10.68, which represents a $0.13 increase from the midpoint of the previous annual guidance we've provided on our second quarter earnings release in July, driven by our stronger-than-expected third quarter operating results and incremental share repurchases.
As a reminder, in line with our normal practice, our guidance includes all of the share repurchase through this call, but does not include any future share repurchases. 
Before I turn the call over to our analysts for questions, I would once again like to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued hard work, dedication and unrelenting focus on providing consistently superior levels of customer service. Your ongoing efforts continue to drive our profitable growth, and we cannot thank you enough. This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I'd like to ask Adrienne, the operator, to return to the line, and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

Our DIY business is doing really well. As I said in my prepared, both our DIY and our do-it-for-me business were pretty well even contributors to our 4.2% comp store sales, so we're doing pretty well in DIY. Obviously, we see these e-commerce players that sell their prices below their brick-and-mortar companies online. There's a lot of elements to play in the auto parts that I think differentiate us from many other retail channels. But primarily, it's about -- and if you can just on the DIY side, many times in the DIY customer walks into our stores, they're really going to need help figure out how to install a problem they have, and we provide that help. and not that we provide that help, but we are able to tell them the tools that they need to fix their car just a whole array of things. We even [indiscernible] the tools. We've got a very significant loan program were customer will put the food that they might otherwise not be able to buy because the expense of a specialty filler is something they can put on a credit card, use it to install the part and fix their car and bring it back for a refund when they're done. And we put back in the shelf and reuse it again for the next customer that needs to use that. So those kinds of services are pretty hard to quantify, but they're incredibly value -- valuable in servicing the DIY customer. On the B2B side, and I speak from having done this for 32 years and previously being in the repair business, that -- none of the shops or very few of the shop stock parts. They may stock a small array of filters or maybe a few belts or a few batteries, stuff like that. But almost every repair that they make, the parts how to be delivered. And it's just so incredibly important that they're able to turn their base over quickly and keep their technicians busy in order to provide gainful employment for the technicians, but also maximize the revenue and the profitability of the shop. And most shops nowadays know that they can get 30 to 45-minute service out of these -- out of the company like ours that has a wide array of parts, and our competitors may use to having this wide array for parts. It's just hard for me to see the company like Amazon being a significant player on the do-it-for-me side. And I would tell you on the DIY side, while there are some people that are going to buy some parts and some accessories over the Internet because they can't wait because they know what they're doing in making the repair, the vast majority need help and appreciate the advice and recommendation and the help that we give them in repairing their cars."

It's hard to say what our competitors were up against from a comparison standpoint whether they're on a weekly basis, while they're up against just from a geography standpoint because I know some are more exposed to the weather-affected areas in the Northeast. And again, this quarter, we saw a difference in the areas that we would consider to be weather affected versus not and taking into consideration the maturity of some of the stores or maybe the lack of maturity on some of the stores, we still look at somewhere in the 400 to 500 basis point difference in comp performance between the weather affected stores at the non-weather affected stores."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts Third Quarter Conference Call. Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Shaw, our Executive Vice President of Store Operations and Sales. David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; and Greg Johnson, our Executive Vice President of Supply Chain, are also present. 
I'm once again pleased to begin our call today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another solid quarter and strong year-to-date results. Our team, made up of over 74,000 dedicated team members, now across 45 states, continues to earn our customers' business and gain market share by consistently providing unsurpassed levels of customer service. This unwavering commitment to customer service drove our third quarter comparable store sales increase of 4.2%, which continues to significantly outpace our industry. These solid results were in line with our guidance of 3% to 5% and were on top of last year's excellent third quarter comparable store sales increase of 7.9%, representing this year's most difficult comparison to the prior year. 
For the first 3 quarters of 2016, our comparable store sales increased 4.8% or 12.2% on a 2-year stack basis, and this consistent market-leading performance is a testament to the quality of our team and the commitment we've made to providing incredible levels of service to our valued customers.
In total, we grew sales for the quarter by 6.8%, and our ongoing focus on profitable growth and expense control translated to solid top line performance into a record third quarter operating margin of 20.2%. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $2.90 is a 10% increase over our reported EPS for the third quarter of 2015 of $2.64. As a reminder, last year, our third quarter EPS results included a larger-than-typical tax benefit of $0.11 from the resolution of certain historical tax positions.
As we called out on the call last year, this benefit, while very positive for our company, was not representative of our expected tax rate going forward or our ongoing operating performance and as appropriate, to focus on our EPS, excluding this benefit from last year.
On this basis, our third quarter 2016 EPS grew 15% compared to adjusted EPS for the third quarter of 2015, representing our 31st consecutive quarter of adjusted EPS growth of 15% or greater.
Our team's track record of strong earnings growth over such a long period of time is a reflection of the effectiveness of our customer service-oriented culture, dual market strategy and focus on profitable, sustainable growth.
The composition of our comparable store sales growth in the third quarter was very balanced, with our professional and DIY sides of our business contributing equally to our comparable store sales growth. We saw solid increases in both comparable ticket average and transaction count with a slightly larger contribution from our professional ticket count, although our DIY ticket count continues to be solid.
As has been the case for several quarters, the increase in average ticket has been driven by increasing parts complexity rather than inflation or pricing, which has remained very static in our industry.
On a category basis, we saw a strong performance throughout the quarter in weather-related categories, such as batteries and air conditioning, as a result of the hot summer whether. We also continue to see solid performance in key hard parts category, such as chassis and brakes, against very difficult comparisons for these categories in the third quarter of 2015.
Moving onto the cadence of our comparable store sales growth in the quarter. Our monthly results in 2016 were impacted by a shift in a number of Sundays, our lightest volume day, both in July and August as compared to last year. Adjusting for this calendar shift, our monthly comparable store sales increase was consistently solid throughout the quarter. Overall, the macroeconomic environment continues to be a positive contributor to demand for our industry and was a factor in our continued steady comparable store sales growth for the third quarter.
Unemployment levels have stabilized over the last year at around 5%, and the associated commuter miles, along with the continued low gas prices, have benefited total miles driven in the U.S., which were up 3.1% year-to-date through August. We expect the current stable macroeconomic environment to continue to be a positive for the health of our industry. However, as we continue to lap a strong year-over-year 2015 benefit from these tailwinds, we are also cautious as we look forward to the fourth quarter when our business can be variable based on the holiday season and weather volatility.
In a lot of these factors, in the very tough comparisons we again faced in the fourth quarter, we feel that it is appropriate to set our fourth quarter comparable store sales guidance at a range of 3% to 5%. 
We are focused to finish the year strong and are off to a good start in the fourth quarter as the solid business trends in the third quarter have continued, thus far, into October.
We are also tightening our full year comparable store sales growth guidance to a range of 4% to 5%, which reflects our year-to-date results and our fourth quarter expectations.
Finally, I would like to make a few comments about our announcement in yesterday's press release regarding our definitive agreement to purchase the assets of Bond Auto Parts. Bond is a very high quality auto parts company, headquartered in the state of Vermont, and operates 48 stores throughout Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and New York. Bond was actually founded 1 year before we were in 1956. And for the past 60 years, we have known them as the premier part supplier for their markets in New England. Their company stands out for their knowledgeable parts professionals and a culture of excellent customer service, and we are excited about the opportunities we will have together to continue our growth in the Northeast.
We expect this transaction to close before the end of the year, and I want to take this opportunity now to express how excited we are to welcome the Bond team to Team O'Reilly. 
Before I finish up my prepared comments and turn the call over to Jeff, I would like to again thank our team for another outstanding quarter and for their continued hard work and commitment to driving the success of our business. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe we are very well positioned to capitalize on this demand and lead the industry by consistently providing outstanding service to our customers every day. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

I'd like to begin today by also congratulating Team O'Reilly on another strong quarter. This quarter is just another example of our team's steadfast commitment to outhustling the competition to earn our customers'",1112,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin today by also congratulating Team O'Reilly on another strong quarter. This quarter is just another example of our team's steadfast commitment to outhustling the competition to earn our customers' business by providing the best service. Our comparable store sales growth of 4.2% on top of an incredible 7.9% last year once again easily led the industry, and I want to thank each of our team members for their dedication to our ongoing success.
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our SG&A results for the quarter. For the third quarter, we delevered 12 basis points, which is similar to the second quarter, was primarily the result of the tough comparisons to the robust sales growth we generated in the comparable quarter of 2015 and a few specific items I'll address in a moment. 
Average per store SG&A for the third quarter increased 2.8%. Based on our results so far in 2016 and looking forward into the fourth quarter, we now expect our full year average SG&A per store guidance to increase slightly to approximately 2.5% over 2015 versus our previous expectation of 2% growth.
As a reminder, this average store SG&A comparison excludes the headwind in the second quarter of 2015 from an adverse legal judgment.
As we've discussed many times in the past, our expense control focus is a key component of the Team O'Reilly culture, and each of our managers is held accountable for the profitability of their individual store. However, and I know I'm a broken record on this one, we will always manage our store level staffing expense for the long term and won't jeopardize the excellent customer service that develops and maintains long-term relationships. 
In addition to the complexities of managing store payroll, we've seen pressure from health care cost as well as higher credit card cost, which should abate when we're fully rolled out with the chip-and-pin technology in the first quarter of 2017. We will continue to closely monitor our sales volumes, and we'll make appropriate adjustments, as needed, to prudently manage SG&A expenses, both up and down, to match business trends and the opportunities that we see in the marketplace.
We successfully added 52 new stores during the third quarter, bringing our net new store count to 141 for the year, and we continue to be pleased with the performance of our new stores. So far, this year, we've opened or acquired stores in 35 different states, including our first 2 stores in Rhode Island, our 45th state, during the third quarter.
Also included in our year-to-date new store additions was our acquisition of Frank's Auto Supermarket, a 5-store chain in Western Pennsylvania, which gives us a jumpstart as we begin to open in the Pittsburgh market. Being able to open stores effectively across our national footprint allows us to balance our growth in our expansion markets in Florida, the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic region, with backfill markets in Texas, California, the Great Lakes and throughout our other existing markets. This flexibility gives us a great advantage in selecting new sites and more importantly, identifying, hiring and training outstanding store teams to provide excellent customer service in our new stores.
As Greg discussed earlier, we have entered into an agreement to acquire the 48 stores of Bond Auto Parts in New England. Assuming Bond closes prior to the end of the year, as we anticipate, we expect our full year addition to store count for 2016 to be approximately 258 net new stores, which reflects our previous new store target of 210 stores plus the addition of the Bond stores. 
We've known the Bond family for many years and have a tremendous amount of respect for the quality of their people and their business. Their team members are truly professional parts people. We're extremely excited to welcome them to Team O'Reilly as we look forward to growing on the outstanding foundation they've established in the Northeast.
Over the course of our history, we've proven our ability to very effectively acquire existing store chains, implement our dual-market strategy and instill the O'Reilly culture in the new store teams. However, as we've discussed repeatedly in the past, we're very disciplined buyers and will only deploy our shareholders capital when we can identify companies that are a good fit with our culture and can be acquired at the right investment. 
This means that although we work hard on an ongoing basis to identify potential acquisitions, we often pass on potential deals which just don't fit our profile, which makes us that much more excited to have to reach agreement this year to add such an outstanding business to Team O'Reilly. 
As we look forward to 2017, we'll continue to execute our profitable new store growth strategy and have established a target of 190 net new store openings for the year, which is below our typical new store target as we plan to devote significant resources to converting the Bond stores. 
Finally, before I close my comments, I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the incredible efforts of our supply chain groups to support our new store growth while also continually enhancing our industry-leading parts availability, and I'd like to thank these teams for the great service levels they provide to our stores.
As we discussed on the last call, these teams very successfully opened the San Antonio distribution center earlier this year and are on track to complete the expansion of our existing DC in Greensboro, North Carolina in the first half of 2017. This expansion will add approximately 200,000 square feet to this facility and allows us to service an additional 125 stores from this location as we continue to add stores in expansion markets in the Mid-Atlantic. 
Our ability to incrementally add capacity to our supply chain network and provide high levels of inventory availability to our expansion markets is a critical component of our growth strategy, and I'm very proud of the great work these teams do to support our growth. 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our company's success. With 1 quarter left in 2016, we've had a solid year so far, but won't rest on our laurels as we push to finish the year strong. As always, the key to our success is providing unwavering customer service that surpasses expectations and continues to earn our customers' business. And I'm confident we have the team in place to outhustle and outservice the competition and keep taking market share. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."
324289,403622074,1063591,"O'Reilly Automotive Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'd also like to begin today by thanking the O'Reilly team for another very profitable and successful quarter. Now we'll take a closer look at our third quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016. For the quarter, sa",1171,"Thanks, Jeff. I'd also like to begin today by thanking the O'Reilly team for another very profitable and successful quarter. Now we'll take a closer look at our third quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016. 
For the quarter, sales increased $141 million, comprised of an $85 million increase in comp store sales; a $50 million -- excuse me, a $54 million increase in noncomp store sales; a $3 million increase in noncomp, nonstore sales; and $1 million decrease from closed stores. Based on our results for the first 9 months and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we now expect our total revenue for 2016 to be $8.5 billion to $8.6 billion. 
For the quarter, gross margin was 52.7% of sales, a 32 basis point increase over the prior year. This was in line with our expectations for the third quarter as continued strong U.S. [ph] margins offset a higher-than-anticipated LIFO charge of $10 million, which was a 23 -- which was 23 basis points higher than last year, but significantly lower than the second quarter. As we have discussed many times in the past, our success at reducing our acquisition cost over time has exhausted our LIFO reserve and further cost decreases require us to reduce our existing inventory value to the lower cumulative acquisition cost creating noncash headwinds to gross margin. However, these cost reductions benefit our POS margins on a go-forward basis. Excluding the impact of LIFO from both years, gross margin increased 55 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially from the second quarter. Year-to-date, gross margin was 52.3% of sales. However, excluding LIFO from both years, gross margin increased 50 basis points. 
For the year, we are tightening our full year gross margin guidance from a range of 52.3% to 52.7% to a range of 52.4% to 52.6% of sales, with the expectation that our strong POS margin improvement will continue during the fourth quarter as a result of the cost decreases we've secured throughout 2016 and that pricing in the industry will remain rational. 
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 35.5% of pretax income, which is slightly below the 35.8% we expected for the quarter. Our third quarter effective tax rate this year was significantly above the 33.6% we saw in the third quarter of 2015, which, as a reminder, benefited from a larger-than-typical tax reserve adjustment of $11 million related to a previous acquisition. We expect our fourth quarter to return to a more normal rate of approximately 37.3% of pretax income. 
Moving on to our free cash flow results. I'll provide some color to our results and our updated full year free cash flow guidance. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $234 million, which was a $21 million -- which was $21 million less than the prior year. Year-to-date, we generated $812 million in free cash flow, which is $46 million more than the prior year. The year-to-date improvement was primarily driven by our net income growth and continued successful management of working capital, specifically, net inventory, partially offset by higher year-over-year capital expenditures. 
Capital expenditure for the first 9 months were $356 million, in line with our expectations and resulted from our continued store growth and distribution expansion projects, as Jeff discussed earlier. We continue to expect capital expenditures will finish the year in the range of $460 million to $490 million. Based on our strong year-to-date free cash flow performance, we're increasing our full year free cash flow guidance to a range of $850 million to $900 million, reflecting an increase of $50 million at both ends of the range.
Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was 592,000, which was a 3% increase from the end of 2015. This growth rate was in line with our expectations for the quarter, but above our full year expectation of inventory per store growth of approximately 1.5%, driven by normal seasonality. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we grow per store inventory at a lower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generate, and we expect to continue our success of effectively deploying inventory.
Our AP to inventory ratio finished the third quarter at 107.5%, which exceeded our expectations and once again represents a new high for this ratio. Our AP percentage continues to benefit from incrementally improved terms and strong sales volumes over the last 12 months. We expect our AP to inventory ratio will moderate somewhat during the fourth quarter from its current level, but we expect to finish this year at a ratio strongly above 100% as we incrementally improve our vendor terms, but face the headwinds and seasonality.
Moving on to debt. We finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.66x, down from the 1.69x at the end of the second quarter, driven by our strong trailing 12-month operating income performance, but up from the 1.57x at the end of the third quarter last year. We are still well below our targeted range of 2 to 2.25x, however, we continue to believe our stated leverage range is appropriate for our business, and we'll move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
We continue to execute our share repurchase program. And during the third quarter, we repurchased 0.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $281.04 per share. Year-to-date through yesterday, we've repurchased 3.9 million shares at an average share price of $262.32 for a total investment of $1 billion. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of the opportunities to invest in our business at a high rate of return, and we will prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns for our shareholders.
We're establishing our fourth quarter earnings per share guidance at a range of $2.44 to $2.54. Based on our year-to-date results and the additional share repurchases since our last call, for the full year, we are tightening our earnings per share guidance to a range of $10.58 to $10.68, which represents a $0.13 increase from the midpoint of the previous annual guidance we provided on our second quarter earnings release in July, driven by our stronger-than-expected third quarter operating results and the incremental share repurchases.
As a reminder, in line with our normal practice, our guidance includes all of the share repurchase through this call, but does not include any future share repurchases. 
Before I turn the call over to our analysts for questions, I would once again like to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued hard work, dedication and unrelenting focus on providing consistently superior levels of customer service. Your ongoing efforts continue to drive our profitable growth, and we cannot thank you enough. 
This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I'd like to ask Adrienne, the operator, to return to the line, and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

But kind of the plan is, is that we would further leverage our distribution capacity in Devens, Massachusetts and supply those stores from there while not sacrificing the benefit they have of availability by having as many parts as they have available in Central Vermont. So we would, over time, alleviate the need to have availability by putting on a big help or something like that. But ultimately, the replenishment would come out of Devens. From a real estate stand point, the company doesn't actually owned a real estate. We've entered a lease agreement with some of the family members to lease the locations that they own, and then we have other third-party leases that we would take over those leases and run the stores as lease properties."

So the -- what I would say is that our DIY business has come on a little faster. We're doing a good job on the do-it-for-me side as we progressively established what our company is about and the availability of model and the service model and those kinds of things, so that continues to build. We see a lot of opportunity in the Northeast. We're -- there's a lot of high population areas that we're not in. We have a lot of capacity in Devens that we've not yet used.

Well, what I would say is that we've had pretty strong competitors on the e-commerce side in the DIY business for quite some time with some other suppliers that did a pretty good job there.

Well, what I would say is that we've had pretty strong competitors on the e-commerce side in the DIY business for quite some time with some other suppliers that did a pretty good job there. Our DIY business is doing really well. As I said in my prepared comments, both our DIY and our do-it-for-me business were pretty well. Even contributors start [ph] 4.2% comp store sales. So we're doing pretty well in DIY. Obviously, we see these e-commerce players that sell at prices below the brick-and-mortar companies online. There's a lot of elements to play in the auto parts that I think differentiate us from many other retail channels. But primarily, it's about -- and as we can -- just on the DIY side, many times, when a DIY customer walks into our stores, they're really needing help, figuring out how to solve a problem that they have, and we provide that help. and not that we provide that help, but we are able to tell them the tools that they need to fix the car, just the whole array of things. And we even loan the tools. We've got a very significant loan a tool program, where a customer will put a tool that they might otherwise not be able to buy because the expense of a specialty filler or something, they can put it on a credit card, use it to install the part and fixing their car then bring it back for a full refund when they're done. And we put it back on the shelf and reuse it again for the next customer that needs to use that. So those kinds of services are pretty hard to quantify, but they're incredibly valuable when servicing the DIY customer. On the B2B side, and I speak from having done this for 32 years and previously being in the repair business, that none of the shops or very few of the shop stock parts. They may stock a small array of filters or maybe a few belts or a few batteries, stuff like that. But almost every repair that they make, the parts have to be delivered. And it's just so incredibly important that they're able to turn their base over quickly and keep their technicians busy in order to provide gainful employment for the technicians, but also maximize the revenue and the profitability of the shop. And most shops nowadays know that they can get 30 to 45-minute service out of these -- out of the company like ours that has a wide array of parts than our competitors, and many guys have this wide array for parts. It's just hard for me to see a company like Amazon being a significant player on the do-it-for-me side. And I would tell you on the DIY side, while there are some people that are going, you know, parts and some accessories over the Internet because they can't wait, because they know what they're doing in making the repair, the vast majority need help and appreciate the advice, recommendation and the help that we give them in repairing their cars."

In my prepared comments, I spoke to August and July on a monthly basis being Sunday affected, which Sunday is our lowest volume day. Probably, a more -- from a trend standpoint, a more meaningful way to look at our comp cadence throughout the quarter will be to look at it on a weekly basis, and I've got that in front of me now. I'll tell you, our sales on a weekly basis were just pretty darn consistent throughout the period, and that consistency has continued to this point in the quarter. And this quarter, our toughest comparers to last year are this month and December. We have a softer comparison in November, and we carry this -- the healthy strong trend that we were on into this -- in the fourth quarter. It's hard to say what our competitors were up against from a comparison standpoint what -- on a weekly basis, what they're up against from just a geography standpoint because I know some are more exposed to the weather-affected areas in the Northeast. And again, this quarter, we saw a difference in the areas that we would consider to be weather affected versus not. And taking into consideration the maturity of some of the stores or maybe the lack of maturity of some of the stores, we still would look at somewhere in the 400 to 500 basis point difference in comp performance between the weather affected stores and the nonweather affected stores."

And the fact that costs go up ultimately result in higher consumer prices, and auto parts would be no different. As far as our opportunity with omni-channel and just the various opportunities we have in businesses, we have an opportunity in the Internet. We're not a big B2C e-commerce player. We could do more, and we're working now to replatform our website to do a little more of that business private label. We continue to be a very powerful company when it comes to building these private label brands. As you know, our strategy is not to have a single private label brand. It's viewed as being a private label. Our brands are really National brands that may have been retired by a supplier or whatever the case maybe, and we've picked them up and reestablished the brand. And many of our brands are now recognized even though they're what would be considered, as we discussed this here, is private label. They're really viewed by our shops as being a National brand even though they run our proprietary brand and there are brands that we put products of equivalent quality to a branded product in the box. So there -- we feel like we have a lot of opportunity there to continue to grow market share in the brands that we own. And as that -- growth is accretive to our gross margin, as you know."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts Third Quarter Conference Call.

David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; and Greg Johnson, our Executive Vice President of Supply Chain, are also present. 
I'm once again pleased to begin our call today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another solid quarter and strong year-to-date results. Our team, made up of over 74,000 dedicated team members, now across 45 states, continues to earn our customers' business and gain market share by consistently providing unsurpassed levels of customer service. This unwavering commitment to customer service drove our third quarter comparable store sales increase of 4.2%, which continues to significantly outpace our industry. These solid results were in line with our guidance of 3% to 5% and were on top of last year's excellent third quarter comparable store sales increase of 7.9%, representing this year's most difficult comparison to the prior year. 
For the first 3 quarters of 2016, our comparable store sales increased 4.8% or 12.2% on a 2-year stack basis, and this consistent market-leading performance is a testament to the quality of our team and the commitment we've made to providing incredible levels of service to our valued customers.
In total, we grew sales for the quarter by 6.8%, and our ongoing focus on profitable growth and expense control translated to solid top line performance into a record third quarter operating margin of 20.2%. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $2.90 is a 10% increase over our reported EPS for the third quarter of 2015 of $2.64. As a reminder, last year, our third quarter EPS results included a larger-than-typical tax benefit of $0.11 from the resolution of certain historical tax positions.
As we called out on the call last year, this benefit, while very positive for our company, was not representative of our expected tax rate going forward or our ongoing operating performance and as appropriate, to focus on our EPS, excluding this benefit from last year.
On this basis, our third quarter 2016 EPS grew 15% compared to adjusted EPS for the third quarter of 2015, representing our 31st consecutive quarter of adjusted EPS growth of 15% or greater.
Our team's track record of strong earnings growth over such a long period of time is a reflection of the effectiveness of our customer service-oriented culture, dual market strategy and focus on profitable, sustainable growth.
The composition of our comparable store sales growth in the third quarter was very balanced, with our professional and DIY sides of our business contributing equally to our comparable store sales growth. We saw solid increases in both comparable ticket average and transaction count with a slightly larger contribution from our professional ticket count, although our DIY ticket count continues to be solid.
As has been the case for several quarters, the increase in average ticket has been driven by increasing parts complexity rather than inflation or pricing, which has remained very static in our industry.
On a category basis, we saw a strong performance throughout the quarter in weather-related categories, such as batteries and air conditioning, as a result of the hot summer weather. We also continue to see solid performance in key hard parts category, such as chassis and brakes, against very difficult comparisons for these categories in the third quarter of 2015.
Moving onto the cadence of our comparable store sales growth in the quarter. Our monthly results in 2016 were impacted by a shift in a number of Sundays, our lightest volume day, both in July and August as compared to last year. Adjusting for this calendar shift, our monthly comparable store sales increase was consistently solid throughout the quarter. Overall, the macroeconomic environment continues to be a positive contributor to demand for our industry and was a factor in our continued steady comparable store sales growth for the third quarter.
Unemployment levels have stabilized over the last year at around 5%, and the associated commuter miles, along with the continued low gas prices, have benefited total miles driven in the U.S., which were up 3.1% year-to-date through August. We expect the current stable macroeconomic environment to continue to be a positive for the health of our industry. However, as we continue to lap a strong year-over-year 2015 benefit from these tailwinds, we are also cautious as we look forward to the fourth quarter when our business can be variable based on the holiday season and weather volatility.
In light of these factors, in the very tough comparisons we again faced in the fourth quarter, we feel that it is appropriate to set our fourth quarter comparable store sales guidance at a range of 3% to 5%. 
We are focused to finish the year strong and are off to a good start in the fourth quarter as the solid business trends in the third quarter have continued, thus far, into October.
We are also tightening our full year comparable store sales growth guidance to a range of 4% to 5%, which reflects our year-to-date results and our fourth quarter expectations.
Finally, I would like to make a few comments about our announcement in yesterday's press release regarding our definitive agreement to purchase the assets of Bond Auto Parts. Bond is a very high quality auto parts company, headquartered in the state of Vermont, and operates 48 stores throughout Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and New York. Bond was actually founded 1 year before we were, in 1956. And for the past 60 years, we have known them as the premier part supplier for their markets in New England. Their company stands out for their knowledgeable parts professionals and a culture of excellent customer service, and we are excited about the opportunities we will have together to continue our growth in the Northeast.
We expect this transaction to close before the end of the year, and I want to take this opportunity now to express how excited we are to welcome the Bond team to Team O'Reilly. 
Before I finish up my prepared comments and turn the call over to Jeff, I would like to again thank our team for another outstanding quarter and for their continued hard work and commitment to driving the success of our business. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe we are very well positioned to capitalize on this demand and lead the industry by consistently providing outstanding service to our customers every day. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

I'd like to begin today by also congratulating Team O'Reilly on another strong quarter. This quarter is just another example of our team's steadfast commitment to outhustling the competition to earn our customers'",1112,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin today by also congratulating Team O'Reilly on another strong quarter. This quarter is just another example of our team's steadfast commitment to outhustling the competition to earn our customers' business by providing the best service. Our comparable store sales growth of 4.2% on top of an incredible 7.9% last year once again easily led the industry, and I want to thank each of our team members for their dedication to our ongoing success.
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our SG&A results for the quarter. For the third quarter, we delevered 12 basis points, which is similar to the second quarter, was primarily the result of the tough comparisons to the robust sales growth we generated in the comparable quarter of 2015 and a few specific items I'll address in a moment. 
Average per store SG&A for the third quarter increased 2.8%. Based on our results so far in 2016 and looking forward into the fourth quarter, we now expect our full year average SG&A per store guidance to increase slightly to approximately 2.5% over 2015 versus our previous expectation of 2% growth.
As a reminder, this average store SG&A comparison excludes the headwind in the second quarter of 2015 from an adverse legal judgment.
As we've discussed many times in the past, our expense control focus is a key component of the Team O'Reilly culture, and each of our managers is held accountable for the profitability of their individual store. However, and I know I'm a broken record on this one, we will always manage our store level staffing expense for the long term and won't jeopardize the excellent customer service that develops and maintains long-term relationships. 
In addition to the complexities of managing store payroll, we've seen pressure from health care cost as well as higher credit card cost, which should abate when we're fully rolled out with the chip-and-pin technology in the first quarter of 2017. We will continue to closely monitor our sales volumes, and we'll make appropriate adjustments, as needed, to prudently manage SG&A expenses, both up and down, to match business trends and the opportunities that we see in the marketplace.
We successfully added 52 new stores during the third quarter, bringing our net new store count to 141 for the year, and we continue to be pleased with the performance of our new stores. So far, this year, we've opened or acquired stores in 35 different states, including our first 2 stores in Rhode Island, our 45th state, during the third quarter.
Also included in our year-to-date new store additions was our acquisition of Frank's Auto Supermarket, a 5-store chain in Western Pennsylvania, which gives us a jumpstart as we begin to open in the Pittsburgh market. Being able to open stores effectively across our national footprint allows us to balance our growth in our expansion markets in Florida, the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic region, with backfill markets in Texas, California, the Great Lakes and throughout our other existing markets. This flexibility gives us a great advantage in selecting new sites and more importantly, identifying, hiring and training outstanding store teams to provide excellent customer service in our new stores.
As Greg discussed earlier, we have entered into an agreement to acquire the 48 stores of Bond Auto Parts in New England. Assuming Bond closes prior to the end of the year, as we anticipate, we expect our full year addition to store count for 2016 to be approximately 258 net new stores, which reflects our previous new store target of 210 stores plus the addition of the Bond stores. 
We've known the Bond family for many years and have a tremendous amount of respect for the quality of their people and their business. Their team members are truly professional parts people. We're extremely excited to welcome them to Team O'Reilly as we look forward to growing on the outstanding foundation they've established in the Northeast.
Over the course of our history, we've proven our ability to very effectively acquire existing store chains, implement our dual-market strategy and instill the O'Reilly culture in the new store teams. However, as we've discussed repeatedly in the past, we're very disciplined buyers and will only deploy our shareholders capital when we can identify companies that are a good fit with our culture and can be acquired at the right investment. 
This means that although we work hard on an ongoing basis to identify potential acquisitions, we often pass on potential deals which just don't fit our profile, which makes us that much more excited to have to reach agreement this year to add such an outstanding business to Team O'Reilly. 
As we look forward to 2017, we'll continue to execute our profitable new store growth strategy and have established a target of 190 net new store openings for the year, which is below our typical new store target as we plan to devote significant resources to converting the Bond stores. 
Finally, before I close my comments, I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the incredible efforts of our supply chain groups to support our new store growth while also continually enhancing our industry-leading parts availability, and I'd like to thank these teams for the great service levels they provide to our stores.
As we discussed on the last call, these teams very successfully opened the San Antonio distribution center earlier this year and are on track to complete the expansion of our existing DC in Greensboro, North Carolina in the first half of 2017. This expansion will add approximately 200,000 square feet to this facility and allows us to service an additional 125 stores from this location as we continue to add stores in expansion markets in the Mid-Atlantic. 
Our ability to incrementally add capacity to our supply chain network and provide high levels of inventory availability to our expansion markets is a critical component of our growth strategy, and I'm very proud of the great work these teams do to support our growth. 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our company's success. With 1 quarter left in 2016, we've had a solid year so far, but won't rest on our laurels as we push to finish the year strong. As always, the key to our success is providing unwavering customer service that surpasses expectations and continues to earn our customers' business. And I'm confident we have the team in place to outhustle and outservice the competition and keep taking market share. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."
324289,403622074,1063803,"O'Reilly Automotive Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'd also like to begin today by thanking the O'Reilly team for another very profitable and successful quarter. Now we'll take a closer look at our third quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016. For the quarter, sa",1170,"Thanks, Jeff. I'd also like to begin today by thanking the O'Reilly team for another very profitable and successful quarter. Now we'll take a closer look at our third quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016. 
For the quarter, sales increased $141 million, comprised of an $85 million increase in comp store sales; a $50 million -- excuse me, a $54 million increase in noncomp store sales; a $3 million increase in noncomp, nonstore sales; and $1 million decrease from closed stores. Based on our results for the first 9 months and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we now expect our total revenue for 2016 to be $8.5 billion to $8.6 billion. 
For the quarter, gross margin was 52.7% of sales, a 32 basis point increase over the prior year. This was in line with our expectations for the third quarter as continued strong POS margins offset a higher-than-anticipated LIFO charge of $10 million, which was a 23 -- which was 23 basis points higher than last year, but significantly lower than the second quarter. As we have discussed many times in the past, our success at reducing our acquisition cost over time has exhausted our LIFO reserve and further cost decreases require us to reduce our existing inventory value to the lower cumulative acquisition cost creating noncash headwinds to gross margin. However, these cost reductions benefit our POS margins on a go-forward basis. Excluding the impact of LIFO from both years, gross margin increased 55 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially from the second quarter. Year-to-date, gross margin was 52.3% of sales. However, excluding LIFO from both years, gross margin increased 50 basis points. 
For the year, we are tightening our full year gross margin guidance from a range of 52.3% to 52.7% to a range of 52.4% to 52.6% of sales, with the expectation that our strong POS margin improvement will continue during the fourth quarter as a result of the cost decreases we've secured throughout 2016 and that pricing in the industry will remain rational. 
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 35.5% of pretax income, which is slightly below the 35.8% we expected for the quarter. Our third quarter effective tax rate this year was significantly above the 33.6% we saw in the third quarter of 2015, which, as a reminder, benefited from a larger-than-typical tax reserve adjustment of $11 million related to a previous acquisition. We expect our fourth quarter to return to a more normal rate of approximately 37.3% of pretax income. 
Moving on to our free cash flow results. I'll provide some color to our results and our updated full year free cash flow guidance. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $234 million, which was a $21 million -- which was $21 million less than the prior year. Year-to-date, we generated $812 million in free cash flow, which is $46 million more than the prior year. The year-to-date improvement was primarily driven by our net income growth and continued successful management of working capital, specifically, net inventory, partially offset by higher year-over-year capital expenditures. 
Capital expenditure for the first 9 months were $356 million, in line with our expectations and resulted from our continued store growth and distribution expansion projects, as Jeff discussed earlier. We continue to expect capital expenditures will finish the year in the range of $460 million to $490 million. Based on our strong year-to-date free cash flow performance, we're increasing our full year free cash flow guidance to a range of $850 million to $900 million, reflecting an increase of $50 million at both ends of the range.
Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was $592,000, which was a 3% increase from the end of 2015. This growth rate was in line with our expectations for the quarter, but above our full year expectation of inventory per store growth of approximately 1.5%, driven by normal seasonality. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we grow per store inventory at a lower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generate, and we expect to continue our success of effectively deploying inventory.
Our AP to inventory ratio finished the third quarter at 107.5%, which exceeded our expectations and once again represents a new high for this ratio. Our AP percentage continues to benefit from incrementally improved terms and strong sales volumes over the last 12 months. We expect our AP to inventory ratio will moderate somewhat during the fourth quarter from its current level, but we expect to finish this year at a ratio strongly above 100% as we incrementally improve our vendor terms, but face the headwinds and seasonality.
Moving on to debt. We finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.66x, down from the 1.69x at the end of the second quarter, driven by our strong trailing 12-month operating income performance, but up from the 1.57x at the end of the third quarter last year. We are still well below our targeted range of 2 to 2.25x, however, we continue to believe our stated leverage range is appropriate for our business, and we'll move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
We continue to execute our share repurchase program. And during the third quarter, we repurchased 0.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $281.04 per share. Year-to-date through yesterday, we've repurchased 3.9 million shares at an average share price of $262.32 for a total investment of $1 billion. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of the opportunities to invest in our business at a high rate of return, and we will prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns for our shareholders.
We're establishing our fourth quarter earnings per share guidance at a range of $2.44 to $2.54. Based on our year-to-date results and the additional share repurchases since our last call, for the full year, we are tightening our earnings per share guidance to a range of $10.58 to $10.68, which represents a $0.13 increase from the midpoint of the previous annual guidance we provided on our second quarter earnings release in July, driven by our stronger-than-expected third quarter operating results and the incremental share repurchases.
As a reminder, in line with our normal practice, our guidance includes all of the share repurchase through this call, but does not include any future share repurchases. 
Before I turn the call over to our analysts for questions, I would once again like to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued hard work, dedication and unrelenting focus on providing consistently superior levels of customer service. Your ongoing efforts continue to drive our profitable growth, and we cannot thank you enough. 
This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I'd like to ask Adrienne, the operator, to return to the line, and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

So we would, over time, alleviate the need to have availability by putting on a big hub or something like that. But ultimately, the replenishment would come out of Devens. From a real estate stand point, the company doesn't actually own the real estate. We've entered a lease agreement with some of the family members to lease the locations that they own, and then we have other third-party leases that we would take over those leases and run the stores as lease properties."

We're doing a good job on the do-it-for-me side as we progressively established what our company is about and the availability of model and the service model and those kinds of things, so that continues to build. We see a lot of opportunity in the Northeast. We're -- there's a lot of high population areas that we're not in. We have a lot of capacity in Devens that we've not yet used.

Well, what I would say is that we've had pretty strong competitors on the e-commerce side in the DIY business for quite some time with some other suppliers that did a pretty good job there. Our DIY business is doing really well. As I said in my prepared comments, both our DIY and our do-it-for-me business were pretty well even contributors to our 4.2% comp store sales. So we're doing pretty well in DIY. Obviously, we see these e-commerce players that sell at prices below the brick-and-mortar companies online. There's a lot of elements to play in the auto parts that I think differentiate us from many other retail channels. But primarily, it's about -- and I'm speaking just on the DIY side, many times, when a DIY customer walks into our stores, they're really needing help, figuring out how to solve a problem that they have, and we provide that help. And not only we provide that help, but we are able to tell them the tools that they need to fix the car, just the whole array of things. And we even loan the tools. We've got a very significant loan a tool program, where a customer will put a tool that they might otherwise not be able to buy because the expense of a specialty tool or something, they can put it on a credit card, use it to install the part and fixing their car then bring it back for a full refund when they're done. And we put it back on the shelf and reuse it again for the next customer that needs to use that. So those kinds of services are pretty hard to quantify, but they're incredibly valuable when servicing the DIY customer. On the B2B side, and I speak from having done this for 32 years and previously being in the repair business, that none of the shops or very few of the shop stock parts. They may stock a small array of filters or maybe a few belts or a few batteries, stuff like that. But almost every repair that they make, the parts have to be delivered. And it's just so incredibly important that they're able to turn their bays over quickly and keep their technicians busy in order to provide gainful employment for the technicians, but also maximize the revenue and the profitability of the shop. And most shops nowadays know that they can get 30 to 45-minute service out of these -- out of the company like ours that has a wide array of parts than our competitors in many cases have this wide array for parts. It's just hard for me to see a company like Amazon being a significant player on the do-it-for-me side. And I would tell you on the DIY side, while there are some people that are going to buy some parts and some accessories over the Internet because they can wait, because they know what they're doing in making the repair, the vast majority need help and appreciate the advice, recommendation and the help that we give them in repairing their cars."

In my prepared comments, I spoke to August and July on a monthly basis being Sunday affected, which Sunday is our lowest volume day. Probably, a more -- from a trend standpoint, a more meaningful way to look at our comp cadence throughout the quarter will be to look at it on a weekly basis, and I've got that in front of me now. I'll tell you, our sales on a weekly basis were just pretty darn consistent throughout the period, and that consistency has continued to this point in the quarter. And this quarter, our toughest comparers to last year are this month and December. We have a softer comparison in November, and we carry this -- the healthy strong trend that we were on into this -- in the fourth quarter. It's hard to say what our competitors were up against from a comparison standpoint what -- on a weekly basis, what they're up against from just a geography standpoint because I know some are more exposed to the weather-affected areas in the Northeast. And again, this quarter, we saw a difference in the areas that we would consider to be weather affected versus not. And taking into consideration the maturity of some of the stores or maybe the lack of maturity of some of the stores, we still would look at somewhere in the 400 to 500 basis point difference in comp performance between the weather affected stores and the nonweather affected stores."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts Third Quarter Conference Call. Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Shaw, our Executive Vice President of Store Operations and Sales. David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; and Greg Johnson, our Executive Vice President of Supply Chain, are also present. 
I'm once again pleased to begin our call today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another solid quarter and strong year-to-date results. Our team, made up of over 74,000 dedicated team members, now across 45 states, continues to earn our customers' business and gain market share by consistently providing unsurpassed levels of customer service. This unwavering commitment to customer service drove our third quarter comparable store sales increase of 4.2%, which continues to significantly outpace our industry. These solid results were in line with our guidance of 3% to 5% and were on top of last year's excellent third quarter comparable store sales increase of 7.9%, representing this year's most difficult comparison to the prior year. 
For the first 3 quarters of 2016, our comparable store sales increased 4.8% or 12.2% on a 2-year stack basis, and this consistent market-leading performance is a testament to the quality of our team and the commitment we've made to providing incredible levels of service to our valued customers.
In total, we grew sales for the quarter by 6.8%, and our ongoing focus on profitable growth and expense control translated to solid top line performance into a record third quarter operating margin of 20.2%. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $2.90 is a 10% increase over our reported EPS for the third quarter of 2015 of $2.64. As a reminder, last year, our third quarter EPS results included a larger-than-typical tax benefit of $0.11 from the resolution of certain historical tax positions.
As we called out on the call last year, this benefit, while very positive for our company, was not representative of our expected tax rate going forward or our ongoing operating performance and as appropriate, to focus on our EPS, excluding this benefit from last year.
On this basis, our third quarter 2016 EPS grew 15% compared to adjusted EPS for the third quarter of 2015, representing our 31st consecutive quarter of adjusted EPS growth of 15% or greater.
Our team's track record of strong earnings growth over such a long period of time is a reflection of the effectiveness of our customer service-oriented culture, dual market strategy and focus on profitable, sustainable growth.
The composition of our comparable store sales growth in the third quarter was very balanced, with our professional and DIY sides of our business contributing equally to our comparable store sales growth. We saw solid increases in both comparable ticket average and transaction count with a slightly larger contribution from our professional ticket count, although our DIY ticket count continues to be solid.
As has been the case for several quarters, the increase in average ticket has been driven by increasing parts complexity rather than inflation or pricing, which has remained very static in our industry.
On a category basis, we saw a strong performance throughout the quarter in weather-related categories, such as batteries and air conditioning, as a result of the hot summer weather. We also continue to see solid performance in key hard parts category, such as chassis and brakes, against very difficult comparisons for these categories in the third quarter of 2015.
Moving onto the cadence of our comparable store sales growth in the quarter. Our monthly results in 2016 were impacted by a shift in a number of Sundays, our lightest volume day, both in July and August as compared to last year. Adjusting for this calendar shift, our monthly comparable store sales increase was consistently solid throughout the quarter. Overall, the macroeconomic environment continues to be a positive contributor to demand for our industry and was a factor in our continued steady comparable store sales growth for the third quarter.
Unemployment levels have stabilized over the last year at around 5%, and the associated commuter miles, along with the continued low gas prices, have benefited total miles driven in the U.S., which were up 3.1% year-to-date through August. We expect the current stable macroeconomic environment to continue to be a positive for the health of our industry. However, as we continue to lap a strong year-over-year 2015 benefit from these tailwinds, we are also cautious as we look forward to the fourth quarter when our business can be variable based on the holiday season and weather volatility.
In light of these factors, in the very tough comparisons we again faced in the fourth quarter, we feel that it is appropriate to set our fourth quarter comparable store sales guidance at a range of 3% to 5%. 
We are focused to finish the year strong and are off to a good start in the fourth quarter as the solid business trends in the third quarter have continued, thus far, into October.
We are also tightening our full year comparable store sales growth guidance to a range of 4% to 5%, which reflects our year-to-date results and our fourth quarter expectations.
Finally, I would like to make a few comments about our announcement in yesterday's press release regarding our definitive agreement to purchase the assets of Bond Auto Parts. Bond is a very high quality auto parts company, headquartered in the state of Vermont, and operates 48 stores throughout Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and New York. Bond was actually founded 1 year before we were, in 1956. And for the past 60 years, we have known them as the premier part supplier for their markets in New England. Their company stands out for their knowledgeable parts professionals and a culture of excellent customer service, and we are excited about the opportunities we will have together to continue our growth in the Northeast.
We expect this transaction to close before the end of the year, and I want to take this opportunity now to express how excited we are to welcome the Bond team to Team O'Reilly. 
Before I finish up my prepared comments and turn the call over to Jeff, I would like to again thank our team for another outstanding quarter and for their continued hard work and commitment to driving the success of our business. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe we are very well positioned to capitalize on this demand and lead the industry by consistently providing outstanding service to our customers every day. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

I'd like to begin today by also congratulating Team O'Reilly on another strong quarter. This quarter is just another example of our team's steadfast commitment to outhustling the competition to earn our customers'",1112,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin today by also congratulating Team O'Reilly on another strong quarter. This quarter is just another example of our team's steadfast commitment to outhustling the competition to earn our customers' business by providing the best service. Our comparable store sales growth of 4.2% on top of an incredible 7.9% last year once again easily led the industry, and I want to thank each of our team members for their dedication to our ongoing success.
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our SG&A results for the quarter. For the third quarter, we delevered 12 basis points, which is similar to the second quarter, was primarily the result of the tough comparisons to the robust sales growth we generated in the comparable quarter of 2015 and a few specific items I'll address in a moment. 
Average per store SG&A for the third quarter increased 2.8%. Based on our results so far in 2016 and looking forward into the fourth quarter, we now expect our full year average SG&A per store guidance to increase slightly to approximately 2.5% over 2015 versus our previous expectation of 2% growth.
As a reminder, this average store SG&A comparison excludes the headwind in the second quarter of 2015 from an adverse legal judgment.
As we've discussed many times in the past, our expense control focus is a key component of the Team O'Reilly culture, and each of our managers is held accountable for the profitability of their individual store. However, and I know I'm a broken record on this one, we will always manage our store level staffing expense for the long term and won't jeopardize the excellent customer service that develops and maintains long-term relationships. 
In addition to the complexities of managing store payroll, we've seen pressure from health care cost as well as higher credit card cost, which should abate when we're fully rolled out with the chip-and-pin technology in the first quarter of 2017. We will continue to closely monitor our sales volumes, and we'll make appropriate adjustments, as needed, to prudently manage SG&A expenses, both up and down, to match business trends and the opportunities that we see in the marketplace.
We successfully added 52 new stores during the third quarter, bringing our net new store count to 141 for the year, and we continue to be pleased with the performance of our new stores. So far, this year, we've opened or acquired stores in 35 different states, including our first 2 stores in Rhode Island, our 45th state, during the third quarter.
Also included in our year-to-date new store additions was our acquisition of Frank's Auto Supermarket, a 5-store chain in Western Pennsylvania, which gives us a jumpstart as we begin to open in the Pittsburgh market. Being able to open stores effectively across our national footprint allows us to balance our growth in our expansion markets in Florida, the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic region, with backfill markets in Texas, California, the Great Lakes and throughout our other existing markets. This flexibility gives us a great advantage in selecting new sites and more importantly, identifying, hiring and training outstanding store teams to provide excellent customer service in our new stores.
As Greg discussed earlier, we have entered into an agreement to acquire the 48 stores of Bond Auto Parts in New England. Assuming Bond closes prior to the end of the year, as we anticipate, we expect our full year addition to store count for 2016 to be approximately 258 net new stores, which reflects our previous new store target of 210 stores plus the addition of the Bond stores. 
We've known the Bond family for many years and have a tremendous amount of respect for the quality of their people and their business. Their team members are truly professional parts people. We're extremely excited to welcome them to Team O'Reilly as we look forward to growing on the outstanding foundation they've established in the Northeast.
Over the course of our history, we've proven our ability to very effectively acquire existing store chains, implement our dual-market strategy and instill the O'Reilly culture in the new store teams. However, as we've discussed repeatedly in the past, we're very disciplined buyers and will only deploy our shareholders capital when we can identify companies that are a good fit with our culture and can be acquired at the right investment. 
This means that although we work hard on an ongoing basis to identify potential acquisitions, we often pass on potential deals which just don't fit our profile, which makes us that much more excited to have to reach agreement this year to add such an outstanding business to Team O'Reilly. 
As we look forward to 2017, we'll continue to execute our profitable new store growth strategy and have established a target of 190 net new store openings for the year, which is below our typical new store target as we plan to devote significant resources to converting the Bond stores. 
Finally, before I close my comments, I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the incredible efforts of our supply chain groups to support our new store growth while also continually enhancing our industry-leading parts availability, and I'd like to thank these teams for the great service levels they provide to our stores.
As we discussed on the last call, these teams very successfully opened the San Antonio distribution center earlier this year and are on track to complete the expansion of our existing DC in Greensboro, North Carolina in the first half of 2017. This expansion will add approximately 200,000 square feet to this facility and allows us to service an additional 125 stores from this location as we continue to add stores in expansion markets in the Mid-Atlantic. 
Our ability to incrementally add capacity to our supply chain network and provide high levels of inventory availability to our expansion markets is a critical component of our growth strategy, and I'm very proud of the great work these teams do to support our growth. 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our company's success. With 1 quarter left in 2016, we've had a solid year so far, but won't rest on our laurels as we push to finish the year strong. As always, the key to our success is providing unwavering customer service that surpasses expectations and continues to earn our customers' business. And I'm confident we have the team in place to outhustle and outservice the competition and keep taking market share. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."
324289,403622074,1064686,"O'Reilly Automotive Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'd also like to begin today by thanking the O'Reilly team for another very profitable and successful quarter. Now we'll take a closer look at our third quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016. For the quarter, sa",1170,"Thanks, Jeff. I'd also like to begin today by thanking the O'Reilly team for another very profitable and successful quarter. Now we'll take a closer look at our third quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2016. 
For the quarter, sales increased $141 million, comprised of an $85 million increase in comp store sales; a $50 million -- excuse me, a $54 million increase in noncomp store sales; a $3 million increase in noncomp, nonstore sales; and $1 million decrease from closed stores. Based on our results for the first 9 months and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we now expect our total revenue for 2016 to be $8.5 billion to $8.6 billion. 
For the quarter, gross margin was 52.7% of sales, a 32 basis point increase over the prior year. This was in line with our expectations for the third quarter as continued strong POS margins offset a higher-than-anticipated LIFO charge of $10 million, which was a 23 -- which was 23 basis points higher than last year, but significantly lower than the second quarter. As we have discussed many times in the past, our success at reducing our acquisition cost over time has exhausted our LIFO reserve and further cost decreases require us to reduce our existing inventory value to the lower cumulative acquisition cost creating noncash headwinds to gross margin. However, these cost reductions benefit our POS margins on a go-forward basis. Excluding the impact of LIFO from both years, gross margin increased 55 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially from the second quarter. Year-to-date, gross margin was 52.3% of sales. However, excluding LIFO from both years, gross margin increased 50 basis points. 
For the year, we are tightening our full year gross margin guidance from a range of 52.3% to 52.7% to a range of 52.4% to 52.6% of sales, with the expectation that our strong POS margin improvement will continue during the fourth quarter as a result of the cost decreases we've secured throughout 2016 and that pricing in the industry will remain rational. 
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 35.5% of pretax income, which is slightly below the 35.8% we expected for the quarter. Our third quarter effective tax rate this year was significantly above the 33.6% we saw in the third quarter of 2015, which, as a reminder, benefited from a larger-than-typical tax reserve adjustment of $11 million related to a previous acquisition. We expect our fourth quarter to return to a more normal rate of approximately 37.3% of pretax income. 
Moving on to our free cash flow results. I'll provide some color to our results and our updated full year free cash flow guidance. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $234 million, which was a $21 million -- which was $21 million less than the prior year. Year-to-date, we generated $812 million in free cash flow, which is $46 million more than the prior year. The year-to-date improvement was primarily driven by our net income growth and continued successful management of working capital, specifically, net inventory, partially offset by higher year-over-year capital expenditures. 
Capital expenditure for the first 9 months were $356 million, in line with our expectations and resulted from our continued store growth and distribution expansion projects, as Jeff discussed earlier. We continue to expect capital expenditures will finish the year in the range of $460 million to $490 million. Based on our strong year-to-date free cash flow performance, we're increasing our full year free cash flow guidance to a range of $850 million to $900 million, reflecting an increase of $50 million at both ends of the range.
Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was $592,000, which was a 3% increase from the end of 2015. This growth rate was in line with our expectations for the quarter, but above our full year expectation of inventory per store growth of approximately 1.5%, driven by normal seasonality. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we grow per store inventory at a lower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generate, and we expect to continue our success of effectively deploying inventory.
Our AP to inventory ratio finished the third quarter at 107.5%, which exceeded our expectations and once again represents a new high for this ratio. Our AP percentage continues to benefit from incrementally improved terms and strong sales volumes over the last 12 months. We expect our AP to inventory ratio will moderate somewhat during the fourth quarter from its current level, but we expect to finish this year at a ratio strongly above 100% as we incrementally improve our vendor terms, but face the headwinds and seasonality.
Moving on to debt. We finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.66x, down from the 1.69x at the end of the second quarter, driven by our strong trailing 12-month operating income performance, but up from the 1.57x at the end of the third quarter last year. We are still well below our targeted range of 2 to 2.25x, however, we continue to believe our stated leverage range is appropriate for our business, and we'll move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
We continue to execute our share repurchase program. And during the third quarter, we repurchased 0.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $281.04 per share. Year-to-date through yesterday, we've repurchased 3.9 million shares at an average share price of $262.32 for a total investment of $1 billion. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of the opportunities to invest in our business at a high rate of return, and we will prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns for our shareholders.
We're establishing our fourth quarter earnings per share guidance at a range of $2.44 to $2.54. Based on our year-to-date results and the additional share repurchases since our last call, for the full year, we are tightening our earnings per share guidance to a range of $10.58 to $10.68, which represents a $0.13 increase from the midpoint of the previous annual guidance we provided on our second quarter earnings release in July, driven by our stronger-than-expected third quarter operating results and the incremental share repurchases.
As a reminder, in line with our normal practice, our guidance includes all of the share repurchase through this call, but does not include any future share repurchases. 
Before I turn the call over to our analysts for questions, I would once again like to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued hard work, dedication and unrelenting focus on providing consistently superior levels of customer service. Your ongoing efforts continue to drive our profitable growth, and we cannot thank you enough. 
This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I'd like to ask Adrienne, the operator, to return to the line, and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

But kind of the plan is, is that we would further leverage our distribution capacity in Devens, Massachusetts and supply those stores from there while not sacrificing the benefit they have of availability by having as many parts as they have available in Central Vermont. So we would, over time, alleviate the need to have availability by putting on a big hub or something like that. But ultimately, the replenishment would come out of Devens. From a real estate stand point, the company doesn't actually own the real estate. We've entered a lease agreement with some of the family members to lease the locations that they own, and then we have other third-party leases that we would take over those leases and run the stores as lease properties."

So the -- what I would say is that our DIY business has come on a little faster. We're doing a good job on the do-it-for-me side as we progressively established what our company is about and the availability of model and the service model and those kinds of things, so that continues to build. We see a lot of opportunity in the Northeast. We're -- there's a lot of high population areas that we're not in. We have a lot of capacity in Devens that we've not yet used. So our plan will be to continue to build out that area of the country and become one of the dominant parts suppliers on the professional side, but then also put a big dent in the DIY business up there."

Well, what I would say is that we've had pretty strong competitors on the e-commerce side in the DIY business for quite some time with some other suppliers that did a pretty good job there. Our DIY business is doing really well. As I said in my prep",521,"Okay. Well, what I would say is that we've had pretty strong competitors on the e-commerce side in the DIY business for quite some time with some other suppliers that did a pretty good job there. Our DIY business is doing really well. As I said in my prepared comments, both our DIY and our do-it-for-me business were pretty well even contributors to our 4.2% comp store sales. So we're doing pretty well in DIY. Obviously, we see these e-commerce players that sell at prices below the brick-and-mortar companies online. There's a lot of elements to play in the auto parts that I think differentiate us from many other retail channels. But primarily, it's about -- and I'm speaking just on the DIY side, many times, when a DIY customer walks into our stores, they're really needing help, figuring out how to solve a problem that they have, and we provide that help. And not only we provide that help, but we are able to tell them the tools that they need to fix the car, just the whole array of things. And we even loan the tools. We've got a very significant loan a tool program, where a customer will put a tool that they might otherwise not be able to buy because the expense of a specialty tool or something, they can put it on a credit card, use it to install the part and fixing their car then bring it back for a full refund when they're done. And we put it back on the shelf and reuse it again for the next customer that needs to use that. So those kinds of services are pretty hard to quantify, but they're incredibly valuable when servicing the DIY customer. On the B2B side, and I speak from having done this for 32 years and previously being in the repair business, that none of the shops or very few of the shop stock parts. They may stock a small array of filters or maybe a few belts or a few batteries, stuff like that. But almost every repair that they make, the parts have to be delivered. And it's just so incredibly important that they're able to turn their bays over quickly and keep their technicians busy in order to provide gainful employment for the technicians, but also maximize the revenue and the profitability of the shop. And most shops nowadays know that they can get 30 to 45-minute service out of these -- out of the company like ours that has a wide array of parts than our competitors in many cases have this wide array for parts. It's just hard for me to see a company like Amazon being a significant player on the do-it-for-me side. And I would tell you on the DIY side, while there are some people that are going to buy some parts and some accessories over the Internet because they can wait, because they know what they're doing in making the repair, the vast majority need help and appreciate the advice, recommendation and the help that we give them in repairing their cars."

In my prepared comments, I spoke to August and July on a monthly basis being Sunday affected, which Sunday is our lowest volume day. Probably, a more -- from a trend standpoint, a more meaningful way to look at our comp cadence throughout the quarter will be to look at it on a weekly basis, and I've got that in front of me now. I'll tell you, our sales on a weekly basis were just pretty darn consistent throughout the period, and that consistency has continued to this point in the quarter. And this quarter, our toughest comparers to last year are this month and December. We have a softer comparison in November, and we carry this -- the healthy strong trend that we were on into this -- in the fourth quarter. It's hard to say what our competitors were up against from a comparison standpoint what -- on a weekly basis, what they're up against from just a geography standpoint because I know some are more exposed to the weather-affected areas in the Northeast. And again, this quarter, we saw a difference in the areas that we would consider to be weather affected versus not. And taking into consideration the maturity of some of the stores or maybe the lack of maturity of some of the stores, we still would look at somewhere in the 400 to 500 basis point difference in comp performance between the weather affected stores and the nonweather affected stores."

Generally speaking, it's on the professional side of our business where companies that are trying to gain market share -- and the most recent entry of some of the larger retail-type companies into the wholesale business is what's talked about most now, but for years, we've had competition from a number of companies on the professional side. So there's always promotions, specials, new ideas. Something that's happening here recently is kind of the kit idea where competitors -- and us too now, we'll put 2 brake rotors and a set of pads and give it a kit price rather than the individual piece price. So there's always a lot of competition. I would say that it's consistent with what I've seen in the last 30 years but, nonetheless, there's a lot of competition."
