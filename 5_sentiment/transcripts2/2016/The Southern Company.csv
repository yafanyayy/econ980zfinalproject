As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. 2015 was a tremendous year for Southern Company as we continue to see outstanding performance in our franchise operations. We saw strong financial",1002,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. 
2015 was a tremendous year for Southern Company as we continue to see outstanding performance in our franchise operations. We saw strong financial performance from both our wholesale subsidiary, Southern Power, and our traditional operating companies. Our state-regulated utility delivered the 2015 results despite the warmest December in the last 120 years. 
We continued our long-standing tradition of operational excellence, once again ranking among the best in our industry for customer satisfaction and solidifying our reputation as one of the most trusted energy providers in America. We experienced great success with strategic initiatives at both Southern Power, and our traditional operating companies continued to build the energy portfolio of the future with significant expansions of their renewable energy resources. 
And in our ongoing quest to deliver superior risk-adjusted long-term growth, we entered into an agreement to acquire AGL Resources and create a platform from which we expect to compete for growth more broadly across the energy value chain.
Now regarding AGL Resources, I will just briefly add that activities related to the proposed merger are progressing in a timely fashion. The waiting period under the HSR Antitrust Improvement Act expired in late 2015, a necessary milestone for closing the transaction. In addition, AGL Resources shareholders voted in November to approve the merger. The merger remains subject to certain other customary closing conditions, including state regulatory approvals, and we are currently engaged in regulatory proceedings for the various state commissions. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016. 
In a few moments, Art will discuss the drivers of our financial performance in more detail and provide guidance for 2016. Before that, however, I will address the progress we've experienced with our major construction projects at plant Vogtle and in Kemper County, Mississippi. 
First, an update on the plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. As reported in our last quarterly call, we agreed to a settlement with our contractors for the 2 new units at plant Vogtle. We have now finalized that settlement, and the related litigation has been dismissed. As a reminder, the $350 million settlement resolves all outstanding commercial issues for the project and amends our EPC agreement to provide even greater protections for customers. The settlement affirms and provides incentives for anticipated fuel load base in December 2018 and 2019 as well as our expected in-service dates in June 2019 and 2020.
In related transaction, Westinghouse acquired the nuclear construction Chicago Bridge & Iron. This move positions Westinghouse and its affiliates as the primary contractor under our EPC agreement, and they have engaged with floor to provide day-to-day construction leadership. We have worked very closely with the contractors through this transition, and I'm pleased to say that, thus far, we are very encouraged by the improved communication and efficiencies we've observed on site. 
On January 21, Georgia Power filed an application for review of the settlement with the Georgia PSC. Yesterday, the PSC made and approved motion asking Georgia Power to file further information within the next 60 days pertaining to the prudence of the project to date as well as the current schedule and cost forecast. Other interested parties will have an opportunity to make filings of their own in response. This will allow the PSC to consider the settlement agreement in the context of a more comprehensive review of the full project cost and schedule. The commission staff, which will not make any separate filings, will have 6 months to analyze these filings. If the staff identifies any issues of imprudence or unreasonableness, they are directed to work with Georgia Power toward a possible settlement of any such issues within that same 6 months period. During this 6-month period, there will be no hearings. If there is a settlement between the company and the staff, Georgia Power and the commission staff will file that for the commission to consider in the fall. If the parties do not come to a settlement, the commission will decide how to proceed.
Let's turn now to an update on the Kemper County facility. The combined cycle performed exceptionally well in 2015, providing over 1/3 of the electricity consumed by Mississippi Power customers last year. Major startup activities are ongoing, and we continue to transition to operational testing. [indiscernible] trials on the first 2 gasifiers are complete, and we were able to begin the cure-out process for gasifier refractory. The [indiscernible] process was an important validation of the scale of the technology as the operators were able to use the control system, circulate sand and air at design flow rate through the gasifier, a good rehearsal for the eventual introduction of lignite to the operation. the team is currently working to repair a portion of the refractory in the first gasifier and making improvements to all of the novels in the refractory lining of both gasifiers to address hotspots identified during the initial cure-out process for the first gasifier. The type of work to repair and improve the refractory lining is similar to the refractory replacement and will be a common part of the plant's long-term maintenance. However, these activities are time-intensive, and they are the primary driver for our scheduled extension into the third quarter of 2016. As always, quality and safety are our top priorities as we are taking steps to help ensure that Mississippi Power customers will enjoy the benefits of a reliable source of low-cost energy for decades to come. We expect to introduce lignite to gasifier late this spring. This critical step is the beginning of the important process of integrating all of the various systems of the facility.
In December, the Mississippi Public Service Commission unanimously approved rates for the combined cycle assets already in service. Mississippi Power plant is to seek recovery of the remaining assets after they are placed into service. 
Art will now provide a financial update, including an outlook for 2016 and beyond."

As you can see from the materials released this morning, we had solid results for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year 2015. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we earned $0.30 per share compared to $0.31",1535,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials released this morning, we had solid results for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year 2015. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we earned $0.30 per share compared to $0.31 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year 2015, we earned $2.60 per share compared to $2.19 per share in 2014, an increase of $0.41 per share. Excluding certain adjustments listed in the earnings materials, earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 were $0.44, $2.89 per share, respectively, compared with $0.38 and $2.80 per share, respectively, for the same periods in 2014. 
As Tom mentioned earlier, our adjusted annual results of $2.89 was just above the top of our 2015 guidance range we established a year ago. The major earnings drivers when compared to our $2.80 adjusted results for 2014 were residential and commercial sales growth, retail revenue effects and tremendous success with renewable projects at Southern Power. These positive drivers were partially offset by increase shares, higher depreciation, operation and maintenance costs and weather. A more comprehensive list of drivers is included in the materials we released this morning.
Moving now to an economic and sales review of 2015. The economy within our region continues to experience modest growth. Favorable domestic market fundamentals include strong employment growth that have served to underpin consumer confidence and spending. At the same time, the effects of the strong dollar, low commodity prices and economic weakness abroad have combined to constrain manufacturing growth in our region. 
Total weather adjusted retail sales grew by 0.3% in 2015, led by commercial sales, which were up almost 1% for the year. We experienced positive growth for the commercial sales in every quarter in 2015, which we have not seen since before the recession. 
Weather adjusted residential sales grew by 0.4% during 2015. Growth in the residential sector has been fueled largely by customer growth as the Southeast continues to see positive in migration. More than 37,000 new residential customers were added in 2015, an increase from 2014 when we added some 31,500 new customers.
Industrial sales fell by 0.3% in 2015. We experienced a modest deceleration in industrial growth in our region as a result of the strong dollar, low oil price and natural gas prices and significant economic slowdown in China and other emerging markets.
We have seen the impact of these factors on 3 of our largest industrial segments: Primary metals, chemicals and paper. However, transportation in housing-related industries had supported growth, and we expect those segments to continue to do well in 2016.
Economic development activity remains robust and consistent with previous quarters' activities. Job creation and capital investment for 2015 exceeded 2014 levels, and the pipeline of potential projects grew significantly compared to recent years. Corporate announcements and potential projects represent a broad cross-section of industries, including automotive, primary and fabricated metals, aerospace and chemical segments. Also within our region, Alabama was named the top state for economic development by Business Facilities Magazine and Georgia has been ranked first for business climate by Site Selection Magazine for the third consecutive year. Despite economic headwinds from overseas, our regional economy remains in a positive growth mode. During our most recent economic roundtable, the consensus of the participants was that the economy will grow in 2016 supported by robust employment and spending growth, modest income gains and a steady housing recovery, all pointing to further growth in energy demand. 
Our sales growth guidance for 2016 is 1.1% for retail sales, 1.2% for residential sales and 1% for both commercial and industrial sales. 
Before we cover the details of our capital expenditure forecast, financing plan and earnings-per-share guidance, I'd like to speak to the impact of the recent extension of tax benefits on our financial outlook. We currently project that a 5-year extension of bonus depreciation will improve cash flows by approximately $4 billion through 2020 and potentially more, assuming Southern Power is able to execute on its growth plan. This translates to a significant uplift in the value of the enterprise. Over the next few years, some of the biggest tax benefits are expected to be generated by plant Ratcliffe, plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 along with a variety of renewable energy projects and environmental compliance investments. Considering our customer-focused business model, this is very good news. All else being equal, our customers should benefit from lower retail rates over time. In addition to the implied reduction in regulatory risk, we expect to enjoy reduced exposure to both debt and equity capital markets over the next several years. 
Perhaps the greatest benefit of all these tax benefits is a level of cash flow support we project for our common dividend. Of course, dividend policy is ultimately subject to the approval of our Board of Directors, but our expected cash coverage of dividends is greatly improved compared to how we characterized our dividend growth at the time of the AGL Resources merger announcement. We fundamentally believe that value is a function of risk and return. Given the magnitude of the dollars and the high degree of certainty inherent in these deductions, Southern Company's value proposition should be greatly improved.
We provided an updated forecast of capital expenditures for 2016 through 2018 in our slide presentation. This stand-alone projection does not include AGL Resources. Anticipating continued success at Southern Power, we are excited about the possibilities that exist with the extension of tax benefits for both wind and solar projects. 
We have enjoyed a higher-than-anticipated growth from Southern Power in recent years. In fact, a year ago, our 2015 through 2017 CapEx forecast was approximately $3 billion. Today, based on our recent success, we estimate the same period to be about $5 billion of investment for Southern Power. Going forward, we expect to sustain that same level of activity and success. In fact, our Southern Power forecast for 2016 through 2018 includes CapEx of $5 billion for wind, solar and traditional natural gas generation projects.
Our CapEx forecast for our traditional operating companies does not include projects specific to the Clean Power Plan. If our ultimate compliance plans require investment prior to 2019, our current CapEx projection could or would increase. Our forecasted $1.8 billion investment in environmental compliance over the next 3 years is largely associated with EPA's affluent guidelines and final coal combustion residuals rule. Included in the appendix of our slide deck are a projected financing plan, credit ratings and a schedule of maturities and a liquidity summary. 
Within our financing plan, you will note the anticipated debt issuances to fund the AGL Resources merger. We expect these notes to be issued shortly before the closing of the acquisition and to include a blend of maturities. Additionally, we are planning on a $1.2 billion in equity issuances in the calendar year 2016. As discussed earlier, the extension of bonus depreciation is expected to reduce our exposure to the capital markets, and that has resulted in a favorable impact to the remainder of our financing plan.
Considering the incremental cash flow, along with our Department of Energy loan facility for Plant Vogtle construction, and on the assumption that we will utilize securitized financing for a significant portion of Kemper, which is subject to approval by the Mississippi Public Service Commission, our exposure to the debt markets for our traditional operating companies over the next 3 years should be limited. Southern Power's debt financing needs will be driven largely by their success in finding suitable projects to fill the placeholders in the CapEx forecast. 
An additional benefit of the incremental cash flow from bonus depreciation is the effect on our need to issue new equity. We currently project no additional equity issuances beyond the $1.2 billion in 2016. Financial integrity and strong credit ratings have always been priorities for us, and that emphasis remains unchanged. Our financial outlook, including our expected credit metrics in 2016 through 2018 has improved, and we continue to believe our credit profile is fully supportive of our credit ratings.
Moving now to our earnings-per-share outlook. You will recall that we began issuing new shares in the fourth quarter of 2015 under our internal equity programs, largely to fund the AGL transaction and to reinforce our commitment to financial integrity. The cumulative effect of the shares issued in 2015 and projected for 2016 equates to a $0.06 dilutive impact on our stand-alone 2016 earnings per share. In addition, the estimated impact of bonus depreciation is $0.04. But for the cumulative impact of these shares and bonus depreciation, we would have been in the top half of our 3% to 4% stand-alone trajectory for 2016. 
Considering these drivers, our stand-alone 2016 earnings-per-share guidance, excluding any cost to achieve the AGL Resources merger, is $2.76 to $2.88 per share. Assuming the AGL merger closes later this year, our long-term earnings-per-share growth outlook remains a range of 4% to 5%. In addition to our earnings estimate -- in addition, our earnings estimate for the first quarter of 2016 is $0.53 per share. 
I will now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks."

The number is going to be somewhere between $4 billion and maybe over $5 billion of cash. The $4 billion of cash that we talked about is really through 2020 and doesn't really assume that Southern Power execute its growth plan, which we think they will. So the number could be higher, maybe over a longer timeframe. When we look at -- so that's kind of a source of cash. When we look at the uses of cash over time, we got into an argument here internally about how to attribute the benefits of that cash. So let's go through it, and let's just use the $4 billion number, although the number could be higher. We had always assumed in our former financial plan, assuming we buy AGL, a $3 billion equity issuance over the timeframe. We're going to do $4 billion in cash. If you just use a 40% equity ratio, 40% times $4 billion, so the cash retires, a mix of capital requirement, the equity portion that would be 1.6. If the total amount of equity was 3 and you don't have to issue 1.6 now, that leaves you 1.4 to issue. When you look at the uses of cash, we could go through a variety of ways to attribute the shares, but since the biggest issue of cash is a near-term use, and that is to acquire AGL. So we decided to allocate the new equity essentially to that project. And so if you think about it, $200 million issued in '15 plus another $1.2 billion represents the balance of $3 billion less $1.6 billion equals $1.4 billion. So that's really the simple math. Look, Dan, we could have allocated the equity to Southern Power. We could have taken a pro rata approach. This is just the way we decided to do it, to keep the plans in place through '16."

So what is -- could you just be specific on what is the $0.14 difference between what you had said before and what you're saying now?"

Look, PE times EPS is a short end for value. When you think about the intrinsic value of Southern, we got bumped from the passage of this bill an additional $4 billion to $5 billion and perhaps more of cash. So when you look at the delta, the number is $0.04 here. That's how you get to 2 82 and we grow off of that 4% to 5%. It is inescapable. In fact, I would argue that the adjustment, from a book standpoint, is in earnings-per-share. But the value adjustment is probably in the PE ratio. If you do a DCF on Southern, we just increase $4 billion to $5 billion just on cash from where we were before. So take 2 88 at 5%, 2 76 at 4%, and that will be our growth trajectory going forward."

We had talked historically about leading and lagging indicators. And in fact, I would argue our staff is as good as anybody in predicting the direction of the market. And what we had been seeing historically is that industrial sales are the leading indicator. Even better than that is economic development. But let's just stay with industrial sales. They create jobs, they grow personal incomes that are above normal for the Southeast. As we create jobs, people move in. They get those jobs, they get the higher incomes, they start consuming more, that's residential. And then as more people move in, the commercial sector comes in, they do drycleaners and grocery stores and hospitals and schools. Now there is an emerging segment in the commercial class, so the commercial class is the lagging indicator. And it matured really well during '15. So you say is that a bearish signal. There is an emerging important segment in commercial sales that really relate to the electrification of the economy. As the whole economy becomes more digital in its composition, we are seeing especially in the Southeast the advent of data farms, of server farms, of IT professionals. And these jobs are 2 to 3x higher than typically what would you see in a normal commercial job like a restaurant or school. These are really high-paying jobs, and they don't have the kind of correlation to industrial activity that you see typically from commercial to industrial. And just as a supporting statistic, Georgia was just named the seventh fastest-growing state in the United States for technology employment. This is a sustainable growth rate and doesn't have that correlation. So even if industrial starts to take off and all that again, these guys are going to sustain, and we're very excited about that.

But here's what I think you're going to find more likely, and that is more projects now come to life. When you think about people starting to anticipate proactive responses to the Clean Power Plan, other states' activities with respect to renewable portfolio standards, look, I think there is a tremendous appetite to grow both solar and wind in the years ahead. So my sense is, with the added ITC and PTC extensions, the market is going to well exceed, I'm just going to guess what we all think is out there, and the price for those projects will reflect the fact that the general participants in the United States are going to have bonus depreciation sitting on top of them.

With respect to new nuclear, certainly, as the Clean Power Plan starts to mature and state's responses, we said it before, there's really a big 3, maybe a big 4, in responding to that. I think new nuclear makes a lot of sense, big scale baseload, no carbon emission. Clearly, renewables will be a big player, will be for us, have been for us. And then when you see kind of intermittent resources like wind and solar come to play, you're going to need 2 types of gas come in. One piece of gas, which will be the ability for generation to follow, the intermittency will be CT. So we think you'll start to see CTs in a big way. And then it looks tougher, coal, certainly knew coal. So if you want to look at baseload looking gas, that looks like CCs. So those are going to be the trends that I think you'll see going forward. Right now, your gas mileage integrated resource plan, but that really is not particularly responsive to the Clean Power Plan. It is way too far early to get a kind of cogent response by the state.

So imagine the CapEx that we have been expending on projects.

We saw an opportunity with AGL not only to buy somebody else's stock at a premium that is enormously creative, especially given where they were trading relative to their peers.

In terms of the relative cost of energy, we kind of covered that i nother calls. And I just remember my datelines here, so I'm just going to quote what I quoted before.

That's not going to vary. And so we're going to be able to produce, assuming a reliability profile, at a very constant level.

And we argued about whether to put it all on Southern Power and say that we have financing all of AGL with cash coming from bonus and all this other stuff or whether to do a mix or whether just to say, look, the nearest term use of cash is AGL and so therefore keeping the $1.4 billion remaining, which we did $200 million in '15, 1.2  is our plan in '16, we have just chosen to associate that with AGL. We could have done a variety of things. When you consider the total amount of CapEx including the acquisition amount less the benefit of cash, we could have attributed that on a pro rata basis. The economic impact of AGL remains the same. Once we get a full year of earnings, remember, maybe this will be helpful just to recall when we did the announcement, their EPS growth rate on a stand-alone basis was between 6% and 9%. And their base case assumed essentially 7.5%. And we thought there were opportunities to improve that a wee bit. When you add AGL into Southern, it increases our overall growth 1% from 3% to 4% to 4% to 5%. That represents about $0.10 a year. We're going to sustain that into the future. How you want to count the shares is almost a term of Art. But the truth is, the fact that we're going to get at least $4 billion, potentially over $5 billion, allows us to offset a significant amount of shares that otherwise we would have issued.

But let me give you just kind of the dumb overview again. When you look at quarter-by-quarter performance, we track very closely the top 10 -- I used you to call them sick code, I understand that they're called something else now, clarification segments, that represents 80 85% of our sales in the industrial sector. So '14, all 10 of those segments showed year-over-year growth. So it's a terrific forward-looking story. And then we projected I guess a 1.3% increase in industrial sales. Then all of a sudden, with worldwide economy China, all that other stuff that we're talking about, dollar, exporting going down, we started seeing those segments start to show year-over-year weakness. In the first quarter, two of them turned negative. In the second quarter, I want to say 3 of them turned negative. In the third quarter, 6 of them turned negative. In the fourth quarter, turns out 7 of them turned negative. And then even now, my momentum analysis would have showed that even if you were still positive, this is the momentum comment, you were less positive. Everything started shoving it was slowing down in the industrial sector. Now what Art said is true, and here's what's interesting. When these guys, we were preparing for this call, first order coming up with the sales forecast, and then we are showing a renewed growth in industrial, we had a lot of give-and-take and pushback and why do you really believe that. Go through a variety of factors, I. Think this notion that the industrial class is adjusting to the high dollar and low commodity prices in this new market reality is one factor. Second factor, remember I mentioned before that with gas prices falling, we saw a bunch of cogent turn on. That tended to depress industrial sales. That delta won't show in '16 anymore. So as people adjust to the new reality, like for example, primary metal, we saw that go way down. We think now some of primary metals is going to grow with the  associated with automobiles transportation. We're going to see that renew. We have reason to believe from our bottoms-up analysis. I'll tell you another thing. Mike Jackson of AutoNation commented on this in some of his commentary. Other foreign operations are being relocated. And I'd say story for that Art is in Alabama with Mercedes-Benz. So some of our bottoms up stories are giving us the reason to believe that in the Southeast, now this is probably not true across the United States, in the Southeast, we're going to see a renewal of industrial sales off of '15. So look forward to occur in transportation, look forward to occur in housing and maybe some of the other sectors."

And how even the EIA would say that tax preference items renewables are way in excess of anything associated with coal, oil, gas and even, gee, even compared to nuclear was estimated to be 35x what's available there. What's fascinating is, I think these are mature industries. And certainly, with the way the Clean Power Plan is structured, even without tax benefit, there would be a great demand to do wind and solar just because of their carbon profile. Recall also that I think the United States, in general, is going to be really well served if we pursue the full portfolio that I'm always fond of saying, we're the only one really doing all of it, new nuclear, 21st Century Coal, natural gas, renewables energy efficiency. Look, behind your question is the notion that these things has, in my opinion, excess economic returns relative to a tax policy that didn't favor one technology or another. But I think given where EPA is going, especially with the price of carbon, that's implied in what they say, even without this tax preference items being so tilted toward renewable, there would still be renewables growth."

2015 was a tremendous year for Southern Company, as we continued to see outstanding performance in our franchise operations. We saw strong financial performance from both our wholesale subsidiary Southern Power and our traditional operating companies. Our state-regulated utilities delivered these 2015 results despite the warmest December in the last 120 years. We continued our longstanding tradition of operational excellence, once again ranking among the best in our industry for customer satisfaction and solidifying our reputation as one of the most trusted energy providers in America. We experienced great success with strategic initiatives at both Southern Power, and our traditional operating companies continued to build the energy portfolio of the future with significant expansions of their renewable energy resources. And in our ongoing quest to deliver superior risk-adjusted long-term growth, we entered into an agreement to acquire AGL Resources and create a platform from which we expect to compete for growth more broadly across the energy value chain.
Now regarding AGL Resources, I will just briefly add that activities related to the proposed merger are progressing in a timely fashion. The waiting period under the HSR Antitrust Improvements Act expired in late 2015, a necessary milestone for closing the transaction. In addition, AGL Resources shareholders voted in November to approve the merger. The merger remains subject to certain other customary closing conditions, including state regulatory approvals, and we are currently engaged in regulatory proceedings before the various state commissions. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016.
In a few moments, Art will discuss the drivers of our financial performance in more detail and provide guidance for 2016. Before that, however, I will address the progress we've experienced with our major construction projects at Plant Vogtle and in Kemper County, Mississippi.
First, an update on the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. As reported in our last quarterly call, we agreed to a settlement with our contractors for the 2 new units at Plant Vogtle. We have now finalized that settlement, and the related litigation has been dismissed. As a reminder, this $350 million settlement resolves all outstanding commercial issues for the project and amends our EPC agreement to provide even greater protections for customers. The settlement affirms and provides incentives for anticipated fuel load dates in December 2018 and 2019 as well as our expected in-service dates in June 2019 and 2020. In a related transaction, Westinghouse acquired the nuclear construction arm of Chicago Bridge & Iron. This move positions Westinghouse and its affiliates as the primary contractor under our EPC agreement. And they have engaged with Fluor to provide day-to-day construction leadership. We have worked very closely with the contractors through this transition, and I'm pleased to say that, thus far, we are very encouraged by the improved communication and efficiencies we've observed on site.
On January 21, Georgia Power filed an application for review of the settlement with the Georgia PSC. Yesterday, the PSC made and approved a motion asking Georgia Power to file further information within the next 60 days pertaining to the prudence of the project to date as well as the current schedule and cost forecast. Other interested parties will have an opportunity to make filings of their own in response. This will allow the PSC to consider the settlement agreement in the context of a more comprehensive review of the full project cost and schedule. The commission staff, which will not make any separate filings, will have 6 months to analyze these filings. If the staff identifies any issues of imprudence or unreasonableness, they are directed to work with Georgia Power toward a possible settlement of any such issues within that same 6-month period. During this 6-month period, there will be no hearings. If there is a settlement between the company and the staff, Georgia Power and the commission staff will file that for the commission to consider in the fall. If the parties do not come to a settlement, the commission will decide how to proceed.
Let's turn now to an update on the Kemper County facility. The combined cycle performed exceptionally well in 2015, providing over 1/3 of the electricity consumed by Mississippi Power customers last year. Major startup activities are ongoing, and we continue to transition to operational testing. Fluidization trials on the first 2 gasifiers are complete, and we were able to begin the cure-out process for gasifier refractory. The fluidization process was an important validation of the scaleup of the technology, as the operators were able to use the control system to circulate sand and air at design-flow rate through the gasifier, a good rehearsal for the eventual introduction of lignite to the operation. The team is currently working to repair a portion of the refractory on the first gasifier and making improvements to all of the nozzles in the refractory lining of both gasifiers to address hotspots identified during the initial cure-out process for the first gasifier. The type of work to repair and improve the refractory lining is similar to the refractory replacement and will be a common part of the plant's long-term maintenance. However, these activities are time intensive, and they are the primary driver for our scheduled extension into the third quarter of 2016. As always, quality and safety are our top priorities as we are taking steps to help ensure that Mississippi Power's customers will enjoy the benefits of a reliable source of low-cost energy for decades to come. We expect to introduce lignite to gasifier A this spring. This critical step is the beginning of the important process of integrating all of the various systems on the facility.
In December, the Mississippi Public Service Commission unanimously approved rates for the combined-cycle assets already in service. Mississippi Power plans to seek recovery of the remaining assets after they are placed into service.
Art will now provide a financial update, including an outlook for 2016 and beyond."

Good afternoon, everyone.As you can see from the materials released this morning, we had solid results for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year of 2015.For the fourth quarter of 2015, we earned $0.30 per share compared to $0.31",1544,"Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone.
As you can see from the materials released this morning, we had solid results for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year of 2015.
For the fourth quarter of 2015, we earned $0.30 per share compared to $0.31 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year of 2015, we earned $2.60 per share compared to $2.19 per share in 2014, an increase of $0.41 per share. Excluding certain adjustments listed in the earnings materials, earnings for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015 were $0.44 and $2.89 per share, respectively, compared with $0.38 and $2.80 per share, respectively, for the same periods in 2014. As Tom mentioned earlier, our adjusted annual result of $2.89 was just above the top of our 2015 guidance range we established a year ago. The major earnings drivers when compared to our $2.80 adjusted result for 2014 were residential and commercial sales growth, retail revenue effects and tremendous success with renewable projects at Southern Power. These positive drivers were partially offset by increased shares; higher depreciation, operation and maintenance costs; and weather. A more comprehensive list of drivers is included in the materials we released this morning.
Moving now to an economic and sales review of 2015.
The economy within our region continues to experience modest growth. Favorable domestic market fundamentals include strong employment growth that have served to underpin consumer confidence and spending. At the same time, the effects of a strong dollar, low commodity prices and economic weakness abroad have combined to constrain manufacturing growth in our region.
Total weather-adjusted retail sales grew by 0.3% in 2015, led by commercial sales which were up almost 1% for the year. We experienced positive growth for the commercial sales in every quarter in 2015, which we have not seen since before the recession. Weather-adjusted residential sales grew by 0.4% during 2015. Growth in the residential sector has been fueled largely by customer growth, as the Southeast continues to see positive in-migration. More than 37,000 new residential customers were added in 2015, an increase from 2014 when we added some 31,500 new customers.
Industrial sales fell by 0.3% in 2015. We experienced a modest deceleration in industrial growth in our region as a result of the strong dollar, low oil price and natural gas prices and significant economic slowdown in China and other emerging markets. We have seen the impact of these factors on 3 of our largest industrial segments: primary metals, chemicals and paper. However, transportation- and housing-related industries have supported growth, and we expect those segments to continue to do well in 2016.
Economic development activity remains robust and consistent with previous quarters' activities. Job creation and capital investment for 2015 exceeded 2014 levels, and the pipeline of potential projects grew significantly compared to recent years. Corporate announcements and potential projects represent a broad cross-section of industries, including automotive, primary and fabricated metals, aerospace and chemical segments. Also within our region, Alabama was named the top state for economic development by Business Facilities magazine, and Georgia has been ranked first for business climate by Site Selection magazine for the third consecutive year. Despite economic headwinds from overseas, our regional economy remains in a positive growth mode. During our most recent economic roundtable, the consensus of the participants was that the economy will grow in 2016 supported by robust employment and spending growth, modest income gains and a steady housing recovery all pointing to further growth in energy demand.
Our sales growth guidance for 2016 is 1.1% for retail sales, 1.2% for residential sales and 1% for both commercial and industrial sales.
Before we cover the details of our capital expenditure forecast, financing plan and earnings per share guidance, I'd like to speak to the impact of the recent extension of tax benefits on our financial outlook. We currently project that a 5-year extension of bonus depreciation will improve cash flows by approximately $4 billion through 2020 and potentially more, assuming Southern Power is able to execute on its growth plan. This translates to a significant uplift in the value of the enterprise. Over the next few years, some of the biggest tax benefits are expected to be generated by Plant Ratcliffe, Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, along with a variety of renewable energy projects and environmental compliance investments. Considering our customer-focused business model, this is very good news. All else being equal, our customers should benefit from lower retail rates over time. In addition to the implied reduction in regulatory risk, we expect to enjoy reduced exposure to both debt and equity capital markets over the next several years.
Perhaps the greatest benefit of all these tax benefits is a level of cash flow support we project for our common dividend. Of course, dividend policy is ultimately subject to the approval of our Board of Directors, but our expected cash coverage of dividends is greatly improved compared to how we characterized our dividend growth at the time of the AGL Resources merger announcement. We fundamentally believe that value is a function of risk and return. Given the magnitude of the dollars and the high degree of certainty inherent in these deductions, Southern Company's value proposition should be greatly improved.
We provided an updated forecast of capital expenditures for 2016 through 2018 in our slide presentation. This stand-alone projection does not include AGL Resources. Anticipating continued success at Southern Power, we are excited about the possibilities that exist with the extension of tax benefits for both wind and solar projects. We have enjoyed a higher-than-anticipated growth from Southern Power in recent years. In fact, a year ago, our 2015-through-2017 CapEx forecast was approximately $3 billion. Today, based on our recent success, we estimate the same period to be about $5 billion of investment for Southern Power. Going forward, we expect to sustain that same level of activity and success. In fact, our Southern Power forecast for 2016 through 2018 includes CapEx of $5 billion for wind, solar and traditional natural gas-generation projects.
Our CapEx forecast for our traditional operating companies does not include projects specific to the Clean Power Plan. If our ultimate compliance plans require investment prior to 2019, our current CapEx projection could -- or would increase. Our forecasted $1.8 billion investment in environmental compliance over the next 3 years is largely associated with EPA's Effluent Guidelines and the final coal combustion residuals rule.
Included in the appendix of our slide deck are a projected financing plan, credit ratings and a schedule of maturities and a liquidity summary. Within our financing plan, you will note the anticipated debt issuances to fund the AGL Resources merger. We expect these notes to be issued shortly before the closing of the acquisition and to include a blend of maturities. Additionally, we are planning on a $1.2 billion in equity issuances in the calendar year of 2016. As discussed earlier, the extension of bonus depreciation is expected to reduce our exposure to the capital markets, and that has resulted in a favorable impact to the remainder of our financing plan.
Considering the incremental cash flow, along with our Department of Energy loan facility for Plant Vogtle construction and an assumption that we will utilize securitized financing for a significant portion of Kemper, which is subject to approval by the Mississippi Public Service Commission, our exposure to the debt markets for our traditional operating companies over the next 3 years should be limited. Southern Power's debt financing needs will be driven largely by their success in finding suitable projects to fill the placeholders in the CapEx forecast.
An additional benefit of the incremental cash flow from bonus depreciation is the effect on our need to issue new equity. We currently project no additional equity issuances beyond the $1.2 billion in 2016. Financial integrity and strong credit ratings have always been priorities for us, and that emphasis remains unchanged. Our financial outlook, including our expected credit metrics in 2016 through 2018, has improved, and we continue to believe our credit profile is fully supportive of our credit ratings.
Moving now to our earnings per share outlook. You will recall that we began issuing new shares in the fourth quarter of 2015 under our internal equity programs, largely to fund the AGL transaction and to reinforce our commitment to financial integrity. The cumulative effect of the shares issued in 2015 and projected for 2016 equates to a $0.06 dilutive impact on our stand-alone 2016 earnings per share. In addition, the estimated impact of bonus depreciation is $0.04, but for the cumulative impact of these shares and bonus depreciation, we would have been in the top half of our 3% to 4% stand-alone trajectory for 2016. Considering these drivers, our stand-alone 2016 earnings per share guidance, excluding any cost to achieve the AGL Resources merger, is $2.76 to $2.88 per share. Assuming the AGL merger closes later this year, our long-term earnings per share growth outlook remains a range of 4% to 5%.
In addition to our earnings estimate for the -- in addition, our earnings estimate for the first quarter of 2016 is $0.53 per share.
I will now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks."

There's this long-term dividend by cheap oil, therefore, cheap gasoline prices, cheap natural gas prices, all is accruing to increase essentially the disposal income of households throughout the Southeast. Interestingly, they're tending to increase their savings rate rather than their consumption rate at that point, not all bad because that typically serves as an insulator against future economic shocks.

The $4 billion of cash that we talked about is really through 2020",340,"Let me take you through dumb math, and then we'll talk about how we attributed it here. Dumb math, the number is going to be somewhere between $4 billion and maybe over $5 billion of cash. The $4 billion of cash that we talked about is really through 2020 and doesn't really assume that Southern Power executes its growth plan, which we think they will. So the number could be higher maybe over a longer time frame. When we look at -- so that's kind of a source of cash. When we look at the uses of cash over time, we got into an argument here internally about how to attribute the benefits of that cash. So let's go through it, and let's just use the $4 billion number, although the number could be higher. We had always assumed in our former financial plan, assuming we buy AGL, a $3 billion equity issuance over the time frame. We're going to do $4 billion in cash. If you just use a 40% equity ratio, 40% times $4 billion, so if the cash retires a mix of capital requirement, the equity portion, that would be $1.6 billion. If the total amount of equity was $3 billion and you don't have to issue $1.6 billion now, that leaves you $1.4 billion to issue. When you look at the uses of cash, we could go through a variety of ways to attribute these shares, but since the biggest issue of cash is a nearer-term use, and that is to acquire AGL, so we decided to allocate the new equity essentially to that project. And so if you think about it, $200 million issued in '15, plus another $1.2 billion, represents the balance of $3 billion; less $1.6 billion equals $1.4 billion. So that's really the simple math. Look, Dan, we could have allocated the equity to Southern Power. We could have taken a pro rata approach. This is just the way we decided to do it to keep the plans in place through '16."

In fact, I would argue that the adjustment, from a book standpoint, is in earnings per share, but the value adjustment is probably in the P/E ratio.

Here's the issue: We had talked historically about leading and lagging indicators. And in fact, I would argue our stuff is as good as anybody's in predicting the direction of the market. And what we had been seeing historically is that industrial sales are the leading indicator. Even better than that is economic development, but let's just stay with industrial sales. They create jobs. They grow personal incomes that are above normal for the Southeast. As we create jobs, people move in. They get those jobs. They get the higher incomes. They start consuming more. That's residential. And then as more people move in, the commercial sector comes in. They do dry cleaners and grocery stores and hospitals and schools. Now there is an emerging segment in the commercial class. So the commercial class is the lagging indicator, and it matured really well during '15. And so you say, is that a bearish signal? There is an emerging, important segment in commercial sales that really relate to the electrification of the economy. As the whole economy becomes more digital in its composition, we're seeing, especially in the Southeast, the advent of data farms, of server farms, of IT professionals. And these jobs are 2 to 3x higher than typically what would you see in a normal commercial job like a restaurant or a school. These are really high-paying jobs, and they don't have the kind of correlation to industrial activity that you see typically from commercial to industrial. And just as a supporting statistic, Georgia was just named the seventh fastest-growing state in the United States for technology employment. This is a sustainable growth rate and doesn't have that correlation, so even if industrial starts to take off and all that again, these guys are going to sustain. And we're very excited about that. The buying power, the economic quality of this segment is really good."

There were the -- I guess, there are big holdups related to the reactor cooling pump resolving those technical issues, those have been resolved. I think they're moving forward. I forget which ones are which, but one's going to go in service this year. And I think Sanmen this year and early next year will be Haiyang. They're going well. With respect to new nuclear, certainly, as the Clean Power Plan starts to mature and state responses, we've said it before, there's really a big 3, maybe a big 4, in responding to that. I think new nuclear makes a lot of sense, big scale baseload, no carbon emission. Clearly, renewables will be a big player, will be for us, have been for us. And then when you see kind of intermittent resources like wind and solar come to play, you're going to need 2 types of gas come in. One piece of gas, which will be the ability for generation to follow, the intermittency will be CTs. So we think you'll start to see CTs in a big way. And then it looks tougher, coal, certainly new coal. So if you want to look at baseload looking gas, that looks like CCs. So those are going to be the trends that I think you'll see going forward. Right now, Georgia has filed gas its integrated resource plan, but that really is not particularly responsive to the Clean Power Plan. It is way too far early to get a kind of cogent response by the state. So you should view the IRP in Georgia as being pre-Clean Power Plan in its composition."

Once we go into service in '16, you're going to see a great big jump. And that jump could be as high as the high 200s to $300 million in net income. So it's going to be a big bump.

We saw an opportunity with AGL not only to buy somebody else's stock at a premium that is enormously accretive, especially given where they were trading relative to their peers.

We think there's tremendous demand for CO2 in the EOR business even at these prices, and I was a little surprised at that. In terms of the relative cost of energy, we kind of covered that in other calls. And I just remember my baselines here, so I'm going to just quote what I've quoted before that at $100 a barrel, the value of CO2 plus a host of other assumptions, got us to about a $1.25 per million BTU equivalent.

One of the things we do know is that we don't know what's going to happen with gas prices, and they tend to be much more volatile than other fuel stuff. One of the advantages of Kemper relative to even other natural gas plants is that we've essentially fixed out our cost of supply. We have mine-mouth lignite. We know what that cost. That's not going to vary. And so we're going to be able to produce, assuming a reliability profile, at a very constant level. And we recall also what has changed over time. Look at the performance of Kemper in the past year just purely by running natural gas through the combined cycle units. We supplied 1/3 of the energy consumed by Mississippi Power customers out of the Kemper site.

We could have done a variety of things. When you consider the total amount of CapEx, including the acquisition amount less the benefit of cash, we could have attributed that on a pro rata basis. The economic impact of AGL remains the same. It's -- once we get a full year of earnings, remember, maybe this will be helpful just to recall, when we did the announcement, their EPS growth rate on a stand-alone basis was between 6% and 9%. And their base case assumed essentially 7.5%. And we thought there were opportunities to improve that a wee bit. When you add AGL into Southern, it increases our overall growth 1% from 3% to 4% to 4% to 5%. That represents about $0.10 a year. We're going to sustain that into the future. How you want to count the shares is almost a term of art.

And in fact, if you want to go back and look at the clip, look at the clip that CNBC has of when I was on, Squawk Box with Dennis Lockhart in December. But let me give you just kind of the dumb overview again. When you look at quarter-by-quarter performance, we track very closely the top 10. I used to call them SIC code. I understand they're called something else now, but Standard Industrial Classification segments. That represents 80% to 85% of our sales in the industrial sector. So '14, all 10 of those segments showed year-over-year growth. So it's a terrific forward-looking story. And then we projected, I guess, a 1.3% increase in industrial sales. Then all of a sudden, with the worldwide economy, China, all that other stuff that we're talking about, dollar, exporting going down, we started seeing those segments start to show year-over-year weakness. In the first quarter, 2 of them turned negative. In the second quarter, I want to say 3 of them turned negative. In the third quarter, 6 of them turned negative. In the fourth quarter, it turns out 7 of them turned negative. And then even now, my momentum analysis would have showed that even if you were still positive, this is the momentum comment, you were less positive. Everything started showing it was slowing down in the industrial sector. Now what Art said is true, and here's what's interesting. When these guys -- we were preparing for this call, first started coming up with the sales forecast and then we're showing a renewed growth in industrial, we had a lot of give-and-take and pushback and why do you really believe that. Go through a variety of factors, I think this notion that the industrial classes adjusting to the high dollar and low commodity prices in this new market reality is one factor. Second factor, remember I mentioned before that with gas prices falling, we saw a bunch of cogen turned on. That tended to depress industrial sales. That delta won't show in '16 anymore. So as people adjust to the new reality, like for example, primary metal, we saw that go way down. We think now some of primary metals is going to grow with the -- associated with automobiles or transportation. We're going to see that renew. We have reason to believe from our bottoms-up analysis. I'll tell you another thing. Mike Jackson of AutoNation commented on this in some of his commentary. Other foreign operations are being relocated. And I'd say story for that Art is in Alabama with Mercedes-Benz. So some of our bottoms-up stories are giving us the reason to believe that in the Southeast, now this is probably not true across the United States, in the Southeast, we're going to see a renewal of industrial sales off of '15. So look forward to occur in transportation, look forward to occur in housing and maybe some of the other sectors."

What's fascinating is, I think these are mature industries. And certainly, with the way the Clean Power Plan is structured, even without tax benefit, there would be a great demand to do wind and solar just because of their carbon profile. Recall also that I think the United States, in general, is going to be really well served if we pursue the full portfolio that -- I'm always fond of saying we're the only one really doing all of it, new nuclear, 21st century coal, natural gas, renewables energy efficiency. Look, Vedula, behind your question is the notion that these things have, in my opinion, excess economic returns relative to a tax policy that didn't favor one technology or another. But I think given where EPA is going, especially with the price of carbon, that's implied in what they say. Even without this tax preference items being so tilted toward renewable, there would still be renewables growth."

2015 was a tremendous year for Southern Company, as we continued to see outstanding performance in our franchise operations. We saw strong financial performance from both our wholesale subsidiary, Southern Power, and our traditional operating companies. Our state-regulated utilities delivered these 2015 results despite the warmest December in the last 120 years. We continued our longstanding tradition of operational excellence, once again ranking among the best in our industry for customer satisfaction and solidifying our reputation as one of the most trusted energy providers in America. We experienced great success with strategic initiatives as both Southern Power and our traditional operating companies continued to build the energy portfolio of the future with significant expansions of their renewable energy resources. And in our ongoing quest to deliver superior risk-adjusted long-term growth, we entered into an agreement to acquire AGL Resources and create a platform from which we expect to compete for growth more broadly across the energy value chain.
Now regarding AGL Resources, I will just briefly add that activities related to the proposed merger are progressing in a timely fashion. The waiting period under the HSR Antitrust Improvements Act expired in late 2015, a necessary milestone for closing the transaction. In addition, AGL Resources shareholders voted in November to approve the merger. The merger remains subject to certain other customary closing conditions, including state regulatory approvals, and we are currently engaged in regulatory proceedings before the various state commissions. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016.
In a few moments, Art will discuss the drivers of our financial performance in more detail and provide guidance for 2016. Before that, however, I will address the progress we've experienced with our major construction projects at Plant Vogtle and in Kemper County, Mississippi.
First, an update on the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. As reported in our last quarterly call, we agreed to a settlement with our contractors for the 2 new units at Plant Vogtle. We have now finalized that settlement, and the related litigation has been dismissed. As a reminder, this $350 million settlement resolves all outstanding commercial issues for the project and amends our EPC agreement to provide even greater protections for customers. The settlement affirms and provides incentives for anticipated fuel load dates in December 2018 and 2019 as well as our expected in-service dates in June 2019 and 2020. In a related transaction, Westinghouse acquired the nuclear construction arm of Chicago Bridge & Iron. This move positions Westinghouse and its affiliates as the primary contractor under our EPC agreement. And they have engaged with Fluor to provide day-to-day construction leadership. We have worked very closely with the contractors through this transition, and I'm pleased to say that, thus far, we are very encouraged by the improved communication and efficiencies we've observed on site.
On January 21, Georgia Power filed an application for review of the settlement with the Georgia PSC. Yesterday, the PSC made and approved a motion asking Georgia Power to file further information within the next 60 days pertaining to the prudence of the project to date as well as the current schedule and cost forecasts. Other interested parties will have an opportunity to make filings of their own in response. This will allow the PSC to consider the settlement agreement in the context of a more comprehensive review of the full project cost and schedule. The Commission staff, which will not make any separate filings, will have 6 months to analyze these filings. If the staff identifies any issues of imprudence or unreasonableness, they are directed to work with Georgia Power toward a possible settlement of any such issues within that same 6-month period. During this 6-month period, there will be no hearings. If there is a settlement between the company and the staff, Georgia Power and the Commission staff will file that for the Commission to consider in the fall. If the parties do not come to a settlement, the Commission will decide how to proceed.
Let's turn now to an update on the Kemper County facility. The combined cycle performed exceptionally well in 2015, providing over 1/3 of the electricity consumed by Mississippi Power customers last year. Major startup activities are ongoing, and we continue to transition to operational testing. Fluidization trials on the first of 2 gasifiers are complete, and we were able to begin the cure-out process for the gasifier refractory. The fluidization process was an important validation of the scaleup of the technology, as the operators were able to use the control system to circulate sand and air at design flow rate through the gasifier, a good rehearsal for the eventual introduction of lignite to the operation. The team is currently working to repair a portion of the refractory on the first gasifier and making improvements to all of the nozzles in the refractory lining of both gasifiers to address hotspots identified during the initial cure-out process for the first gasifier. The type of work to repair and improve the refractory lining is similar to the refractory replacement that will be a common part of the plant's long-term maintenance. However, these activities are time intensive, and they are the primary driver for our schedule extension into the third quarter of 2016. As always, quality and safety are our top priorities as we are taking steps to help ensure that Mississippi Power's customers will enjoy the benefits of a reliable source of low-cost energy for decades to come. We expect to introduce lignite to gasifier A this spring. This critical step is the beginning of the important process of integrating all of the various systems of the facility.
In December, the Mississippi Public Service Commission unanimously approved rates for the combined-cycle assets already in service. Mississippi Power plans to seek recovery of the remaining assets after they are placed into service.
Art will now provide a financial update, including an outlook for 2016 and beyond."

As you can see from the materials released this morning, we had solid results for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year of 2015.
For the fourth quarter of 2015, we earned $0.30 per share compared to $0.31 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year of 2015, we earned $2.60 per share compared to $2.19 per share in 2014, an increase of $0.41 per share. Excluding certain adjustments listed in the earnings materials, earnings for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015 were $0.44 and $2.89 per share, respectively, compared with $0.38 and $2.80 per share, respectively, for the same periods in 2014. As Tom mentioned earlier, our adjusted annual result of $2.89 was just above the top of our 2015 guidance range we established a year ago. The major earnings drivers when compared to our $2.80 adjusted result for 2014 were residential and commercial sales growth, retail revenue effects and tremendous success with renewable projects at Southern Power. These positive drivers were partially offset by increased shares; higher depreciation, operation and maintenance costs; and weather. A more comprehensive list of drivers is included in the materials we released this morning.
Moving now to an economic and sales review of 2015.
The economy within our region continues to experience modest growth. Favorable domestic market fundamentals include strong employment growth that have served to underpin consumer confidence and spending. At the same time, the effects of a strong dollar, low commodity prices and economic weakness abroad have combined to constrain manufacturing growth in our region.
Total weather-adjusted retail sales grew by 0.3% in 2015, led by commercial sales, which were up almost 1% for the year. We experienced positive growth for the commercial sales in every quarter in 2015, which we have not seen since before the recession. Weather-adjusted residential sales grew by 0.4% during 2015. Growth in the residential sector has been fueled largely by customer growth, as the Southeast continues to see positive in-migration. More than 37,000 new residential customers were added in 2015, an increase from 2014, when we added some 31,500 new customers.
Industrial sales fell by 0.3% in 2015. We experienced a modest deceleration in industrial growth in our region as a result of the strong dollar, low oil price and natural gas prices and significant economic slowdown in China and other emerging markets. We have seen the impact of these factors on 3 of our largest industrial segments: primary metals, chemicals and paper. However, transportation and housing related industries have supported growth, and we expect those segments to continue to do well in 2016.
Economic development activity remains robust and consistent with previous quarters' activities. Job creation and capital investment for 2015 exceeded 2014 levels, and the pipeline of potential projects grew significantly compared to recent years. Corporate announcements and potential projects represent a broad cross-section of industries, including automotive, primary and fabricated metals, aerospace and chemical segments. Also within our region, Alabama was named the top state for economic development by Business Facilities magazine, and Georgia has been ranked first for business climate by Site Selection magazine for the third consecutive year. Despite economic headwinds from overseas, our regional economy remains in a positive growth mode. During our most recent economic roundtable, the consensus of the participants was that the economy will grow in 2016 supported by robust employment and spending growth, modest income gains and a steady housing recovery, all pointing to further growth in energy demands.
Our sales growth guidance for 2016 is 1.1% for retail sales, 1.2% for residential sales and 1% for both commercial and industrial sales.
Before we cover the details of our capital expenditure forecast, financing plan and earnings per share guidance, I'd like to speak to the impact of the recent extension of tax benefits on our financial outlook. We currently project that a 5-year extension of bonus depreciation will improve cash flows by approximately $4 billion through 2020 and potentially more, assuming Southern Power is able to execute on its growth plan. This translates to a significant uplift in the value of the enterprise. Over the next few years, some of the biggest tax benefits are expected to be generated by Plant Ratcliffe, Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, along with a variety of renewable energy projects and environmental compliance investments. Considering our customer-focused business model, this is very good news. All else being equal, our customers should benefit from lower retail rates over time. In addition to the implied reduction in regulatory risks, we expect to enjoy reduced exposure to both debt and equity capital markets over the next several years.
Perhaps the greatest benefit of all these tax benefits is the level of cash flow support we project for our common dividend. Of course, dividend policy is ultimately subject to the approval of our Board of Directors, but our expected cash coverage of dividends is greatly improved compared to how we characterized our dividend growth at the time of the AGL Resources merger announcement. We fundamentally believe that value is a function of risk and return. Given the magnitude of the dollars and the high degree of certainty inherent in these deductions, Southern Company's value proposition should be greatly improved.
We provided an updated forecast of capital expenditures for 2016 through 2018 in our slide presentation. This stand-alone projection does not include AGL Resources. Anticipating continued success at Southern Power, we are excited about the possibilities that exist with the extension of tax benefits for both wind and solar projects. We have enjoyed a higher-than-anticipated growth from Southern Power in recent years. In fact, a year ago, our 2015 through 2017 CapEx forecast was approximately $3 billion. Today, based on our recent success, we estimate the same period to be about $5 billion of investment for Southern Power. Going forward, we expect to sustain that same level of activity and success. In fact, our Southern Power forecast for 2016 through 2018 includes CapEx of $5 billion for wind, solar and traditional natural gas generation projects.
Our CapEx forecast for our traditional operating companies does not include projects specific to the Clean Power Plan. If our ultimate compliance plans require investment prior to 2019, our current CapEx projection could or would increase. Our forecasted $1.8 billion investment in environmental compliance over the next 3 years is largely associated with EPA's Effluent Guidelines and final coal combustion residuals rules.
Included in the appendix of our slide deck are a projected financing plan, credit ratings and a schedule of maturities in a liquidity summary. Within our financing plan, you will note the anticipated debt issuances to fund the AGL Resources merger. We expect these notes to be issued shortly before the closing of the acquisition and to include a blend of maturities. Additionally, we are planning on a $1.2 billion in equity issuances in the calendar year of 2016. As discussed earlier, the extension of bonus depreciation is expected to reduce our exposure to the capital markets, and that has resulted in a favorable impact to the remainder of our financing plan.
Considering the incremental cash flow, along with our Department of Energy loan facility for Plant Vogtle construction and an assumption that we will utilize securitized financing for a significant portion of Kemper, which is subject to approval by the Mississippi Public Service Commission, our exposure to the debt markets for our traditional operating companies over the next 3 years should be limited. Southern Power's debt financing needs will be driven largely by their success in finding suitable projects to fill the placeholders in the CapEx forecast.
An additional benefit of the incremental cash flow from bonus depreciation is the effect on our need to issue new equity. We currently project no additional equity issuances beyond the $1.2 billion in 2016. Financial integrity and strong credit ratings have always been priorities for us, and that emphasis remains unchanged. Our financial outlook, including our expected credit metrics in 2016 through 2018, has improved, and we continue to believe our credit profile is fully supportive of our credit ratings.
Moving now to our earnings per share outlook. You will recall that we began issuing new shares in the fourth quarter of 2015 under our internal equity programs, largely to fund the AGL transaction and to reinforce our commitment to financial integrity. The cumulative effect of the shares issued in 2015 and projected for 2016 equates to a $0.06 dilutive impact on our stand-alone 2016 earnings per share. In addition, the estimated impact of bonus depreciation is $0.04. But for the cumulative impact of these shares and bonus depreciation, we would have been in the top half of our 3% to 4% stand-alone trajectory for 2016. Considering these drivers, our stand-alone 2016 earnings per share guidance, excluding any costs to achieve the AGL Resources merger, is $2.76 to $2.88 per share. Assuming the AGL merger closes later this year, our long-term earnings per share growth outlook remains a range of 4% to 5%.
In addition to our earnings estimate for the -- in addition, our earnings estimate for the first quarter of 2016 is $0.53 per share.
I will now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks."

Dumb math, the number is going to be somewhere between $4 billion and maybe over $5 billion of cash. The $4 billion of cash that we talked about is really through 2020 and doesn't really assume that Southern Power executes its growth plan, which we think they will. So the number could be higher maybe over a longer time frame. When we look at -- so that's kind of a source of cash. When we look at the uses of cash over time, we got into an argument here internally about how to attribute the benefits of that cash. So let's go through it, and let's just use the $4 billion number, although the number could be higher. We had always assumed in our former financial plan, assuming we buy AGL, a $3 billion equity issuance over the time frame. We're going to do $4 billion in cash. If you just use a 40% equity ratio, 40% times $4 billion, so as the cash retires and makes a capital requirement, the equity portion of that would be $1.6 billion. If the total amount of equity was $3 billion and you don't have to issue $1.6 billion now, that leaves you $1.4 billion to issue. When you look at the uses of cash, we could go through a variety of ways to attribute these shares, but since the biggest issue of cash is a near-term use, and that is to acquire AGL, so we decided to allocate the new equity essentially to that project. And so if you think about it, $200 million issued in '15, plus another $1.2 billion, represents the balance of $3 billion; less $1.6 billion equals $1.4 billion. So that's really the simple math. Look, Dan, we could have allocated the equity to Southern Power. We could have taken a pro rata approach. This is just the way we decided to do it to keep the plans in place through '16."

In fact, I would argue that the adjustment, from a book standpoint, is in earnings per share, but the value adjustment is probably in the P/E ratio.

Here's the issue: We had talked historically about leading and lagging indicators. And in fact, I would argue our stuff is as good as anybody's in predicting the direction of the market. And what we had been seeing historically is that industrial sales are the leading indicator. Even better than that is economic development, but let's just stay with industrial sales. They create jobs. They grow personal incomes that are above normal for the Southeast. As we create jobs, people move in. They get those jobs. They get the higher incomes. They start consuming more. That's residential. And then as more people move in, the commercial sector comes in. They do dry cleaners and grocery stores and hospitals and schools. Now there is an emerging segment in the commercial class. So the commercial class is the lagging indicator, and it matured really well during '15. And so you say, is that a bearish signal? There is an emerging, important segment in commercial sales that really relate to the electrification of the economy. As the whole economy becomes more digital in its composition, we're seeing, especially in the Southeast, the advent of data farms, of server farms, of IT professionals. And these jobs are 2 to 3x higher than typically what would you see in a normal commercial job, like a restaurant or a school. These are really high-paying jobs, and they don't have the kind of correlation to industrial activity that you see typically from commercial to industrial. And just as a supporting statistic, Georgia was just named the seventh fastest-growing state in the United States for technology employment. This is a sustainable growth rate and doesn't have that correlation, so even if industrial starts to take off and all that again, these guys are going to sustain. And we're very excited about that.

There could be some minor spillage, if you will, into '17. But here's what I think you're going to find more likely, and that is more projects now come to light. When you think about people starting to anticipate proactive responses to the Clean Power Plan, other states' activities with respect to renewable portfolio standards, look, I think there is a tremendous appetite to grow both solar and wind in the years ahead. So my sense is, with the added ITC and PTC extensions, the market is going to well exceed, I'm just going to guess, what we all think is out there. And the price for those projects will reflect the fact that the general participants in the United States are going to have bonus depreciation sitting on top of them.

With respect to new nuclear, certainly, as the Clean Power Plan starts to mature and state's responses, we've said it before, there's really a big 3, maybe a big 4, in responding to that. I think new nuclear makes a lot of sense, big scale baseload, no carbon emissions. Clearly, renewables will be a big player, will be for us, have been for us. And then when you see kind of intermittent resources like wind and solar come to play, you're going to need 2 types of gas come in. One piece of gas, which will be the ability for a generation to follow the intermittency will be CTs. So we think you'll start to see CTs in a big way. And then it looks tough for coal, certainly new coal. So if you want to look at baseload looking gas, that looks like CCs. So those are going to be the trends that I think you'll see going forward. Right now, Georgia has filed its integrated resource plan, but that really is not particularly responsive to the Clean Power Plan. It is way too far early to get a kind of cogent response by the state. So you should view the IRP in Georgia as being pre-Clean Power Plan in its composition."

When we estimated '15, we estimated $1.80 billion, and we're going to get $2.15 billion. Now here's what's interesting. I'm going to give you a number in '16 that's going to knock your socks off, I think. But remember, we added to the CapEx, so our CapEx went from, I forget what we estimated, $1.2 billion to $2.4 billion, round numbers, in '15. And then we said we're going to execute similarly in '16. So imagine the CapEx that we've been expending on projects. And while we jumped up to $2.15 billion, the effect of this acceleration of CapEx, at the end of '15, we were spending CapEx but didn't have projects in service. Once we go into service in '16, you're going to see a great big jump. And that jump could be as high as the high 200s to $300 million in net income. So it's going to be a big bump. Now consistent with the CapEx that we're showing you here, that number is not sustained. And in fact, the -- I mean, the less CapEx and the idea of the cliff and all that, would show that our net income will come down in Southern Power to some level in '17. Not prepared to talk about what that level is. But I want you to know, don't expect $300 million to stay the same every year thereafter. I will just say, '16, we expect a great year in net income contribution from Southern Power. And just remember, in '17, '18 going forward, AGL pops in, and we estimated way back when I think about $0.10 a year on the average.

And what we had been seeing, which you've seen us do in that strategy, was to buy up a bunch of assets, particularly at Southern Power. We saw an opportunity with AGL not only to buy somebody else's stock at a premium that is enormously accretive, especially given where they were trading relative to their peers. So our premium wasn't nearly as high as what you see in the media, and especially relative to other deals. And it accretes to our growth rate.

But listen, you know what, and that -- I get this question all the time about how can you justify building nuclear when gas prices are low. One of the things we do know is that we don't know what's going to happen with gas prices, and they tend to be much more volatile than other fuel stocks. One of the advantages of Kemper relative to even other natural gas plants is that we've essentially fixed out our costs of supply. We have mine-mouth lignite. We know what that costs. That's not going to vary. And so we're going to be able to produce, assuming a reliability profile, at a very constant level. And we recall also what has changed over time. Look at the performance of Kemper in the past year just purely by running natural gas through the combined cycle units. We've supplied 1/3 of the energy consumed by Mississippi Power customers out of the Kemper site. So we're going to be able to provide reliability assurances in the regulatory process that we think is going to be very attractive."

That -- and we argued about whether to put it all on Southern Power and say that we are financing all of AGL with cash coming from bonus and all this other stuff or whether to do a mix or whether just to say, look, the nearest-term use of cash is AGL, and so, therefore, keeping the $1.4 billion remaining, which we did $200 million in '15, $1.2 billion is our plan in '16, we have just chosen to associate that with AGL. We could have done a variety of things. When you consider the total amount of CapEx, including the acquisition amount less the benefit of cash, we could have attributed that on a pro rata basis. The economic impact of AGL remains the same. It's -- once we get a full year of earnings, remember, and maybe this will be helpful just to recall, when we did the announcement, their EPS growth rate on a stand-alone basis was between 6% and 9%. And their base case assumed essentially 7.5%. And we thought there were opportunities to improve that a wee bit. When you add AGL into Southern, it increases our overall growth 1% from 3% to 4% to 4% to 5%. That represents about $0.10 a year. We're going to sustain that into the future. How you want to count the shares is almost a term of art. But the truth is, the fact that we're going to get at least $4 billion, potentially over $5 billion, allows us to offset a significant amount of shares that otherwise we would have issued. The firm is better off $4 billion to $5 billion in total."

And in fact, if you want to go back and look at the clip, look at the clip that CNBC has of when I was on Squawk Box with Dennis Lockhart in December. But let me give you just kind of the dumb overview again. When you look at quarter-by-quarter performance, we tracked very closely the top 10 I used to call them SIC codes. I understand they're called something else now, but Standard Industrial Classification segments. That represents 80% to 85% of our sales in the industrial sector. So '14, all 10 of those segments showed year-over-year growth. So it was a terrific forward-looking story. And then we projected, I guess, a 1.3% increase in industrial sales. Then all of a sudden, with the worldwide economies, China, all that other stuff that we're talking about, dollar, exporting going down, we started seeing those segments start to show year-over-year weakness. In the first quarter, 2 of them turned negative. In the second quarter, I want to say 3 of them turned negative. In the third quarter, 6 of them turned negative. In the fourth quarter, it turns out 7 of them turned negative. And then even now, my momentum analysis would have showed that even if you were still positive, this is the momentum comment, you were less positive. Everything started showing that it was slowing down in the industrial sector. Now what Art said is true, and here's what's interesting. When these guys -- when we were preparing for this call, first started coming up with the sales forecast, and they were showing a renewed growth in industrial, we had a lot of give-and-take and pushback in why do you really believe that. It goes to a variety of factors. I think this notion that the industrial class is adjusting to the high dollar and low commodity prices in this new market reality is one factor. Second factor, remember I mentioned before that with gas prices falling, we saw a bunch of co-gens turn on. That tended to depress industrial sales. That delta won't show in '16 anymore. So as people adjust to the new reality, like for example, primary metals, we saw that go way down. We think now some of primary metals is going to grow with the -- associated with automobiles, with transportation. We're going to see that renew. We have reason to believe from our bottoms-up analysis. I'll tell you another thing, and Mike Jackson of AutoNation commented on this in some of his commentary. Other foreign operations are being relocated. And I'd say a story for that Art is in Alabama with Mercedes-Benz. So some of our bottoms-up stories are giving us the reason to believe that in the Southeast, now this is probably not true across the United States, in the Southeast, we're going to see a renewal of industrial sales off of '15. So look for it to occur in transportation, look forward to occur in housing and maybe some of the other sectors."

What's fascinating is, I think these are mature industries. And certainly, with the way the Clean Power Plan is structured, even without tax benefits, there would be a great demand to do wind and solar just because of their carbon profile. Recall also that I think the United States, in general, is going to be really well served if we pursue the full portfolio that -- I'm always fond of saying we're the only one really doing all of it, new nuclear, 21st century coal, natural gas, renewables energy efficiency. Look, Vedula, behind your question is the notion that these things have, in my opinion, excess economic returns relative to a tax policy that didn't favor one technology or another.

We had another good quarter to begin 2016, a great start to the year, and we are making excellent progress on many fronts. Art will provide an overview of our financial results in just a minute. But first, I'd like to provide you with a brief update on our regulatory calendar in Georgia and updates on the Vogtle and Kemper Project. 
As many of you are aware, 2016 is a busy year for regulatory filings in Georgia, an IRP filing, 2 VCM filings, our merger approval applications, a potential rate increase and the Vogtle contractors settlement filing, which has been expanded by the Georgia Public Service Commission to review all costs of the project incurred to date. 
To summarize, first, Georgia Power filed its triannual Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, in January. The PSC is expected to vote on the company's plan this July. 
Second, the PSC unanimously approved Georgia Power's 13th Vogtle Construction Monitoring Report in February. And later that same month, Georgia Power filed a 14th VCM report to be voted on in August. 
Third, Southern Company and AGL Resources received unanimous regulatory approval of our companies proposed merger from the Georgia PSC earlier this month, with all intervening parties in support of the settlement agreement. 
Fourth, Georgia Power has agreed to extend its current rate plan until 2019 and to keep base rates flat for the next 3 years. 
Fifth and finally, as you may recall in January, Georgia Power filed an application with the Georgia PSC for review of the $350 million settlement with its Vogtle 3 and 4 EPC contractors. The commission voted to move forward with an expanded process, which will examine the full project cost and schedule. Consistent with that February order, Georgia Power filed a supplemental information report, which provides compelling support that all project costs incurred to date for Vogtle Units 3 and 4 have been prudent and that the current cost and schedule forecast is reasonable. The filing includes reports from several subject matter experts, which support that conclusion. Over the next 6 months, Commission staff and Georgia Power will review this information which may result in an agreement this fall for the Commission to consider.
Let's move to an update on the construction status of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. The Vogtle 3 and 4 nuclear expansion project continues to progress with multiple milestones achieved in the first quarter. The transition to Westinghouse and its affiliate as the single contractor is complete. Fluor is fully engaged and providing on-site leadership to the construction effort. We've seen increased productivity at the worksite, including 24-hour coverage in critical path areas of the project. Expected near-term milestones include the placement of the final large construction module in the Unit 3 nuclear island, CA-02 and the 400-ton stainless steel CA-03 module. For Unit 4, we anticipate setting the CA-05 module and getting the 5-story 1,100-ton CA-20 module ready for hook later this summer.
Now let's turn to an update on the Kemper County project. We're making good progress on modifications and improvements to the refractory lining of both gasifiers and addressing issues identified during the initial fluidization and refractory cure-out on gasifier A. We are also in the process of remediating issues with the lignite feed and drying system as we approach testing of the gasifier using lignite. In March, we completed the refractory cure-out of gasifier B, reaching full operating temperatures while successfully operating the gasifier in pre-lignite FEED mode. Over the next couple of months, utilizing gasifier B, we expect to achieve first SIM gas production and, later this summer, initial power production using SIM gas. We continue to estimate an in-service date for the entire facility in the third quarter of this year. Reflected in the financial results we released today, we have recorded additional dollars to account for the projected schedule cost through September largely to accommodate the revised schedule for gasifier A. 
I'll now turn the call over to art for a financial and economic overview."

As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had solid results for the first quarter of 2016, reporting earnings of $485 million or $0.53 per share compared with earnings of $508 million or $0.56 per share in the first quart",1170,"Thanks, Tom. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had solid results for the first quarter of 2016, reporting earnings of $485 million or $0.53 per share compared with earnings of $508 million or $0.56 per share in the first quarter of last year. First quarter results for 2016 include after-tax charges of $33 million related to increased cost estimates for the construction of Mississippi Power's Kemper County project. First quarter results for 2015 included after-tax charges of $6 million for the Kemper Project. Earnings for the first quarter of 2016 also include after-tax charges of $14 million related to the proposed acquisition of AGL Resources and PowerSecure International. Excluding these items, Southern Company earned $532 million, or $0.58 per share, during the first quarter of '16 compared to $514 million, or $0.56 per share, in the first quarter of 2015. The major earnings drivers year-over-year for the first quarter of '16 included retail revenue effects across all our regulated operating companies and lower nonfuel operating and maintenance costs, offset by mild weather and higher depreciation expense. Southern Power also contributed positively year-over-year as a result of anticipated benefits from renewables projects expected to be in service in '16 and increased revenues from renewable projects placed in service in 2015.
Moving now to an economic and sales review for the first quarter. Economic growth in the first quarter of '16 was modest, and our retail sales results are encouraging. Total weather-adjusted retail sales grew 0.4% in the first quarter, led by strong residential sales, which were up 1.4% for the quarter. Growth in our residential class continues to be driven by strong customer growth as a result of faster population growth compared with the rest of the nation. Regional market fundamentals are strong, and we expect our regional economy to outpace the national economy. The housing sector appears poised for a modest uptick and the economy continues to add jobs at a decent pace. Residential construction spending continues to grow, driven by the integration of millennials into the workforce. Atlanta added the most new apartments in the nation in 2015, and even more units are expected to come online in 2016. Nationwide, Atlanta's multifamily forecast is second only to that of Brooklyn, New York. 
Weather-adjusted commercial sales were up 0.8% for the first quarter. This marks 5 consecutive quarters of positive growth in commercial sales, and we expect to continue this momentum into the second quarter. Atlanta's office market vacancy rate was 16.2% at the end of 2015, the lowest rate since 2008. This marks a move from absorption in existing properties to accelerated new office construction. 
Industrial sales were down 1% in the first quarter. Our regional manufacturing sector continues to adapt to weak demand and U.S. dollar remained a challenge for export-oriented businesses. I think it's significant to note that some of our largest industrial segments experienced maintenance outages during the first quarter. We expect them to return to operation soon, supporting our positive outlook for stronger industrial sales for the remainder of the year. We are also encouraged by certain economic indicators that suggest an improving industrial production outlook. The ISM Manufacturing Index increased to 51.8% in March, signaling a prospective expansion in industrial production for the first time in 6 months. New orders and production improved for a second consecutive month, with new orders posting the largest monthly gain since 2009. Manufacturing employment in the U.S. declined in March, but our service territory has experienced a strong rebound with manufacturing employment up 1.8% year-over-year. All 4 of our states posted manufacturing job gains. 4 of our 10 largest industrial segments saw increases in sales year-over-year, paper and transportation, along with lumber, stone, clay and glass lead the way largely attributed to a continued recovery in the housing sector.
Our economic development pipeline continues to be strong. There has been a 69% increase in year-to-date jobs announced compared to the same period in 2015. We have also seen a 19% increase in the year-to-date capital investment announced compared to that same period in 2015. The geographic region we serve continues to attract businesses that are seeking well-established transportation networks, lower cost of living, a capable workforce, attractive climate and low-cost energy.
Before turning the call back over to Tom, I will briefly cover 3 final items. First, our earnings estimate for the second quarter. We estimate that Southern Company will earn $0.70 per share in the second quarter of 2016. 
Secondly, I'd like to highlight our dividend announcement last week. Our Board of Directors approved a $0.07 increase in our common dividend to an annualized rate of $2.24. This is our 15th consecutive annual increase and marks 68 years, dating back to 1948, that Southern Company has paid a dividend to its shareholders that was equal to or greater than that of the previous year. But the decision to increase the dividend isn't about the past, it's all about the future. It's the strength of our underlying franchise together with our continued focus on remaining an industry leader through innovation that underpinned the board's decision to support our objective of providing superior risk-adjusted total shareholder return to investors over the long run. I would like to note that with the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation, our expected cash coverage of dividends is approximately 10% higher than before the extension and 20% higher than our recent historical average.
Finally, I want to provide an update on our financing plan. The year is off to a great start. We completed a $1.2 billion syndicated term loan for Mississippi Power in the first quarter. This term loan provides much-needed liquidity to Mississippi Power. 
Also in the first quarter, Georgia Power became the first retail-regulated utility in the U.S. to issue green bonds. In doing so, they follow Southern Power, which became the first investment-grade power producer in the U.S. to issue green bonds last November. Demand for both of these green bond offerings exceeded our expectations. 
As we look ahead, executing our holding company financing plan is a key priority. This plan includes issuing approximately $8 billion of debt and a minimum of $1.2 billion of -- in equity in 2016. Our internal plans, which were deployed last fall, have generated approximately $270 million so far this year. We will look to supplement those plans with additional common equity, and we are taking steps to preserve several options for achieving this. We expect to issue the debt and most, if not all, of the equity in advance of closing the AGL Resources transaction. While these issuances are intended to accommodate all of our holding company needs for 2016, our financing needs could increase to the extent that incremental investment opportunities present themselves, including Southern Power growth projects. Southern Company is committed to maintaining a high degree of financial integrity, and our financing plans are intended to support our current credit rating. 
I will now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks."

Our pending merger with AGL Resources is progressing through the approval process. The proposed merger has been approved by AGL Resources stockholders and the Federal Trade Commission. And we're making good progress with relevant state approvals, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in the second half of this year. 
We are also excited about our pending acquisition of PowerSecure International. Subject to the PowerSecure shareholder vote on May 5, we expect to close in the second quarter. PowerSecure is a premier provider of distributed infrastructure, offering primarily commercial and industrial customers innovative solutions to meet their individual reliability, energy efficiency or green objectives. Our business model has traditionally focused on making, moving and selling energy predominantly in front of the customer meter. PowerSecure accelerates our opportunity to extend our make, move and sell business model to the other side of the utility meter, as innovative new technologies emerge and customers' needs evolve.
In conclusion, we believe Southern Company is well-positioned for continued success in 2016 and for years to come.

So as we move the lignite from the field into the plant, it goes through a process where we essentially remove the moisture. In fact, one of the cool environmental aspects of this plant is that it actually produces water. We capture the evaporation and use it in the plant. One of the theaters for the lignite dryer had blades, you can imagine, like an old timing system, I would use these metaphors. And there's like an old time the nonpower lawnmower, where you would push behind it, and it would actually feed the lignite into the plant. What we've done is expanded the distance of the blades of that feeder that would allow us not to experience clumping and some other thing. So it's just stuff like that.

For example, one of the things that we demonstrated beautifully during 2015 is our ability to run that plant on natural gas. It provided, I don't know, 40% of the energy to the citizens of Mississippi Power customers of Mississippi Power. And did so in an extremely economic way. So as you think about the ability for that plant to provide not only electricity from SIM gas, but in a dual fuel sort of way to provide a really high level of reliability by supplementing any outages or whatever with natural gas-fired electricity, it's exceedingly attractive and, in my opinion, more than meets the obligations we are setting forth when this plant was originally ordered."

So you have both fuel stock moving into the riser as well as a very intricate set of air-fired nozzles. What we found in the original fluidization test, even the fluidization test went beautifully, the nozzles worked well, the materials circulated amazingly, and remember, I was there the day it happened. We found that because there was a lack of seals among and between the refractory and these nozzles, some of the materials got behind the refractory and the hard face and caused what we call these ratholes. But these are really small, really small kind of tunnels, if you will, that were filled up with material. As we had and the way you fix it is you tear the refractory back off and put it back on. It's not a high-tech operation. What has taken a lot of time is that the confined space and has just been time intensive. And the more we've looked around the refractory, we found more of these ratholes, we had to tear more it off and put it more back on. We have not seen, to any sense, that degree of rat holing with B.

We had another good quarter to begin 2016, a great start to the year, and we are making excellent progress on many fronts. Art will provide an overview of our financial results in just a minute. But first, I'd like to provide you with a brief update on our regulatory calendar in Georgia and updates on the Vogtle and Kemper Project. 
As many of you are aware, 2016 is a busy year for regulatory filings in Georgia, an IRP filing, 2 VCM filings, our merger approval application, a potential rate increase and the Vogtle contractors settlement filing, which has been expanded by the Georgia Public Service Commission to review all costs of the project incurred to date. 
To summarize, first, Georgia Power filed its triannual Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, in January. The PSC is expected to vote on the company's plan this July. Second, the PSC unanimously approved Georgia Power's 13th Vogtle Construction Monitoring Report in February. And later that same month, Georgia Power filed a 14th VCM report to be voted on in August. Third, Southern Company and AGL Resources received unanimous regulatory approval of our companies proposed merger from the Georgia PSC earlier this month, with all intervening parties in support of the settlement agreement. Fourth, Georgia Power has agreed to extend its current rate plan until 2019 and to keep base rates flat for the next 3 years. Fifth and finally, as you may recall in January, Georgia Power filed an application with the Georgia PSC for review of the $350 million settlement with its Vogtle 3 and 4 EPC contractors. The commission voted to move forward with an expanded process, which will examine the full project costs and schedule. Consistent with that February order, Georgia Power filed a supplemental information report, which provides compelling support that all project costs incurred to date for Vogtle Units 3 and 4 have been prudent and that the current cost and schedule forecast is reasonable. The filing includes reports from several subject matter experts, which support that conclusion. Over the next 6 months, Commission staff and Georgia Power will review this information, which may result in an agreement this fall for the Commission to consider.
Let's move to an update on the construction status of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. The Vogtle 3 and 4 nuclear expansion project continues to progress with multiple milestones achieved in the first quarter. The transition to Westinghouse and its affiliate as the single contractor is complete. Fluor is fully engaged in providing on-site leadership to the construction effort. We've seen increased productivity at the worksite, including 24-hour coverage in critical path areas of the project. Expected near-term milestones include the placement of the final large construction module in the Unit 3 nuclear island, CA-02 and the 400-ton stainless steel CA-03 module. For Unit 4, we anticipate setting the CA-05 module and getting the 5-story, 1,100-ton CA-20 module ready for hook later this summer.
Now let's turn to an update on the Kemper County project. We're making good progress on modifications and improvements to the refractory lining of both gasifiers and addressing issues identified during the initial fluidization and refractory cure-out on gasifier A. We are also in the process of remediating issues with the lignite feed and drying systems as we approach testing of the gasifier using lignite. In March, we completed the refractory cure-out of gasifier B, reaching full operating temperatures while successfully operating the gasifier in pre-lignite feed mode. Over the next couple of months, utilizing gasifier B, we expect to achieve first SIM gas production and, later this summer, initial power production using SIM gas. We continue to estimate an in-service date for the entire facility in the third quarter of this year. Reflected in the financial results we released today, we have recorded additional dollars to account for the projected schedule cost through September largely to accommodate the revised schedule for gasifier A. 
I'll now turn the call over to art for a financial and economic overview."

As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had solid results for the first quarter of 2016, reporting earnings of $485 million or $0.53 per share compared with earnings of $508 million or $0.56 per share in the first quart",1170,"Thanks, Tom. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had solid results for the first quarter of 2016, reporting earnings of $485 million or $0.53 per share compared with earnings of $508 million or $0.56 per share in the first quarter of last year. First quarter results for 2016 include after-tax charges of $33 million related to increased cost estimates for the construction of Mississippi Power's Kemper County project. First quarter results for 2015 included after-tax charges of $6 million for the Kemper Project. 
Earnings for the first quarter of 2016 also include after-tax charges of $14 million related to the proposed acquisition of AGL Resources and PowerSecure International. Excluding these items, Southern Company earned $532 million or $0.58 per share during the first quarter of '16 compared to $514 million or $0.56 per share in the first quarter of 2015. The major earnings drivers year-over-year for the first quarter of '16 included retail revenue effects across all our regulated operating companies and lower nonfuel operating and maintenance costs, offset by mild weather and higher depreciation expense. Southern Power also contributed positively year-over-year as a result of anticipated benefits from renewables projects expected to be in service in '16 and increased revenues from renewable projects placed in service in 2015.
Moving now to an economic and sales review for the first quarter. Economic growth in the first quarter of '16 was modest, and our retail sales results are encouraging. Total weather-adjusted retail sales grew 0.4% in the first quarter, led by strong residential sales, which were up 1.4% for the quarter. Growth in our residential class continues to be driven by strong customer growth as a result of faster population growth compared with the rest of the nation. Regional market fundamentals are strong, and we expect our regional economy to outpace the national economy. The housing sector appears poised for a modest uptick, and the economy continues to add jobs at a decent pace. Residential construction spending continues to grow, driven by the integration of millennials into the workforce. Atlanta added the most new apartments in the nation in 2015, and even more units are expected to come online in 2016. Nationwide, Atlanta's multifamily forecast is second only to that of Brooklyn, New York. 
Weather-adjusted commercial sales were up 0.8% for the first quarter. This marks 5 consecutive quarters of positive growth in commercial sales, and we expect to continue this momentum into the second quarter. Atlanta's office market vacancy rate was 16.2% at the end of 2015, the lowest rate since 2008. This marks a move from absorption in existing properties to accelerated new office construction. 
Industrial sales were down 1% in the first quarter. Our regional manufacturing sector continues to adapt to weak demand, and U.S. dollar remains a challenge for export-oriented businesses. I think it's significant to note that some of our largest industrial segments experienced maintenance outages during the first quarter. We expect them to return to operation soon, supporting our positive outlook for stronger industrial sales for the remainder of the year. We are also encouraged by certain economic indicators that suggest an improving industrial production outlook. 
The ISM Manufacturing Index increased to 51.8% in March, signaling a prospective expansion in industrial production for the first time in 6 months. New orders and production improved for a second consecutive month, with new orders posting the largest monthly gain since 2009. Manufacturing employment in the U.S. declined in March, but our service territory has experienced a strong rebound, with manufacturing employment up 1.8% year-over-year. All 4 of our states posted manufacturing job gains. 4 of our 10 largest industrial segments saw increases in sales year-over-year, paper and transportation, along with lumber, stone, clay and glass lead the way, largely attributed to a continued recovery in the housing sector.
Our economic development pipeline continues to be strong. There has been a 69% increase in year-to-date jobs announced compared to the same period in 2015. We have also seen a 19% increase in the year-to-date capital investment announced compared to that same period in 2015. The geographic region we serve continues to attract businesses that are seeking well-established transportation networks, lower cost of living, a capable workforce, attractive climate and low-cost energy.
Before turning the call back over to Tom, I will briefly cover 3 final items. First, our earnings estimate for the second quarter. We estimate that Southern Company will earn $0.70 per share in the second quarter of 2016. 
Secondly, I'd like to highlight our dividend announcement last week. Our Board of Directors approved a $0.07 increase in our common dividend to an annualized rate of $2.24. This is our 15th consecutive annual increase and marks 68 years, dating back to 1948, that Southern Company has paid a dividend to its shareholders that was equal to or greater than that of the previous year. But the decision to increase the dividend isn't about the past, it's all about the future. It's the strength of our underlying franchise, together with our continued focus on remaining an industry leader through innovation, that underpinned the board's decision to support our objective of providing superior risk-adjusted total shareholder return to investors over the long run. I would like to note that with the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation, our expected cash coverage of dividends is approximately 10% higher than before the extension and 20% higher than our recent historical average.
Finally, I want to provide an update on our financing plan. The year is off to a great start. We completed a $1.2 billion syndicated term loan for Mississippi Power in the first quarter. This term loan provides much-needed liquidity to Mississippi Power. Also in the first quarter, Georgia Power became the first retail-regulated utility in the U.S. to issue green bonds. In doing so, they follow Southern Power, which became the first investment-grade power producer in the U.S. to issue green bonds last November. Demand for both of these green bond offerings exceeded our expectations. 
As we look ahead, executing our holding company financing plan is a key priority. This plan includes issuing approximately $8 billion of debt and a minimum of $1.2 billion of -- in equity in 2016. Our internal plans, which were deployed last fall, have generated approximately $270 million so far this year. We will look to supplement those plans with additional common equity, and we are taking steps to preserve several options for achieving this. We expect to issue the debt and most, if not all, of the equity in advance of closing the AGL Resources transaction. While these issuances are intended to accommodate all of our holding company needs for 2016, our financing needs could increase to the extent that incremental investment opportunities present themselves, including Southern Power growth projects. Southern Company is committed to maintaining a high degree of financial integrity, and our financing plans are intended to support our current credit rating. 
I will now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks."

Our franchise business continues to perform at a high level, solidifying our position as an industry leader in all phases of the business. We are seeing continued progress on major capital projects, and our customer-focused business model continues to serve us well. 
Our pending merger with AGL Resources is progressing through the approval process. The proposed merger has been approved by AGL Resources stockholders and the Federal Trade Commission. And we're making good progress with relevant state approvals, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in the second half of this year. 
We are also excited about our pending acquisition of PowerSecure International. Subject to the PowerSecure shareholder vote on May 5, we expect to close in the second quarter. PowerSecure is a premier provider of distributed infrastructure, offering, primarily, commercial and industrial customers innovative solutions to meet their individual reliability, energy efficiency or green objectives. Our business model has traditionally focused on making, moving and selling energy predominantly in front of the customer meter. PowerSecure accelerates our opportunity to extend our make, move and sell business model to the other side of the utility meter, as innovative new technologies emerge and customers' needs evolve.
In conclusion, we believe Southern Company is well positioned for continued success in 2016 and for years to come. Bolstered by the strength of our 26,000 employees and their commitment to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to customers in the communities we serve, we are enthusiastic about the future.

So this is -- we may do some business in our territory, we'd be glad to do it. We'll probably do it under the brand of the operating company, and we have done some of this already.

And recall, as Art mentioned in his comments, even since then, because of bonus depreciation and everything else, we are substantially better from a cash flow coverage standpoint than we were. So the financial integrity underlying that decision even to increase the rate of growth of our dividend has improved since we spoke to you by 10% over kind of recent historical averages by 20%.

The other stuff that you may be remembering, let me kind of -- I'm trying to remember what you're referring to. Lignite dryers has been one, but that's been something we've talked about for some time. And again, you got to remember, the lignite is essentially 40% moisture. So as we move the lignite from the field into the plant, it goes through a process where we essentially remove the moisture. In fact, one of the cool environmental aspects of this plant is that it actually produces water. We capture the evaporation and use it in the plant. One of the feeders for the lignite dryer had blades, if you can imagine, like an old–timey  -- I would use these metaphors. There's like an old-timey nonpower lawnmower, where you would push behind it, and it would actually feed the lignite into the plant. What we've done is expanded the distance of the blades of that feeder that would allow us not to experience clumping and some other thing. So it's just stuff like that. We continue to work through it in a rather pedantic manner, and that's really what startup is all about. You operate certain areas of the plant, and we make improvements where we see capable."

We think that's the right way to go. And we continue to do everything along the way. So this hasn't just been, oh, something broke and let's fix it and -- we are making improvements along the way. For example, one of the things that we've demonstrated beautifully during 2015 is our ability to run that plant on natural gas. It provided, I don't know, 40% of the energy to the citizens of Mississippi Power -- or the customers of Mississippi Power. And did so in an extremely economic way. So as you think about the ability for that plant to provide not only electricity from SIM gas, but in a dual fuel sort of way to provide a really high level of reliability by supplementing any outages or whatever with natural gas-fired electricity, it's exceedingly attractive and, in my opinion, more than meets the obligations we're setting forth when this plant was originally ordered."

If you can imagine, the riser -- remember this thing, I would view it as lettered D, it's what it looks like. And the riser is essentially where the lignite comes in and then gets blown up into the air in a kind of beautiful helix design. So you have both fuel stock moving into the riser as well as a very intricate set of air-fired nozzles. What we found in the original fluidization test, even though the fluidization test went beautifully, the nozzles worked well, the materials circulated amazingly, and remember, I was there the day it happened. We found that because there was a lack of seals among and between the refractory and these nozzles, some of the materials got behind the refractory in a hard way and caused what we call these ratholes. But these are really small, really small kind of tunnels, if you will, that were filled up with material. As we had -- and the way you fix it is you tear the refractory back off and put it back on. It's not a high-tech operation. What has taken a lot of time is that the confined space and has just been time intensive. And the more we've looked around the refractory, we found more of these ratholes. We had to tear more of it off and put more back on. We have not seen, to any sense, that degree of rat holing with B.

We had another good quarter to begin 2016, a great start to the year, and we are making excellent progress on many fronts. Art will provide an overview of our financial results in just a minute. But first, I'd like to provide you with a brief update on our regulatory calendar in Georgia and updates on the Vogtle and Kemper Project. 
As many of you are aware, 2016 is a busy year for regulatory filings in Georgia, an IRP filing, 2 VCM filings, a merger approval application, a potential rate increase and the Vogtle contractors settlement filing, which has been expanded by the Georgia Public Service Commission to review all costs of the project incurred to date. 
To summarize, first, Georgia Power filed its triannual Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, in January. The PSC is expected to vote on the company's plan this July. Second, the PSC unanimously approved Georgia Power's 13th Vogtle Construction Monitoring Report in February. And later that same month, Georgia Power filed a 14th VCM report to be voted on in August. Third, Southern Company and AGL Resources received unanimous regulatory approval of our companies proposed merger from the Georgia PSC earlier this month, with all intervening parties in support of the settlement agreement. Fourth, Georgia Power has agreed to extend its current rate plan until 2019 and to keep base rates flat for the next 3 years. Fifth and finally, as you may recall in January, Georgia Power filed an application with the Georgia PSC for review of the $350 million settlement with its Vogtle 3 and 4 EPC contractors. The commission voted to move forward with an expanded process, which will examine the full project costs and schedule. Consistent with that February order, Georgia Power filed a supplemental information report, which provides compelling support that all project costs incurred to date for Vogtle Units 3 and 4 have been prudent and that the current cost and schedule forecast is reasonable. The filing includes reports from several subject matter experts which support that conclusion. Over the next 6 months, Commission staff and Georgia Power will review this information, which may result in an agreement this fall for the Commission to consider.
Let's move to an update on the construction status of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. The Vogtle 3 and 4 nuclear expansion project continues to progress, with multiple milestones achieved in the first quarter. The transition to Westinghouse and its affiliate as the single contractor is complete. Fluor is fully engaged in providing on-site leadership to the construction effort. We've seen increased productivity at the worksite, including 24-hour coverage in critical path areas of the project. Expected near-term milestones include the placement of the final large construction module in the Unit 3 nuclear island, CA-02 and the 400-ton stainless steel CA-03 module. For Unit 4, we anticipate setting the CA-05 module and getting the 5-story, 1,100-ton CA-20 module ready for hook later this summer.
Now let's turn to an update on the Kemper County project. We're making good progress on modifications and improvements to the refractory lining of both gasifiers and addressing issues identified during the initial fluidization and refractory cure-out on gasifier A. We are also in the process of remediating issues with the lignite feed and drying systems as we approach testing of the gasifiers using lignite. In March, we completed the refractory cure-out of gasifier B, reaching full operating temperatures while successfully operating the gasifier in pre-lignite feed mode. Over the next couple of months, utilizing gasifier B, we expect to achieve first SIM gas production and, later this summer, initial power production using SIM gas. We continue to estimate an in-service date for the entire facility in the third quarter of this year. Reflected in the financial results we released today, we have recorded additional dollars to account for the projected schedule cost through September largely to accommodate the revised schedule for gasifier A. 
I'll now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic overview."

As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had solid results for the first quarter of 2016, reporting earnings of $485 million or $0.53 per share compared with earnings of $508 million or $0.56 per share in the first quart",1170,"Thanks, Tom. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had solid results for the first quarter of 2016, reporting earnings of $485 million or $0.53 per share compared with earnings of $508 million or $0.56 per share in the first quarter of last year. First quarter results for 2016 include after-tax charges of $33 million related to increased cost estimates for the construction of Mississippi Power's Kemper County project. First quarter results for 2015 included after-tax charges of $6 million for the Kemper Project. 
Earnings for the first quarter of 2016 also include after-tax charges of $14 million related to the proposed acquisition of AGL Resources and PowerSecure International. Excluding these items, Southern Company earned $532 million or $0.58 per share during the first quarter of '16 compared to $514 million or $0.56 per share in the first quarter of 2015. The major earnings drivers year-over-year for the first quarter of '16 included retail revenue effects across all our regulated operating companies and lower nonfuel operating and maintenance costs, offset by mild weather and higher depreciation expense. Southern Power also contributed positively year-over-year as a result of anticipated benefits from renewables projects expected to be in service in '16 and increased revenues from renewable projects placed in service in 2015.
Moving now to an economic and sales review for the first quarter. Economic growth in the first quarter of '16 was modest, and our retail sales results are encouraging. Total weather-adjusted retail sales grew 0.4% in the first quarter, led by strong residential sales, which were up 1.4% for the quarter. Growth in our residential class continues to be driven by strong customer growth as a result of faster population growth compared with the rest of the nation. Regional market fundamentals are strong, and we expect our regional economy to outpace the national economy. The housing sector appears poised for a modest uptick, and the economy continues to add jobs at a decent pace. Residential construction spending continues to grow, driven by the integration of millennials into the workforce. Atlanta added the most new apartments in the nation in 2015, and even more units are expected to come online in 2016. Nationwide, Atlanta's multifamily forecast is second only to that of Brooklyn, New York. 
Weather-adjusted commercial sales were up 0.8% for the first quarter. This marks 5 consecutive quarters of positive growth in commercial sales, and we expect to continue this momentum into the second quarter. Atlanta's office market vacancy rate was 16.2% at the end of 2015, the lowest rate since 2008. This marks a move from absorption in existing properties to accelerated new office construction. 
Industrial sales were down 1% in the first quarter. Our regional manufacturing sector continues to adapt to weak demand, and U.S. dollar remains a challenge for export-oriented businesses. I think it's significant to note that some of our largest industrial segments experienced maintenance outages during the first quarter. We expect them to return to operation soon, supporting our positive outlook for stronger industrial sales for the remainder of the year. We are also encouraged by certain economic indicators that suggest an improving industrial production outlook. 
The ISM Manufacturing Index increased to 51.8% in March, signaling a prospective expansion in industrial production for the first time in 6 months. New orders and production improved for a second consecutive month, with new orders posting the largest monthly gain since 2009. Manufacturing employment in the U.S. declined in March, but our service territory has experienced a strong rebound, with manufacturing employment up 1.8% year-over-year. All 4 of our states posted manufacturing job gains. 4 of our 10 largest industrial segments saw increases in sales year-over-year, paper and transportation, along with lumber, stone, clay and glass, led the way, largely attributed to a continued recovery in the housing sector.
Our economic development pipeline continues to be strong. There has been a 69% increase in year-to-date jobs announced compared to the same period in 2015. We have also seen a 19% increase in the year-to-date capital investment announced compared to that same period in 2015. The geographic region we serve continues to attract businesses that are seeking well-established transportation networks, lower cost of living, a capable workforce, attractive climate and low-cost energy.
Before turning the call back over to Tom, I will briefly cover 3 final items. First, our earnings estimate for the second quarter. We estimate that Southern Company will earn $0.70 per share in the second quarter of 2016. 
Secondly, I'd like to highlight our dividend announcement last week. Our Board of Directors approved a $0.07 increase in our common dividend to an annualized rate of $2.24. This is our 15th consecutive annual increase and marks 68 years, dating back to 1948, that Southern Company has paid a dividend to its shareholders that was equal to or greater than that of the previous year. But the decision to increase the dividend isn't about the past, it's all about the future. It's the strength of our underlying franchise, together with our continued focus on remaining an industry leader through innovation that underpinned the board's decision to support our objective of providing superior risk-adjusted total shareholder return to investors over the long run. I would like to note that with the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation, our expected cash coverage of dividends is approximately 10% higher than before the extension and 20% higher than our recent historical average.
Finally, I want to provide an update on our financing plan. The year is off to a great start. We completed a $1.2 billion syndicated term loan for Mississippi Power in the first quarter. This term loan provides much-needed liquidity to Mississippi Power. Also in the first quarter, Georgia Power became the first retail-regulated utility in the U.S. to issue green bonds. In doing so, they follow Southern Power, which became the first investment-grade power producer in the U.S. to issue green bonds, last November. Demand for both of these green bond offerings exceeded our expectations. 
As we look ahead, executing our holding company financing plan is a key priority. This plan includes issuing approximately $8 billion of debt and a minimum of $1.2 billion of -- in equity in 2016. Our internal plans, which were deployed last fall, have generated approximately $270 million so far this year. We will look to supplement those plans with additional common equity, and we are taking steps to preserve several options for achieving this. We expect to issue the debt and most, if not all, of the equity in advance of closing the AGL Resources transaction. While these issuances are intended to accommodate all of our holding company needs for 2016, our financing needs could increase to the extent that incremental investment opportunities present themselves, including Southern Power growth projects. Southern Company is committed to maintaining a high degree of financial integrity, and our financing plans are intended to support our current credit rating. 
I will now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks."

Following a successful and eventful 2015, Southern Company has entered 2016 with strong momentum. Our franchise business continues to perform at a high level, solidifying our position as an industry leader in all phases of the business. We are seeing continued progress on major capital projects, and our customer-focused business model continues to serve us well. 
Our pending merger with AGL Resources is progressing through the approval process. The proposed merger has been approved by AGL Resources stockholders and the Federal Trade Commission. And we're making good progress with relevant state approvals, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in the second half of this year. 
We are also excited about our pending acquisition of PowerSecure International. Subject to the PowerSecure shareholder vote on May 5, we expect to close in the second quarter. PowerSecure is a premier provider of distributed infrastructure, offering primarily commercial and industrial customers innovative solutions to meet their individual reliability, energy efficiency, or green, objectives. Our business model has traditionally focused on making, moving and selling energy predominantly in front of the customer meter. PowerSecure accelerates our opportunity to extend our make, move and sell business model to the other side of the utility meter, as innovative new technologies emerge and customers' needs evolve.
In conclusion, we believe Southern Company is well positioned for continued success in 2016 and for years to come. Bolstered by the strength of our 26,000 employees and their commitment to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to customers in the communities we serve, we are enthusiastic about the future.

Given our belief in the growth contribution from AGL, recall, we increased our corporate expectation, our long-term growth rate from 3% to 4% to 4% to 5%. And what we said back then was, of course, this is the purview of the board and it is ultimately their decision, but we saw a pathway to increase the rate of growth from $0.07 in a year to $0.08 in a year. And recall, as Art mentioned in his comments, even since then, because of bonus depreciation and everything else, we are substantially better from a cash flow coverage standpoint than we were. So the financial integrity underlying that decision even to increase the rate of growth of our dividend has improved since we spoke to you by 10% over kind of recent historical averages by 20%. So if anything, our ability to do that as measured purely by financial integrity is even higher than what we've suggested. So I think we'll keep it right there for now and look forward to the rest of the year."

One of the feeders for the lignite dryer had blades, if you can imagine, like an old–timey  -- I would use these metaphors. There's like an old-timey nonpower lawnmower, where you would push behind it, and it would actually feed the lignite into the plant. What we've done is expanded the distance of the blades of that feeder that would allow us not to experience clumping and some other thing. So it's just stuff like that.

And I think one of the things that I think is distinguished by our operation at Mississippi and Kemper County plant, Ratcliffe, sometimes painfully, is that getting it done right the first time is really important. We're not going to rush and try and slam this thing in. And what we will do is essentially demonstrate a reasonable history of reliable commercial operation and then file the rate case. We think that's the right way to go. And we continue to do everything along the way. So this hasn't just been, oh, something broke and let's fix it and -- we are making improvements along the way. For example, one of the things that we've demonstrated beautifully during 2015 is our ability to run that plant on natural gas. It provided, I don't know, 40% of the energy to the citizens of Mississippi Power -- or the customers of Mississippi Power. And did so in an extremely economic way. So as you think about the ability for that plant to provide not only electricity from SIM gas, but in a dual fuel sort of way to provide a really high level of reliability by supplementing any outages or whatever with natural gas-fired electricity, it's exceedingly attractive and, in my opinion, more than meets the obligations we were setting forth when this plant was originally ordered."

If you can imagine, the riser -- remember this thing, I would view it as a letter D, it's what it looks like. And the riser is essentially where the lignite comes in and then gets blown up into the air in a kind of beautiful helix design. So you have both fuel stock moving into the riser as well as a very intricate set of air-fired nozzles. What we found in the original fluidization test, even though the fluidization test went beautifully, the nozzles worked well, the material circulated amazingly, and remember, I was there the day it happened. We found that because there was a lack of seals among and between the refractory and these nozzles, some of the material got behind the refractory and the hard face and caused what we call these rat holes. But these are really small, really small kind of tunnels, if you will, that were filled up with material. As we had -- and the way you fix it is you tear the refractory back off and put it back on. It's not a high-tech operation. What has taken a lot of time is it’s a confined space and has just been time-intensive. And the more we've looked around the refractory, we found more of these rat holes. We had to tear more of it off and put more back on. We have not seen, to any sense, that degree of rat-holing with B. And recall, I think B finished its fluidization test like in 1 day. So we learned a lot going from A to B."

As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. This is an extraordinary time for Southern Company. In addition to our better-than-expected financial results for the quarter, we've had several major accomplishments over the past several months. I'd like to first discuss our business development activities, which are enhancing our low-risk, attractive-return business model. 
As you know, we completed our merger with AGL Resources on July 1 and subsequently renamed them Southern Company Gas. This acquisition was our first major step in a broader strategy to further expand our business in a meaningful way across the energy value chain. We purchased the gas infrastructure company with high growth projections at a great price and, in the process, retained a top-notch natural gas management team. The regulatory approval process was constructive and uneventful. We were able to close the transaction faster and at a lower cost, including our debt and equity financing, than we originally expected. Southern Company Gas is a great addition to our company and should contribute positively towards fulfilling our shareholder value proposition for a very long time. 
Shortly after closing the Southern Company Gas transaction, we announced the strategic venture with Kinder Morgan, in which we agree to purchase a 50% equity interest in the Southern Natural Gas Pipeline System. Subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino review, we anticipate the transaction will be completed by the late third quarter or early fourth quarter of this year. This is precisely the type of natural gas infrastructure strategy we discussed for almost 2 years, and we view this venture as an ideal complement to the newly expanded Southern Company. With natural gas being one of the United States' dominant energy solutions for the future, the industrial logic of this transaction is completely clear, and there's hopefully more to come. Kinder Morgan is a recognized leader in natural gas pipeline development. Our 2 companies have identified a variety of specific growth opportunities, which we expect to benefit both customers and investors. As those opportunities come to fruition, we will update you on their details. 
Earlier in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of PowerSecure, a company known for its proprietary distributed infrastructure expertise. PowerSecure has a national footprint and continues to grow rapidly an expended high profile customer roster. We are impressed with the way in which PowerSecure is deploying its proprietary technology and innovative customer-focused solutions to strengthen an already stellar reputation. This business is the way to play offense in the energy efficiency/distributed infrastructure sector, extending our customer-focused business model beyond meter. 
Lastly, I'd like to highlight Southern Power's most recent successes. In our first quarter earnings call, we shared our belief that the potential pipeline for renewable projects was larger than originally anticipated. Since then, Southern Power has continued to find value-accretive renewable projects that benefit 2016 and beyond. Already this year, Southern Power has announced 278 megawatts of new solar projects and 43 megawatts of new wind projects. And we anticipate more to come. 
Art will highlight 2016 CapEx expectations in just a few minutes, but I want to reinforce 2 points we've made before. First, in the years ahead, we expect to pivot to a greater focus on lean projects, with the reemergence of gas projects within the next few years. Second, much of the additional growth capital this year will be invested to bring us growth in 2017 and beyond. 
Let's turn now to an update on our major construction projects. First, the Kemper IGCC. Almost 2 weeks ago, we achieved our most significant milestone to date, with the first lignite feed and the production of SIM gas on gasifier B. This was a major accomplishment. This first production of syngas operation of the front end of the plant, which includes many first-of-a-kind components related to gasification technology. This milestone is significant as it validates the trade technology at a commercial scale. We've also proven the back end of the plan, the combined-cycle units currently operating reliably on natural gas. Significant testing activities are in progress and are scheduled to continue over the coming days, leading to the initial production of an electricity using syngas and combustion turbine B expected towards the end of next week. Accomplishing this next milestone will likely present challenges as the plant's 14 operational systems must be integrated for the first time. 
We have previously disclosed that both Units A and B of the facility are expected to be fully integrated and in-service by the end of September. We are closely monitoring the next critical steps in the start of schedule and we expect to learn a lot. We will reflect any necessary schedule adjustments in our second quarter 10-Q. 
Let's move on to an update on the construction set Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Construction on Units 3 and 4 remains on track and productivity continues to improve as Westinghouse has effectively leveraged the construction expertise of its subcontractor, Fluor. The contractor has reaffirmed its confidence in the schedule, and several new work fronts have been established, with many critical areas implementing 24-hour coverage of craft labor to maintain the productivity momentum. The nuclear island containment building, with all 6 major modules now installed, remains the critical path for Unit 3 construction. We expect the remainder of the year to include a number of major milestones for Unit 3, including the setting of ring 2 on the containment vessel, placement of the reactor vessel and initial energization. 
Meanwhile, Unit 4 is progressing especially well, with the lessons learned from Unit 3, and have resulted in measurable productivity improvements. 
Early on, we highlighted the NRC's ITACC process, which stands for inspection, test, analyses and acceptance criteria, as an area of key focus for the project. We began submitting ITACC closure notices to the NRC in 2015, and the pace will more than triple in 2016. Thus far, this process is right on track, and all indications are that the NRC has done everything necessary to prepare to support this effort going forward. 
On the regulatory front, we expect to vote on VCM 14 and August and the filing of VCM 15 shortly thereafter. The prudence process is ongoing with Georgia Power and the PSC staff expected to report to the Georgia Public Service Commission by mid-October. 
I'll now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic overview."

As you can see from the materials released this morning, we had solid results for the second quarter of 2016, earning $0.68 per share, compared to $0.69 per share in the second quarter of 2015. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, we earned $1.21 a share compared with $1.25 a share from the same period in 2015. Excluding certain adjustments listed in the earnings materials, earnings for the second quarter of 2016 and the 6-month period ended June 30, 2016 were $0.77 and $1.35 per share, respectively. This compares with $0.71 per share and $1.28 per share for the same periods in 2015. Major earnings drivers for the second quarter of 2016 included retail revenue effects at Southern Company's traditional operating companies and lower nonfuel operating and maintenance costs, offset by lower usage across all customer classes, higher depreciation in amortization expense and higher interest expense. 
Southern Power also contributed positively year-over-year as a result of anticipated benefits from renewables projects expected to be in service in 2016 and increased revenues from renewable projects previously placed in service in 2015 and in the first half of 2016. 
Moving now to an economic and sales review of the second quarter. U.S. economy continues to expand at a moderate pace. Service sectors are generally doing well, driven by strong consumer spending and a relatively robust labor market. Real GDP rose 1.1% in the first quarter of this year, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's current forecast for real GDP growth in 2016 is 2.4%. Overall, market fundamentals are positive and job gains remain fairly robust. 
Total weather-adjusted retail sales are down 1.4% in the second quarter of 2016 versus the second quarter of 2015 and down 0.5% year-to-date. A combination of shifting economics and the replacement of old equipment with more energy-efficient devices and appliances appears to be negatively impacting usage in our residential and commercial customer classes, outweighing positive economic trends. The manufacturing sector remains challenged by global headwinds, including the strength of the U.S. dollar and volatility and commodity prices, which have hit energy-related industries especially hard. Also, worldwide event risk appears to be inhibiting major commitments of capital by many industrial customers. 
Weather-adjusted residential sales declined 0.2% in the second quarter of 2016 but are up 0.6% year-to-date. Residential sales growth continues to be driven by strong customer growth exceeding both expectations and actual growth in recent years. Conversely, residential use per customer is constrained by higher influx of multifamily construction as well as the replacement of old equipment with newer and more energy-efficient devices and appliances. 
Weather-adjusted commercial sales declined 1.9% in the second quarter of 2016 after 5 consecutive quarters of positive growth and are down 0.6% year-to-date. Year to date, we've added 3,300 new commercial customers versus 2,300 at the same juncture in 2015. These healthy customer growth trends are running counter to decreased energy demand related to e-commerce growth and lighting retrofit -- retrofits utilizing LED technologies. 
Industrial sales declined 1.9% in the second quarter of this year and are down 1.5% year-to-date. Sales continue to be negatively influenced by stagnant global demand, weaker, albeit, recovering energy prices and a strong dollar. We are encouraged, however, by a variety of positive indicators. Manufacturing employment in the Southeast continues to outpace the rest of the nation, with manufacturing employment up 1.4% year-over-year. The ISM manufacturing index has risen in 5 of the past 6 months, jumping to 53.2 in June, the highest since February of 2015. 
Our stone, clay and glass and lumber segments continue to outperform compared to 2015 on a year-to-date basis, as these segments continue to benefit from the housing recovery in our region. Economic development activity remains fairly robust, with a 166% increase in new jobs announced year-to-date and healthy capital spending across our region. The pipeline of active projects is on pace with 2015. However, despite an increased in the number of prospective jobs, potential investment seems to be slowing. Political and economic uncertainty, both domestic and abroad, along with the continued strength of the dollar appear to be hindering business investment decisions in both the industrial and commercial sectors. As we stated before, we remain encouraged that the geographic region we serve continues to attract businesses that are seeking well-established transportation networks, lower cost of living and capable workforce and attractive climate and low-cost energy. We believe all these factors continue to merit cautious optimism. 
Before turning the call back to Tom, I want to briefly cover a few final items. First, our earnings estimate for the third quarter. We estimate that Southern Company will earn $1.16 per share in the third quarter of 2016, excluding any impact from Southern Company Gas and the related acquisition debt costs, as well as our investment in [indiscernible] in the related financing costs. 
Earlier, Tom addressed the continued success of Southern Power has had in developing its project pipeline in 2016. Because of that success, we are updating our forecast for Southern Power capital expenditures for 2016, including $500 million of placeholders for additional projects. Of the capital investments identified thus far in 2016, $2.5 billion is for solar projects and, consistent with our pivot toward wind, $1.4 billion is for wind projects. In total, we are increasing our 2016 Southern Power capital expenditures to $4.5 billion, an increase of about $2.1 billion. Most of this increase supports projects that will contribute to income in 2017 and beyond and have the effect of strengthening and lengthening our growth rate. The 2016 capital investments update also includes expected capital expenditures of $800 million for Southern Company Gas in the second half of the year and approximately $1.5 billion for our investment in [indiscernible]. 
Finally, I want to provide an update on our financing plan. In the second quarter of 2016, Southern Company successfully completed a $900 million equity offering and $8.5 billion debt offering at the parent company, the largest ever for a utility, and issued EUR 1.1 million of bonds of euro-denominated green bonds at Southern Power. 
Our updated financing plan for the remainder of 2016 now reflects incremental financing activity largely to support our increased level of investments at Southern Power, as well as our investment in [indiscernible]. It is designed to be supportive of both our long-term growth and credit quarterly objectives. 
Our equity needs for the remainder of 2016 total approximately $2 billion. While a portion of this equity will be funded through our existing plans, our projected needs exceed the typical capacity of these plans. Southern Company is committed to maintaining a high degree of financial integrity, and our financing plans are intended to support our current credit profile. 
At this point, I'll turn the call back to Tom for his closing remarks."

Very interesting. I set the meeting with them last week, last Thursday. And is this -- we're seeing in the Southeast, the plus side, is more expansion, more in-migration than we have seen in the past, more than our budget and more job creation. And so that side of the ledger looks pretty good. When you look at usage, it looks a little worse. The net effect is kind of flat. The usage accounts could really, it's a residential level, can really speak to 2 things going on, and the Fed has been wrestling with this one as well. Savings rates are up. So people aren't necessarily taking improvements in their household income statement as a result of lower gasoline prices, for example, and going out and spending it. Maybe that's not so surprising coming out of a recession. The other one is greater penetration of energy efficiency. Outweighing that is people's kind of diving into more of the digital economy, more devices, more whatever. Anyway, the net effect of all that right now is flat. Commercial, same deal. We are up on customers, Art went through the numbers. We think that is energy efficiency. And that could be LEDs, it could be more efficient HVAC or whatever. And you want to know what that goes to, Steve? Our response to that is really PowerSecure. That is, we think, technology is enabling, and customers are asking for this notion of making, moving and selling on their own premise. In fact, they're obviating in many respects the importance of the meter. And so our response to that has bee, number one, we want to do what's good for our customers and energy efficiency and every one of our companies has projects and programs and all that. But we want to start getting share there, and that's what PowerSecure is all about. And if you look at some very successful segments that may apply, would be in the military and some areas related to that. Industrial is a different kettle of fish. And it pretty -- boy, if you look at the business, Roundtable, if you look at our own surveys with our own important customers, we just got through with you call it the sounding board or something."

And if you look at the broad data, it appears that starting some time in the second quarter, maybe beginning in the first, industrial companies started really pulling back on capital deployment. When I was on Bloomberg this morning, they talked about in many broad measures how durable goods just fell off the table. It looks as if that is kind of event-related, whether it is more worries about economic malaise in Europe, Brexit, terrorism, lack of transparency out of China, whether it looks like the dollar versus other worldwide currencies, whether it's uncertainty about our own political process, it looks as if capital commitment by big industrials has really fallen off. But I'll give you a quick data point. A number of our economic development projects is about the same. The number of jobs is about the same, within 5%. But the number of forward-looking capital commitments of our economic development backlog is down about 50%. At least it is for now. We don't think those are cancellations, we think those are deferrals. One other point on industrial. We have seen many of our major customers now start to consider consolidation. That may into our benefit, if they consolidate away from higher price places in the United States to the Southeast, we'll see. The other place we've seen that is in extended outages and perhaps more comprehensive outages. They're going to take the outages anyway. They're going to take them longer and do more during this period of uncertainty. That's what we think is behind the industrial numbers."

When we look at the number of commercial customers we have, and there's almost 600,000 of them, it's hard to get a beat on exactly what every customer might be doing. But there are segments of offices and data centers where we are seeing drops in load, and we're not quite sure whether that's  they're raising temperatures in their server rooms or whether they're actually moving data centers out of our territory to other facilities.

Having lived through Kemper, there's always issues. The unknown unknowns and everything else. But I'll say this, we've been -- you always learn more in getting one unit ahead of the other and applying those learnings to the next unit. Haven't we seen that on Vogtle. Vogtle 3 has been going fine. Vogtle 4 is going a little better than expected because of what we learned on 3, especially a and a variety of other things. Recall B jumped ahead of A, and we made the adjustment in the schedule really because of the prolonged refractory work on A. Remember that was the first one out of the chute on the fluidization trials. We learned that, adjusted on B, and bam, B just jumped ahead and doing great. I guess the last point I just want to make on that really probably your question goes to, when we talk about delivering electricity out of B, and then ultimately, delivering electricity out of A, that really isn't good enough to declare COD. We've got to make sure that the whole system works well in an integrated fashion. And that's when we'll call COD. And we think we'll learn a lot here in the next couple of weeks."

So we wanted to be very pure about giving you the estimate, what we have going forward. AGL has significant periodicity as we do in their earnings strength. You get mostly earnings in the first half of the year, and only about 1/3 of their earnings come in the second half. So when we talk about -- remember when we announced the deal, it was all about how much they were going to accrete to our value proposition and everything else. Look, the information value of the second half of Southern Gas, now, yes, Southern Company Gas is not particularly interesting. What's interesting to me is what the full year in '17 will look like, how we're going to seemingly get through FTC, regulatory approvals, get [indiscernible] integrated into that. And then, I think we'll have very kind of very, very interesting fun stuff to talk about in October.

So right now, I guess, year to date, where 50% of our energy produced from natural gas and I don't know, 28%, 27% from coal. With all the loads were having now, those numbers are going to converge a bit. It may be that by the end of the year, just given the demand and cold was starting to run a little bit more, we could see gas drop down into the very high 40s and coal pick up just a bit. But what remains is that we are one of the nation's most important consumers of natural gas, whether it's through our pipes or whether it's being consumed in our electric generation facilities. One of the great advantages, and one of the synergies of the deal, really goes to the excellent capability of the folks at AGL -- formerly AGL Resources. And so we're looking to see what are the different things we can do to keep prices as low to our customers as they possibly can be, and we're working through all those synergies now. An idea we've had forever has been this rate basing of gas. It never has risen high enough on the priority list of our Commissions to really make a big push on it. If it becomes attractive, we certainly talk about it, if it becomes attractive enough, we'll certainly pursue it."

And you all -- well, you all -- we all were aware some of the challenges that CBI was having, the hangover on litigation, cash issue that CBI had, there's a whole kind of storyline around the challenges that the contractor group was facing. Cutting out the litigation and the overhang that produced with the settlement, at the same time Westinghouse buying away this piece of the business from CBI, gives clarity to who's in charge, and then replacing CBI with Fluor has all [indiscernible] to everyone's benefit. One of the things now that we have been able to do with Fluor on-site with Westinghouse firmly in charge is moved to this full 24-hour coverage. One of things we're doing is adding more craft labor to the site to be able to hit the productivity curves that we need to do. We expect to prove those things in the next quarter and months ahead. That is going to be the key to hitting our schedule. The other thing is we have put in place in the new contract with Westinghouse, incentive for meeting load as well as payment milestones for cash payments to Westinghouse and then ultimately the fuller from us anyway. So really the Westinghouse, that's all we care about. So there's a whole range of commercial incentives in place for that to happen. We think we're making terrific progress. We're very happy. And the other thing I want you to hear is there's Unit 3, Unit 4 is actually progressing even better.

There's always ongoing conversations on Capitol Hill about taxes and policy and everything else. I don't think we're at that point yet certainly in meeting that. The administration in place so far and Congress have both been incredibly supportive of this notion of promoting the renaissance of nuclear to America. So, so far, it's Southern and then it's summer. We hear other projects coming to the doorsteps and, I think, as a national priority, Congress and the administration, and even the new administration, I think, will be supportive in making sure that, that happens as well as it can. One last point, I know I go on, but I can't make this point enough. For all the schedule changes and all the costs associated with the schedule changes, the benefits to customers have overwhelmed those costs, and when that thing was originally ordered by the commission, it was going to be a 12% price increase. Now, we think, because the benefits have overwhelmed the costs even with the schedule changes, we think that the price impact will not be 12, it will be between 6 and 6.5. Price increases have actually come down over this time frame."

What we've tried to be very clear about and there's some new language in this 8-K that really reflects remember how in effect I'm going to go back to stuff we said boy when we originally started this thing, we were talking about risks. And beyond construction risks, we talked about how a combined cycle unit has 3 pieces that need to be integrated, that this unit was going to this plant was going to have about 14, 13 or 14. And one of the challenges we always said was integrating the different systems in this plant. Goodness, that so far that we think we've integrated or at least demonstrated maybe 8 of those 14 systems. What's left, and we're going to learn a lot, like I said in these next 2 weeks, is our ability to integrate successfully the remaining systems in order to produce electricity from syngas out of the combined cycle. And Paul, just want to say, that is really important information. And I don't think this is in the realm of it won't work, we believe it absolutely will work, but it's a matter of fine tuning this engine."

So one of the things that the topic of conversation with the Commission is really what will be the operating performance of the plant through its first 10 years or something like that. And in order to demonstrate the early sustainability, we want to ramp up the production of syngas to about a 60% to 70% capability. Now, how likely we are to get 60% to 70% average for the first year of operation? That's a whole different number. And I think one of the things that just led us handle, maybe we can give you a better answer in October, but it's an understanding between us and the Commission as to what is the ramp-up of performance? If you go back to many of the supercritical units in America, when you look at introducing new nuclear plants, there are always opportunities to improve performance and reliability and capacity factor over time. You don't hit full speed right away. We'll share with you some of that, but I wouldn't expect 70% out of the gate. We need 70% to demonstrate, but then we'll take it down and fix and bring it back.

With respect to the administration in place, the Obama administrative, certainly under the leadership of Secretary, who without blowing smoke at him, I really believe he's been the best energy secretary America has ever had. Very practical, very focused on providing on all of the above energy solution for America.

As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. 
This is an extraordinary time for Southern Company. In addition to our better-than-expected financial results for the quarter, we've had several major accomplishments over the past several months. I'd like to first discuss our business development activities, which are enhancing our low-risk, attractive-return business model. 
As you know, we completed our merger with AGL Resources on July 1, and subsequently renamed them Southern Company Gas. This acquisition was our first major step in a broader strategy to further expand our business in a meaningful way across the energy value chain. We purchased a gas infrastructure company with high growth projections at a great price and in the process, retained a top-notch natural gas management team. The regulatory approval process was constructive and uneventful. We were able to close the transaction faster and at a lower cost, including our debt and equity financing, than we originally expected. Southern Company Gas is a great addition to our company and should contribute positively towards fulfilling our shareholder value proposition for a very long time. 
Shortly after closing the Southern Company Gas transaction, we announced a strategic venture with Kinder Morgan, in which we agreed to purchase a 50% equity interest in the Southern Natural Gas Pipeline System. Subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino review, we anticipate the transaction will be completed by the late third quarter or early fourth quarter of this year. This is precisely the type of natural gas infrastructure strategy we've discussed for almost 2 years, and we view this venture as an ideal complement to the newly expanded Southern Company. With natural gas being one of the United States' dominant energy solutions for the future, the industrial logic of this transaction is completely clear, and there's hopefully more to come. Kinder Morgan is a recognized leader in natural gas pipeline development. Our 2 companies have identified a variety of specific growth opportunities, which we expect will benefit both customers and investors. As those opportunities come to fruition, we will update you on their details. 
Earlier in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of PowerSecure, a company known for its proprietary distributed infrastructure expertise. PowerSecure has a national footprint and continues to grow rapidly an expanded high-profile customer roster. We are impressed with the way in which PowerSecure is deploying its proprietary technology and innovative customer-focused solutions to strengthen an already stellar reputation. This business is the way to play offense in the energy efficiency/distributed infrastructure sector, extending our customer-focused business model beyond the meter.
Lastly, I'd like to highlight Southern Power's most recent successes. In our first quarter earnings call, we shared our belief that the potential pipeline for renewable projects was larger than originally anticipated. Since then, Southern Power has continued to find value-accretive renewable projects that benefit 2016 and beyond. Already this year, Southern Power has announced 278 megawatts of new solar projects and 43 megawatts of new wind projects. And we anticipate more to come. 
Art will highlight 2016 CapEx expectations in just a few minutes, but I want to reinforce 2 points we've made before. First, in the years ahead, we expect to pivot to a greater focus on lean projects, with the reemergence of gas projects within the next few years. Second, much of the additional growth capital this year will be invested to bring us growth in 2017 and beyond. 
Let's turn now to an update on our major construction projects. First, the Kemper IGCC. Almost 2 weeks ago, we achieved our most significant milestone to date, with the first lignite feed and the production of syngas on gasifier B. This was a major accomplishment. This first production of syngas involved the operation of the front end of the plant, which includes many first-of-a-kind components related to TRIG gasification technology. This milestone is significant as it validates the TRIG technology at a commercial scale. We've also proven the back end of the plant, the combined-cycle units currently operating reliably on natural gas. Significant testing activities are in progress and are scheduled to continue over the coming days, leading to the initial production of electricity using syngas in combustion turbine B expected towards the end of next week. Accomplishing this next milestone will likely present challenges as the plant's 14 operational systems must be integrated for the first time. 
We've previously disclosed that both Units A and B of the facility are expected to be fully integrated and in-service by the end of September. We're closely monitoring these next critical steps in the start of schedule and we expect to learn a lot. We'll reflect any necessary schedule adjustments in our second quarter 10-Q. 
Let's move on to an update on the construction set of the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Construction on Units 3 and 4 remains on track, and productivity continues to improve as Westinghouse has effectively leveraged the construction expertise of its subcontractor, Fluor. The contractor has reaffirmed its confidence in the schedule, and several new work fronts have been established, with many critical areas implementing 24-hour coverage of craft labor to maintain the productivity momentum. The nuclear island containment building, with all 6 major modules now installed, remains the critical path for Unit 3 construction. We expect the remainder of the year to include a number of major milestones for Unit 3, including the setting of ring 2 on the containment vessel, placement of the reactor vessel and initial energization. 
Meanwhile, Unit 4 is progressing especially well, with the lessons learned from Unit 3, and have resulted in measurable productivity improvements. 
Early on, we highlighted the NRC's ITACC process, which stands for inspection, test, analysis and acceptance criteria, as an area of key focus for the project. We began submitting ITACC closure notices to the NRC in 2015, and the pace will more than triple in 2016. Thus far, this process is right on track, and all indications are that the NRC has done everything necessary to prepare to support this effort going forward. 
On the regulatory front, we expect the vote on VCM 14 in August, and the filing of VCM 15 shortly thereafter. The prudence process is ongoing with Georgia Power and the PSC staff expected to report to the Georgia Public Service Commission by mid-October. 
I'll now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic overview."

As you can see from the materials released this morning, we had solid results for the second quarter of 2016, earning $0.68 per share, compared to $0.69 per share in the second quarter of 2015.

As you can see from the materials released this morning, we had solid results for the second quarter of 2016, earning $0.68 per share, compared to $0.69 per share in the second quarter of 2015. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, we earned $1.21 a share compared with $1.25 a share for the same period in 2015. Excluding certain adjustments listed in the earnings materials, earnings for the second quarter of 2016 and the 6-month period ended June 30, 2016 were $0.77 and $1.35 per share, respectively. This compares with $0.71 per share and $1.28 per share for the same periods in 2015. Major earnings drivers for the second quarter of 2016 included retail revenue effects at Southern Company's traditional operating companies and lower nonfuel operating and maintenance costs, offset by lower usage across all customer classes, higher depreciation in amortization expense and higher interest expense. 
Southern Power also contributed positively year-over-year as a result of anticipated benefits from renewables projects expected to be in service in 2016 and increased revenues from renewable projects previously placed in service in 2015, and in the first half of 2016. 
Moving now to an economic and sales review of the second quarter. U.S. economy continues to expand at a moderate pace. The service sectors are generally doing well, driven by strong consumer spending and a relatively robust labor market. Real GDP rose 1.1% in the first quarter of this year, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's current forecast for real GDP growth in 2016 is 2.4%. Overall, market fundamentals are positive and job gains remain fairly robust. 
Total weather-adjusted retail sales are down 1.4% in the second quarter of 2016 versus the second quarter of 2015, and down 0.5% year-to-date. A combination of shifting economics and the replacement of old equipment with more energy-efficient devices and appliances appears to be negatively impacting usage in our residential and commercial customer classes, outweighing positive economic trends. The manufacturing sector remains challenged by global headwinds, including the strength of the U.S. dollar and volatility and commodity prices, which have hit energy-related industries especially hard. Also, worldwide event risk appears to be inhibiting major commitments of capital by many industrial customers. 
Weather-adjusted residential sales declined 0.2% in the second quarter of 2016 but are up 0.6% year-to-date. Residential sales growth continues to be driven by strong customer growth exceeding both expectations and actual growth in recent years. Conversely, residential use per customer is constrained by a higher influx of multifamily construction as well as the replacement of old equipment with newer and more energy-efficient devices and appliances. 
Weather-adjusted commercial sales declined 1.9% in the second quarter of 2016 after 5 consecutive quarters of positive growth, and are down 0.6% year-to-date. Year to date, we've added 3,300 new commercial customers versus 2,300 at this same juncture in 2015. These healthy customer growth trends are running counter to decreased energy demand related to e-commerce growth and lighting retrofit -- retrofits utilizing LED technologies. 
Industrial sales declined 1.9% in the second quarter of this year and are down 1.5% year-to-date. Sales continue to be negatively influenced by stagnant global demand weaker, albeit, recovering energy prices and a strong dollar. We are encouraged, however, by a variety of positive indicators. Manufacturing employment in the Southeast continues to outpace the rest of the nation, with manufacturing employment up 1.4% year-over-year. The ISM manufacturing index has risen in 5 of the past 6 months, jumping to 53.2 in June, the highest since February of 2015. 
Our stone, clay and glass and lumber segments continue to outperform compared to 2015 on a year-to-date basis as these segments continue to benefit from the housing recovery in our region. Economic development activity remains fairly robust, with a 166% increase in new jobs announced year-to-date and healthy capital spending across our region. The pipeline of active projects is on pace with 2015. However, despite an increase in the number of prospective jobs, potential investment seems to be slowing. Political and economic uncertainty, both domestic and abroad, along with the continued strength of the dollar appear to be hindering business investment decisions in both the industrial and commercial sectors. As we stated before, we remain encouraged that the geographic region we serve continues to attract businesses that are seeking well-established transportation networks, lower cost of living, a capable workforce, an attractive climate and low-cost energy. We believe all of these factors continue to merit cautious optimism. 
Before turning the call back to Tom, I want to briefly cover a few final items. First, our earnings estimate for the third quarter. We estimate that Southern Company will earn $1.16 per share in the third quarter of 2016, excluding any impact from Southern Company Gas and the related acquisition debt costs, as well as our investment in SONAT and the related financing cost. 
Earlier, Tom addressed the continued success of Southern Power has had in developing its project pipeline in 2016. Because of that success, we are updating our forecast for Southern Power capital expenditures for 2016, including $500 million of placeholders for additional projects. Of the capital investments identified thus far in 2016, $2.5 billion is for solar projects and, consistent with our pivot toward wind, $1.4 billion is for wind projects. In total, we are increasing our 2016 Southern Power capital expenditures to $4.5 billion, an increase of about $2.1 billion. Most of this increase supports projects that will contribute to income in 2017 and beyond, and have the effect of strengthening and lengthening our growth rate. The 2016 capital investments update also includes expected capital expenditures of $800 million for Southern Company Gas in the second half of the year and approximately $1.5 billion for our investment in SONAT. 
Finally, I want to provide an update on our financing plan. In the second quarter of 2016, Southern Company successfully completed a $900 million equity offering and $8.5 billion debt offering at the parent company, the largest ever for a utility, and issued EUR 1.1 million of bonds of euro-denominated green bonds at Southern Power. 
Our updated financing plan for the remainder of 2016 now reflects incremental financing activity, largely to support our increased level of investments at Southern Power, as well as our investment in SONAT. It is also designed to be supportive of both our long-term growth and credit quality objectives. 
Our equity needs for the remainder of 2016 total approximately $2 billion. While a portion of this equity will be funded through our existing plans, our projected needs exceed the typical capacity of these plans. Southern Company is committed to maintaining a high degree of financial integrity, and our financing plans are intended to support our current credit profile. 
At this point, I'll turn the call back to Tom for his closing remarks."

We are extremely proud of our recent successes, and we're excited about how Southern Company continues to grow for the future. In recognition of this evolution, we recently unveiled a new brand and logo to better represent our focus on building the future of energy. 
Meanwhile, as we execute on our strategy and expand opportunities for future growth, we continue to maintain a concerted focus on preserving the company's risk profile. As Art mentioned just a moment ago, our long-term objective with each incremental investment opportunity is to strengthen and lengthen our growth profile, which is supportive of our goal to provide superior, long-term, risk-adjusted returns to our investors. 
We plan to host an Analyst Day on October 31, in New York City, in lieu of our third quarter earnings call. This will be an opportunity to share our stories, provide further insights into our growth drivers, provide outlooks and supporting details inclusive of our new subsidiaries and, importantly, provide access to a broader cross section of the Southern Company management team, which, I believe, is the best and deepest bench in the industry. Our Investor Relations team will provide more details on this event before the end of August.

I'd said in the meeting last week with them, last week, last Thursday. And if this -- we're seeing in the Southeast, the plus side, is more expansion, more in-migration than we have seen in the past, more than our budget and more job creation. And so that side of the ledger looks pretty good. When you look at usage, it looks a little worse. The net effect is kind of flat. The usage accounts could really, at the residential level, it could really speak to 2 things going on, and the Fed has been wrestling with this one as well. Savings rates are up. So people aren't necessarily taking improvements in their household income statements as a result of lower gasoline prices, for example, and going out and spending it. Maybe that's not so surprising coming out of a recession. The other one is, greater penetration of energy efficiency. Outweighing that is, people's kind of diving into more of the digital economy, more devices, more whatever. Anyway, the net effect of all that right now is flat. Commercial, same deal. We are up on customers, Art went through the numbers. We think that is energy efficiency. And that could be LEDs, it could be more efficient HVAC or whatever. And you want to know what that goes to, Steve? Our response to that is really PowerSecure. That is, we think, technology is enabling, and customers are asking for this notion of making, moving and selling on their own premise. In fact, they're obviating in many respects the importance of the meter. And so our response to that has been, number one, we want to do what's good for our customers and work for energy efficiency and every one of our companies has projects and programs and all that. But we want to start getting share there, and that's what PowerSecure is all about. And if you look at our some very successful segments that may apply, it would be in the military and some areas related to that. Industrial is a different kettle of fish.

And if you look at the broad data, it appears that starting some time in the second quarter, maybe beginning in the first, industrial companies started really pulling back on capital deployment. When I was on Bloomberg this morning, they talked about, in many broad measures, how durable goods just fell off the table. It looks as if that is kind of event-related, whether it is more worries about economic malaise in Europe, Brexit, terrorism, lack of transparency out of China, whether it looks like the dollar versus other worldwide currencies, whether it's uncertainty about our own political process, it looks as if capital commitments by big industrials has really fallen off. I'd give you a quick data point. A number of our economic development projects is about the same. The number of jobs is about the same, within 5%. But the number of forward-looking capital commitments of our economic development backlog is down about 50%. At least it is for now. We don't think those are cancellations, we think those are deferrals. One other point on industrial. We have seen many of our major customers now start to consider consolidation. That may inure to our benefit, if they consolidate away from higher-priced places in the United States to the Southeast, we'll see. The other place we've seen that is in extended outages and perhaps more comprehensive outages. They're going to take the outages anyway. They're going to take them longer and do more during this period of uncertainty. That's what we think is behind the industrial numbers."

I think I mentioned in the script that we had 4 or 5 quarters of growth on the commercial, and this was the first drop we've seen in that in quite a while. We had a very strong second quarter in '15 in commercial sales. So you're comparing year-over-year to a very strong growth rate a year ago. So we're looking into that. When we look at the number of commercial customers we have, and there's almost 600,000 of them, it's hard to get a beat on exactly what every customer might be doing. But there are segments of offices and data centers where we're seeing drops in load, and we're not quite sure whether that's -- they're raising temperatures in their server rooms or whether they're actually moving data centers out of our territory to other facilities. So we're doing -- we're still doing research on that in order to get a better beat on what's going on."

It may be that by the end of the year, just given the demand, and coal was starting to run a little bit more, we could see gas drop down into the very high 40s and coal pick up just a bit. But what remains is that we are one of the nation's most important consumers of natural gas, whether it's through our pipes or whether it's being consumed in our electric generation facilities. One of the great advantages and one of the synergies of the deal really goes to the excellent capability of the folks at AGL -- formerly AGL Resources. And so we're looking to see what are the different things we can do to keep prices as low to our customers as they possibly can be, and we're working through all those synergies now. An idea we've had forever has been this rate-basing of gas. It never has risen high enough on the priority list of our Commissions to really make a big push on it.

There is a whole kind of storyline around the challenges that the contractor group was facing. Cutting out the litigation and the overhang that produced with the settlement, at the same time Westinghouse buying away this piece of the business from CBI, gives clarity to who's in charge, and then replacing CBI with Fluor has all inured to everyone's benefit. One of the things now that we have been able to do with Fluor on-site, with Westinghouse firmly in charge, is move to this full 24-hour coverage. One of the things we're doing is adding more craft labor to the site to be able to hit the productivity curves that we need to do. We expect to prove those things in the next quarter and months ahead. That is going to be the key to hitting our schedule. The other thing is we have put in place, in the new contract with Westinghouse, incentive for meeting the fuel load as well as payment milestones for cash payments to Westinghouse and then ultimately, to Fluor from us anyway. So really, to Westinghouse, that's all we care about. So there's a whole range of commercial incentives in place for that to happen. We think we're making terrific progress. We're very happy.

One last point, I know I'd go on, but I can't make this point enough. For all the schedule changes and all the costs associated with the schedule changes, the benefits to customers have overwhelmed those costs. And when that thing was originally ordered by the Commission, it was going to be a 12% price increase. Now we think because the benefits have overwhelmed the costs even with the schedule changes, we think that the price impact will not be 12%, it will be between 6% and 6.5%.

We've tried to make those along the way. But I think our processes have been proving themselves to be very valuable. So we want to get to a point to demonstrate to the Commission. On a sustained basis, there is no clear criteria between us and the Commission as to what that is just yet. So we will develop that over time, and we're in conversation with the Commission and the staff as to what that might be. At the end of the day, getting this done right is what's most important.

Now how likely we are to get 60% to 70% average for the first year of operation, that's a whole different number. And I think one of the things that it just let us handle, maybe we can give you a better answer in October, but there's an understanding between us and the Commission as to what is the ramp-up of performance. If you go back to many of the supercritical units in America, when you look at introducing new nuclear plants, there are always opportunities to improve performance and reliability and capacity factor over time. You don't hit full speed right away. We'll share with you some of that, but I wouldn't expect 70% out of the gate. We need 70% to demonstrate, but then we'll take it down and fix and bring it back.

I met recently with Maria Cantwell and Lisa Murkowski, 2 terrific senators from both different sides of the aisle. I think they've been able to advance some important legislation. We've always had great leadership out of the House. Fred Upton, Ed Whitfield. I think we'll continue to get good leadership there. I really believe energy policy is something that we can come together on and make improvements. Is it everything we want? No, probably not. But is it making good progress? Yes, I think it is. With respect to the administration in place, the Obama administration, certainly under the leadership of Secretary Moniz, who without blowing smoke at him, I really believe he's been the best energy secretary America has ever had. Very practical, very focused on providing, in all of the above, energy solution for America. We have this unassailable advantage to drive the economy relative to any other economy in the world, and I think we need to take advantage of it.

120623,372921843,1014351,"Southern Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","The Southern Company","Executives","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. This is an extraordinary time for Southern Company. In addition to our better-than-expected financial results for the quarter, we've had several ma",1068,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. 
This is an extraordinary time for Southern Company. In addition to our better-than-expected financial results for the quarter, we've had several major accomplishments over the past several months. I'd like to first discuss our business development activities, which are enhancing our low-risk, attractive-return business model. 
As you know, we completed our merger with AGL Resources on July 1, and subsequently renamed them Southern Company Gas. This acquisition was our first major step in a broader strategy to further expand our business in a meaningful way across the energy value chain. We purchased a gas infrastructure company with high growth projections at a great price and in the process, retained a top-notch natural gas management team. The regulatory approval process was constructive and uneventful. We were able to close the transaction faster and at a lower cost, including our debt and equity financing, than we originally expected. Southern Company Gas is a great addition to our company and should contribute positively towards fulfilling our shareholder value proposition for a very long time. 
Shortly after closing the Southern Company Gas transaction, we announced a strategic venture with Kinder Morgan, in which we agreed to purchase a 50% equity interest in the Southern Natural Gas Pipeline System. Subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino review, we anticipate the transaction will be completed by the late third quarter or early fourth quarter of this year. This is precisely the type of natural gas infrastructure strategy we've discussed for almost 2 years, and we view this venture as an ideal complement to the newly expanded Southern Company. With natural gas being one of the United States' dominant energy solutions for the future, the industrial logic of this transaction is completely clear, and there's hopefully more to come. Kinder Morgan is a recognized leader in natural gas pipeline development. Our 2 companies have identified a variety of specific growth opportunities, which we expect to benefit both customers and investors. As those opportunities come to fruition, we will update you on their details. 
Earlier in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of PowerSecure, a company known for its proprietary distributed infrastructure expertise. PowerSecure has a national footprint and continues to grow rapidly and expand its high-profile customer roster. We are impressed with the way in which PowerSecure is deploying its proprietary technology and innovative customer-focused solutions to strengthen an already stellar reputation. This business is a way to play offense in the energy efficiency/distributed infrastructure sector, extending our customer-focused business model beyond the meter.
Lastly, I'd like to highlight Southern Power's most recent successes. In our first quarter earnings call, we shared our belief that the potential pipeline for renewable projects was larger than originally anticipated. Since then, Southern Power has continued to find value-accretive renewable projects that benefit 2016 and beyond. Already this year, Southern Power has announced 278 megawatts of new solar projects and 43 megawatts of new wind projects. And we anticipate more to come. 
Art will highlight 2016 CapEx expectations in just a few minutes, but I want to reinforce 2 points we've made before. First, in the years ahead, we expect to pivot to a greater focus on wind projects, with the reemergence of gas projects within the next few years. Second, much of the additional growth capital this year will be invested to bring us growth in 2017 and beyond. 
Let's turn now to an update on our major construction projects. First, the Kemper IGCC. Almost 2 weeks ago, we achieved our most significant milestone to date, with the first lignite feed and the production of syngas on gasifier B. This was a major accomplishment. This first production of syngas involved the operation of the front end of the plant, which includes many first-of-a-kind components related to TRIG gasification technology. This milestone is significant as it validates the TRIG technology at a commercial scale. We've also proven the back end of the plant, the combined-cycle units currently operating reliably on natural gas. Significant testing activities are in progress and are scheduled to continue over the coming days, leading to the initial production of electricity using syngas in combustion turbine B expected towards the end of next week. Accomplishing this next milestone will likely present challenges as the plant's 14 operational systems must be integrated for the first time. 
We have previously disclosed that both Units A and B of the facility are expected to be fully integrated and in-service by the end of September. We're closely monitoring these next critical steps in the start of schedule and we expect to learn a lot. We'll reflect any necessary schedule adjustments in our second quarter 10-Q. 
Let's move on to an update on the construction setup of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Construction on Units 3 and 4 remains on track, and productivity continues to improve as Westinghouse has effectively leveraged their construction expertise of its subcontractor, Fluor. The contractor has reaffirmed its confidence in the schedule, and several new work fronts have been established, with many critical areas implementing 24-hour coverage of craft labor to maintain the productivity momentum. The nuclear island containment building, with all 6 major modules now installed, remains the critical path for Unit 3 construction. We expect the remainder of the year to include a number of major milestones for Unit 3, including the setting of ring 2 on the containment vessel, placement of the reactor vessel and initial energization. 
Meanwhile, Unit 4 is progressing especially well, with the lessons learned from Unit 3, and have resulted in measurable productivity improvements. 
Early on, we highlighted the NRC's ITAAC process, which stands for inspection, test, analysis and acceptance criteria, as an area of key focus for the project. We began submitting ITAAC closure notices to the NRC in 2015, and the pace will more than triple in 2016. Thus far, this process is right on track, and all indications are that the NRC has done everything necessary to prepare to support this effort going forward. 
On the regulatory front, we expect the vote on VCM 14 in August, and the filing of VCM 15 shortly thereafter. The prudence process is ongoing with Georgia Power and the PSC staff expected to report to the Georgia Public Service Commission by mid-October. 
I'll now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic overview."

As you can see from the materials released this morning, we had solid results for the second quarter of 2016, earning $0.68 per share, compared to $0.69 per share in the second quarter of 2015. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, we earned",1131,"Thanks, Tom. As you can see from the materials released this morning, we had solid results for the second quarter of 2016, earning $0.68 per share, compared to $0.69 per share in the second quarter of 2015. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, we earned $1.21 a share compared with $1.25 a share for the same period in 2015. Excluding certain adjustments listed in the earnings materials, earnings for the second quarter of 2016 and the 6-month period ended June 30, 2016, were $0.77 and $1.35 per share, respectively. This compares with $0.71 per share and $1.28 per share for the same periods in 2015. Major earnings drivers for the second quarter of 2016 included retail revenue effects at Southern Company's traditional operating companies and lower nonfuel operating and maintenance costs, offset by lower usage across all customer classes, higher depreciation in amortization expense and higher interest expense. 
Southern Power also contributed positively year-over-year as a result of anticipated benefits from renewables projects expected to be in service in 2016 and increased revenues from renewable projects previously placed in service in 2015, and in the first half of 2016. 
Moving now to an economic and sales review of the second quarter. U.S. economy continues to expand at a moderate pace. The service sectors are generally doing well, driven by strong consumer spending and a relatively robust labor market. Real GDP rose 1.1% in the first quarter of this year, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's current forecast for real GDP growth in 2016 is 2.4%. Overall, market fundamentals are positive and job gains remain fairly robust. 
Total weather-adjusted retail sales are down 1.4% in the second quarter of 2016 versus the second quarter of 2015, and down 0.5% year-to-date. A combination of shifting economics and the replacement of old equipment with more energy-efficient devices and appliances appears to be negatively impacting usage in our residential and commercial customer classes, outweighing positive economic trends. The manufacturing sector remains challenged by global headwinds, including the strength of the U.S. dollar and volatility and commodity prices, which have hit energy-related industries especially hard. Also, worldwide event risk appears to be inhibiting major commitments of capital by many industrial customers. 
Weather-adjusted residential sales declined 0.2% in the second quarter of 2016 but are up 0.6% year-to-date. Residential sales growth continues to be driven by strong customer growth exceeding both expectations and actual growth in recent years. Conversely, residential use per customer is constrained by a higher influx of multifamily construction as well as the replacement of old equipment with newer and more energy-efficient devices and appliances. 
Weather-adjusted commercial sales declined 1.9% in the second quarter of 2016 after 5 consecutive quarters of positive growth, and are down 0.6% year-to-date. Year-to-date, we've added 3,300 new commercial customers versus 2,300 at this same juncture in 2015. These healthy customer growth trends are running counter to decreased energy demand related to e-commerce growth and lighting retrofit -- retrofits utilizing LED technologies. 
Industrial sales declined 1.9% in the second quarter of this year and are down 1.5% year-to-date. Sales continue to be negatively influenced by stagnant global demand; weaker, albeit, recovering energy prices; and a strong dollar. We are encouraged, however, by a variety of positive indicators. Manufacturing employment in the Southeast continues to outpace the rest of the nation, with manufacturing employment up 1.4% year-over-year. The ISM manufacturing index has risen in 5 of the past 6 months, jumping to 53.2 in June, the highest since February of 2015. 
Our stone, clay and glass and lumber segments continue to outperform compared to 2015 on a year-to-date basis as these segments continue to benefit from the housing recovery in our region. Economic development activity remains fairly robust, with a 166% increase in new jobs announced year-to-date and healthy capital spending across our region. The pipeline of active projects is on pace with 2015. However, despite an increase in the number of prospective jobs, potential investment seems to be slowing. Political and economic uncertainty, both domestic and abroad, along with the continued strength of the dollar, appear to be hindering business investment decisions in both the industrial and commercial sectors. As we stated before, we remain encouraged that the geographic region we serve continues to attract businesses that are seeking well-established transportation networks, lower cost of living, a capable workforce, an attractive climate and low-cost energy. We believe all of these factors continue to merit cautious optimism. 
Before turning the call back to Tom, I want to briefly cover a few final items. First, our earnings estimate for the third quarter. We estimate that Southern Company will earn $1.16 per share in the third quarter of 2016, excluding any impact from Southern Company Gas and the related acquisition debt costs, as well as our investment in SONAT and the related financing cost. 
Earlier, Tom addressed the continued success that Southern Power has had in developing its project pipeline in 2016. Because of that success, we are updating our forecast for Southern Power capital expenditures for 2016, including $500 million of placeholders for additional projects. Of the capital investments identified thus far in 2016, $2.5 billion is for solar projects and, consistent with our pivot toward wind, $1.4 billion is for wind projects. In total, we are increasing our 2016 Southern Power capital expenditures to $4.5 billion, an increase of about $2.1 billion. Most of this increase supports projects that will contribute to income in 2017 and beyond, and have the effect of strengthening and lengthening our growth rate. The 2016 capital investments update also includes expected capital expenditures of $800 million for Southern Company Gas in the second half of the year and approximately $1.5 billion for our investment in SONAT. 
Finally, I want to provide an update on our financing plan. In the second quarter of 2016, Southern Company successfully completed a $900 million equity offering and $8.5 billion debt offering at the parent company, the largest ever for a utility, and issued EUR 1.1 million of bonds of euro-denominated green bonds at Southern Power. 
Our updated financing plan for the remainder of 2016 now reflects incremental financing activity, largely to support our increased level of investments at Southern Power, as well as our investment in SONAT. It is also designed to be supportive of both our long-term growth and credit quality objectives. 
Our equity needs for the remainder of 2016 total approximately $2 billion. While a portion of this equity will be funded through our existing plans, our projected needs exceed the typical capacity of these plans. Southern Company is committed to maintaining a high degree of financial integrity, and our financing plans are intended to support our current credit profile. 
At this point, I'll turn the call back to Tom for his closing remarks."

We are extremely proud of our recent successes, and we're excited about how Southern Company continues to grow for the future. In recognition of this evolution, we recently unveiled a new brand and logo to better represent our focus on building the future of energy. 
Meanwhile, as we execute on our strategy and expand opportunities for future growth, we continue to maintain a concerted focus on preserving the company's risk profile. As Art mentioned just a moment ago, our long-term objective with each incremental investment opportunity is to strengthen and lengthen our growth profile, which is supportive of our goal to provide superior, long-term, risk-adjusted returns to our investors. 
We plan to host an Analyst Day on October 31, in New York City, in lieu of our third quarter earnings call. This will be an opportunity to share our stories, provide further insights into our growth drivers, provide outlooks and supporting details inclusive of our new subsidiaries and, importantly, provide access to a broader cross section of the Southern Company management team, which, I believe, is the best and deepest bench in the industry. Our Investor Relations team will provide more details on this event before the end of August.

I don't know, we'll double team it, but it is almost exactly what the Fed is talking about. Our data is matching them almost exactly, very interesting. I just had the meeting last week with them, last week, last Thursday. And if this -- what we're seeing in the Southeast, the plus side, is more expansion, more in-migration than we have seen in the past, more than our budget and more job creation. And so that side of the ledger looks pretty good. When you look at usage, it looks a little worse. The net effect is kind of flat. The usage accounts could really, at the residential level, it could really speak to 2 things going on, and the Fed has been wrestling with this one as well. Savings rates are up. So people aren't necessarily taking improvements in their household income statements as a result of lower gasoline prices, for example, and going out and spending it. Maybe that's not so surprising coming out of a recession. The other one is, greater penetration of energy efficiency. Outweighing that is people kind of diving into more of the digital economy, more devices, more whatever. Anyway, the net effect of all that right now is flat. Commercial, same deal. We are up on customers, Art went through the numbers. We think that is energy efficiency. And that could be LEDs, it could be more efficient HVAC or whatever. And you want to know what that goes to, Steve? Our response to that is really PowerSecure. That is, we think, technology is enabling, and customers are asking for this notion of making, moving and selling on their own premise. In fact, they're obviating in many respects the importance of the meter. And so our response to that has been, number one, we want to do what's good for our customers and work for energy efficiency and every one of our companies has projects and programs and all that. But we want to start getting share there, and that's what PowerSecure is all about. And if you look at some very successful segments that may apply, it would be in the military and some areas related to that. Industrial is a different kettle of fish.

And if you look at the broad data, it appears that starting sometime in the second quarter, maybe beginning in the first, industrial companies started really pulling back on capital deployment. When I was on Bloomberg this morning, they talked about in many broad measures, how durable goods just fell off the table. It looks as if that is kind of event-related, whether it is more worries about economic malaise in Europe, Brexit, terrorism, lack of transparency out of China, whether it looks like the dollar versus other worldwide currencies, whether it's uncertainty about our own political process, it looks as if capital commitment by big industrials has really fallen off. I'll give you a quick data point. A number of our economic development projects is about the same. The number of jobs is about the same, within 5%. But the number of forward-looking capital commitments of our economic development backlog is down about 50%. At least it is for now. We don't think those are cancellations, we think those are deferrals. One other point on industrial. We have seen many of our major customers now start to consider consolidation. That may inure to our benefit. If they consolidate away from higher price places in the United States to the Southeast, we'll see. The other place we've seen that is in extended outages and perhaps more comprehensive outages. They were going to take the outages anyway. They're going to take them longer and do more during this period of uncertainty. That's what we think is behind the industrial numbers."

Vogtle 3 has been going fine. Vogtle 4 is going a little better than expected because of what we've learned on 3, especially if you look at a balanced plan and a variety of other things. Recall, B jumped ahead of A, and we made the adjustment in the schedule really because of the prolonged refractory work on A. Remember, that was the first one out of the chute on the fluidization trials. We learned that, adjusted on B, and bam, B just has jumped ahead and been doing great. So I guess the last point I just want to make on that, really, Paul, to your question goes to, when we talk about delivering electricity out of B and then ultimately delivering electricity out of A, that really isn't good enough to declare COD.

What is interesting to me is what the full year in '17 will look like, how we're going to assumingly get through FTC and a variety of regulatory approvals, get SONAT, integrated into that.

So right now, I guess, year-to-date, we're 50% of our energy produced from natural gas, and I don't know, 28%, 27% from coal. With all the loads we're having now, those numbers are going to converge a bit. It may be that by the end of the year, just given the demand, and coal was starting to run a little bit more, we could see gas drop down into the very high 40s and coal pick up just a bit. But what remains is that we are one of the nation's most important consumers of natural gas, whether it's through our pipes or whether it's being consumed in our electric generation facilities. One of the great advantages and one of the synergies of the deal really goes to the excellent capability of the folks at AGL -- formerly AGL Resources. And so we're looking to see what are the different things we can do to keep prices as low to our customers as they possibly can be, and we're working through all those synergies now. An idea we've had forever has been this rate-basing of gas. It never has risen high enough on the priority list of our Commissions to really make a big push on it. If it becomes attractive, we certainly talk about it. If it becomes attractive enough, we'll certainly pursue it."

And you all -- well, you all -- we all were aware of some of the challenges that CBI was having, the hangover on litigation, the cash issues that CBI had. There was a whole kind of storyline around the challenges that the contractor group was facing. Cutting out the litigation and the overhang that produced with the settlement, at the same time Westinghouse buying away this piece of the business from CBI, gives clarity to who's in charge, and then replacing CBI with Fluor has all inured to everyone's benefit. One of the things now that we have been able to do with Fluor on-site, with Westinghouse firmly in charge, is move to this full 24-hour coverage. One of the things we're doing is adding more craft labor to the site to be able to hit the productivity curves that we need to do. We expect to prove those things in the next quarter and months ahead. That is going to be the key to hitting our schedule. The other thing is we have put in place, in the new contract with Westinghouse, incentive for meeting the fuel load as well as payment milestones for cash payments to Westinghouse and then ultimately, to Fluor from us anyway. So really, to Westinghouse, that's all we care about. So there's a whole range of commercial incentives in place for that to happen. We think we're making terrific progress. We're very happy.

We hear other projects coming to the doorstep, and I think, as a national priority, Congress and the administration and even the new administration, I think, will be supportive in making sure that happens as well as it can. One last point, I know I'd go on, but I can't make this point enough. For all the schedule changes and all the costs associated with the schedule changes, the benefits to customers have overwhelmed those costs. And when that thing was originally ordered by the Commission, it was going to be a 12% price increase. Now we think because the benefits have overwhelmed the costs even with the schedule changes, we think that the price impact will not be 12%, it will be between 6% and 6.5%.

And beyond construction risks, we talked about how a combined cycle unit has 3 pieces that need to be integrated, that this unit was going to -- this plant was going to have about 14, 13 or 14. And one of the challenges we always said was integrating the different systems in this plant. Goodness, that so far we think we've integrated or at least demonstrated maybe 8 of those 14 systems. What's left, and we're going to learn a lot, like I said, in these next 2 weeks, is our ability to integrate successfully the remaining systems in order to produce electricity from syngas out of the combined cycle.

So one of the things as the topic of conversation with the Commission is really what will be the operating performance of the plant through its first 10 years or something like that. And in order to demonstrate the early sustainability, we want to ramp up the production of syngas to about a 60% to 70% capability. Now how likely we are to get 60% to 70% average for the first year of operation, that's a whole different number. And I think one of the things that it just let us handle, maybe we can give you a better answer in October, but there's an understanding between us and the Commission as to what is the ramp-up of performance. If you go back to many of the supercritical units in America, when you look at introducing new nuclear plants, there are always opportunities to improve performance and reliability and capacity factor over time. You don't hit full speed right away. We'll share with you some of that, but I wouldn't expect 70% out of the gate. We need 70% to demonstrate, but then we'll take it down and fix and bring it back.

As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. 
This is an extraordinary time for Southern Company. In addition to our better-than-expected financial results for the quarter, we've had several major accomplishments over the past several months. I'd like to first discuss our business development activities, which are enhancing our low-risk, attractive-return business model. 
As you know, we completed our merger with AGL Resources on July 1, and subsequently renamed them Southern Company Gas. This acquisition was our first major step in a broader strategy to further expand our business in a meaningful way across the energy value chain. We purchased a gas infrastructure company with high growth projections at a great price and in the process, retained a top-notch natural gas management team. The regulatory approval process was constructive and uneventful. We were able to close the transaction faster and at a lower cost, including our debt and equity financing, than we originally expected. Southern Company Gas is a great addition to our company and should contribute positively towards fulfilling our shareholder value proposition for a very long time. 
Shortly after closing the Southern Company Gas transaction, we announced a strategic venture with Kinder Morgan, in which we agreed to purchase a 50% equity interest in the Southern Natural Gas Pipeline System. Subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino review, we anticipate the transaction will be completed by the late third quarter or early fourth quarter of this year. This is precisely the type of natural gas infrastructure strategy we've discussed for almost 2 years, and we view this venture as an ideal complement to the newly expanded Southern Company. With natural gas being one of the United States' dominant energy solutions for the future, the industrial logic of this transaction is completely clear, and there's hopefully more to come. Kinder Morgan is a recognized leader in natural gas pipeline development. Our 2 companies have identified a variety of specific growth opportunities, which we expect to benefit both customers and investors. As those opportunities come to fruition, we will update you on their details. 
Earlier in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of PowerSecure, a company known for its proprietary distributed infrastructure expertise. PowerSecure has a national footprint and continues to grow rapidly and expand its high-profile customer roster. We are impressed with the way in which PowerSecure is deploying its proprietary technology and innovative customer-focused solutions to strengthen an already stellar reputation. This business is a way to play offense in the energy efficiency/distributed infrastructure sector, extending our customer-focused business model beyond the meter.
Lastly, I'd like to highlight Southern Power's most recent successes. In our first quarter earnings call, we shared our belief that the potential pipeline for renewable projects was larger than originally anticipated. Since then, Southern Power has continued to find value-accretive renewable projects that benefit 2016 and beyond. Already this year, Southern Power has announced 278 megawatts of new solar projects and 43 megawatts of new wind projects. And we anticipate more to come. 
Art will highlight 2016 CapEx expectations in just a few minutes, but I want to reinforce 2 points we've made before. First, in the years ahead, we expect to pivot to a greater focus on wind projects, with the reemergence of gas projects within the next few years. Second, much of the additional growth capital this year will be invested to bring us growth in 2017 and beyond. 
Let's turn now to an update on our major construction projects. First, the Kemper IGCC. Almost 2 weeks ago, we achieved our most significant milestone to date, with the first lignite feed and the production of syngas on gasifier B. This was a major accomplishment. This first production of syngas involved the operation of the front end of the plant, which includes many first-of-a-kind components related to TRIG gasification technology. This milestone is significant as it validates the TRIG technology at a commercial scale. We've also proven the back end of the plant, the combined-cycle units currently operating reliably on natural gas. Significant testing activities are in progress and are scheduled to continue over the coming days, leading to the initial production of electricity using syngas in combustion turbine B expected towards the end of next week. Accomplishing this next milestone will likely present challenges as the plant's 14 operational systems must be integrated for the first time. 
We have previously disclosed that both Units A and B of the facility are expected to be fully integrated and in-service by the end of September. We're closely monitoring these next critical steps in the start of schedule and we expect to learn a lot. We'll reflect any necessary schedule adjustments in our second quarter 10-Q. 
Let's move on to an update on the construction setup of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Construction on Units 3 and 4 remains on track, and productivity continues to improve as Westinghouse has effectively leveraged their construction expertise of its subcontractor, Fluor. The contractor has reaffirmed its confidence in the schedule, and several new work fronts have been established, with many critical areas implementing 24-hour coverage of craft labor to maintain the productivity momentum. The nuclear island containment building, with all 6 major modules now installed, remains the critical path for Unit 3 construction. We expect the remainder of the year to include a number of major milestones for Unit 3, including the setting of ring 2 on the containment vessel, placement of the reactor vessel and initial energization. 
Meanwhile, Unit 4 is progressing especially well, with the lessons learned from Unit 3, and have resulted in measurable productivity improvements. 
Early on, we highlighted the NRC's ITAAC process, which stands for inspection, test, analysis and acceptance criteria, as an area of key focus for the project. We began submitting ITAAC closure notices to the NRC in 2015, and the pace will more than triple in 2016. Thus far, this process is right on track, and all indications are that the NRC has done everything necessary to prepare to support this effort going forward. 
On the regulatory front, we expect the vote on VCM 14 in August, and the filing of VCM 15 shortly thereafter. The prudence process is ongoing with Georgia Power and the PSC staff expected to report to the Georgia Public Service Commission by mid-October. 
I'll now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic overview."

As you can see from the materials released this morning, we had solid results for the second quarter of 2016, earning $0.68 per share, compared to $0.69 per share in the second quarter of 2015. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, we earned",1131,"Thanks, Tom. As you can see from the materials released this morning, we had solid results for the second quarter of 2016, earning $0.68 per share, compared to $0.69 per share in the second quarter of 2015. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, we earned $1.21 a share compared with $1.25 a share for the same period in 2015. Excluding certain adjustments listed in the earnings materials, earnings for the second quarter of 2016 and the 6-month period ended June 30, 2016, were $0.77 and $1.35 per share, respectively. This compares with $0.71 per share and $1.28 per share for the same periods in 2015. Major earnings drivers for the second quarter of 2016 included retail revenue effects at Southern Company's traditional operating companies and lower nonfuel operating and maintenance costs, offset by lower usage across all customer classes, higher depreciation in amortization expense and higher interest expense. 
Southern Power also contributed positively year-over-year as a result of anticipated benefits from renewables projects expected to be in service in 2016 and increased revenues from renewable projects previously placed in service in 2015, and in the first half of 2016. 
Moving now to an economic and sales review of the second quarter. U.S. economy continues to expand at a moderate pace. The service sectors are generally doing well, driven by strong consumer spending and a relatively robust labor market. Real GDP rose 1.1% in the first quarter of this year, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's current forecast for real GDP growth in 2016 is 2.4%. Overall, market fundamentals are positive and job gains remain fairly robust. 
Total weather-adjusted retail sales are down 1.4% in the second quarter of 2016 versus the second quarter of 2015, and down 0.5% year-to-date. A combination of shifting economics and the replacement of old equipment with more energy-efficient devices and appliances appears to be negatively impacting usage in our residential and commercial customer classes, outweighing positive economic trends. The manufacturing sector remains challenged by global headwinds, including the strength of the U.S. dollar and volatility and commodity prices, which have hit energy-related industries especially hard. Also, worldwide event risk appears to be inhibiting major commitments of capital by many industrial customers. 
Weather-adjusted residential sales declined 0.2% in the second quarter of 2016 but are up 0.6% year-to-date. Residential sales growth continues to be driven by strong customer growth exceeding both expectations and actual growth in recent years. Conversely, residential use per customer is constrained by a higher influx of multifamily construction as well as the replacement of old equipment with newer and more energy-efficient devices and appliances. 
Weather-adjusted commercial sales declined 1.9% in the second quarter of 2016 after 5 consecutive quarters of positive growth, and are down 0.6% year-to-date. Year-to-date, we've added 3,300 new commercial customers versus 2,300 at this same juncture in 2015. These healthy customer growth trends are running counter to decreased energy demand related to e-commerce growth and lighting retrofit -- retrofits utilizing LED technologies. 
Industrial sales declined 1.9% in the second quarter of this year and are down 1.5% year-to-date. Sales continue to be negatively influenced by stagnant global demand; weaker, albeit, recovering energy prices; and a strong dollar. We are encouraged, however, by a variety of positive indicators. Manufacturing employment in the Southeast continues to outpace the rest of the nation, with manufacturing employment up 1.4% year-over-year. The ISM manufacturing index has risen in 5 of the past 6 months, jumping to 53.2 in June, the highest since February of 2015. 
Our stone, clay and glass and lumber segments continue to outperform compared to 2015 on a year-to-date basis as these segments continue to benefit from the housing recovery in our region. Economic development activity remains fairly robust, with a 166% increase in new jobs announced year-to-date and healthy capital spending across our region. The pipeline of active projects is on pace with 2015. However, despite an increase in the number of prospective jobs, potential investment seems to be slowing. Political and economic uncertainty, both domestic and abroad, along with the continued strength of the dollar, appear to be hindering business investment decisions in both the industrial and commercial sectors. As we stated before, we remain encouraged that the geographic region we serve continues to attract businesses that are seeking well-established transportation networks, lower cost of living, a capable workforce, an attractive climate and low-cost energy. We believe all of these factors continue to merit cautious optimism. 
Before turning the call back to Tom, I want to briefly cover a few final items. First, our earnings estimate for the third quarter. We estimate that Southern Company will earn $1.16 per share in the third quarter of 2016, excluding any impact from Southern Company Gas and the related acquisition debt costs as well as our investment in SONAT and the related financing cost. 
Earlier, Tom addressed the continued success that Southern Power has had in developing its project pipeline in 2016. Because of that success, we are updating our forecast for Southern Power capital expenditures for 2016, including $500 million of placeholders for additional projects. Of the capital investments identified thus far in 2016, $2.5 billion is for solar projects and, consistent with our pivot toward wind, $1.4 billion is for wind projects. In total, we are increasing our 2016 Southern Power capital expenditures to $4.5 billion, an increase of about $2.1 billion. Most of this increase supports projects that will contribute to income in 2017 and beyond, and have the effect of strengthening and lengthening our growth rate. The 2016 capital investments update also includes expected capital expenditures of $800 million for Southern Company Gas in the second half of the year and approximately $1.5 billion for our investment in SONAT. 
Finally, I want to provide an update on our financing plan. In the second quarter of 2016, Southern Company successfully completed a $900 million equity offering and $8.5 billion debt offering at the parent company, the largest ever for a utility, and issued EUR 1.1 million of bonds of euro-denominated green bonds at Southern Power. 
Our updated financing plan for the remainder of 2016 now reflects incremental financing activity, largely to support our increased level of investments at Southern Power as well as our investment in SONAT. It is also designed to be supportive of both our long-term growth and credit quality objectives. 
Our equity needs for the remainder of 2016 total approximately $2 billion. While a portion of this equity will be funded through our existing plans, our projected needs exceed the typical capacity of these plans. Southern Company is committed to maintaining a high degree of financial integrity, and our financing plans are intended to support our current credit profile. 
At this point, I'll turn the call back to Tom for his closing remarks."

I don't know, we'll double team it, but it is almost exactly what the Fed is talking about. Our data is matching them almost exactly, very interesting. I just had the meeting last week with them, last week, last Thursday. And if this -- what we're seeing in the Southeast, the plus side, is more expansion, more in-migration than we have seen in the past, more than our budget and more job creation. And so that side of the ledger looks pretty good. When you look at usage, it looks a little worse. The net effect is kind of flat. The usage accounts could really, at the residential level, it could really speak to 2 things going on, and the Fed has been wrestling with this one as well. Savings rates are up. So people aren't necessarily taking improvements in their household income statements as a result of lower gasoline prices, for example, and going out and spending it. Maybe that's not so surprising coming out of a recession. The other one is, greater penetration of energy efficiency. Outweighing that is people kind of diving into more of the digital economy, more devices, more whatever. Anyway, the net effect of all that right now is flat. Commercial, same deal. We are up on customers, Art went through the numbers. We think that is energy efficiency. And that could be LEDs, it could be more efficient HVAC or whatever. And you want to know what that goes to, Steve? Our response to that is really PowerSecure. That is, we think, technology is enabling, and customers are asking for this notion of making, moving and selling on their own premise. In fact, they're obviating in many respects the importance of the meter. And so our response to that has been, number one, we want to do what's good for our customers and work for energy efficiency and every one of our companies has projects and programs and all that. But we want to start getting share there, and that's what PowerSecure is all about. And if you look at some very successful segments that may apply, it would be in the military and some areas related to that. Industrial is a different kettle of fish. And it pretty -- boy, if you look at the business, Roundtable, if you look at our own surveys with our own important customers, we just got through with your -- I forget what you call it, the sounding board or something."

And if you look at the broad data, it appears that starting sometime in the second quarter, maybe beginning in the first, industrial companies started really pulling back on capital deployment. When I was on Bloomberg this morning, they talked about in many broad measures, how durable goods just fell off the table. It looks as if that is kind of event-related, whether it is more worries about economic malaise in Europe, Brexit, terrorism, lack of transparency out of China, whether it looks like the dollar versus other worldwide currencies, whether it's uncertainty about our own political process, it looks as if capital commitment by big industrials has really fallen off. I'll give you a quick data point. A number of our economic development projects is about the same. The number of jobs is about the same, within 5%. But the number of forward-looking capital commitments of our economic development backlog is down about 50%. At least it is for now. We don't think those are cancellations, we think those are deferrals. One other point on industrial. We have seen many of our major customers now start to consider consolidation. That may inure to our benefit. If they consolidate away from higher price places in the United States to the Southeast, we'll see. The other place we've seen that is in extended outages and perhaps more comprehensive outages. They were going to take the outages anyway. They're going to take them longer and do more during this period of uncertainty. That's what we think is behind the industrial numbers."

But there are segments of offices and data centers where we're seeing drops in load, and we're not quite sure whether that's -- they're raising temperatures in their server rooms or whether they're actually moving data centers out of our territory to other facilities.

But what remains is that we are one of the nation's most important consumers of natural gas, whether it's through our pipes or whether it's being consumed in our electric generation facilities. One of the great advantages and one of the synergies of the deal really goes to the excellent capability of the folks at AGL -- formerly AGL Resources. And so we're looking to see what are the different things we can do to keep prices as low to our customers as they possibly can be, and we're working through all those synergies now. An idea we've had forever has been this rate-basing of gas. It never has risen high enough on the priority list of our Commissions to really make a big push on it. If it becomes attractive, we certainly talk about it. If it becomes attractive enough, we'll certainly pursue it."

And you all -- well, you all -- we all were aware of some of the challenges that CBI was having, the hangover on litigation, the cash issues that CBI had. There was a whole kind of storyline around the challenges that the contractor group was facing. Cutting out the litigation and the overhang that produced with the settlement, at the same time Westinghouse buying away this piece of the business from CBI, gives clarity to who's in charge, and then replacing CBI with Fluor has all inured to everyone's benefit. One of the things now that we have been able to do with Fluor on-site, with Westinghouse firmly in charge, is move to this full 24-hour coverage. One of the things we're doing is adding more craft labor to the site to be able to hit the productivity curves that we need to do. We expect to prove those things in the next quarter and months ahead. That is going to be the key to hitting our schedule. The other thing is we have put in place, in the new contract with Westinghouse, incentive for meeting the fuel load as well as payment milestones for cash payments to Westinghouse and then ultimately, to Fluor from us anyway. So really, to Westinghouse, that's all we care about. So there's a whole range of commercial incentives in place for that to happen. We think we're making terrific progress. We're very happy. And the other thing I want you to hear is there's Unit 3, Unit 4 is actually progressing even better. So that one is particularly important to us with respect to the production tax credits on the back end."

There is always ongoing conversations on Capitol Hill about taxes and policy and everything else. I don't think we're at that point yet, certainly in needing that. The administration in place so far and Congress have both been incredibly supportive of this notion of promoting the renaissance of nuclear to America. So, so far, it's Southern and then it's summer. We hear other projects coming to the doorstep, and I think, as a national priority, Congress and the administration and even the new administration, I think, will be supportive in making sure that happens as well as it can. One last point, I know I'd go on, but I can't make this point enough. For all the schedule changes and all the costs associated with the schedule changes, the benefits to customers have overwhelmed those costs. And when that thing was originally ordered by the Commission, it was going to be a 12% price increase. Now we think because the benefits have overwhelmed the costs even with the schedule changes, we think that the price impact will not be 12%, it will be between 6% and 6.5%. Price increases have actually come down over this time frame."

Now how likely we are to get 60% to 70% average for the first year of operation, that's a whole different number. And I think one of the things that it just let us handle, maybe we can give you a better answer in October, but there's an understanding between us and the Commission as to what is the ramp-up of performance. If you go back to many of the supercritical units in America, when you look at introducing new nuclear plants, there are always opportunities to improve performance and reliability and capacity factor over time. You don't hit full speed right away. We'll share with you some of that, but I wouldn't expect 70% out of the gate. We need 70% to demonstrate, but then we'll take it down and fix and bring it back.

Along the way, we keep having these dribs and drabs of extra expenses along the way. One of the things that our guys have developed, some of that is extra O&M, some of it is unexpected capital, some of it has been improvements. And one of the improvements that we have made is the capability to deliver a dual fuel investment here. So we fully expect this thing to be used and useful on synfuel. Okay? But in order to demonstrate the economics to customers, when we're not running on synfuel, we can run on natural gas. And if you believe natural gas prices are going to be cheap for some prolonged period, I'm just willing to bet we can deliver the economics in Mississippi's customers that they thought they were going to get when this thing was ordered. So this dual fuel capability, when we're not running on syngas, is going to be particularly important in the regulatory approval process."

I'll be appearing with Ernie Moniz tomorrow at the Democratic Convention in the morning to talk about energy policy and innovation. Let me just say this, I know I'm an optimistic person. I've walked the halls of Congress. I try not to become bitter and cynical. But you know what? I think energy is one of the areas where we can show bipartisan support. I met recently with Maria Cantwell and Lisa Murkowski, 2 terrific senators from both different sides of the aisle. I think they've been able to advance some important legislation. We've always had great leadership out of the House. Fred Upton, Ed Whitfield. I think we'll continue to get good leadership there. I really believe energy policy is something that we can come together on and make improvements. Is it everything we want? No, probably not. But is it making good progress? Yes, I think it is. With respect to the administration in place, the Obama administration, certainly under the leadership of Secretary Moniz, who without blowing smoke at him, I really believe he's been the best energy secretary America has ever had. Very practical, very focused on providing, in all of the above, energy solution for America. We have this unassailable advantage to drive the economy relative to any other economy in the world, and I think we need to take advantage of it. Now we can get caught up in the politics of what each party's plans are and everything else. But I'll say this, I'm reasonably confident that either administration, whether it's Clinton or Trump, will be good for our industry."
