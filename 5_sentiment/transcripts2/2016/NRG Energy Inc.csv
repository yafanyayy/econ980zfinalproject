Joining me today and covering the financial part of the presentation is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Retail; and Chris Moser, Head of Commercial operations, are available for questions. Let Me also formally welcome Kevin Cole as our new Head of Investor Relations. He's well known by many of you, having spent a number of years in the energy sector on both the buy and sell side. I also want to thank Chad Plotkin for providing transitional support over the past few months and wish him of as he moves on to take other responsibilities within the company.
Before we begin, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and think David Crane for his years of service at NRG. We are grateful for his many contributions to the company for over a decade, and I want to wish him well in his next endeavors.
Today, is my first I'm addressing you as CEO of NRG, so I'm going to deviate slightly from our normal earnings agenda because I want to use this time to not only report by the results of our business, which were exceptional, but also to give you my perspective on the strategic direction of the company and our immediate priorities.
So let's begin on Slide 4, where I have outlined in the queue messages you should take away from today's call. First, as our financial performance has shown a time and time again, we have the right portfolio and the right platform to succeed in this environment. Our business delivers strong results during periods of low prices and importantly, our generation fleet remains significantly levered to our market recovery.
Second, in this environment, we will benefit from having a stronger balance sheet. We have initiated a comprehensive plan to reduce debt, streamline costs and replenish capital. We are proactively doing these to take advantage of market opportunities in the short term so we can benefit from a market recovery in the medium to long run.
Third, in order to afford ourselves maximum flexibility on our capital allocation decisions, we are recalibrating our dividend to be consistent with our capital intensive and cyclical nature of our industry. 
Finally, we are focused on bringing the GreenCo process to a closure that maximizes value for our shareholders. We are reintegrating business renewables back into the NRG platform with no change to our financial guidance and reinforcing our strategic relationship with NRG Yield. We are continuing the sales process of GreenCo and NRG Home Solar.
All of these factions support our objective to continue building and operating the best integrated competitive power company. Now let me elaborate in more detail.
Starting on Slide 6 with the financial performance of our business. I am very pleased to report that we achieved in the upper range of our adjusted EBITDA guidance in 2015 despite the challenging power markets, a company wide restructuring and changes in management. We remain focused on our business, and delivered top quartile safety performance with our retail business having a record year, demonstrating the consistency and value of our integrated platform. So to everyone of my colleagues, job well done.
There are a few points that I want to highlight. We are reaffirming 2016 financial guidance, which now includes our business renewables, our commercial team continues to execute super be mitigated the impact of lower prices for the year. We are off to a good start on our plans to strengthen the balance sheet. Since November, we have retired close to $700 million in high yield debt and significantly discount to par. We are expending these by an additional $925 million of debt reductions, which Kirk will book cover in more detail.
We remain focused in replenishing capital with $500 million in targeted asset sales in 2016, and we are accelerating our cost savings time line. And as I mentioned before and something I will discuss in more detail in a few slides, we are reducing the annual dividend to $0.12 per share from $0.15 per share, which afford us maximum flexibility in our capital allocation program during this market period.
Let me move to the strategic part of the presentation, and provide you my perspective and where NRG is today, and what I believe a separate us from others in our industry. Stakeholders repeatedly tell me that NRG's story and capital structure is too complicated. And that the company suspending too much money in businesses that are outside of our core competencies. I have taken these feedback seriously, and I am here today telling you that simplification of our business is an imperative, both for external perception and internal focus. Efforts are already under way to address this concern. Everything from the way NRG is perceived in this market, to the way we disclose information to the way we run our platform will be greatly simplified over the next several quarters.
Simplification starts with the way that we think about the business. The graphic on the left side of Slide 7 represents our thinking. NRG has and continues to be comprised of 2 main businesses: Generation, inclusive of renewables and retail. That is our focus and there should be no mistake about that. But it is not only these 2 businesses independently that create the most value for NRG. It is the interaction between the 2 through our scalable operating platform. This is truly a case where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The touch points between our generation and retail businesses on their team, the NRG value proposition, a generation fleet that is well diversified in terms of location, merit order and fuel type, minimizing exposure to downturns in any one market, but flexible enough to benefit from scarcity periods like we saw during the polar vortex.
A complementary business model that helps insulate revenues from commodity risk. Today, 2/3 of our economic gross margin comes from sources that are counter or non-correlated to gas like retail, capacity revenues or long-term contracts.  A cash flow machine. Even what has become a very difficult commodity cycle that this enhanced by our ability to replenish capital through NRG Yield. What I believe is not fully appreciated, much to our own doing is the shared and scalable platform that we have built. Our ability to leverage a common platform to grow our business and realize cost synergies in the processes absolutely unique in this industry. And all of these is unique, but later in the presentation, I will explain why I think it is necessary to succeed.
In summary, my view of the business is that it's simple, focused and differentiated within the competitive power space. 
Turning now to Slide 8, I want to take a step back and give you my perspective on the competitive power industry and what I believe it takes to be successful. This industry is currently undergoing a paradigm shift. We are in periods of staying low natural gas prices, low growth that has slowed in most markets except Texas on the Gulf Coast, behind coming on to the grid changing traditional dispatch, market growth are focused on reliability, particularly in the face of retirements, renewables continue to enter the market as regulation focuses on limiting emissions from conventional power.
Being a pure IDP play year is no longer enough to succeed in the market today and definitely not tomorrow.
The company that can successfully navigate all the risks and changes in the competitive power industry is one that is diversified. But only in terms of its generation portfolio, but also in terms of its business lines. It is too easy for any one fuel type or any one business line to experience turmoil or disruption in the current shifting market. 
As I mentioned before, the operational platform has become a value differentiator and to a great extent, a source of incremental revenue. Operational excellence as always nonnegotiable, regardless industry but in ours, building on operational platform that enables economies of scale is even more fundamental. For NRG, these operational platform has become a differentiated means of margin enhancement as complementary businesses intersect, and create opportunities for companies to straddle between markets.
But this is just the foundation. In the competitive power industry, companies need to remain leveraged to the upside by constantly assessing the market and the economic viability of opportunities to grow their businesses in a disciplined manner as markets evolve. For me, this means investing in areas where you can have a competitive advantage. It does not mean trying to be everything to everyone.
Last, I believe in financial discipline needs to be a top priority for companies in our sector. It is not prudent to take a myopic approach to managing the balance sheet and capital allocation. These decisions, mostly made on a portfolio level, looking at all parts of the business and aligning decision-making with current market opportunities. 
So how do we start up against these principles? I have already stressed how pleased I am with the operational execution across the business within NRG. We have made great strides in diversifying our business and revenues to protect us from low natural gas and power prices. At the same time, we remain well positioned for growth, looking for low-cost development opportunities and to monetize assets through our strategic relationship with NRG Yield. These unique attributes position NRG for sustained success in the industry.
As you saw on the earlier slides, we have identified cost control and financial discipline as one of our key opportunities for improvement. While we have already begun a period of cost savings, I still believe we can do more, and I am actively working with the team to uncover new opportunities.
Our other area of focus will be in how we approach capital allocation and how we manage our capital structure. I want to make sure that our capital decisions fit with the current and near-term market cycles. We plan to be transparent in our capital allocation, and there should be no head scratching when it comes to how we deploy capital.
And on that note, our focus right now needs to be on deleveraging the business to ensure we stay ahead of this market cycles so we can take advantage of the opportunities that will result from it. We have already made significant progress, and we will continue to do so until we see market conditions change.
As we just discussed, NRG operates a large and well diversified integrated portfolio with assets that are environmentally well-controlled. while it is important to have a good foundation, there is no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to regional dynamics. On the Slide 9, we outline what I referred to as our go-to-market strategy that reflects each of our region, specific trends and market dynamics. 
In the East region, it's all about reliability or capacity revenues. We are seeing system operators support for capacity products that reward reliability and performance, particularly in the face of retirements and weather events such as the polar vortex. For example, in the first capacity performance auction in PJM, we cleared close to 90% of our fleet and increased capacity revenue by 80% over the next 3 years.
We are about to finish the repositioning of our portfolio to shift our margin mix from energy to capacity via fuel conversions which reduces operating costs significantly and environmental retrofits to maintain a cheap option and key access to capitalize on higher power prices.
In the Gulf, we continue to benefit from our integrated platform in these low-price environment where our retail operation continues to over perform. Let me just say that our retail business in Texas is virtually impossible to replicate due to its scale and linkage with generation. We have demonstrated the value of our retail franchise for the past 7 years, with 2015 being our best year yet. This is a key differentiator of ours and one that we will continue to focus on and grow.
Our generational fleet has the scale and environmental controls needed to sustain this weak price environment where we should see further supply rationalization. At the same time, there is still the potential for the market to self correct and be enhanced by improvements in market structure and peak pricing.
The West region is a story of renewables and distributor resources, and maintaining a capacity fleet that supports the grade given the intermittent nature of these resources. There is a need for a quick start, well-located assets, and that is exactly what NRG has been successful in that market, securing contracted assets and developing sites and favorable locations that can then be monetized through NRG Yield, providing us a long-term dividend payment.
So far, we have developed over 1,800 megawatts of quick-start generation and won nearly 800 [ph] megawatts of repowering at our Carlsbad and Puente sites. We have been successful in growing our renewable and distribute the portfolio, and within reintegration of the renewables group into NRG, this will continue to be a growth area. 
Now turning to Slide 10. We remain focused on streamlining the organization. I am pleased with our efforts in taking close to $350 million in costs out of the system, but I am not satisfied. And we continue to look for more. So today, I am announcing an accelerated time line for our target cost savings of $150 million under our core NRG continuous improvement process, which has yielded so many benefits across the organization over the years. We expect these EBITDA accretive cost savings to be realized through end of 2017.
Additionally, we continue to burn our portfolio to bring incremental capital back into the company. We have executed $138 million in asset sales thus far, and are on track with our $500 million target. Last, we are nearing the completion of our current generation of the modernization program, which reduces our CapEx commitment by nearly $650 million in 2017, providing us additional flexibility of capital allocation in the next 5 years.
Moving on to Slide 11. I know there has been a lot of questions about my perspective on renewables and how these relates to the GreenCo process that we announced late last year. Let me be clear: As the CEO of not only the largest competitive generation owner in the country, but also one of the largest renewable companies, I have recognized that this market represents a significant development opportunity given state renewable targets, customer needs, our competencies and financial incentives and and ti is one in which we must participate. 
However, I am committed to ensuring that our efforts in this area match our skills and capabilities, and are secured in a way that is of value creating to our shareholders. I'm mindful of what has and continues to be a very deliberate process around GreenCo to determine the best way to create value in these business areas. So let me summarize where we are now.
First, from here on out, we will no longer refer to GreenCo in describing our September update call. As we think about the individual business strategies moving forward, it no longer makes sense to group them under 1 headline. Not all renewable businesses are viewed the same in terms of fit and value for NRG. 
Today, I'm announcing the reintegration of our traditional NRG Business. Everything but the utility scales that was never part of the GreenCo process back into the company to ensure we maintain our advantage position and skills to participate in the changing landscape of the power industry.
It is important to recognize that many of our C&I customers expect us to be able to integrate renewables on and off-site. Said it another way, our efforts in renewables will mirror the strengths of our integrated platform.  And when augmented by our partnership with NRG Yield, our renewables business, which is net cash positive on a full year basis, does not require permanent capital from NRG. 
In addition, the reintegration of NRG Renew will not cause any change to our financial guidance. I am also pleased to announce that NRG and NRG Yield have reallocated $50 million in previously committed cash equity from the residential solar partnership to the business renewable partnership. This change reinforces our alignment with NRG Yield with mutual focus in renewable energy development.
Finally, as you will note on the slide, we are in active negotiations around strategic transactions for Home Solar and eVgo, so my comments will be limited. I do expect to complete this process in the second quarter.
Turning onto Slide 12. I want to walk you through our revised approach to the NRG dividend. The dividend was launched in 2012 for several reasons: To better highlight the value of our contracted assets, to enable ownership by dividend restricted income funds and to have yield support. Today, our world looks much different than it did in 2012. We now have a deliberate dividend paying vehicle in NRG Yield to highlight the value of contracted generation, and the extreme volatility in the end of the sector has mitigated our ability to realize yield support.  And so it is our fundamental view that a static dividend approach is not an appropriate use of capital given the deep cyclical nature of our sector. With that, we are reducing the dividend to $0.12 a share from $0.58 a share, or to about 1% yield. 
I want to be crystal-clear that these reductions is not due to balance sheet concerns. It is simply aligning our dividend approach with our broader focus on adaptability, while at the same time, maintaining a differentiated platform that appeals to a broad range of investors and creating shareholder value through all commodities, credit and development cycles.
Moving to Slide 13. This is one of the most important topics of today's call. My core fundamental view on capital allocation is to stay focused on what we want to become. However, given the deep cyclical nature of the sector, we must first ensure the robustness of our balance sheet when deploying capital. We are proactively taking the necessary steps to not only leave no doubt about our strength during this cycle, but also to take advantage of opportunities that arise during market dislocations. Kurt will discuss in more detail the specifics, but I want to offer 3 takeaways: One, the nearing conclusion of our large capital reinvestment program provides us the latitude to effectively harvests strong free cash flows through our asset optimization program, as I believe we have a good line of sight on market prices and environmental requirements, at least through the end of the decade. Next, paying down debt is fundamental, as it assures our equity holders that NRG has the flexibility to create strong returns for them when the market recovers, and it assures our customers in a stronger counterpart. My goal is to create no doubt in the strength of our balance sheet. So at this time, maintaining our current target ratio of 4.25% [ph], 4.8% [ph] to corporate debt to corporate EBITDA gives us ample headroom to our bond covenants, and it is consistent with our credit ratings. Last, I remain committed to returning cash to shareholders when we feel that our capital structure is strong enough to allow for flexibility in the event of a prolonged commodity and capital market downturn. I ask that you don't take our focus on deleveraging in 2016 as an indication that NRG has turned away from returning capital to shareholders. 
Rather, I think of it as assuring that our shareholders can have confidence that NRG will be in a strong position to benefit from opportunities and better market conditions. I will now turn it over to Kurt for the financial review."

Our 2015 results highlight the bene",2112,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. 
Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 15. NRG delivered a total of $3.34 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and $1.127 billion in free cash flow before growth in 2015. Our 2015 results highlight the benefits and resilience of our integrated platform as a low commodity price environment help home retail delivered $739 million in adjusted EBITDA, exceeding our original 2015 guidance of that segment by more than 20%.
Business in Renew achieved $1.881 billion in EBITDA for the year, while NRG Yield, which was aided by robust wind conditions in California late in the fourth quarter, contributed $720 [ph] million.
NRG completed $786 million in drop-downs to NRG Yield in 2015, helping expend capital available for allocation and allowing us to return over $1.3 billion to stakeholders.
$628 million of this capital was returned to shareholders, including the repurchase of approximately 7% of shares outstanding. Having shifted our capital allocation focus late in 2015, since November, and through this past month, NRG has retard approximately $700 million in unsecured debt, including over $400 million at the NRG level and $274 million at GenOn. 
Our reduced unsecured debt balances will also help increase recurring cash flow with over $50 million in annualized interest savings realized so far as a result of these efforts. I'd also like to briefly address 1 element of our 2015 results outside of EBITDA and free cash flow. That is the noncash impairment charges we took in the fourth quarter. 
On an annual basis, with test our long-lived assets and goodwill for potential impairments. Given the prolonged low commodity price outlook, we adjusted our long-term view of power prices which resulted in noncash impairment charge of approximately $5.1 billion. Consisting of a write-down of certain fixed assets as well as goodwill. Due to the lack of robust forward prices in ERCOT, this change that -- charge, rather, it is primarily related to impairments of our 2 coal plants in that market as well as goodwill related to the 2006 acquisition of Texas Genco, of which these 2 coal plants were part. Based on a robust commodity price outlook at the time of the acquisition, we allocated a substantial portion of that Texas Genco purchase price to the coal plants with minimal value allocated to the gas plants. And although since that time, the Texas Genco portfolio has delivered over $8.5 billion of unlevered free cash flow and provided the platform for our expansion into retail with the acquisition of Reliant in 2009, the outlook in the ERCOT market has nonetheless, a shifted stubbly, curly favoring gas over coal. The impairment of our 2 ERCOT coal plants aligns the book value of these assets with their forward cash flow profile as implied by the current market environment. And while the shift in market dynamics also implies the value of our gas portfolio in Texas, now substantially exceeds its book value, as many of you are aware, county rules permit only the write-down of asset book values, and do not permit a write-off.
These impairment charges also resulted in cumulative net income for the prior 3-year period following below the threshold prescribed for evaluation allowance against our net deferred tax asset balance largely associated with NRG's tax NOLs. As a result, our onetime fourth quarter charges also include a $3 billion noncash charge to tax expense resulting from a contra-asset entry on NRG's balance sheet as required under GAAP as a valuation allowance, offsetting our net deferred tax asset balance. That said, this accounting charge has no bearing on our ability to utilize our NOLs against the future taxable income, and we continue to fully expect to do so.
Finally, turning to our 2016 guidance, we are reaffirming our previously announced guidance ranges for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth which is Mauricio indicated earlier, reflect our expectations for consolidated 2016 results, including business renewables, which was previously part of GreenCo. A point of clarification. Business Renewables is NRG's commercial and industrial distributor of solar business. Our utility-scale renewable assets were not part of the GreenCo business previously excluded from our guidance.
Turning to Slide 16. I'd like to briefly summarize our capital allocation progress in 2015, focusing on the NRG level, which excludes cash and capital projects at various excluded subsidiaries, primarily GenOn and NRG Yield. Total NRG-level capital available through 2015 was $1.7 billion as shown on the left of the slide. Capital available to NRG includes 3 components: First, NRG level excess cash at the end of 2014, which is basically cash and cash equivalents less our $700 million minimum cash liquidity reserves, net of any cash collateral posted as of the year end. Second, the portion of our consolidated free cash flow before growth at the NRG level which is in 2015, was just over $800 million; and finally, during 2015, as I mentioned earlier, NRG received $786 [ph] million proceeds from NRG Yield, which comprises the third component of capital available.
And during 2015, NRG level capital located total approximately $1.2 billion, with more than half of that amount to return to our shareholders. Have a shifted our focus late in year toward debt reduction from we ended 2015 by retiring $246 million of the principal across various maturities of NRG's unsecured notes, which significantly expanded the reduction of corporate debt beyond the amortization of our term loan facility. And as I mentioned earlier, we continued that deleveraging process to the first 2 months of the year, which I'll address more comprehensively when we turned to 2016 capital allocation in a moment.
The remaining $320 million was allocated towards growth investments. Importantly, this amount represents a reduction of over $450 million versus our original growth investments forecast for provided on our first quarter 2015 earnings call. At that time, we projected approximately $960 million in consolidated growth investments, with nearly $800 million of that amount expected at the NRG level. Of this reduction in NRG level spend was the result of both the slower pace of Home Solar as well as the elimination of other growth investments.
Turning to our 2016 NRG-level capital allocation plans on Slide 17, and building on the delivering process progress, rather, we've made since November2016, I will see -- in 2016, we'll see a more significant shifts toward further debt reduction, leaving no doubt that our balance sheet strength and credit ratios will remain resilient even if the current low commodity prices continue beyond the current year. We expect approximately $1.5 billion of capital available for allocation at the NRG level in 2016, which again represents excess capital beyond our minimum cash balance reserve for liquidity which is further supplemented by our $2.5 billion credit facility. 2016 capital available for allocation consists of the excess cash balance at the NRG level at year end 2015, plus the midpoint of our NRG-level free cash flow before growth guidance and expected proceeds from drop-downs to NRG Yield of approximately $125 million in 2016. These expected drop-down proceeds consist of the substantial portion of what remains under our residential solar and business renewables, or DG partnerships at NRG Yield, and represents the return of the portion of our 2016 growth investments towards these 2 businesses.
This month, in order to align the size of these 2 partnerships with NRG's strategic priorities, we have reached agreement with NRG Yield to shift the amount of capital between Home Solar and the business renewables partnership. As a result of the Home Solar partnership was reduced by $50 million to $100 million, with a corresponding $50 million increase to the business renewables partnership, reflecting the more robust and reliable pipeline of business renewables, which is now been reintegrated within energy.
We expect to allocate approximately 75% of our 2016 NRG-level capital or over $1 billion towards further debt reduction in 2016. This consist of ongoing term loan amortization as well as over $150 million in NRG corporate debt already retired year-to-date. We plan to supplement this deleveraging in 2 ways: First, we'll allocate $600 million of capital towards NRG debt retirement through open market purchases or tenders; and second, being mindful of our next NRG bond maturity in 2018 [ph] which is now approximately $1 billion [ph] in principal outstanding. And the backdrop of the current dislocation and the high-yield market, we will reserve an additional $325 million toward the retirement of our 2018 notes in connection with that coincident refinancing of the balance when market conditions are more favorable.  While our current priority is to ensure an efficient retirement and refinancing of our 2018 notes. As conditions evolve, we will continue to evaluate the best use of this debt reduction capital and make shoes to allocate different maturities alternative prove more favorable.
In any event, we expect this capital to ultimately be allocated toward corporate debt reduction in order to meaningfully advance our efforts to further strengthen our balance sheet and ensure adherence to our target balance sheet metrics even through an extended low cycle in commodity prices. As Mauricio indicated earlier, we have now adjusted our dividend rate to a level consistent with both our capital allocation priorities and the cyclical and capital intensive nature of our business.  And while the current depressed level of our share price undoubtedly represents that compelling return opportunity, we believe it is prudent to continue our progress in rightsizing corporate debt and strengthening ratios, which will enable us the flexibility to capitalize on value enhancing opportunities for shareholders.
Such opportunities are only made truly compelling by first, ensuring the strength of the balance sheet which supports them. For 2016, we expect just over $300 million of growth investments consisting primarily of our PH Robinson Pico project, Carbon 360, and our commitments for pursuant to the California GB go settlement. During 2016, we are also focused on executing on opportunities to further expand capital available for allocation, including $250 million of nonrecourse financing included as part of our recent announcement last year.
As I indicated in our third quarter call, we are now fully prepared to launch this financing when market conditions are more favorable. In addition, we continue to expect the next utility-scale drop-down effort to NRG Yield remaining stake in CVSR and plan to offer this yield in 2016.
We are currently exploring will field the best means to efficiently finance this drop-down to assist yield in prudently managing its liquidity while continuing to replenish capital to NRG. I expect we'll have more to share with you on the timing and the tenant structure later this year.
And finally, turning to Slide 18, in light of our significantly deleveraging progress and having -- provided an expended look at our 2016 capital allocation plan. I'd like to update the information we provided last quarter regarding NRG's capital structure in 2016 corporate credit metrics. Focusing on recourse debt at the NRG level, which prior to deleveraging, we had expected to be approximately $8.8 billion as of year end 2016. On our third quarter call, we indicated our intention to reduce that debt by at least $500 million. Having completed half of this objective during the fourth quarter alone, we ended 2015 with just over $8.5 billion in recourse debt. Since then in early February, we completed an additional $171 million and that production, as shown on the far right column on the slide. And as a result, based on the midpoint of our guidance and our implied 2016 corporate debt to corporate EBITDA, ratio is already nearly in line with our 4.25% target. However, our goal is to maintain aherence to the target in 2017 and beyond, taking into account the possibilities of sustained low commodity prices. This objective drives our continued focus on further debt reduction over the course of 2016, as I indicated previously in reviewing 2016 capital allocation, we expect to further reduce corporate debt by at least another $600 million this year. Taking that additional deleveraging into account, we are in track to drive corporate debt below $8 billion within of the year, which should place our corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio at approximately 4x.  And finally, factoring on in the effective releasing the $325 million of additional capital, we have clearly reserved the for further reducing our 2018 maturity, that 2016 ratio would be reduced to 3.8x.
One way to consider that number is that, that allows us to maintain adherence to a 4.25 target ratio even if corporate EBITDA were to be reduced by approximately $200 million as a result of sustained low commodity prices. And with that, I'd turn it back over to Mauricio."

Obviously, and that's the core message that you're giving us today. So can you characterize, for instance, free up this incremental drop-down money and nonrecourse financing. How do you think about each incremental dollar for capital allocation going forward, and how do you characterize what you're doing in New England in the context of the message that you're giving us today?"

Let me just start by providing you kind of the general -- my general take on capital allocation and then I'll go into the specifics of it now. As you can see from all the actions that we're taking today, one of my key priorities, the first 90 days of being the CEO was to focus on capital allocation. First, being mindful and aware of the current commodity cycle that we are today, and then second,  the dislocation that we have in our capital markets. It was important to me to afford us the maximum flexibility when deploying capital, and to exert absolute financial discipline. I already talked about the actions that we're taking one, on deleveraging and strengthening our balance sheet and ensuring that we go through these cycle and with a strong position to capitalize on opportunities but importantly, that we're ready when the market turns around. Two, they'll be calibration of the dividend; and then three is the focus on cost savings and streamlining the cost structure of the organization. So when I think about canal, it is not a capital allocation decision for 2016. It's a capital allocation decision that we will make in 2018, and at that point, we will evaluate the current environment and then on that perspective, then we'll make the determination what is the best use of our capital. But I want to make sure that we continue to generating low-cost options at good, good returns given the opportunity that we have to lock for 7 years a very constructive capacity prices. And as I told you in the prepared remarks, our focus in the Northeast and particularly, in New England is focus on capacity revenues. Canal is a dual-fueled peaker that is needed in that market, have good returns and is a capital edition decision that we will make not today where we are focusing all our attention in strengthening the balance sheet, but in 2 years."

We went through a process where we automize that portfolio through fuel conversions and environmental retrofits. So as you know, we have been executing that plan, and this year is the last year of that. What we -- what I expect in the next couple of years is really to have a strong investment. All the market dynamics that we were expecting when we made those investments are playing out, particularly around reliability and capacity, but all 3 North East markets, whether it's PJM through capacity performance, New England and New York, we're moving towards that. We saw that during the polar vortex. We acted upon, and it's playing out the way we thought it was going to play out. Now with respect to other parts of the country, you know that I will exert absolute financial discipline when it comes to the profitability of our assets. If it's not economically viable, we will shut them down just like we have done in the past and just like we're doing today in New York.

But as I've have indicated in my past remarks, various conferences and when once, that order of magnitude is certainly helpful and necessary, but not sufficient in order to bring about rightsizing that balance sheet. We're mindful and certainly we've got some near-term maturities in GenOn. We're focused part and parcel of why we have the deleveraging that we did. And as you saw in -- Mauricio's remarks, rather, we have continuation of our assets and program, which as we've indicated previously, going back to the reset, that's focused on the Northeast, so we'd expect it slightly more likely that, that would probably come out of the GenOn Compex which would enhance liquidity. But as the year progresses, certainly, I would believe 2016 is a key inflection point given those maturities. And we're mindful of the only say, continue to deliver to the open market purchases as we've done before. And we're recognizing that we've got some some secured debt capacity there.

But secondly, when I looked at the current dividend that we have and the underlying premises or principles that we used to implement in 2012, a lot of them are not valid anymore. If you recall, when we announced the dividend back then, it was to highlight the value of contracted assets. Since then, we've created NRG Yield. We already talk about the -- one of the objective was the yield support. And in this current market environment and with a level of volatility that we're seeing in the stocks. It really doesn't accomplish that objective. So when I put the 2 together, one, the nature of our industry and two, some of the principles that we have when we initiated, is just an consistent. I think what you should expect is this number is the right number today. And it affords us the maximum flexibility for capital deployment and capital allocation.

The current market in Texas has been very disappointed despite what I consider, still pretty strong fundamentals, strong demand and a pricing and set of his new build economics even though we have seen some what I consider out of not economical entry. When I look at our portfolio, particularly the Parish life on an STP, they are very large in scale, they're environmentally controlled, and I would say that they're probably one of the most cost advantage based load plants our coal in and nuclear plants in the states. We have identified what we believe is the least competitive assets in the supply stack when it comes to coal. And we believe that if the market continues to be at these levels, it will not be possible to sustain the operation of some of these assets. So that's why I think there is got to be a sublime rationalization in the immediate term, and we should see a recalibration of the market. I feel comfortable right now with 3 of our baseload plants and back I think we have a pretty good track record in terms of if and when these plants are not economic and the prospects of these plants are not positive, we will act upon. And we have done that in other regions, and there is no reason why we wouldn't do it in Texas.

Comprehensively, and this is outside of capital available for allocation, we focus on liquidity separately. So liquidity is that $700 million of minimum cash at the NRG level, plus the 2.5 billion corporate credit facility. That's separate and apart from what we consider excess capital, which is what that $513 million that you referred to represent. Does that help?"

Let me also formally welcome Kevin Cole as our new Head of Investor Relations. He's well known by many of you, having spent a number of years in the energy sector on both the buy and sell side. I also want to thank Chad Plotkin for providing transitional support over the past few months and wish him well of as he moves on to take other responsibilities within the company.
Before we begin, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and think David Crane for his years of service at NRG. We are grateful for his many contributions to the company for over a decade, and I want to wish him well in his next endeavors.
Today, is my first I'm addressing you as CEO of NRG, so I'm going to deviate slightly from our normal earnings agenda because I want to use this time to not only report by the results of our business, which were exceptional, but also to give you my perspective on the strategic direction of the company and our immediate priorities.
So let's begin on Slide 4, where I have outlined in the key messages you should take away from today's call. First, as our financial performance has shown a time and time again, we have the right portfolio and the right platform to succeed in this environment. Our business delivers strong results during periods of low prices, and importantly, our generation fleet remains significantly levered through market recovery.
Second, in this environment, we will benefit from having a stronger balance sheet. We have initiated a comprehensive plan to reduce debt, streamline costs and replenish capital. We are proactively doing these to take advantage of market opportunities in the short term so we can benefit from a market recovery in the medium to long run.
Third, in order to afford ourselves maximum flexibility on our capital allocation decisions, we are recalibrating our dividend to be consistent with the capital-intensive and cyclical nature of our industry. 
Finally, we are focused on bringing the GreenCo process to a closure that maximizes value for our shareholders. We are reintegrating business renewables back into the NRG platform with no change to our financial guidance and reinforcing our strategic relationship with NRG Yield. We are continuing the sales process of eVgo and NRG Home Solar.
All of these actions support our objective to continue building and operating the best integrated competitive power company. Now let me elaborate in more detail.
Starting on Slide 6, with the financial performance of our business. I am very pleased to report that we achieved in the upper range of our adjusted EBITDA guidance in 2015 despite the challenging power markets, a company-wide restructuring and changes in management. We remain focused on our business, and delivered top quartile safety performance with our retail business having a record year, demonstrating the consistency and value of our integrated platform. So to every one of my colleagues, job well done.
There are a few points that I want to highlight. We are reaffirming 2016 financial guidance, which now includes our business renewables. Our commercial team continues to execute superbly and have mitigated the impact of lower prices for the year. We are off to a good start on our plans to strengthen the balance sheet. Since November, we have retired close to $700 million in high-yield debt at a significantly discount to par. We are expanding this by an additional $925 million of debt reductions, which Kirk will cover in more detail.
We remain focused in replenishing capital with $500 million in targeted asset sales in 2016, and we are accelerating our cost savings time line. And as I mentioned before and something I will discuss in more detail in a few slides, we are reducing the annual dividend to $0.12 per share from $0.15 per share, which afford us maximum flexibility in our capital allocation program during this market period.
Let me now move to the strategic part of the presentation, and provide you my perspective on where NRG is today, and what I believe separate us from others in our industry. Stakeholders repeatedly tell me that NRG's story and capital structure is too complicated, that the company is spending too much money on businesses that are outside of its core competencies. I have taken these feedback seriously, and I am here today telling you that simplification of our business is an imperative, both for external perception and internal focus. Efforts are already underway to address this concern. Everything from the way NRG is perceived in the market, to the way we disclose information to the way we run our platform will be greatly simplified over the next several quarters.
Simplification starts with the way that we think about the business. The graphic on the left side of Slide 7 represents our thinking. NRG has and continues to be comprised of 2 main businesses: generation, inclusive of renewables; and retail. That is our focus and there should be no mistake about that. But it is not only these 2 businesses independently that create the most value for NRG. It is the interaction between the 2 through our scalable operating platform. This is truly a case where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The touch points between our generation and retail businesses underpin the NRG value proposition: A generation of fleet that is well diversified in terms of location, merit order and fuel type, minimizing exposure to downturns in any one market, but flexible enough to benefit from scarcity periods like we saw during the polar vortex.
A complementary business model that helps insulate revenues from commodity risk. Today, 2/3 of our economic gross margin comes from sources that are counter or noncorrelated to gas like retail, capacity revenues or long-term contracts.  A cash flow machine. Even in what has become a very difficult commodity cycle that is enhanced by our ability to replenish capital through NRG Yield. What I believe is not fully appreciated, much to our own doing, is the shared and scalable platform that we have built. Our ability to leverage a common platform to grow our business and realize cost synergies in the process is absolutely unique in this industry. And not only is it unique, but later in the presentation, I will explain why I think it is necessary to succeed.
In summary, my view of the business is that it's simple, focused and differentiated within the competitive power space. 
Turning now to Slide 8, I want to take a step back and give you my perspective on the competitive power industry and what I believe it takes to be successful. This industry is currently undergoing a paradigm shift. We are in periods of sustained low natural gas prices; low growth that has flowed in most markets, except Texas on the Gulf Coast; behind-the-meter technologies are coming on to the grid, changing traditional dispatch; market growth are focused on reliability, particularly in the face of retirements; renewables continue to enter the market as regulation focuses on limiting emissions from conventional power.
Being a pure IPP player is no longer enough to succeed in the market today and definitely not tomorrow. The company that can successfully navigate all the risks and changes in the competitive power industry is one that is diversified, not only in terms of its generation portfolio, but also in terms of its business lines. It is too easy for any one fuel type or any one business line to experience turmoil or disruption in the current shifting market. 
As I mentioned before, the operational platform has become a value differentiator and, to a great extent, a source of incremental revenue. Operational excellence is always nonnegotiable, regardless of industry. But in ours, building on operational platform that enables economies of scale is even more fundamental. For NRG, these operational platform has become a differentiated means of margin enhancement as complementary businesses intersect, and create opportunities for companies to straddle between markets.
But this is just the foundation. In the competitive power industry, companies need to remain leveraged to the upside by constantly assessing the market and the economic viability of opportunities to grow the businesses in a disciplined manner as markets evolve. For me, this means investing in areas where you can have a competitive advantage. It does not mean trying to be everything to everyone.
Last, I believe financial discipline needs to be a top priority for companies in our sector. It is not prudent to take a myopic approach to managing the balance sheet and capital allocation. These decisions, mostly made on a portfolio level, looking at all parts of the business and aligning decision-making with current market opportunities. 
So how do we stock up against these principles? I have already stressed how pleased I am with the operational execution across the business within NRG. We have made great strides in diversifying our business and revenues to protect us from low natural gas and power prices. At the same time, we remain well positioned for growth, looking for low-cost development opportunities and to monetize assets through our strategic relationship with NRG Yield. These unique attributes position NRG for sustained success in the industry.
As you saw on in the earlier slides, we have identified cost control and financial discipline as one of our key opportunities for improvement. While we have already begun a period of cost savings, I still believe we can do more, and I am actively working with the team to uncover new opportunities.
Our other area of focus will be in how we approach capital allocation and how we manage our capital structure. I want to make sure that our capital decisions fit with the current and near-term market cycles. We plan to be transparent in our capital allocation, and there should be no head scratching when it comes to how we deploy capital.
And on that note, our focus right now needs to be on deleveraging the business to ensure we stay ahead of this market cycle so we can take advantage of the opportunities that will result from it. We have already made significant progress, and we will continue to do so until we see market conditions change.
As we just discussed, NRG operates a large and well diversified integrated portfolio with assets that are environmentally well controlled. While it is important to have a good foundation, there is no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to regional dynamics. On the Slide 9, we outline what I refer to as our go-to-market strategy that reflects each of our region, specific trends and market dynamics. 
In the East region, it's all about reliability or capacity revenues. We are seeing system operators support for capacity products that reward reliability and performance, particularly in the face of retirements and weather events such as the polar vortex. For example, in the first capacity performance auction in PJM, we cleared close to 90% of our fleet and increased capacity revenue by 80% over the next 3 years. We are about to finish the repositioning of our portfolio to shift our margin mix from energy to capacity via fuel conversions which reduces operating costs significantly and environmental retrofits to maintain a cheap option on key access to capitalize on higher power prices.
In the Gulf, we continue to benefit from our integrated platform in this low-price environment, where our retail operation continues to overperform. Let me just say that our retail business in Texas is virtually impossible to replicate due to its scale and linkage with generation. We have demonstrated the value of our retail franchise for the past 7 years, with 2015 being our best year yet. This is a key differentiator of ours and one that we will continue to focus on and grow.
Our generational fleet has the scale and environmental controls needed to sustain this weak price environment where we should see further supply rationalization. At the same time, there is still the potential for the market to self-correct and be enhanced by improvements in market structure and peak pricing.
The West region is a story of renewables and distributed resources, and maintaining a capacity fleet that supports the grid given the intermittent nature of these resources. There is a need for quick start, well-located assets, and that is exactly what NRG has been successful in that market, securing contracted assets and developing sites in favorable locations that can then be monetized through NRG Yield, providing us a long-term dividend payment.
So far, we have developed over 1,800 megawatts of quick-start generation and won nearly 800 megawatts of repowering at our Carlsbad and Puente sites. We have been successful in growing our renewable and distributed portfolio. And with a reintegration of the renewables group into NRG, this will continue to be a growth area. 
Now turning to Slide 10. We remain focused on streamlining the organization. I am pleased with our efforts in taking close to $350 million in costs out of the system, but I am not satisfied, and we continue to look for more. So today, I am announcing an accelerated time line for our target cost savings of $150 million under our core NRG continuous improvement process, which has yielded so many benefits across the organization over the years. We expect these EBITDA accretive cost savings to be realized through end of 2017.
Additionally, we continue to prune our portfolio to bring incremental capital back into the company. We have executed $138 million in asset sales thus far, and are on track with our $500 million target. Last, we are nearing the completion of our current generation of fleet modernization program, which reduces our CapEx commitment by nearly $650 million in 2017, providing us additional flexibility of capital allocation in the next 5 years.
Moving on to Slide 11. I know there has been a lot of questions about my perspective on renewables and how these relates to the GreenCo process that we announced late last year. Let me be clear. As the CEO of not only the largest competitive generation owner in the country but also one of the largest renewable companies, I have recognized that this market represents a significant development opportunity given state renewable targets, customer needs, our competencies and financial incentives, and it is one in which we must participate. 
However, I am committed to ensuring that our efforts in this area match our skills and capabilities and are executed in a way that is value creating for our shareholders. I'm mindful of what has and continues to be a very deliberate process around GreenCo to determine the best way to create value in these business areas. So let me summarize where we are now.
First, from here on out, we will no longer refer to GreenCo, as described in our September update call. As we think about the individual business strategies moving forward, it no longer makes sense to group them under one headline. Not all renewable businesses are viewed the same in terms of fit and value for NRG. Today, I'm announcing the reintegration of our traditional NRG Business. Everything but the utility scales gets, that was never part of the GreenCo process, back into the company to ensure we maintain our advantage position and skills to participate in the changing landscape of the power industry.
It is important to recognize that many of our C&I customers expect us to be able to integrate renewables on and off site. Said another way, our efforts in renewables will mirror the strengths of our integrated platform. And when augmented by our partnership with NRG Yield, our renewables business, which is net cash positive on a full year basis, does not require permanent capital from NRG. 
In addition, the reintegration of NRG Renew will not cause any change to our financial guidance. I am also pleased to announce that NRG and NRG Yield have reallocated $50 million in previously committed cash equity from the residential solar partnership to the business renewable partnership. This change reinforces our alignment with NRG Yield with mutual focus in renewable energy development.
Finally, as you will note on the slide, we're in active negotiations around strategic transactions for Home Solar and eVgo, so my comments will be limited. I do expect to complete this process in the second quarter.
Turning on to Slide 12. I want to walk you through our revised approach to the NRG dividend. The dividend was launched in 2012 for several reasons: To better highlight the value of our contracted assets, to enable ownership by dividend restricted income funds and to have yield support. 
Today, our world looks much different than it did in 2012. We now have a deliberate dividend-paying vehicle in NRG Yield to highlight the value of contracted generation, and the extreme volatility in the IPP sector has mitigated our ability to realize yield support. And so it is our fundamental view that a static dividend approach is not an appropriate use of capital given the deep cyclical nature of our sector. With that, we are reducing the dividend to $0.12 a share from $0.58 a share, or to about 1% yield. 
I want to be crystal clear that these reductions is not due to balance sheet concerns. It is simply aligning our dividend approach with our broader focus on adaptability, while at the same time maintaining a differentiated platform that appeals to a broad range of investors and creating shareholder value through all commodity, credit and development cycles.
Moving to Slide 13. This is one of the most important topics of today's call. My core fundamental view on capital allocation is to stay focused on what we want to become. However, given the deep cyclical nature of the sector, we must first ensure the robustness of our balance sheet when deploying capital. We are proactively taking the necessary steps to not only leave no doubt about our strength during this cycle, but also to take advantage of opportunities that arise during market dislocations. Kurt will discuss in more detail the specifics, but I want to offer 3 takeaways.
One, the nearing conclusion of our large capital reinvestment program provides us the latitude to effectively harvest strong free cash flows through our asset optimization program, as I believe we have a good line of sight on market prices and environmental requirements, at least through the end of the decade. Next, paying down debt is fundamental as it assures our equity holders that NRG has the flexibility to create strong returns for them when the market recovers, and it assures our customers a stronger counterpart. My goal is to create no doubt in the strength of our balance sheet. So at this time, maintaining our current target ratio of 4.25% corporate debt to corporate EBITDA gives us ample headroom to our bond covenants, and it is consistent with our credit ratings.
Last, I remain committed to returning cash to shareholders when we feel that our capital structure is strong enough to allow for flexibility in the event of a prolonged commodity and capital market downturn. I ask that you don't take our focus on deleveraging in 2016 as an indication that NRG has turned away from returning capital to shareholders. Rather, I think of it as assuring that our shareholders can have confidence that NRG will be in a strong position to benefit from opportunities and better market conditions.
I will now turn it over to Kurt for the financial review."

Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 15, NRG delivered a total of $3.34 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.127 billion in free cash flow before growth in 2015. Our 2015 results highlight the benefit",2100,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 15, NRG delivered a total of $3.34 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.127 billion in free cash flow before growth in 2015. Our 2015 results highlight the benefits and resilience of our integrated platform as the low commodity price environment helped Home Retail deliver $739 million in adjusted EBITDA, exceeding our original 2015 guidance for that segment by more than 20%. Business & Renew achieved $1.881 billion in EBITDA for the year; while NRG Yield, which was aided by robust wind conditions in California late in the fourth quarter, contributed $720 million.
NRG completed $786 million in drop-downs to NRG Yield in 2015, helping to expand capital available for allocation and allowing us to return over $1.3 billion to stakeholders. $628 million of this capital was returned to shareholders, including the repurchase of approximately 7% of shares outstanding. Having shifted our capital allocation focus late in 2015, since November and through this past month, NRG has retired approximately $700 million in unsecured debt, including over $400 million at the NRG level and $274 million at GenOn. 
Our reduced unsecured debt balances will also help increase recurring cash flow, with over $50 million in annualized interest savings realized so far as a result of these efforts. I'd also like to briefly address one element of our 2015 results outside of EBITDA and free cash flow. That is the noncash impairment charges we took in the fourth quarter. 
On an annual basis, we test our long-lived assets and goodwill for potential impairments. Given the prolonged low commodity price outlook, we adjusted our long-term view of power prices which resulted in noncash impairment charge of approximately $5.1 billion, consisting of a write-down of certain fixed assets as well as goodwill. Due to the lack of robust forward prices in ERCOT, this change -- charge, rather, is primarily related to impairments of our 2 coal plants in that market as well as goodwill related to the 2006 acquisition of Texas Genco, of which these 2 coal plants were part.
Based on the robust commodity price outlook at the time of the acquisition, we allocated a substantial portion of the Texas Genco purchase price to the coal plants with minimal value allocated to the gas plants. And although, since that time, the Texas Genco portfolio has delivered over $8.5 billion of unlevered free cash flow and provided a platform for our expansion into retail with the acquisition of Reliant in 2009. The outlook in the ERCOT market has nonetheless shifted substantially, currently favoring gas over coal.
The impairment of our 2 ERCOT coal plants aligns the book value of these assets with their forward cash flow profile as implied by the current market environment. And while the shift in market dynamics also implies the value of our gas portfolio in Texas now substantially exceeds its book value, as many of you are aware, accounting rules permit only the write-down of asset book values and do not permit a write-off.
These impairment charges also resulted in cumulative net income for the prior 3-year period following below the threshold prescribed for a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset balance largely associated with NRG's tax NOLs. As a result, our onetime fourth quarter charges also include a $3 billion noncash charge to tax expense resulting from a contra-asset entry on NRG's balance sheet as required under GAAP as a valuation allowance, offsetting our net deferred tax asset balance. That said, this accounting charge has no bearing on our ability to utilize our NOLs against future taxable income, and we continue to fully expect to do so.
Finally, turning to our 2016 guidance, we are reaffirming the previously announced guidance ranges for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth which, as Mauricio indicated earlier, reflect our expectations for consolidated 2016 results including business renewables, which was previously part of GreenCo. A point of clarification. Business renewables is NRG's commercial and industrial distributed of solar business. Our utility-scale renewable assets were not part of the GreenCo business previously excluded from our guidance.
Turning to Slide 16. I'd like to briefly summarize our capital allocation progress in 2015, focusing on the NRG level, which excludes cash and capital projects at various excluded subsidiaries, primarily GenOn and NRG Yield. Total NRG-level capital available through 2015 was $1.7 billion as shown on the left of the slide. Capital available to NRG includes 3 components. First, NRG level excess cash at the end of 2014, which is basically cash and cash equivalents less our $700 million minimum cash liquidity reserve, net of any cash collateral posted as of the year end. Second, the portion of our consolidated free cash flow before growth at the NRG level, which is in 2015, was just over $800 million. And finally during 2015, as I mentioned earlier, NRG received $786 million proceeds from NRG Yield, which comprises the third component of capital available.
During 2015, NRG-level capital located total approximately $1.2 billion, with more than half of that amount returned to our shareholders. Having shifted our focus late in the year toward debt reduction, we ended 2015 by retiring $246 million of the principal across various maturities of NRG's unsecured notes, which significantly expanded the reduction of corporate debt beyond the amortization of our term loan facility. And as I mentioned earlier, we continued that deleveraging process through the first 2 months of the year, which I'll address more comprehensively when we turn to 2016 capital allocation in a moment.
The remaining $320 million was allocated towards growth investments. Importantly, this amount represents a reduction of over $450 million versus our original growth investments forecast provided on our first quarter 2015 earnings call. At that time, we projected approximately $960 million in consolidated growth investments, with nearly $800 million of that amount expected at the NRG level. This reduction in NRG level spend was the result of both the slower pace of Home Solar as well as the elimination of other growth investments.
Turning to our 2016 NRG-level capital allocation plans on Slide 17, and building on the delivering process -- progress, rather, we've made since November2016, I will see -- in 2016, we'll see a more significant shift towards further debt reduction, leaving no doubt that our balance sheet strength and credit ratios will remain resilient even if the current low commodity prices continue beyond the current year. We expect approximately $1.5 billion of capital available for allocation at the NRG level in 2016, which again represents excess capital beyond our minimum cash balance reserve for liquidity, which is further supplemented by our $2.5 billion credit facility.
2016 capital available for allocation consists of the excess cash balance at the NRG level at year-end 2015, plus the midpoint of our NRG-level free cash flow before growth guidance and expected proceeds from drop-downs to NRG Yield of approximately $125 million in 2016. These expected drop-down proceeds consist of the substantial portion of what remains under our Residential Solar and business renewables, or DG partnerships, at NRG Yield, and represents the return of the portion of our 2016 growth investments towards these 2 businesses.
This month, in order to align the size of these 2 partnerships with NRG's strategic priorities, we have reached agreement with NRG Yield to shift the amount of capital between Home Solar and the business renewables partnerships. As a result, the Home Solar partnership was reduced by $50 million to $100 million, with a corresponding $50 million increase to the business renewables partnership, reflecting the more robust and reliable pipeline of business renewables, which is now been reintegrated within NRG.
We expect to allocate approximately 75% of our 2016 NRG-level capital or over $1 billion towards further debt reduction in 2016. This consists of ongoing term loan amortization as well as over $150 million in NRG corporate debt already retired year-to-date. We plan to supplement this deleveraging in 2 ways: First, we'll allocate $600 million of capital towards NRG debt retirement through open market purchases or tenders; and second, being mindful of our next NRG bond maturity in 2018, which is now approximately $1 billion in principal outstanding.
In the backdrop of the current dislocation in the high-yield market, we will reserve an additional $325 million toward the retirement of our 2018 notes in connection with the coincident refinancing of the balance when market conditions are more favorable. While our current priority is to ensure an efficient retirement and refinancing of our 2018 notes, as conditions evolve, we will continue to evaluate the best use of this debt reduction capital and may choose to allocate it toward different maturities should this alternative prove more favorable.
In any event, we expect this capital to ultimately be allocated toward corporate debt reduction in order to meaningfully advance our efforts to further strengthen our balance sheet and ensure adherence to our target balance sheet metrics even through an extended low cycle in commodity prices.
As Mauricio indicated earlier, we have now adjusted our dividend rate to a level consistent with both our capital allocation priorities and the cyclical and capital-intensive nature of our business. And while the current depressed level of our share price undoubtedly represents a compelling return opportunity, we believe it is prudent to continue our progress in rightsizing corporate debt and strengthening ratios, which will enable us the flexibility to capitalize on value-enhancing opportunities for shareholders.
Such opportunities are only made truly compelling by first ensuring the strength of the balance sheet which supports them. For 2016, we expect just over $300 million of growth investments consisting primarily of our PH Robinson peaker project, Carbon 360 and our commitments pursuant to the California eVgo settlement. During 2016, we are also focused on executing on opportunities to further expand capital available for allocation, including $250 million of nonrecourse financing included as part of our recent announcement last year. As I indicated on our third quarter call, we are now fully prepared to launch this financing when market conditions are more favorable.
In addition, we continue to expect the next utility-scale drop-down offer to NRG Yield to be our remaining stake in CVSR and plan to offer this to Yield in 2016. We are currently exploring with Yield the best means to efficiently finance this drop-down to assist Yield in prudently managing its liquidity while continuing to replenish capital at NRG. I expect we'll have more to share with you on the timing and the tenant structure later this year.
And finally, turning to Slide 18, in light of our significant deleveraging progress and having provided an expanded look at our 2016 capital allocation plan, I'd like to update the information we provided last quarter regarding NRG's capital structure and 2016 corporate credit metrics. Focusing on recourse debt at the NRG level, which, prior to deleveraging, we had expected to be approximately $8.8 billion as of year-end 2016. On our third quarter call, we indicated our intention to reduce that debt by at least $500 million. Having completed half of this objective during the fourth quarter alone, we ended 2015 with just over $8.5 billion in recourse debt.
Since then and through February, we've completed an additional $171 million in debt reduction, as shown on the far right column on the slide. And as a result, based on the midpoint of our guidance and our implied 2016 corporate debt to corporate EBITDA, ratio is already nearly in line with our 4.25% target. However, our goal is to maintain adherence to the target in 2017 and beyond, taking into account the possibilities of sustained low commodity prices. This objective drives our continued focus on further debt reduction over the course of 2016. As I indicated previously in reviewing 2016 capital allocation, we expect to further reduce corporate debt by at least another $600 million this year.
Taking that additional deleveraging into account, we are on track to drive corporate debt below $8 billion within of the year, which should place our corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio at approximately 4x. And finally, factoring in the effect of releasing the $325 million of additional capital, we have currently reserved for further reducing our 2018 maturity, that 2016 ratio would be reduced to 3.8x. One way to consider that number is that it allows us to maintain adherence to a 4.25% target ratio even if corporate EBITDA were to be reduced by approximately $200 million as a result of sustained low commodity prices.
And with that, I'd turn it back over to Mauricio."

Let me just start by providing you kind of the general -- my general take on capital allocation, and then I'll go into the specifics of Canal. As you can see from all the actions that we're taking today, one of my key priorities, the first 90 days of being the CEO, was to focus on capital allocation. First, being mindful and aware of the current commodity cycle that we are today; and then second, the dislocation that we have in our capital markets. It was important to me to afford us the maximum flexibility when deploying capital, and to exert absolute financial discipline. I already talked about the actions that we're taking, one, on deleveraging and strengthening our balance sheet and ensuring that we go through these cycle and with a strong position to capitalize on opportunities; but importantly, that we're ready when the market turns around. Two, the recalibration of the dividend. And then three is the focus on cost savings and streamlining the cost structure on the organization. So when I think about Canal, it is not a capital allocation decision for 2016. It's a capital allocation decision that we will make in 2018, and at that point, we will evaluate the current environment. And on that perspective, then we'll make the determination what is the best use of our capital. But I want to make sure that we continue to generating low-cost options at good, good returns given the opportunity that we have to lock for 7 years a very constructive capacity prices. And as I told you in the prepared remarks, our focus in the Northeast, and particularly in New England, is focus on capacity revenues. Canal is a dual-fuel peaker that is needed in that market, have good returns and is a capital allocation decision that we will make not today, where we are focusing all our attention in strengthening the balance sheet, but in 2 years."

All the market dynamics that we were expecting when we made those investments are playing out, particularly around reliability and capacity. But all 3 Northeast markets, whether it's PJM through capacity performance, New England and New York, we're moving towards that. We saw that during the polar vortex. We acted upon, and it's playing out the way we thought it was going to play out. Now with respect to other parts of the country, you know that I will exert absolute financial discipline when it comes to the profitability of our assets.

And as you saw in -- in Mauricio's remarks, rather, we have continuation of our assets and program, which, as we've indicated previously going back to the reset, that's focused on the Northeast. So we'd expect it's likely -- more likely that, that would probably come out of the GenOn complex, which would enhance liquidity. But as the year goes -- as the progresses, certainly I would believe 2016 is a key inflection point given those loan maturities. And we're mindful of the options.

We already talked about the -- one of the objective was the yield support. And in this current market environment and with the level of volatility that we're seeing in the stocks, it really doesn't accomplish that objective. So when I put the 2 together, one, the nature of our industry; and two, some of the principles that we have when we initiated it, it's just inconsistent.

And we're moving forward, obviously, to close the second of those 2, and continuing to focus on completing the remaining $500 million -- or the remainder of the $500 million that we announced on the reset, which as I dedicated to Julien, given the fact that we -- we're very clear about the fact that we expect those assets to still be in the Northeast. If the expectation -- the knock-on [ph] expectation certainly is that, that would continue to be at the GenOn level.

As I said, though, always be mindful of preserving the integrity of the balance sheet of NRG given the nonrecourse nature of the GenOn subsidiary, which will continue to be the case."

The current market in Texas has been very disappointed despite what I consider still pretty strong fundamentals, strong demand and a -- price that doesn't incentivize newbuild economics even though we have seen some, what I consider, out of -- non-economical entry. When I look at our portfolio, particularly the Parish lines on an STP, they are very large in scale, they're environmentally controlled, and I would say that they're probably one of the most cost-advantaged base load plants for coal and nuclear plants in the state. We have identified what we believe is the least competitive assets in the supply stack when it comes to coal. And we believe that if the market continues to be at these levels, it will not be possible to sustain the operation of some of these assets. So that's why I think there is going to be a supply rationalization in the immediate term, and we should see a recalibration of the market. I feel comfortable right now with 3 of our baseload plants. And -- but I think we have a pretty good track record in terms of if and when these plants are not economic and the prospects of these plants are not positive, we will act upon. And we have done that in other regions, and there is no reason why we wouldn't do it in Texas. But right now, still not the time, and I think the supply stack will react before we get to that point."

And this was -- good morning, Steve. This is one of the reason why, I think at a couple of points in my prepared remarks, I made specific reference to contextualize capital available for allocation, which we consider to be a cash surplus versus cash on the balance sheet. And so when we calculate that, we start with the minimum cash balance that we reserve at the NRG level. So we set aside $700 million for liquidity. Now that -- part of that liquidity is what we need for cash collateral postings, for example. So as we post cash collateral, we consider that a utilization of the minimum cash reserve. So whatever we deduct at any given time, think about it as $700 million of minimum cash minus the amount of cash collateral we've posted. Comprehensively, and this is outside of capital available for allocation, we focus on liquidity separately. So liquidity is that $700 million of minimum cash at the NRG level plus the $2.5 billion corporate credit facility. That's separate and apart from what we consider excess capital, which is what that $513 million that you referred to represents. Does that help?"

Let me also formally welcome Kevin Cole as our new Head of Investor Relations. He's well known by many of you, having spent a number of years in the energy sector on both the buy and sell side. I also want to thank Chad Plotkin for providing transitional support over the past few months and wish him well of as he moves on to take other responsibilities within the company.
Before we begin, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank David Crane for his years of service at NRG. We are grateful for his many contributions to the company for over a decade, and I want to wish him well in his next endeavors.
Today, is my first I'm addressing you as CEO of NRG, so I'm going to deviate slightly from our normal earnings agenda because I want to use this time to not only report on the results of our business, which were exceptional, but also to give you my perspective on the strategic direction of the company and our immediate priorities.
So let's begin on Slide 4, where I have outlined the key messages you should take away from today's call. First, as our financial performance has shown time and time again, we have the right portfolio and the right platform to succeed in this environment. Our business delivers strong results during periods of low prices, and importantly, our generation fleet remains significantly levered through market recovery.
Second, in this environment, we will benefit from having a stronger balance sheet. We have initiated a comprehensive plan to reduce debt, streamline costs and replenish capital. We are proactively doing these to take advantage of market opportunities in the short term so we can benefit from a market recovery in the medium to long run.
Third, in order to afford ourselves maximum flexibility on our capital allocation decisions, we are recalibrating our dividend to be consistent with the capital-intensive and cyclical nature of our industry. 
Finally, we are focused on bringing the GreenCo process to a closure that maximizes value for our shareholders. We are reintegrating business renewables back into the NRG platform with no change to our financial guidance and reinforcing our strategic relationship with NRG Yield. We are continuing the sale process of eVgo and NRG Home Solar.
All of these actions support our objective to continue building and operating the best integrated competitive power company. Now let me elaborate in more detail.
Starting on Slide 6, with the financial performance of our business. I am very pleased to report that we achieved in the upper range of our adjusted EBITDA guidance in 2015 despite the challenging power markets, a company-wide restructuring and changes in management. We remain focused on our business, and delivered top quartile safety performance with our retail business having a record year, demonstrating the consistency and value of our integrated platform. So to every one of my colleagues, job well done.
There are a few points that I want to highlight. We are reaffirming 2016 financial guidance, which now includes our business renewables. Our commercial team continues to execute superbly and have mitigated the impact of lower prices for the year. We are off to a good start on our plans to strengthen the balance sheet. Since November, we have retired close to $700 million in high-yield debt at a significantly discount to par. We are expanding this by an additional $925 million of debt reductions, which Kirk will cover in more detail.
We remain focused in replenishing capital with $500 million in targeted asset sales in 2016, and we are accelerating our cost savings time line. And as I mentioned before and something I will discuss in more detail in a few slides, we are reducing the annual dividend to $0.12 per share from $0.15 per share, which afford us maximum flexibility in our capital allocation program during this market period.
Let me now move to the strategic part of the presentation, and provide you my perspective on where NRG is today, and what I believe separate us from others in our industry. Stakeholders repeatedly tell me that NRG's story and capital structure is too complicated, that the company is spending too much money on businesses that are outside of its core competencies. I have taken this feedback seriously, and I am here today telling you that simplification of our business is an imperative, both for external perception and internal focus. Efforts are already underway to address this concern. Everything from the way NRG is perceived in the market, to the way we disclose information to the way we run our platform will be greatly simplified over the next several quarters.
Simplification starts with the way that we think about the business. The graphic on the left side of Slide 7 represents our thinking. NRG has and continues to be comprised of 2 main businesses: generation, inclusive of renewables; and retail. That is our focus and there should be no mistake about that. But it is not only these 2 businesses independently that create the most value for NRG. It is the interaction between the 2 through our scalable operating platform. This is truly a case where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The touch points between our generation and retail businesses underpin the NRG value proposition: a generation of fleet that is well diversified in terms of location, merit order and fuel type, minimizing exposure to downturns in any one market, but flexible enough to benefit from scarcity periods like we saw during the polar vortex.
A complementary business model that helps insulate revenues from commodity risk. Today, 2/3 of our economic gross margin comes from sources that are counter or noncorrelated to gas like retail, capacity revenues or long-term contracts. A cash flow machine, even in what has become a very difficult commodity cycle that is enhanced by our ability to replenish capital through NRG Yield. What I believe is not fully appreciated, much to our own doing, is the shared and scalable platform that we have built. Our ability to leverage a common platform to grow our business and realize cost synergies in the process is absolutely unique in this industry. And not only is it unique, but later in the presentation, I will explain why I think it is necessary to succeed.
In summary, my view of the business is that it's simple, focused and differentiated within the competitive power space. 
Turning now to Slide 8, I want to take a step back and give you my perspective on the competitive power industry and what I believe it takes to be successful. This industry is currently undergoing a paradigm shift. We are in periods of sustained low natural gas prices; low growth that has flowed in most markets, except Texas on the Gulf Coast; behind-the-meter technologies are coming on to the grid, changing traditional dispatch; market growth are focused on reliability, particularly in the face of retirements; renewables continue to enter the market as regulation focuses on limiting emissions from conventional power.
Being a pure IPP player is no longer enough to succeed in the market today and definitely not tomorrow. The company that can successfully navigate all the risks and changes in the competitive power industry is one that is diversified, not only in terms of its generation portfolio, but also in terms of its business lines. It is too easy for any one fuel type or any one business line to experience turmoil or disruption in the current shifting market. 
As I mentioned before, the operational platform has become a value differentiator and, to a great extent, a source of incremental revenue. Operational excellence is always nonnegotiable, regardless of industry. But in ours, building an operational platform that enables economies of scale is even more fundamental. For NRG, this operational platform has become a differentiated means of margin enhancement as complementary businesses intersect, and create opportunities for companies to straddle between markets.
But this is just the foundation. In the competitive power industry, companies need to remain leveraged to the upside by constantly assessing the market and the economic viability of opportunities to grow the businesses in a disciplined manner as markets evolve. For me, this means investing in areas where you can have a competitive advantage. It does not mean trying to be everything to everyone.
Last, I believe financial discipline needs to be a top priority for companies in our sector. It is not prudent to take a myopic approach to managing the balance sheet and capital allocation. These decisions, mostly made on a portfolio level, looking at all parts of the business and aligning decision-making with current market opportunities. 
So how do we stack up against these principles? I have already stressed how pleased I am with the operational execution across the business within NRG. We have made great strides in diversifying our business and revenues to protect us from low natural gas and power prices. At the same time, we remain well positioned for growth, looking for low-cost development opportunities and to monetize assets through our strategic relationship with NRG Yield. These unique attributes position NRG for sustained success in the industry.
As you saw on in the earlier slides, we have identified cost control and financial discipline as one of our key opportunities for improvement. While we have already begun a period of cost savings, I still believe we can do more, and I am actively working with the team to uncover new opportunities.
Our other area of focus will be in how we approach capital allocation and how we manage our capital structure. I want to make sure that our capital decisions fit with the current and near-term market cycles. We plan to be transparent in our capital allocation, and there should be no head scratching when it comes to how we deploy capital.
And on that note, our focus right now needs to be on deleveraging the business to ensure we stay ahead of this market cycle so we can take advantage of the opportunities that will result from it. We have already made significant progress, and we will continue to do so until we see market conditions change.
As we just discussed, NRG operates a large and well diversified integrated portfolio with assets that are environmentally well controlled. While it is important to have a good foundation, there is no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to regional dynamics. On the Slide 9, we outline what I refer to as our go-to-market strategy that reflects each of our regions, specific trends and market dynamics. 
In the East region, it's all about reliability or capacity revenues. We are seeing system operator support for capacity products that reward reliability and performance, particularly in the face of retirements and weather events such as the polar vortex. For example, in the first capacity performance auction in PJM, we cleared close to 90% of our fleet and increased capacity revenue by 80% over the next 3 years. We are about to finish the repositioning of our portfolio to shift our margin mix from energy to capacity via fuel conversions which reduces operating costs significantly and environmental retrofits to maintain a cheap option on key assets to capitalize on higher power prices.
In the Gulf, we continue to benefit from our integrated platform in this low-price environment, where our retail operation continues to overperform. Let me just say that our retail business in Texas is virtually impossible to replicate due to its scale and linkage with generation. We have demonstrated the value of our retail franchise for the past 7 years, with 2015 being our best year yet. This is a key differentiator of ours and one that we will continue to focus on and grow.
Our generational fleet has the scale and environmental controls needed to sustain this weak price environment where we should see further supply rationalization. At the same time, there is still the potential for the market to self-correct and be enhanced by improvements in market structure and peak pricing.
The West region is a story of renewables and distributed resources, and maintaining a capacity fleet that supports the grid given the intermittent nature of these resources. There is a need for quick start, well-located assets, and that is exactly what NRG has been successful in that market, securing contracted assets and developing sites in favorable locations that can then be monetized through NRG Yield, providing us a long-term dividend payment.
So far, we have developed over 1,800 megawatts of quick-start generation and won nearly 800 megawatts of repowering at our Carlsbad and Puente sites. We have been successful in growing our renewable and distributed portfolio. And with a reintegration of the renewables group into NRG, this will continue to be a growth area. 
Now turning to Slide 10. We remain focused on streamlining the organization. I am pleased with our efforts in taking close to $350 million in costs out of the system, but I am not satisfied, and we continue to look for more. So today, I am announcing an accelerated time line for our target cost savings of $150 million under our core NRG continuous improvement process, which has yielded so many benefits across the organization over the years. We expect these EBITDA accretive cost savings to be realized through end of 2017.
Additionally, we continue to prune our portfolio to bring incremental capital back into the company. We have executed $138 million in asset sales thus far, and are on track with our $500 million target. Last, we are nearing the completion of our current generation fleet modernization program, which reduces our CapEx commitment by nearly $650 million in 2017, providing us additional flexibility of capital allocation in the next 5 years.
Moving on to Slide 11. I know there has been a lot of questions about my perspective on renewables and how these relates to the GreenCo process that we announced late last year. Let me be clear. As the CEO of not only the largest competitive generation owner in the country but also one of the largest renewable companies, I have recognized that this market represents a significant development opportunity given state renewable targets, customer needs, our competencies and financial incentives, and it is one in which we must participate. 
However, I am committed to ensuring that our efforts in this area match our skills and capabilities and are executed in a way that is value creating for our shareholders. I'm mindful of what has and continues to be a very deliberate process around GreenCo to determine the best way to create value in these business areas. So let me summarize where we are now.
First, from here on out, we will no longer refer to GreenCo, as described in our September update call. As we think about the individual business strategies moving forward, it no longer makes sense to group them under one headline. Not all renewable businesses are viewed the same in terms of fit and value for NRG. Today, I'm announcing the reintegration of our traditional NRG Business. Everything but the utility scale, since that was never part of the GreenCo process, back into the company to ensure we maintain our advantaged position and skills to participate in the changing landscape of the power industry.
It is important to recognize that many of our C&I customers expect us to be able to integrate renewables on and off site. Said another way, our efforts in renewables will mirror the strength of our integrated platform. And when augmented by our partnership with NRG Yield, our renewables business, which is net cash positive on a full year basis, does not require permanent capital from NRG. 
In addition, the reintegration of NRG Renew will not cause any change to our financial guidance. I am also pleased to announce that NRG and NRG Yield have reallocated $50 million in previously committed cash equity from the residential solar partnership to the business renewable partnership. This change reinforces our alignment with NRG Yield with mutual focus in renewable energy development.
Finally, as you will note on the slide, we're in active negotiations around strategic transactions for Home Solar and eVgo, so my comments will be limited. I do expect to complete this process in the second quarter.
Turning on to Slide 12. I want to walk you through our revised approach to the NRG dividend. The dividend was launched in 2012 for several reasons: to better highlight the value of our contracted assets; to enable ownership by dividend restricted income funds and to have yield support. 
Today our world looks much different than it did in 2012. We now have a deliberate dividend-paying vehicle in NRG Yield to highlight the value of contracted generation, and the extreme volatility in the IPP sector has mitigated our ability to realize yield support. And so it is our fundamental view that a static dividend approach is not an appropriate use of capital given the deep cyclical nature of our sector. With that, we are reducing the dividend to $0.12 a share from $0.58 a share, or to about 1% yield. 
I want to be crystal clear that this reduction is not due to balance sheet concerns. It is simply aligning our dividend approach with our broader focus on adaptability, while at the same time maintaining a differentiated platform that appeals to a broad range of investors and creating shareholder value through all commodity, credit and development cycles.
Moving to Slide 13. This is one of the most important topics of today's call. My core fundamental view on capital allocation is to stay focused on what we want to become. However, given the deep cyclical nature of the sector, we must first ensure the robustness of our balance sheet when deploying capital. We are proactively taking the necessary steps to not only leave no doubt about our strength during this cycle, but also to take advantage of opportunities that arise during market dislocations. Kirk will discuss in more detail the specifics, but I want to offer 3 takeaways.
One, the nearing conclusion of our large capital reinvestment program provides us the latitude to effectively harvest strong free cash flows through our asset optimization program, as I believe we have a good line of sight on market prices and environmental requirements, at least through the end of the decade. Next, paying down debt is fundamental as it assures our equity holders that NRG has the flexibility to create strong returns for them when the market recovers, and it assures our customers a stronger counterpart. My goal is to create no doubt in the strength of our balance sheet. So at this time, maintaining our current target ratio of 4.25% corporate debt to corporate EBITDA gives us ample headroom to our bond covenants, and it is consistent with our credit ratings.
Last, I remain committed to returning cash to shareholders when we feel that our capital structure is strong enough to allow for flexibility in the event of a prolonged commodity and capital market downturn. I ask that you don't take our focus on deleveraging in 2016 as an indication that NRG has turned away from returning capital to shareholders. Rather, I think of it as assuring that our shareholders can have confidence that NRG will be in a strong position to benefit from opportunities and better market conditions.
I will now turn it over to Kirk for the financial review."

Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 15, NRG delivered a total of $3.34 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.127 billion in free cash flow before growth in 2015. Our 2015 results highlight the benefit",2100,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 15, NRG delivered a total of $3.34 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.127 billion in free cash flow before growth in 2015. Our 2015 results highlight the benefits and resilience of our integrated platform as the low commodity price environment helped Home Retail deliver $739 million in adjusted EBITDA, exceeding our original 2015 guidance for that segment by more than 20%. Business & Renew achieved $1.881 billion in EBITDA for the year; while NRG Yield, which was aided by robust wind conditions in California late in the fourth quarter, contributed $720 million.
NRG completed $786 million in drop-downs to NRG Yield in 2015, helping expand capital available for allocation and allowing us to return over $1.3 billion to stakeholders. $628 million of this capital was returned to shareholders, including the repurchase of approximately 7% of shares outstanding. Having shifted our capital allocation focus late in 2015, since November and through this past month, NRG has retired approximately $700 million in unsecured debt, including over $400 million at the NRG level and $274 million at GenOn. 
Our reduced unsecured debt balances will also help increase recurring cash flow, with over $50 million in annualized interest savings realized so far as a result of these efforts. I'd also like to briefly address one element of our 2015 results outside of EBITDA and free cash flow. That is the noncash impairment charges we took in the fourth quarter. 
On an annual basis, we test our long-lived assets and goodwill for potential impairments. Given the prolonged low commodity price outlook, we adjusted our long-term view of power prices which resulted in noncash impairment charge of approximately $5.1 billion, consisting of a write-down of certain fixed assets as well as goodwill. Due to the lack of robust forward prices in ERCOT, this change -- charge, rather, is primarily related to impairments of our 2 coal plants in that market as well as goodwill related to the 2006 acquisition of Texas Genco, of which these 2 coal plants were part.
Based on the robust commodity price outlook at the time of the acquisition, we allocated a substantial portion of the Texas Genco purchase price to the coal plants with minimal value allocated to the gas plants. And although, since that time, the Texas Genco portfolio has delivered over $8.5 billion of unlevered free cash flow and provided a platform for our expansion into retail with the acquisition of Reliant in 2009, the outlook in the ERCOT market has nonetheless shifted substantially, currently favoring gas over coal.
The impairment of our 2 ERCOT coal plants aligns the book value of these assets with their forward cash flow profile as implied by the current market environment. And while the shift in market dynamics also implies the value of our gas portfolio in Texas now substantially exceeds its book value, as many of you are aware, accounting rules permit only the write-down of asset book values and do not permit a write-off.
These impairment charges also resulted in cumulative net income for the prior 3-year period following below the threshold prescribed for a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset balance largely associated with NRG's tax NOLs. As a result, our onetime fourth quarter charges also include a $3 billion noncash charge to tax expense resulting from a contra-asset entry on NRG's balance sheet as required under GAAP as a valuation allowance, offsetting our net deferred tax asset balance. That said, this accounting charge has no bearing on our ability to utilize our NOLs against future taxable income, and we continue to fully expect to do so.
Finally, turning to our 2016 guidance, we are reaffirming the previously announced guidance ranges for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth which, as Mauricio indicated earlier, reflect our expectations for consolidated 2016 results including business renewables, which was previously part of GreenCo. A point of clarification. Business renewables is NRG's commercial and industrial distributed of solar business. Our utility-scale renewable assets were not part of the GreenCo business previously excluded from our guidance.
Turning to Slide 16. I'd like to briefly summarize our capital allocation progress in 2015, focusing on the NRG level, which excludes cash and capital projects at various excluded subsidiaries, primarily GenOn and NRG Yield. Total NRG-level capital available through 2015 was $1.7 billion as shown on the left of the slide. Capital available to NRG includes 3 components. First, NRG level excess cash at the end of 2014, which is basically cash and cash equivalents less our $700 million minimum cash liquidity reserve, net of any cash collateral posted as of the year end. Second, the portion of our consolidated free cash flow before growth at the NRG level, which is in 2015, was just over $800 million. And finally during 2015, as I mentioned earlier, NRG received $786 million proceeds from NRG Yield, which comprises the third component of capital available.
During 2015, NRG-level capital located total approximately $1.2 billion, with more than half of that amount returned to our shareholders. Having shifted our focus late in the year toward debt reduction, we ended 2015 by retiring $246 million of the principal across various maturities of NRG's unsecured notes, which significantly expanded the reduction of corporate debt beyond the amortization of our term loan facility. And as I mentioned earlier, we continued that deleveraging process through the first 2 months of the year, which I'll address more comprehensively when we turn to 2016 capital allocation in a moment.
The remaining $320 million was allocated towards growth investments. Importantly, this amount represents a reduction of over $450 million versus our original growth investments forecast provided on our first quarter 2015 earnings call. At that time, we projected approximately $960 million in consolidated growth investments, with nearly $800 million of that amount expected at the NRG level. This reduction in NRG level spend was the result of both the slower pace of Home Solar as well as the elimination of other growth investments.
Turning to our 2016 NRG-level capital allocation plans on Slide 17, and building on the delevering process -- progress, rather, we've made since November 2016, I will see -- in 2016, we'll see a more significant shift towards further debt reduction, leaving no doubt that our balance sheet strength and credit ratios will remain resilient even if the current low commodity prices continue beyond the current year. We expect approximately $1.5 billion of capital available for allocation at the NRG level in 2016, which again represents excess capital beyond our minimum cash balance reserve for liquidity, which is further supplemented by our $2.5 billion credit facility.
2016 capital available for allocation consists of the excess cash balance at the NRG level at year-end 2015, plus the midpoint of our NRG-level free cash flow before growth guidance and expected proceeds from drop-downs to NRG Yield of approximately $125 million in 2016. These expected drop-down proceeds consist of the substantial portion of what remains under our Residential Solar and business renewables, or DG partnerships, at NRG Yield, and represents the return of the portion of our 2016 growth investments towards these 2 businesses.
This month, in order to align the size of these 2 partnerships with NRG's strategic priorities, we have reached agreement with NRG Yield to shift the amount of capital between Home Solar and the business renewables partnerships. As a result, the Home Solar partnership was reduced by $50 million to $100 million, with a corresponding $50 million increase to the business renewables partnership, reflecting the more robust and reliable pipeline of business renewables, which is now been reintegrated within NRG.
We expect to allocate approximately 75% of our 2016 NRG-level capital or over $1 billion towards further debt reduction in 2016. This consists of ongoing term loan amortization as well as over $150 million in NRG corporate debt already retired year-to-date. We plan to supplement this deleveraging in 2 ways: First, we'll allocate $600 million of capital towards NRG debt retirement through open market purchases or tenders; and second, being mindful of our next NRG bond maturity in 2018, which is now approximately $1 billion in principal outstanding and the backdrop of the current dislocation in the high-yield market, we will reserve an additional $325 million toward the retirement of our 2018 notes in connection with the coincident refinancing of the balance when market conditions are more favorable. While our current priority is to ensure an efficient retirement and refinancing of our 2018 notes, as conditions evolve, we will continue to evaluate the best use of this debt reduction capital and may choose to allocate it toward different maturities should this alternative prove more favorable.
In any event, we expect this capital to ultimately be allocated toward corporate debt reduction in order to meaningfully advance our efforts to further strengthen our balance sheet and ensure adherence to our target balance sheet metrics even through an extended low cycle in commodity prices.
As Mauricio indicated earlier, we have now adjusted our dividend rate to a level consistent with both our capital allocation priorities and the cyclical and capital-intensive nature of our business. And while the current depressed level of our share price undoubtedly represents a compelling return opportunity, we believe it is prudent to continue our progress in rightsizing corporate debt and strengthening ratios, which will enable us the flexibility to capitalize on value-enhancing opportunities for shareholders.
Such opportunities are only made truly compelling by first ensuring the strength of the balance sheet which supports them. For 2016, we expect just over $300 million of growth investments consisting primarily of our PH Robinson peaker project, Carbon 360 and our commitments pursuant to the California eVgo settlement. During 2016, we are also focused on executing on opportunities to further expand capital available for allocation, including $250 million of nonrecourse financing included as part of our recent announcement last year. As I indicated on our third quarter call, we are now fully prepared to launch this financing when market conditions are more favorable.
In addition, we continue to expect the next utility-scale drop-down offer to NRG Yield to be our remaining stake in CVSR and plan to offer this to Yield in 2016. We are currently exploring with Yield the best means to efficiently finance this drop-down to assist Yield in prudently managing its liquidity while continuing to replenish capital at NRG. I expect we'll have more to share with you on the timing and the tenant structure later this year.
And finally, turning to Slide 18, in light of our significant deleveraging progress and having provided an expanded look at our 2016 capital allocation plan, I'd like to update the information we provided last quarter regarding NRG's capital structure and 2016 corporate credit metrics. Focusing on recourse debt at the NRG level, which, prior to deleveraging, we had expected to be approximately $8.8 billion as of year-end 2016. On our third quarter call, we indicated our intention to reduce that debt by at least $500 million. Having completed half of this objective during the fourth quarter alone, we ended 2015 with just over $8.5 billion in recourse debt.
Since then and through February, we've completed an additional $171 million in debt reduction, as shown on the far right column on the slide. And as a result, based on the midpoint of our guidance and our implied 2016 corporate debt to corporate EBITDA, ratio is already nearly in line with our 4.25% target. However, our goal is to maintain adherence to the target in 2017 and beyond, taking into account the possibilities of sustained low commodity prices. This objective drives our continued focus on further debt reduction over the course of 2016. As I indicated previously in reviewing 2016 capital allocation, we expect to further reduce corporate debt by at least another $600 million this year.
Taking that additional deleveraging into account, we are on track to drive corporate debt below $8 billion within of the year, which would place our corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio at approximately 4x. And finally, factoring in the effect of releasing the $325 million of additional capital, we have currently reserved for further reducing our 2018 maturity, that 2016 ratio would be reduced to 3.8x. One way to consider that number is that it allows us to maintain adherence to our 4.25% target ratio even if corporate EBITDA were to be reduced by approximately $200 million as a result of sustained low commodity prices.
And with that, I'd turn it back over to Mauricio."

Obviously, that's the core message that you're giving us today. So can you characterize -- if you were to, for instance, free up this incremental drop-down money on nonrecourse financing, how do you think about each incremental dollar for capital allocation going forward?

Let me just start by providing you kind of the general -- my general take on capital allocation, and then I'll go into the specifics of Canal. As you can see from all the actions that we're taking today, one of my key priorities, the first 90 days of being the CEO, was to focus on capital allocation. First, being mindful and aware of the current commodity cycle that we are today; and then second, the dislocation that we have in our capital markets. It was important to me to afford us the maximum flexibility when deploying capital, and to exert absolute financial discipline. I already talked about the actions that we're taking, one, on deleveraging and strengthening our balance sheet and ensuring that we go through this cycle and with a strong position to capitalize on opportunities; but importantly, that we're ready when the market turns around. Two, the recalibration of the dividend. And then three is the focus on cost savings and streamlining the cost structure on the organization. So when I think about Canal, it is not a capital allocation decision for 2016. It's a capital allocation decision that we will make in 2018, and at that point, we will evaluate the current environment. And on that perspective, then we'll make the determination what is the best use of our capital. But I want to make sure that we continue to generating low-cost options at good, good returns given the opportunity that we have to lock for 7 years a very constructive capacity prices. And as I told you in the prepared remarks, our focus in the Northeast, and particularly in New England, is focus on capacity revenues. Canal is a dual-fuel peaker that is needed in that market at good returns and is a capital allocation decision that we will make not today, where we are focusing all our attention in strengthening the balance sheet, but in 2 years."

One, I think this level is consistent with just the nature of our industry, capital intensive and cyclical. But secondly, when I look at the current dividend that we have and the underlying premises or principles that we used to implement it in 2012, a lot of them are not valid anymore. If you recall, when we announced the dividend back then, it was to highlight the value of contracted assets. Since then, we've created NRG Yield. We already talked about the -- one of the objective was the yield support. And in this current market environment and with the level of volatility that we're seeing in the stocks, it really doesn't accomplish that objective. So when I put the 2 together, one, the nature of our industry; and two, some of the principles that we have when we initiated it, it's just inconsistent. I think what you should expect is this number is the right number today, and it affords us the maximum flexibility for capital deployment and capital allocation. And that's -- that is my assessment right now on the dividend."

Michael, first of all, on the capital structure, as I've said in addressing Julien's question, we've obviously begun to make progress in terms of delevering that's been -- are confident in doing that, we're mindful of balancing, maintaining adequate liquidity at GenOn with the need to obviously attack the capital structure at the same time, which is why the asset sale process, obviously, kick-started that. We got a head start on it at the end of the year having announced a couple of asset sales. And we're moving forward, obviously, to close the second of those 2, and continuing to focus on completing the remaining $500 million -- or the remainder of the $500 million that we announced on the reset, which as I dedicated to Julien, given the fact that we -- we're very clear about the fact that we expect those assets to still be in the Northeast. If the expectation -- the knock-on expectation certainly is that, that would continue to be at the GenOn level. So we'd use the proceeds of those asset sales to continue to deploy towards deleveraging. And as we moved through the year, we're mindful of that 2017 maturity, which is why supplemented by those asset sales, a I indicated also to Julien's question, we're focused on the best means comprehensively to use the options at our disposal, not only asset sales but obviously we've got some secured debt capacity there that we're mindful of. So all I can tell you is as we progress through the year, we're going to focus on those alternatives and the best means possible. As I said, though, always be mindful of preserving the integrity of the balance sheet of NRG given the nonrecourse nature of the GenOn subsidiary, which will continue to be the case."

The current market in Texas has been very disappointed despite what I consider still pretty strong fundamentals, strong demand and a -- price signal that doesn't incentivize newbuild economics even though we have seen some, what I consider, out of -- non-economical entry. When I look at our portfolio, particularly the Parish lines on an STP, they are very large in scale, they're environmentally controlled, and I would say that they're probably one of the most cost-advantaged base load plants for coal and nuclear plants in the state. We have identified what we believe is the least competitive assets in the supply stack when it comes to coal. And we believe that if the market continues to be at these levels, it will not be possible to sustain the operation of some of these assets. So that's why I think there is going to be a supply rationalization in the immediate term, and we should see a recalibration of the market. I feel comfortable right now with 3 of our baseload plants. And -- but I think we have a pretty good track record in terms of if and when these plants are not economic and the prospects of these plants are not positive, we will act upon. And we have done that in other regions, and there is no reason why we wouldn't do it in Texas. But right now, still not the time, and I think the supply stack will react before we get to that point."

And this was -- good morning, Steve. This is one of the reason why, I think at a couple of points in my prepared remarks, I made specific reference to contextualize capital available for allocation, which we consider to be a cash surplus versus cash on the balance sheet. And so when we calculate that, we start with the minimum cash balance that we reserve at the NRG level. So we set aside $700 million for liquidity. Now that -- part of that liquidity is what we need for cash collateral postings, for example. So as we post cash collateral, we consider that a utilization of the minimum cash reserve. So whatever we deduct at any given time, think about it as $700 million of minimum cash minus the amount of cash collateral we've posted. Comprehensively, and this is outside of capital available for allocation, we focus on liquidity separately. So liquidity is that $700 million of minimum cash at the NRG level plus the $2.5 billion corporate credit facility. That's separate and apart from what we consider excess capital, which is what that $513 million that you referred to represents. Does that help?"

Joining me this morning is Kirkland Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions we have a lease of the chiller, Head of Our result is a; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. We're also really a good start for the year. Our financial performance was strong for the first quarter, allowing us to reaffirm guidance for the full year. We are making significant progress in our priorities are reducing costs, replacing capital and deleveraging the business. And importantly, we're bringing certain people to our platform with the conclusion of the GreenCo process. Let so let's start with our first quarter results. 
NRG delivered $812 million of adjusted EBITDA under very challenging market conditions. We remain focused on our day-to-day operations, achieving top quartile safety performance, good availability across our generation fleet and stable results from our results business. All of these, combined with our opportunity hedging program mitigate in the impact of the very weak wholesale prices that we experienced during the quarter. These results illustrate the strength of our platform and the unique value proposition that NRG offers. 
We are making good progress in our commitment to deleveraging the business. We retired $229 million of NRG debt or approximately 30% of our 2016 targets. Not only are we on track with our original plans, we had expanded the total capital available for deleveraging to $1.3 billion after adding $253 million from our Midwest Generation capacity monetization financing, which Kirk will provide additional details on during his remarks. 
Finally, this quarter, we're taking another part and step forward in simplifying our business as we concluded after much consideration to GreenCo process. With the integration of business renewables last quarter and now the resolution for our Home Solar and EVgo businesses, which I will cover in more detail in a few slides, we have turned the page and this period of uncertainty and now are focused on executing our plan. On our last call, I spent some time talking about diversification as a necessary condition to succeed in the future of competitive our industry. Today, I want to expand on the multilingual that NRG has to deliver value to our shareholders. 
Now turning to Slide 5, I have outlined the 3 key macro levers that describe the earnings potential of our business. Over the years, we have successfully repositioned of the company away from solely relying on Entergy margins to other more stable and predictable sources of revenue. So let me start with the first lever, which now represents 2/3 of our economic gross margin. This comes from parts of our business that are either not directly correlated to or that are countercyclical to the price of natural gas, including our retail business, contracted generation and capacity payments. This lever of our business provides a stable base of predictable and visible earnings potential of a quality that differentiate us from many other in our industry, and we do it at significant scale across all 3 areas. 
Keep in mind this base is also growing, given market trends in new renewables and contracted generation, where our relationship with NRG Yield will continue to be a competitive advantage in the future. Now let's talk about the second and third leverage that comprise the other 1/3 of our economic gross margin, which is directly tied to the price of gas and power. 
These portions relative share have declined over the years given the prolonged weak commodity price environment. But we have deliberately maintained off-site through fuel diversity, unsightly of the current gas pricing environment is all sustainable in the medium to long run. And we want to be there with scale when the market recovers. 
The second lever is what I refer to as the field spread. This is the traditional way we have made money, selling coal, oil and uranium at gas prices. These effectively a synthetic long gas position. For those of you invest in the E&P sector, we're long roughly about 3 Bcf a day of gas. So for every $0.50 move in gas prices, our portfolio has a potential to buy $0.5 billion in additional gross margin. 
Let me be clear. We're not yet agnostic and don't want to be gas agnostic as we believe current prices are not sustainable. The third lever is our power spread or feed rate exposure. As power markets tighten due to retirements or low growth, we maintained significant off-site to increasing power prices, as we have the largest competitive our portfolio in the country with close to 50,000 miles of generation with both geographics and merit order diversification. 
So when people ask me why I'm convinced we have the right platform to be the leader in the competitive power space today and into the future, this is why. Success in this industry is all about diversification of the business and core operational excellence. Our platform is designed to deliver results given any difficult market, and given how unpredictable to the markets can be, having a stability in our core platform is critical. At the same time, our leverage to any market recovery should be embraced not explored because it is quite substantial. And when you coupled these dynamics with our commitment to strengthening our balance sheet and streamlining our costs, I have no doubt that NRG is built to thrive under a variety of market conditions. 
So moving on to our next slide. I want to touch briefly on key developments across our markets. WE are encouraged by recent acts rents from regulators in support of competitive markets. We are pleased that first quarter has secondly stopped the out of market PPAs for AP and for Ohio. It is also encouraging that the U.S. Supreme Court decided to invalidate Maryland contract created for the sole purpose of suppressing capacity prices. 
In PJM, the transition to the capacity performance product has brought higher capacity payments in exchange for higher performance commitments, as we pivoted our fleet accordingly. Our program of transforming coal plants to gas was undertaken with an eye towards becoming a provider of reliability. 
In Texas, we're optimistic in as we see up to 9 gigawatts of coal generation at risk due to upcoming environmental regulations and continued strong growth. In addition, we expect market changes to RDC with the purpose of increasing prices to better reflect scarcity conditions. And in the West, while the oh so kind of issue will present reliability challenges for the California ISO over the next year, we do not expect decision to have significant impact to our generation portfolio since most of our revenue in California is supported by PPAs and RA contracts. 
Also, our newest merchant plant, Sunrise, us supplied of the current River pipeline and thereof not impacted. We hope this becomes a catalyst to address gas power coordination and fuel cost recovery issues that are much needed in California. 
Turning to Slide 7. Let me now discuss the details around the conclusion of the GreenCo process that we started in September of last year. Last quarter, I explained that there were 3 objectives we saw to accomplish in this process, maintain our capability to take advantage of renewable trends at appropriate investment returns, incorporate all of our businesses into our financial results and to minimize the use of the $125 million revolver. 
Today, I'm here to tell you we have met our objectives and have concluded the process. To do a quick recap, beginning last quarter, where we integrated business renewables, which allows us to maintain a strong position in the renewables market. This business is now fully integrated, and I will be updating you on each progress in the months to come. 
Moving to residential solar. We honored 2 comprehensive strategic review process over the past 6 months to determine the best course of action to realize value, to minimize capital needs and like business renewables, ensure we do not lose the ability to meet renewable energy demands across all types of customers. 
While our original goal was to secure permitting capital and deconsolidate the enterprise, we were not able to move forward in this direction in a that met all our objectives. Today, we're announcing a change in our approach to residential solar that will allow us to meet them. 
First, we're both streamlining and simplifying the organization by significantly lowering the cost structure and focusing in markets where we have a competitive advantage. Residential solar will become a product in our retail offering, and we intend to fully integrate into our retail business by 2017. Second, we are changing our business model to focus on origination, installation and direct third-party sales, which will allow us to simplify of financial reporting by providing immediate revenue recognition. I am pleased to announce new partnerships with both Sunrun and Spruce Financial, which will allow us to execute on this plan. Our approach comes with significant changes in our overall organization, cost structure and business model. This model allows us to maintain our 2016 financial guidance as we transition the business throughout the remainder of 2016 to be at least an EBITDA breakeven business by 2017.
While this is not a business you can expect to hear about each quarter, our strategy for this business is important to our organization, allowing us to maintain a viable yet rightsized structure so that when the market economics are viable, we can offer residential solar to our existing 3 million customers. 
We have also concluded the strategic review process for our electric vehicle charging network or EVgo. I am announcing today the sale of our majority stake of this business to Vision Ridge Partners. NRG will receive total consideration of approximately $50 million with $19.5 million upfront available to NRG and $30 million remaining in the EVgo platform. 
In addition, NRG have some earnout potential of up to $70 million through 2022. Under this structure, NRG will have -- will not have any ongoing capital commitments to EVgo other than its obligations under the California settlement. With the closing of this transaction, EVgo results will no longer be consolidated into NRG financial statements. 
With the conclusion of the GreenCo process, the $125 million revolver is no longer necessary and will be eliminated as we move forward and execute on our new plans. On Slide 8, I want to provide you an update from the great progress we have made in streamlining our cost structure. We are on track to realize $250 million in recurring cost savings in overhead and O&M, and we have made significant progress in our new for NRG program targets. This means that over the next 2 years, we will have taken an impressive $400 million in total cost out of the system. 
Additionally, you will be able to track these costs in our disclosures to see our progress as we move through the subsequent quarters. While I'm very pleased with our efforts today, I expect that we will be able to find even more opportunities to reduce our cost structure as we continue with our remaining asset sales, the integration of the residential solar business and our push to find even more opportunities to streamline the organization. 
So with that, I will turn it to Kirk for the financial review."

Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 10, NRG delivered $812 million and adjusted EBITDA and $249 million in free cash flow before growth in the first quarter of 2016. Having now concluded the Green",537,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 10, NRG delivered $812 million and adjusted EBITDA and $249 million in free cash flow before growth in the first quarter of 2016. Having now concluded the GreenCo process, our financial results and our guidance now include both EVgo and the newly restructured residential solar within our corporate segment, which is part of the generation and renewable subset of our consolidated guidance. 
With all businesses now included, we are reaffirming our 2016 full year guidance for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. During the quarter, we continued our deleveraging program and have now retired a total of $229 million of NRG corporate debt year-to-date through May 4, leading to an additional annualized cash interest savings of $60 million. 
Finally, to update our progress in achieving our target of $1 billion in incremental consolidated available capital, which was announced on September 18 of last year, NRG has now completed a non-recourse monetization of future PJM capacity revenues from our Midwest Generation fleet for cash proceeds of $253 million. This transaction, which will be accounted for as a non-recourse debt financing with no impact on adjusted EBITDA, represents the final component of our plan to free up $1 billion of 2016 capital, leaving only the balance of our $500 million asset sale target, and we expect to complete this over the balance of this year. 
Turning to Slide 11. The Midwest gen non-recourse capacity modernization proceeds of $253 million increases our 2016 capital available for allocation by $210 million versus our prior expectation as we reviewed during our year-end earnings call. The remaining $43 million in financing proceeds represents the acceleration of capacity revenues within 2016, which were already included in the NRG level of free cash flow before growth guidance mid-point, which was part of the $1.488 billion in 2016 capital available, as shown in our year-end earnings materials. 
Including the Midwest Gen proceeds, total 2016 capital available for allocation now stands at approximately $1.7 billion at the NRG level. 
We expect to allocate this incremental capital to further advance our deleveraging efforts oral or tentatively, to repay our convertible preferred stock, which based on the conversion price relative to our current share price, presents a compelling potential opportunity. The drop-down of NRG's remaining stake in CVSR to NRG Yield continues to represent an additional opportunity to further supplement NRG level capital available, and we intend to offer this remaining stake to NRG Yield during the quarter. 
Finally, liquidity stands at $1.9 billion as of March 31, which includes $589 million of cash at the NRG level, which has been since supplemented with the proceeds from the Midwest Gen capacity metallization, which close just following the quarter end. 
Finally, turning refleet to Slide 12. Our continued progress on deleveraging keeps us on track to bring our 2016 corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio below our target as we position NRG's balance sheet to maintain adherence to our 4.25x target ratio even through a continued low commodity price cycle. And we will continue to update this analysis as our debt reduction program progresses. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to the Mauricio."

This is the scorecard that I will share with you throughout the rest of the year. 
As you can see, we have made considerable progress in just the first few months of the year. Addressing the general debt is among one of our highest priorities, given both the overall debt level and maturities in 2017 and 2018. We're actively evaluating alternatives to optimize the capital structure with a focus on maximizing value for all stakeholders. 
With this objective in mind, we expect to be engaging in discussions with general creditors as part of this process in the near term. As we evaluate alternatives, we remain committed to our prudent balance sheet management principles, including maintaining our target corporate credit metrics. We remain focused on executing our current strategy and with the reintegration of renewables, we are not in a position to reintegrate the development pipeline and provide certainty to NRG Yield growth potential. I believe we now have all the business to move forward and demonstrate the value of our integrated platform.

Greg, I mean, we actually went to a process that took a significant amount of time. During this time, I think everybody knows that the -- we knew that the conditions, both in the capital markets and the that through the beginning of the year, were pretty challenging for both the residential solar business as a whole, but also on the capital market. So this was not the best time to be in the market. We knew that, that's why we are looking at the ceiling the majority stake, not all of it, because we wanted to maintain optionality on the Texas market, where we think we have a significant asset in our customers to be able to offer them residential solar. I think when you couple that with this change in the business model, where it's effectively, we sell, install and flip to a third-party. And importantly, refocusing the business where we actually have been successful in the past and reducing significantly the cost structure, we felt that, that combination was the best task for maximizing value for this business. And I think we provide that over the next 12 months. We expect that business to be at least breakeven in 2017. I've always looked at residential solar as another product in our retail offering. It makes a whole lot of sense if we already have that relationship with the residential customer. And this is one of the products that they are asking for it that we provided. I mean, we can't provided in early that is cost-effective and that we can great value, we should have it in our line of product offering. So I think the rationale is there. I think the appetite from customers for rooftop solar is there. We just needed to make pretty significant changes in the way we can structure the business model to ensure that it was quite candidly a profitable one.

But actually, the Midwest Gen financing, to answer your question, is it worth it? Yes. And I think as we disclosed in the press release, certainly, in the Q, a cost of just under 4.5%. And that is basically the way to think about the cost of financing. The way that it works mechanically is you're basically monetizing today the discount and the implied cost from an interest rate standpoint is that kind of 4.5 type costs. Relative to the opportunity certainly that we have and even relative to what the path that we were on exporting predict recently, which is the term loan B market, we see that as an attractive cost as you well put it, to bring cash forward today to take advantage of opportunities. And obviously, get ahead in our deleveraging part -- progress. I mean, certainly, we are focused on doing that, but we are cognizant of the fact that rightsizing the balance sheet is important today so that we can preserve flexibility for the company tomorrow. And this $250 million net 2 10, as I mentioned, for 2016 is an important step in that direction for us. As far as our overall debt is concerned, our long-term notes are still trading at a margin smaller discount. They've recruited largely closer to par even on the long dated maturities, which from a silly standpoint of opportunistically purchasing debt as a discount makes it more expensive. But as you well know, we are a serial issuer or a serial lower all that from our refinancing opportunity standpoint. So that certainly, I feel like more comfortable with what that means in terms of broader and that ideal quality I think underpinned by what were on the path as you drive these ratios down, and also giving us great flexibly on refinancing front. So the total package, I like where we are today. I think we've probably seen 350 basis points of rally on the long side just since our last earnings call."

What we need to do is we need to look at it in the context of all the dynamics in that market. What are the prospects for each of those plants? And what exactly is what that plant provides to the system that eventually will be captured in the prices. So that's, I guess, where I see that. What I will tell you is that we have an absolute commitment to operate plants that are economic. We have, I think, a pretty good track record in terms of retiring plants where the system doesn't need them in the past over the last 10 years. And even, since the beginning of this year, we have retired close to a gigawatt of generation in Western New York and Texas because the market just doesn't supported and because we felt that the economic prospects in those particular markets were not going to support it.

Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. We're also really good start for the year. Our financial performance was strong for the first quarter, allowing us to reaffirm guidance for the full year. We are making significant progress in our priorities for reducing costs, replenishing capital and deleveraging the business. And importantly, we're bringing certain people to our platform with a conclusion of the GreenCo process. So let me start with our first quarter results.
NRG delivered $812 million of adjusted EBITDA under very challenging market conditions. We remain focused on our day-to-day operations, achieving top quartile safety performance, good availability across our generation fleet, and stable results from our Retail business. All of these, combined with our opportunity hedging program mitigated the impact of the very weak wholesale prices that we experienced during the quarter. These results illustrate the strength of our platform and the unique value proposition that NRG offers. 
We are making good progress in our commitment to deleveraging the business. We retired $229 million of NRG debt or approximately 30% of our 2016 targets. Not only are we on track with our original plans, we have expanded the total capital available for deleveraging to $1.3 billion after adding $253 million from our Midwest Generation capacity monetization financing, which Kirk will provide additional details on during his remarks.
Finally, this quarter, we're taking another important step forward in simplifying our business as we concluded after much consideration to GreenCo process. With the reintegration of business renewables last quarter and now the resolution for our Home Solar and eVgo businesses, which I will cover in more detail in a few slides, we have turned the page on this period of uncertainty and now are focused on executing our plan. On our last call, I spent some time talking about the merits of diversification as a necessary condition to succeed in the future of a competitive fire industry. Today, I want to expand on the multiple levers that NRG has to deliver value to our shareholders.
Now turning to Slide 5, I have outlined the 3 key macro levers that describe the earnings potential of our business. Over the years, we have successfully repositioned the company away from solely relying on energy margins to other more stable and predictable sources of revenue. So let me start with the first lever, which now represents 2/3 of our economic gross margin. These comes from parts of our business that are either not directly correlated to or that are countercyclical to the price of natural gas, including our retail business, contracted generation and capacity payments. This lever of our business provides a stable base of predictable and visible earnings potential, a quality that differentiate us from many others in our industry, and we do it at significant scale across all 3 areas.
Keep in mind this base is also growing, given market trends in renewables and contracted generation, where our relationship with NRG Yield will continue to be a competitive advantage in the future. Now let's talk about the second and third lever that comprise the other 1/3 of our economic gross margin, which is directly tied to the price of gas and power.
These portions relative share have declined over the years given the prolonged weak commodity price environment. But we have deliberately maintained off-site through fuel diversity as I believe the current gas pricing environment is unsustainable in the medium to long run. And we want to be there with scale when the market recovers.
The second lever is what I refer to as the field spread. This is the traditional way we have made money, selling coal, oil and uranium at gas prices. It is effectively a synthetic loan gap position. For those of you who invest in the E&P sector, we're along, roughly about 3 Bcf a day of gas. So for every $0.03 move in gas prices, our portfolio has a potential to flex off by $0.5 billion in additional gross margin.  Let me be clear. We're not gas agnostic and don't want to be gas agnostic as we believe current prices are not sustainable. 
The third lever is our power spread or heat rate exposure. As power markets tighten due to retirements or low growth, we maintain significant off-site to increasing power prices, as we have the largest competitive power portfolio in the country, with close to 50,000 megawatts of generation with both geographic and merit order diversification.
So when people ask me why I am convinced, we have the right platform to be the leader in the competitive power space today and into the future, this is why success in this industry is all about diversification of the business and core operational excellence. Our platform is designed to deliver results even in a difficult market, and given how unpredictable the markets can be, having a stability in our core platform is critical. At the same time, our leverage to any market recovery should be embraced not ignored because it is quite substantial. And when you couple these dynamics with our commitment to strengthening our balance sheet and streamlining our costs, I have no doubt that NRG is built to thrive under a variety of market conditions.
So moving on to the next slide. I want to touch briefly on key developments across our markets. We are encouraged by recent action from regulators in support of competitive markets. We are pleased that FERC has stepped in to effectively stopped the out of market PPAs for AEP and for Synergy in Ohio. It is also encouraging that the U.S. Supreme Court decided to invalidate Maryland contract created for the sole purpose of suppressing capacity prices.
In PJM, the transition to the capacity performance product has brought a higher capacity payments in exchange for higher performance commitments as we pivoted our fleet accordingly. Our program of transforming coal plants to gas was undertaken with an eye towards becoming a provider of reliability.
In Texas, we're optimistic in [indiscernible] as we see up to 9 gigawatts of coal generation at risk due to upcoming environmental regulations and continued strong growth. In addition, we expect market changes to ORDC with the purpose of increasing prices to better reflect scarcity conditions. And in the West, while the  Aliso Canyon issue will present reliability challenges for the California ISO over the next year, we do not expect decision to have significant impact to our generation portfolio since most of our revenue in California is supported by PPAs and RA contracts. 
Also, our newest merchant plant, Sunrise, us supplied of the Kern River pipeline and thereof not impacted. We hope this becomes a catalyst to address gas power coordination and fuel cost recovery issues that are much needed in California. 
Turning to Slide 7. Let me now discuss the details around the conclusion of the GreenCo process that we started in September of last year. Last quarter, I explained that there were 3 objectives we saw to accomplish in this process, maintain our capability to take advantage of renewable trends at appropriate investment returns, incorporate all of our businesses into our financial results and to minimize the use of the $125 million revolver.
Today, I'm here to tell you we have met our objectives and have concluded the process. To do a quick recap, beginning last quarter, we reintegrated business renewables, which allows us to maintain a strong position in the renewables market. This business is now fully integrated, and I will be updating you on each progress in the months to come.
Moving to Residential Solar. We undertook a comprehensive strategic review process over the past 6 months to determine the best course of action to realize value, to minimize capital needs and like business renewables, ensure we do not lose the ability to meet renewable energy demands across all types of customers.
While our original goal was to secure permanent capital and deconsolidate the enterprise, we were not able to move forward in this direction in a way that met all our objectives. Today, we're announcing a change in our approach to residential solar that will allow us to meet them.
First, we're both streamlining and simplifying the organization by significantly lowering the cost structure and focusing in markets where we have a competitive advantage. Residential Solar will become a product in our retail offering, and we intend to fully integrate into our retail business by 2017. Second, we are changing our business model to focus on origination, installation and direct third-party sales, which will allow us to simplify financial reporting by providing immediate revenue recognition. I am pleased to announce new partnerships with both Sunrun and Spruce Financial, which will allow us to execute on this plan. 
Our approach comes with significant changes in our overall organization, cost structure and business model. This model allows us to maintain our 2016 financial guidance as we transition the business throughout the remainder of 2016 to be at least an EBITDA breakeven business by 2017.  While this is not a business you can expect to hear about each quarter, our strategy for this business is important to our organization, allowing us to maintain a viable yet rightsized structure so that when the market economics are viable, we can offer Residential Solar to our existing 3 million customers.
We have also concluded the strategic review process for our electric vehicle charging network or eVgo. I am announcing today the sale of a majority stake of this business to Vision Ridge Partners. NRG will receive total consideration of approximately $50 million with $19.5 million upfront available to NRG and $30 million remaining in the eVgo platform. 
In addition, NRG has some earnout potential of up to $70 million through 2022. Under this structure, NRG will have -- will not have any ongoing capital commitments to eVgo other than its obligations under the California settlement. With the closing of this transaction, eVgo results will no longer be consolidated into NRG financial statements.  With the conclusion of the GreenCo process, the $125 million revolver is no longer necessary and will be eliminated as we move forward and execute on our new plans. 
On Slide 8, I want to provide you an update from the great progress we have made in streamlining our cost structure. We are on track to realize $250 million in recurring cost savings in overhead and O&M, and we have made significant progress in our new fornrg program target. This means that over the next 2 years, we will have taken an impressive $400 million in total cost out of the system.
Additionally, you will be able to track these costs in our disclosures to see our progress as we move through the subsequent quarters. While I'm very pleased with our efforts today, I expect that we will be able to find even more opportunities to reduce our cost structure as we continue with our remaining asset sales, the integration of the Residential Solar business and our push to find even more opportunities to streamline the organization. 
So with that, I will turn it to Kirk for the financial review."

Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 10, NRG delivered $812 million and adjusted EBITDA and $249 million in free cash flow before growth in the first quarter of 2016. Having now concluded the Green",535,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 10, NRG delivered $812 million and adjusted EBITDA and $249 million in free cash flow before growth in the first quarter of 2016. Having now concluded the GreenCo process, our financial results and our guidance now include both eVgo and the newly restructured Residential Solar within our corporate segment, which is part of the generation and renewable subset of our consolidated guidance.  With all businesses now included, we are reaffirming our 2016 full year guidance for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. 
During the quarter, we continued our deleveraging program and have now retired a total of $229 million of NRG corporate debt year-to-date through May 4, leading to an additional annualized cash interest savings of $60 million.
Finally, to update our progress in achieving our target of $1 billion in incremental consolidated available capital, which was announced on September 18 of last year, NRG has now completed a non-recourse monetization of future PJM capacity revenues from our Midwest Generation fleet for cash proceeds of $253 million. This transaction, which will be accounted for as a nonrecourse debt financing with no impact on adjusted EBITDA, represents the final component of our plan to free up $1 billion of 2016 capital, leaving only the balance of our $500 million asset sale target, and we expect to complete this over the balance of this year.
Turning to Slide 11. The Midwest Gen nonrecourse capacity monetization proceeds of $253 million increases our 2016 capital available for allocation by $210 million versus our prior expectation as we reviewed during our year-end earnings call. The remaining $43 million in financing proceeds represents the acceleration of capacity revenues within 2016, which were already included in the NRG level of free cash flow before growth guidance mid-point, which was part of the $1.488 billion in 2016 capital available as shown in our year-end earnings materials.
Including the Midwest Gen proceeds, total 2016 capital available for allocation now stands at approximately $1.7 billion at the NRG level.
We expect to allocate this incremental capital to further advance our deleveraging efforts or alternatively to repay our convertible preferred stock, which based on the conversion price, relative to our current share price, presents a compelling potential opportunity. The drop-down of NRG's remaining stake in CVSR to NRG Yield continues to represent an additional opportunity to further supplement NRG level capital available, and we intend to offer this remaining stake to NRG Yield during the quarter.
Finally, liquidity stands at $1.9 billion as of March 31, which includes $589 million of cash at the NRG level, which has since been supplemented with the proceeds from the Midwest Gen capacity monetization, which closed just following the quarter end.
Finally, turning to briefly to Slide 12. Our continued progress on deleveraging keeps us on track to bring our 2016 corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio below our target as we position NRG's balance sheet to maintain adherence to our 4.25x target ratio even through a continued low commodity price cycle. And we will continue to update this analysis as our debt reduction program progresses.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio."

With this objective in mind, we expect to be engaging in discussions with general creditors as a part of this process in the near term. As we evaluate alternatives, we remain committed to our prudent balance sheet management principles, including maintaining our target corporate credit metrics. We remain focused on executing our current strategy and with the reintegration of renewables, we are now in a position to reinvigorate the development pipeline and provide certainty to NRG Yield's growth potential. I believe, we now have all the pieces to move forward and demonstrate the value of our integrated platform.
So with that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions."

Greg, I mean, we've actually went through a process that took a significant amount of time. During this time, I think everybody knows that the -- we knew that the conditions, both in the capital markets and then through the beginning of the year, were pretty challenging for both the Residential Solar business as a whole, but also on the capital market. So this was not the best time to be in the market. We knew that, that's why we are looking at selling the majority stake, not all of it, because we wanted to maintain the optionality on the Texas market, where we think we have a significant asset in our customers to be able to offer them residential solar. I think when you couple that with this change in the business model, where it's effectively, we sell, install and flip to a third-party. And importantly, refocusing the business, where we actually have been successful in the past and reducing significantly the cost structure, we felt that, that combination was the best task for maximizing value for this business. And I think we provide that over the next 12 months. We expect that business to be at least breakeven in 2017. I've always looked at residential solar as another product in our retail offering. It makes a whole lot of sense if we already have that relationship with the path customer. And this is one of the products that they are asking for it that we provided. And if we can provide it in a way that is cost-effective and that we can great value, we should have it in our line up of product offering. So I think that the rationale is there. I think the appetite from customers for rooftop solar is there. We just needed to make pretty significant changes in the way we can structure the business model to ensure that it was quite candidly a profitable one. And I think that -- those are the steps that we have taken."

If we now have already a relationship with a customer that is buying system power, we will be using those same vehicles to offer now rooftop solar and potentially decrease our -- the cost or the -- the cost of selling that we had on a stand-alone basis. So I mean, I think this way, we create not only a lot of synergies by including in our retail business, but we also are being very disciplined in terms of the size and the scope of this business as we transition to this period and importantly maintain the option to, if this becomes viable in Texas, we can offer this to our 3 million customers because that to me is the price.

But actually, the Midwest Gen financing, to answer your question, and is it worth it? Yes. As I think as we disclosed in the press release, certainly, in the Q, our cost of just under 4.5%. And that is basically the way to think about the cost of financing. The way that it works mechanically is you're basically monetizing today the discount and the implied cost from an interest rate standpoint, is that kind of 4.5% type cost. Relative to the opportunity certainly that we have, and even relative to what the path that we were on exploring previously, which is the term loan B market, we see that as at an attractive cost as you well put it, to bring cash forward today to take advantage of opportunities. And obviously, get ahead in our deleveraging part of progress. I mean, certainly, we are focused on doing that, but we are cognizant of the fact that rightsizing the balance sheet is important today so that we can preserve flexibility for the company tomorrow. And this $250 million net $210 million as I mentioned, for 2016 is an important step in that direction for us. And apart -- as part of our overall debt is concerned, our long-term notes are still trading at a much smaller discount. They recruited largely closer to par even on the long-dated maturities, which from the certainly, from the standpoint of opportunistically purchasing debt as a discount, makes it more expensive. But as you well know, we are a serial issuer or a serial roller of debt from a refinancing opportunity standpoint. So that certainly, I feel a lot more comfortable with what that means in terms of the barometer and the confidence that value of market has in the quality of our credit, I think underpinned by what we're on the path as we're driving those ratios down, and also giving us greater flexibility on the refinancing front. So in the total package, I like where we are today. I mean, I think we've probably seen 350 basis points of rally on the long side just since our last earning call."

And this is based on economic generation that we can see today at current markets.

I think what the -- from our perspective, and we don't provide specific information on a plant-by-plant basis. But I will tell you is, in Texas, we actually have a higher threshold than if we were a stand-alone generator. And the reason why is because of our integrated model. So we actually achieve significant amount of synergies and value by pointing generation to retail. We avoid a lot of charges. We avoid friction costs. So we have this higher threshold when it comes to evaluating the economic viability of the plant. But again, I don't think we can take a -- we can make a decision of retiring a plant based on 1 month or 3 months of very low commodity prices, which, to be fair, we have very effectively mitigated with our hedging philosophy and strategy. What we need to do is we need to look at it in the context of all the dynamics in that market. What are the prospects for each of those plants? And what exactly is what that plant provides to the system that eventually will be captured in the prices. So that's, I guess, where I see that. And what I will tell you is that we have an absolute commitment to operate plants that are economic. We have, I think, a pretty good track record in terms of retiring plants where the system doesn't need them in the past for the -- over the last 10 years. And even since the beginning of this year, we have retired close to a gigawatt of generation in Western New York and Texas because the market just doesn't support it and because we felt that the economic prospects in those particular markets were not going to support it. But I think investors should rest assured that we will make the right economic decision. But we need to make sure that we go beyond the next month and we look at the prospects going forward."

And to be candid, I mean, it is a reflection, and it has to be -- it is an imperative in this commodity cycle. So we are looking across not just overhead, but also operations O&M. And that is an area of focus, as we're seeing changes in dispatch profiles and changes in terms of how our units get compensated, specifically moving from energy-driven margins to capacity-driven margins.

Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. We're off to a really good start for the year. Our financial performance was strong for the first quarter, allowing us to reaffirm guidance for the full year. We are making significant progress in our priorities for reducing costs, replenishing capital and deleveraging the business. And importantly, we're bringing certain people to our platform with a conclusion of the GreenCo process. So let me start with our first quarter results.
NRG delivered $812 million of adjusted EBITDA under very challenging market conditions. We remain focused on our day-to-day operations, achieving top quartile safety performance, good availability across our generation fleet, and stable results from our Retail business. All of these, combined with our opportunity hedging program mitigated the impact of the very weak wholesale prices that we experienced during the quarter. These results illustrate the strength of our platform and the unique value proposition that NRG offers. 
We are making good progress in our commitment to deleveraging the business. We retired $229 million of NRG debt or approximately 30% of our 2016 targets. Not only are we on track with our original plans, we have expanded the total capital available for deleveraging to $1.3 billion after adding $253 million from our Midwest Generation capacity monetization financing, which Kirk will provide additional details on during his remarks.
Finally, this quarter, we're taking another important step forward in simplifying our business as we concluded after much consideration to GreenCo process. With the reintegration of business renewables last quarter and now the resolution for our Home Solar and eVgo businesses, which I will cover in more detail in a few slides, we have turned the page on this period of uncertainty and now are focused on executing our plan. On our last call, I spent some time talking about the merits of diversification as a necessary condition to succeed in the future of a competitive power industry. Today, I want to expand on the multiple levers that NRG has to deliver value to our shareholders.
Now turning to Slide 5, I have outlined the 3 key macro levers that describe the earnings potential of our business. Over the years, we have successfully repositioned the company away from solely relying on energy margins to other more stable and predictable sources of revenue. So let me start with the first lever, which now represents 2/3 of our economic gross margin. These comes from parts of our business that are either not directly correlated to or that are countercyclical to the price of natural gas, including our retail business, contracted generation and capacity payments. This lever of our business provides a stable base of predictable and visible earnings potential, a quality that differentiate us from many others in our industry, and we do it at significant scale across all 3 areas.
Keep in mind this base is also growing, given market trends in renewables and contracted generation, where our relationship with NRG Yield will continue to be a competitive advantage in the future. Now let's talk about the second and third lever that comprise the other 1/3 of our economic gross margin, which is directly tied to the price of gas and power.
These portions relative share have declined over the years given the prolonged weak commodity price environment. But we have deliberately maintained off-site through fuel diversity as I believe the current gas pricing environment is unsustainable in the medium to long run. And we want to be there with scale when the market recovers.
The second lever is what I refer to as the fuel spread. This is the traditional way we have made money, selling coal, oil and uranium at gas prices. It is effectively a synthetic long gas position. For those of you who invest in the E&P sector, we're long, roughly about 3 Bcf a day of gas. So for every $0.03 move in gas prices, our portfolio has a potential to flex off by $0.5 billion in additional gross margin.  Let me be clear. We're not gas agnostic and don't want to be gas agnostic as we believe current prices are not sustainable. 
The third lever is our power spread or heat rate exposure. As power markets tighten due to retirements or low growth, we maintain significant upside to increasing power prices, as we have the largest competitive power portfolio in the country, with close to 50,000 megawatts of generation with both geographic and merit order diversification.
So when people ask me why I am convinced, we have the right platform to be the leader in the competitive power space today and into the future, this is why. Success in this industry is all about diversification of the business and core operational excellence. Our platform is designed to deliver results even in a difficult market, and given how unpredictable the markets can be, having a stability in our core platform is critical. At the same time, our leverage to any market recovery should be embraced not ignored because it is quite substantial. And when you couple these dynamics with our commitment to strengthening our balance sheet and streamlining our costs, I have no doubt that NRG is built to thrive under a variety of market conditions.
So moving on to the next slide. I want to touch briefly on key developments across our markets. We are encouraged by recent action from regulators in support of competitive markets. We are pleased that FERC has stepped in to effectively stop the out of market PPAs for AEP and for Synergy in Ohio. It is also encouraging that the U.S. Supreme Court decided to invalidate Maryland contract created for the sole purpose of suppressing capacity prices.
In PJM, the transition to the capacity performance product has brought higher capacity payments in exchange for higher performance commitments as we pivoted our fleet accordingly. Our program of transforming coal plants to gas was undertaken with an eye towards becoming a provider of reliability.
In Texas, we're optimistic in [indiscernible] as we see up to 9 gigawatts of coal generation at risk due to upcoming environmental regulations and continued strong growth. In addition, we expect market changes to ORDC with the purpose of increasing prices to better reflect scarcity conditions. And in the West, while the  Aliso Canyon issue will present reliability challenges for the California ISO over the next year, we do not expect decision to have significant impact to our generation portfolio since most of our revenue in California is supported by PPAs and RA contracts. 
Also, our newest merchant plant, Sunrise, is supplied off the Kern River pipeline and thereof not impacted. We hope this becomes a catalyst to address gas power coordination and fuel cost recovery issues that are much needed in California. 
Turning to Slide 7. Let me now discuss the details around the conclusion of the GreenCo process that we started in September of last year. Last quarter, I explained that there were 3 objectives we saw to accomplishing this process, maintain our capability to take advantage of renewable trends at appropriate investment returns, incorporate all of our businesses into our financial results and to minimize the use of the $125 million revolver.
Today, I'm here to tell you we have met our objectives and have concluded the process. To do a quick recap, beginning last quarter, we reintegrated business renewables, which allows us to maintain a strong position in the renewables market. This business is now fully integrated, and I will be updating you on each progress in the months to come.
Moving to Residential Solar. We undertook a comprehensive strategic review process over the past 6 months to determine the best course of action to realize value, to minimize capital needs and like business renewables, ensure we do not lose the ability to meet renewable energy demands across all types of customers.
While our original goal was to secure permanent capital and deconsolidate the enterprise, we were not able to move forward in this direction in a way that met all our objectives. Today, we're announcing a change in our approach to residential solar that will allow us to meet them.
First, we're both streamlining and simplifying the organization by significantly lowering the cost structure and focusing in markets where we have a competitive advantage. Residential Solar will become a product in our retail offering, and we intend to fully integrate into our retail business by 2017. Second, we are changing our business model to focus on origination, installation and direct third-party sales, which will allow us to simplify financial reporting by providing immediate revenue recognition. I am pleased to announce new partnerships with both Sunrun and Spruce Financial, which will allow us to execute on this plan. 
Our approach comes with significant changes in our overall organization, cost structure and business model. This model allows us to maintain our 2016 financial guidance as we transition the business throughout the remainder of 2016 to be at least an EBITDA breakeven business by 2017.  While this is not a business you can expect to hear about each quarter, our strategy for this business is important to our organization, allowing us to maintain a viable yet rightsized structure so that when the market economics are viable, we can offer Residential Solar to our existing 3 million customers.
We have also concluded the strategic review process for our electric vehicle charging network or eVgo. I am announcing today the sale of a majority stake of this business to Vision Ridge Partners. NRG will receive total consideration of approximately $50 million with $19.5 million upfront available to NRG and $30 million remaining in the eVgo platform. 
In addition, NRG has some earnout potential of up to $70 million through 2022. Under this structure, NRG will have -- will not have any ongoing capital commitments to eVgo other than its obligations under the California settlement. With the closing of this transaction, eVgo results will no longer be consolidated into NRG financial statements.  With the conclusion of the GreenCo process, the $125 million revolver is no longer necessary and will be eliminated as we move forward and execute on our new plans. 
On Slide 8, I want to provide you an update from the great progress we have made in streamlining our cost structure. We are on track to realize $250 million in recurring cost savings in overhead and O&M, and we have made significant progress in our new FORNRG program target. This means that over the next 2 years, we will have taken an impressive $400 million in total costs out of the system.
Additionally, you will be able to track these costs in our disclosures to see our progress as we move through the subsequent quarters. While I'm very pleased with our efforts today, I expect that we will be able to find even more opportunities to reduce our cost structure as we continue with our remaining asset sales, the integration of the Residential Solar business and our push to find even more opportunities to streamline the organization. 
So with that, I will turn it to Kirk for the financial review."

Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 10, NRG delivered $812 million and adjusted EBITDA and $249 million in free cash flow before growth in the first quarter of 2016. Having now concluded the Green",535,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 10, NRG delivered $812 million and adjusted EBITDA and $249 million in free cash flow before growth in the first quarter of 2016. Having now concluded the GreenCo process, our financial results and our guidance now include both eVgo and the newly restructured Residential Solar within our corporate segment, which is part of the generation and renewable subset of our consolidated guidance.  With all businesses now included, we are reaffirming our 2016 full year guidance for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. 
During the quarter, we continued our deleveraging program and have now retired a total of $229 million of NRG corporate debt year-to-date through May 4, leading to an additional annualized cash interest savings of $60 million.
Finally, to update our progress in achieving our target of $1 billion in incremental consolidated available capital, which was announced on September 18 of last year, NRG has now completed a non-recourse monetization of future PJM capacity revenues from our Midwest Generation fleet for cash proceeds of $253 million. This transaction, which will be accounted for as a nonrecourse debt financing with no impact on adjusted EBITDA, represents the final component of our plan to free up $1 billion of 2016 capital, leaving only the balance of our $500 million asset sale target, and we expect to complete this over the balance of this year.
Turning to Slide 11. The Midwest Gen nonrecourse capacity monetization proceeds of $253 million increases our 2016 capital available for allocation by $210 million versus our prior expectation as we reviewed during our year-end earnings call. The remaining $43 million in financing proceeds represents the acceleration of capacity revenues within 2016, which were already included in the NRG level of free cash flow before growth guidance mid-point, which was part of the $1.488 billion in 2016 capital available as shown in our year-end earnings materials.
Including the Midwest Gen proceeds, total 2016 capital available for allocation now stands at approximately $1.7 billion at the NRG level.
We expect to allocate this incremental capital to further advance our deleveraging efforts or alternatively to repay our convertible preferred stock, which based on the conversion price, relative to our current share price, presents a compelling potential opportunity. The drop-down of NRG's remaining stake in CVSR to NRG Yield continues to represent an additional opportunity to further supplement NRG level capital available, and we intend to offer this remaining stake to NRG Yield during the quarter.
Finally, liquidity stands at $1.9 billion as of March 31, which includes $589 million of cash at the NRG level, which has since been supplemented with the proceeds from the Midwest Gen capacity monetization, which closed just following the quarter end.
Finally, turning to briefly to Slide 12. Our continued progress on deleveraging keeps us on track to bring our 2016 corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio below our target as we position NRG's balance sheet to maintain adherence to our 4.25x target ratio even through a continued low commodity price cycle. And we will continue to update this analysis as our debt reduction program progresses.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio."

And in closing, I wanted to remind everyone of our priorities in Slide 14. This is the scorecard that I will share with you throughout the rest of the year.
As you can see, we have made considerable progress in just the first few months of the year. Addressing the general debt is among one of our highest priorities, given both the overall debt level and maturities in 2017 and 2018. We're actively evaluating alternatives to optimize the capital structure with a focus on maximizing value for all stakeholders.
With this objective in mind, we expect to be engaging in discussions with general creditors as a part of this process in the near term. As we evaluate alternatives, we remain committed to our prudent balance sheet management principles, including maintaining our target corporate credit metrics. We remain focused on executing our current strategy and with the reintegration of renewables, we are now in a position to reinvigorate the development pipeline and provide certainty to NRG Yield's growth potential. I believe, we now have all the pieces to move forward and demonstrate the value of our integrated platform.

So rather than you then seeing proceeds come in, in terms of a return of capital and CapEx go out in advance of that, that is now going to be revenue, which is what we will receive for lock, stock and barrel the entirety of the system to Sunrun or Spruce, and then they will also retain the ongoing obligations to manage and operate the system, O&M and the like.

Greg, I mean, we've actually went through a process that took a significant amount of time. During this time, I think everybody knows that the -- we knew that the conditions, both in the capital markets and then through the beginning of the year, were pretty challenging for both the Residential Solar business as a whole, but also on the capital market. So this was not the best time to be in the market. We knew that, that's why we were looking at selling the majority stake, not all of it, because we wanted to maintain the optionality on the Texas market, where we think we have a significant asset in our customers to be able to offer them residential solar. I think when you couple that with this change in the business model, where it's effectively, we sell, install and flip to a third-party. And importantly, refocusing the business, where we actually have been successful in the past and reducing significantly the cost structure, we felt that, that combination was the best path for maximizing value for this business. And I think we provide that over the next 12 months. We expect that business to be at least breakeven in 2017. I've always looked at residential solar as another product in our retail offering. It makes a whole lot of sense if we already have that relationship with the residential customer. And this is one of the products that they are asking for it that we provided. And if we can provide it in a way that is cost-effective and that we can great value, we should have it in our lineup of product offering. So I think that the rationale is there. I think the appetite from customers for rooftop solar is there. We just needed to make pretty significant changes in the way we could structure the business model to ensure that it was quite candidly a profitable one. And I think that -- those are the steps that we have taken."

But actually, the Midwest Gen financing, to answer your question, and is it worth it? Yes. As I think as we disclosed in the press release, certainly, in the Q, our cost of just under 4.5%. And that is basically the way to think about the cost of financing. The way that it works mechanically is you're basically monetizing today the discount and the implied cost from an interest rate standpoint, is that kind of 4.5% type cost. Relative to the opportunity certainly that we have, and even relative to what the path that we were on exploring previously, which is the term loan B market, we see that as at an attractive cost as you well put it, to bring cash forward today to take advantage of opportunities. And obviously, get ahead in our deleveraging part of progress. I mean, certainly, we are focused on doing that, but we are cognizant of the fact that rightsizing the balance sheet is important today so that we can preserve flexibility for the company tomorrow. And this $250 million, net $210 million as I mentioned, for 2016 is an important step in that direction for us. And apart -- as far as our overall debt is concerned, our long-term notes are still trading at a much smaller discount. They recruited largely closer to par even on the long-dated maturities, which from the certainly, from the standpoint of opportunistically purchasing debt as a discount, makes it more expensive. But as you well know, we are a serial issuer or a serial roller of debt from a refinancing opportunity standpoint. So that certainly, I feel a lot more comfortable with what that means in terms of the barometer and the confidence that value of market has in the quality of our credit, I think underpinned by what we're on the path to do as we're driving those ratios down, and also giving us greater flexibility on the refinancing front. So in the total package, I like where we are today. I mean, I think we've probably seen 350 basis points of rally on the long side just since our last earning call."

And this is based on economic generation that we can see today at current markets.

So I think it's an artifact of some moving around on the heat rate side."

I think what the -- from our perspective, and we don't provide specific information on a plant-by-plant basis. But I will tell you is, in Texas, we actually have a higher threshold than if we were a stand-alone generator. And the reason why is because of our integrated model. So we actually achieve significant amount of synergies and value by pointing generation to retail. We avoid a lot of charges. We avoid friction costs. So we have this higher threshold when it comes to evaluating the economic viability of the plant. But again, I don't think we can take a -- we can make a decision of retiring a plant based on 1 month or 3 months of very low commodity prices, which, to be fair, we have very effectively mitigated with our hedging philosophy and strategy. What we need to do is we need to look at it in the context of all the dynamics in that market. What are the prospects for each of those plants? And what exactly is what that plant provides to the system that eventually will be captured in the prices. So that's, I guess, where I see that. And what I will tell you is that we have an absolute commitment to operate plants that are economic. We have, I think, a pretty good track record in terms of retiring plants where the system doesn't need them in the past for the -- over the last 10 years. And even since the beginning of this year, we have retired close to a gigawatt of generation in Western New York and Texas because the market just doesn't support it and because we felt that the economic prospects in those particular markets were not going to support it. But I think investors should rest assured that we will make the right economic decision. But we need to make sure that we go beyond the next month and we look at the prospects going forward."

And what kind of impact is the RICE NESHAP going to have on those? And those are a bit of wild cards out there that could swing that one. Well, I think that those swing it directionally upwards compared to where it otherwise would be if you start pulling out some of the DR based on auto DR, and then, also look at FirstEnergy and AEP decide they're going to retire those units and don't want capacity obligations because they're concerned about whether or not they -- this end run, this most recent end run, they're trying around FERC works or not. I think there -- that 6,000 megawatts of stuff that's up in the air, which arguably could have a bullish piece on it, will that be enough to offset the load change that they've had and the load forecast?

Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. We're off to a really good start for the year. Our financial performance was strong for the first quarter, allowing us to reaffirm guidance for the full year. We are making significant progress in our priorities for reducing costs, replenishing capital and deleveraging the business. And importantly, we're bringing certain people to our platform with a conclusion of the GreenCo process. So let me start with our first quarter results.
NRG delivered $812 million of adjusted EBITDA under very challenging market conditions. We remain focused on our day-to-day operations, achieving top quartile safety performance, good availability across our generation fleet, and stable results from our Retail business. All of these, combined with our opportunity hedging program mitigated the impact of the very weak wholesale prices that we experienced during the quarter. These results illustrate the strength of our platform and the unique value proposition that NRG offers. 
We are making good progress in our commitment to deleveraging the business. We retired $229 million of NRG debt or approximately 30% of our 2016 targets. Not only are we on track with our original plans, we have expanded the total capital available for deleveraging to $1.3 billion after adding $253 million from our Midwest Generation capacity monetization financing, which Kirk will provide additional details on during his remarks.
Finally, this quarter, we're taking another important step forward in simplifying our business as we concluded after much consideration to GreenCo process. With the reintegration of business renewables last quarter and now the resolution for our Home Solar and eVgo businesses, which I will cover in more detail in a few slides, we have turned the page on this period of uncertainty and now are focused on executing our plan. On our last call, I spent some time talking about the merits of diversification as a necessary condition to succeed in the future of a competitive power industry. Today, I want to expand on the multiple levers that NRG has to deliver value to our shareholders.
Now turning to Slide 5, I have outlined the 3 key macro levers that describe the earnings potential of our business. Over the years, we have successfully repositioned the company away from solely relying on energy margins to other more stable and predictable sources of revenue. So let me start with the first lever, which now represents 2/3 of our economic gross margin. These comes from parts of our business that are either not directly correlated to or that are countercyclical to the price of natural gas, including our retail business, contracted generation and capacity payments. This lever of our business provides a stable base of predictable and visible earnings potential, a quality that differentiate us from many others in our industry, and we do it at significant scale across all 3 areas.
Keep in mind this base is also growing, given market trends in renewables and contracted generation, where our relationship with NRG Yield will continue to be a competitive advantage in the future. Now let's talk about the second and third lever that comprise the other 1/3 of our economic gross margin, which is directly tied to the price of gas and power.
These portions relative share have declined over the years given the prolonged weak commodity price environment. But we have deliberately maintained off-site through fuel diversity as I believe the current gas pricing environment is unsustainable in the medium to long run. And we want to be there with scale when the market recovers.
The second lever is what I refer to as the fuel spread. This is the traditional way we have made money, selling coal, oil and uranium at gas prices. It is effectively a synthetic long gas position. For those of you who invest in the E&P sector, we're long, roughly about 3 Bcf a day of gas. So for every $0.03 move in gas prices, our portfolio has a potential to flex off by $0.5 billion in additional gross margin. Let me be clear. We're not gas agnostic and don't want to be gas agnostic as we believe current prices are not sustainable. 
The third lever is our power spread or heat rate exposure. As power markets tighten due to retirements or low growth, we maintain significant upside to increasing power prices, as we have the largest competitive power portfolio in the country, with close to 50,000 megawatts of generation with both geographic and merit order diversification.
So when people ask me why I am convinced, we have the right platform to be the leader in the competitive power space today and into the future, this is why. Success in this industry is all about diversification of the business and core operational excellence. Our platform is designed to deliver results even in a difficult market, and given how unpredictable the markets can be, having a stability in our core platform is critical. At the same time, our leverage to any market recovery should be embraced not ignored because it is quite substantial. And when you couple these dynamics with our commitment to strengthening our balance sheet and streamlining our costs, I have no doubt that NRG is built to thrive under a variety of market conditions.
So moving on to the next slide. I want to touch briefly on key developments across our markets. We are encouraged by recent action from regulators in support of competitive markets. We are pleased that FERC has stepped in to effectively stop the out of market PPAs for AEP and for Synergy in Ohio. It is also encouraging that the U.S. Supreme Court decided to invalidate Maryland contract created for the sole purpose of suppressing capacity prices.
In PJM, the transition to the capacity performance product has brought higher capacity payments in exchange for higher performance commitments as we pivoted our fleet accordingly. Our program of transforming coal plants to gas was undertaken with an eye towards becoming a provider of reliability.
In Texas, we're optimistic in [indiscernible] as we see up to 9 gigawatts of coal generation at risk due to upcoming environmental regulations and continued strong growth. In addition, we expect market changes to ORDC with the purpose of increasing prices to better reflect scarcity conditions. And in the West, while the Aliso Canyon issue will present reliability challenges for the California ISO over the next year, we do not expect decision to have significant impact to our generation portfolio since most of our revenue in California is supported by PPAs and RA contracts. 
Also, our newest merchant plant, Sunrise, is supplied off the Kern River pipeline and thereof not impacted. We hope this becomes a catalyst to address gas power coordination and fuel cost recovery issues that are much needed in California. 
Turning to Slide 7. Let me now discuss the details around the conclusion of the GreenCo process that we started in September of last year. Last quarter, I explained that there were 3 objectives we saw to accomplishing this process, maintain our capability to take advantage of renewable trends at appropriate investment returns, incorporate all of our businesses into our financial results and to minimize the use of the $125 million revolver.
Today, I'm here to tell you we have met our objectives and have concluded the process. To do a quick recap, beginning last quarter, we reintegrated business renewables, which allows us to maintain a strong position in the renewables market. This business is now fully integrated, and I will be updating you on each progress in the months to come.
Moving to Residential Solar. We undertook a comprehensive strategic review process over the past 6 months to determine the best course of action to realize value, to minimize capital needs and like business renewables, ensure we do not lose the ability to meet renewable energy demands across all types of customers.
While our original goal was to secure permanent capital and deconsolidate the enterprise, we were not able to move forward in this direction in a way that met all our objectives. Today, we're announcing a change in our approach to residential solar that will allow us to meet them.
First, we're both streamlining and simplifying the organization by significantly lowering the cost structure and focusing in markets where we have a competitive advantage. Residential Solar will become a product in our retail offering, and we intend to fully integrate into our retail business by 2017. Second, we are changing our business model to focus on origination, installation and direct third-party sales, which will allow us to simplify financial reporting by providing immediate revenue recognition. I am pleased to announce new partnerships with both Sunrun and Spruce Financial, which will allow us to execute on this plan. 
Our approach comes with significant changes in our overall organization, cost structure and business model. This model allows us to maintain our 2016 financial guidance as we transition the business throughout the remainder of 2016 to be at least an EBITDA breakeven business by 2017. While this is not a business you can expect to hear about each quarter, our strategy for this business is important to our organization, allowing us to maintain a viable yet rightsized structure so that when the market economics are viable, we can offer Residential Solar to our existing 3 million customers.
We have also concluded the strategic review process for our electric vehicle charging network or eVgo. I am announcing today the sale of a majority stake of this business to Vision Ridge Partners. NRG will receive total consideration of approximately $50 million with $19.5 million upfront available to NRG and $30 million remaining in the eVgo platform. 
In addition, NRG has some earnout potential of up to $70 million through 2022. Under this structure, NRG will have -- will not have any ongoing capital commitments to eVgo other than its obligations under the California settlement. With the closing of this transaction, eVgo results will no longer be consolidated into NRG financial statements. With the conclusion of the GreenCo process, the $125 million revolver is no longer necessary and will be eliminated as we move forward and execute on our new plans. 
On Slide 8, I want to provide you an update from the great progress we have made in streamlining our cost structure. We are on track to realize $250 million in recurring cost savings in overhead and O&M, and we have made significant progress in our new FORNRG program target. This means that over the next 2 years, we will have taken an impressive $400 million in total costs out of the system.
Additionally, you will be able to track these costs in our disclosures to see our progress as we move through the subsequent quarters. While I'm very pleased with our efforts today, I expect that we will be able to find even more opportunities to reduce our cost structure as we continue with our remaining asset sales, the integration of the Residential Solar business and our push to find even more opportunities to streamline the organization. 
So with that, I will turn it to Kirk for the financial review."

Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 10, NRG delivered $812 million and adjusted EBITDA and $249 million in free cash flow before growth in the first quarter of 2016. Having now concluded the Green",535,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 10, NRG delivered $812 million and adjusted EBITDA and $249 million in free cash flow before growth in the first quarter of 2016. Having now concluded the GreenCo process, our financial results and our guidance now include both eVgo and the newly restructured Residential Solar within our corporate segment, which is part of the generation and renewable subset of our consolidated guidance. With all businesses now included, we are reaffirming our 2016 full year guidance for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. 
During the quarter, we continued our deleveraging program and have now retired a total of $229 million of NRG corporate debt year-to-date through May 4, leading to an additional annualized cash interest savings of $60 million.
Finally, to update our progress in achieving our target of $1 billion in incremental consolidated available capital, which was announced on September 18 of last year, NRG has now completed a non-recourse monetization of future PJM capacity revenues from our Midwest Generation fleet for cash proceeds of $253 million. This transaction, which will be accounted for as a nonrecourse debt financing with no impact on adjusted EBITDA, represents the final component of our plan to free up $1 billion of 2016 capital, leaving only the balance of our $500 million asset sale target, and we expect to complete this over the balance of this year.
Turning to Slide 11. The Midwest Gen nonrecourse capacity monetization proceeds of $253 million increases our 2016 capital available for allocation by $210 million versus our prior expectation as we reviewed during our year-end earnings call. The remaining $43 million in financing proceeds represents the acceleration of capacity revenues within 2016, which were already included in the NRG level of free cash flow before growth guidance mid-point, which was part of the $1.488 billion in 2016 capital available as shown in our year-end earnings materials.
Including the Midwest Gen proceeds, total 2016 capital available for allocation now stands at approximately $1.7 billion at the NRG level.
We expect to allocate this incremental capital to further advance our deleveraging efforts or alternatively to repay our convertible preferred stock, which based on the conversion price, relative to our current share price, presents a compelling potential opportunity. The drop-down of NRG's remaining stake in CVSR to NRG Yield continues to represent an additional opportunity to further supplement NRG level capital available, and we intend to offer this remaining stake to NRG Yield during the quarter.
Finally, liquidity stands at $1.9 billion as of March 31, which includes $589 million of cash at the NRG level, which has since been supplemented with the proceeds from the Midwest Gen capacity monetization, which closed just following the quarter end.
Finally, turning to briefly to Slide 12. Our continued progress on deleveraging keeps us on track to bring our 2016 corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio below our target as we position NRG's balance sheet to maintain adherence to our 4.25x target ratio even through a continued low commodity price cycle. And we will continue to update this analysis as our debt reduction program progresses.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio."

And in closing, I wanted to remind everyone of our priorities in Slide 14. This is the scorecard that I will share with you throughout the rest of the year.
As you can see, we have made considerable progress in just the first few months of the year. Addressing the general debt is among one of our highest priorities, given both the overall debt level and maturities in 2017 and 2018. We're actively evaluating alternatives to optimize the capital structure with a focus on maximizing value for all stakeholders.
With this objective in mind, we expect to be engaging in discussions with general creditors as a part of this process in the near term. As we evaluate alternatives, we remain committed to our prudent balance sheet management principles, including maintaining our target corporate credit metrics. We remain focused on executing our current strategy and with the reintegration of renewables, we are now in a position to reinvigorate the development pipeline and provide certainty to NRG Yield's growth potential. I believe, we now have all the pieces to move forward and demonstrate the value of our integrated platform.

So rather than you then seeing proceeds come in, in terms of a return of capital and CapEx go out in advance of that, that is now going to be revenue, which is what we will receive for lock, stock and barrel the entirety of the system to Sunrun or Spruce, and then they will also retain the ongoing obligations to manage and operate the system, O&M and the like.

Greg, I mean, we've actually went through a process that took a significant amount of time. During this time, I think everybody knows that the -- we knew that the conditions, both in the capital markets and then through the beginning of the year, were pretty challenging for both the Residential Solar business as a whole, but also on the capital market. So this was not the best time to be in the market. We knew that, that's why we were looking at selling the majority stake, not all of it, because we wanted to maintain the optionality on the Texas market, where we think we have a significant asset in our customers to be able to offer them residential solar. I think when you couple that with this change in the business model, where it's effectively, we sell, install and flip to a third-party. And importantly, refocusing the business, where we actually have been successful in the past and reducing significantly the cost structure, we felt that, that combination was the best path for maximizing value for this business. And I think we provide that over the next 12 months. We expect that business to be at least breakeven in 2017. I've always looked at residential solar as another product in our retail offering. It makes a whole lot of sense if we already have that relationship with the residential customer. And this is one of the products that they are asking for it that we provided. And if we can provide it in a way that is cost-effective and that we can great value, we should have it in our lineup of product offering. So I think that the rationale is there. I think the appetite from customers for rooftop solar is there. We just needed to make pretty significant changes in the way we could structure the business model to ensure that it was quite candidly a profitable one. And I think that -- those are the steps that we have taken."

You made the decision to bring some cash flow forward by monetizing these capacity payments. Theoretically, cash in hand today is better than cash in hand 1 year or 2 from now, especially if you're in a position to aggressively delever the balance sheet. But Kirk, can you talk about the -- what you're foregoing in the future to get that cash today, how much financing costs are you incurring? And do you see that as worth it given the market opportunities to retire debt? And where is your debt currently trading? Is it still at big discounts or has it improved?"

But actually, the Midwest Gen financing, to answer your question, and is it worth it? Yes. As I think as we disclosed in the press release, certainly, in the Q, our cost of just under 4.5%. And that is basically the way to think about the cost of financing. The way that it works mechanically is you're basically monetizing today the discount and the implied cost from an interest rate standpoint, is that kind of 4.5% type cost. Relative to the opportunity certainly that we have, and even relative to what the path that we were on exploring previously, which is the term loan B market, we see that as at an attractive cost as you well put it, to bring cash forward today to take advantage of opportunities. And obviously, get ahead in our deleveraging part of progress. I mean, certainly, we are focused on doing that, but we are cognizant of the fact that rightsizing the balance sheet is important today so that we can preserve flexibility for the company tomorrow. And this $250 million, net $210 million as I mentioned, for 2016 is an important step in that direction for us. And apart -- as far as our overall debt is concerned, our long-term notes are still trading at a much smaller discount. They recruited largely closer to par even on the long-dated maturities, which from the certainly, from the standpoint of opportunistically purchasing debt as a discount, makes it more expensive. But as you well know, we are a serial issuer or a serial roller of debt from a refinancing opportunity standpoint. So that certainly, I feel a lot more comfortable with what that means in terms of the barometer and the confidence that value of market has in the quality of our credit, I think underpinned by what we're on the path to do as we're driving those ratios down, and also giving us greater flexibility on the refinancing front. So in the total package, I like where we are today. I mean, I think we've probably seen 350 basis points of rally on the long side just since our last earning call."

So the way to think about the -- my remarks of moving the value of the portfolio by $0.50, $0.5 billion, is on an open basis. And this is based on economic generation that we can see today at current markets. So if you can appreciate that economic generation as commodity prices move, that will increase, and your sensitivity to the same $0.50 move will be greater. This sensitivity basically reflects the economic generation that is exposed at current market. So I don't know if that at least provide some clarity in terms of what this number is.

So I would say that some of that is already captured in the GenOn complex. I don't know if that was part of your comment that, perhaps, the GenOn complex is not as sensitized with natural gas because of those fuel conversions. But $0.50 make a -- makes some difference.

But I will tell you is, in Texas, we actually have a higher threshold than if we were a stand-alone generator. And the reason why is because of our integrated model. So we actually achieve significant amount of synergies and value by pointing generation to retail. We avoid a lot of charges. We avoid friction costs. So we have this higher threshold when it comes to evaluating the economic viability of the plant. But again, I don't think we can take a -- we can make a decision of retiring a plant based on 1 month or 3 months of very low commodity prices, which, to be fair, we have very effectively mitigated with our hedging philosophy and strategy. What we need to do is we need to look at it in the context of all the dynamics in that market. What are the prospects for each of those plants? And what exactly is what that plant provides to the system that eventually will be captured in the prices. So that's, I guess, where I see that. And what I will tell you is that we have an absolute commitment to operate plants that are economic. We have, I think, a pretty good track record in terms of retiring plants where the system doesn't need them in the past for the -- over the last 10 years. And even since the beginning of this year, we have retired close to a gigawatt of generation in Western New York and Texas because the market just doesn't support it and because we felt that the economic prospects in those particular markets were not going to support it. But I think investors should rest assured that we will make the right economic decision. But we need to make sure that we go beyond the next month and we look at the prospects going forward."

Obviously, the large BRA, in the 200s, were areas where we have a lot of generation, we have fantastic results.

So it's probably down year-on-year, so that's why we threw the analyst expectations on. I'm not going to throw a number or our own internal number out there. But look, I think it's reasonable to think it's going to be down some or moderate a little bit from the numbers we saw last time just because of the changes in load forecast. And then, you're right to point out, I think there are some pretty big wild cards out there in terms of, a, what does FirstEnergy do? What does AEP do? And what kind of impact is the RICE NESHAP going to have on those? And those are a bit of wild cards out there that could swing that one. Well, I think that those swing it directionally upwards compared to where it otherwise would be if you start pulling out some of the DR based on auto DR, and then, also look at FirstEnergy and AEP decide they're going to retire those units and don't want capacity obligations because they're concerned about whether or not they -- this end run, this most recent end run, they're trying around FERC works or not. I think there -- that 6,000 megawatts of stuff that's up in the air, which arguably could have a bullish piece on it, will that be enough to offset the load change that they've had and the load forecast?

We have identified and either executed or in execution close to $400 million of cost reductions that I feel -- we all feel very comfortable that are very achievable, and we're making significant progress. I think there are more opportunities as we integrate some of the businesses, specifically residential solar, into the platform. But I expect that we will be looking at other areas. We now have a comprehensive, continuous improvement program that, over the years, have been very effective under the FORNRG umbrella. And we are extending that, expanding that to the entire organization. So we are reinvigorating that initiative.

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Dillinger, Head of our Retail business",2253,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Dillinger, Head of our Retail business.
Today, we're reporting second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $779 million, a 14% increase when compared to the same period last year, thanks to a solid performance from the generation business and a record second quarter result for retail, which continues to benefit from lower wholesale prices, a proven ability to attract and retain customers, and outstanding execution. These are excellent results, particularly in light of the low commodity prices that we continue to experience in our core markets. And it once again validate our integrated model and diversified approach to competitive power market.
Given the back-to-back strong quarterly results and the hedge position we have in place for the remainder of the year, we're not only reaffirming guidance, but we're tracking towards the upper end of our range.
Traditionally, this quarter is a quiet one, our season, since the electricity and respective wholesale prices are the lowest for the year. But for us, it was rather busy. In addition to ensuring our fleet was ready for summer operations, we made significant progress in executing on our debt management plan. We have retired $337 million of corporate level debt year-to-date, reduced our 2018 to 2020 maturity debt obligation by $5.8 billion and bought back $345 million of our convertible preferred stock. Kirk will go into more detail in a few slides, but I want to take a moment to recognize him and the entire finance and legal organizations for superb execution and timing. The progress made today is an important step to ensure that our leverage ratios remain on target through varying commodity cycles.
In delivering on our commitment to enhance capital flexibility, we have entered into an agreement with NRG Yield to drop out down our 51% interest in CDSR with $180 million in total cash consideration, including financing proceeds and an EB to EBITDA multiple of over 14x. This transaction reinforces the value of our partnership, allowing us to replenish capital efficiently, but further expanding yields portfolio in Casabi, which benefits our nearly 50% economic interest on them. From this transaction will be allocated towards deleveraging, specifically to supplement the resource set aside for 2018 bonds, expanding our total deleveraging target from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. This quarter, we also finalized the sale of Rockport and the Aurora plants for $425 million, bringing total cash consideration from asset sales to $563 million, which surpasses our initial target of $500 million.
We have remained relentless in our pursuit of streamlining the organization and finding additional cost savings. We are on track to achieve our full energy cost reduction target of $400 million to 2017 and to reduce our CapEx program by $650 million for 2017. This CapEx reduction followed the successful completion of fuel conversions at new cash flow and Juliet and environmental operate at with all 3 plans back online and better positioned to opportunities in their respective markets.
Now turning to Slide 4, I want to highlight the soft performance of our integrated platform during the second quarter. Safety is always top of mine. And while we remain a top quartile performer year-to-date, we can do and have done better. We are focused on and committed to improving our safety record for the balance of the year.
Mild weather continued from the winter months into the start of the summer with temperatures that were milder than last year. Needless to say, this kept commodity prices through the end of June lower than last year, but once again, our business delivered results that were even stronger than last year. You have heard me say this before, but this is exactly what differentiates NRG from other our ITPs. We have an integrated platform, a capital provide stability and deliver strong results even during periods of low prices, while maintaining significant upside. And we continue to demonstrate this quarter after quarter.
Our generation business performed well with improvements in reliability, availability and operating cost, while realizing higher capacity revenues. We successfully completed multiple CapEx projects, bringing several units back online for the summer.
In fact, during the first month of operations, our fuel conversions benefited from low gas prices at PJM and are performing even better than expected. Our fleet was also well positioned to maximize value in the recent 1920 PJM capacity auction. Results were disappointed, given the reduction in loads an increase in newbuilds, accepting comment where prices remains strong, benefiting our Midwest gen portfolio.Overall, we cleared about 80% of all our PJM for a total revenues of over $0.5 billion.
While these market conditions were not ideal for the generation business, the low wholesale prices benefited our complimentary retail business. The unfavorable supply cost this quarter, our retail business continued its push for cost efficiencies, customer retention and product expansion. This is a business that continues a trajectory of growth and has proven to be very stable. I want to commend Elizabeth and the retail team for their achievement this quarter and for continued success in growing this business.
But while the retail business and our towards becoming a capacity player are important parts of the story, the energy value proposition is even more robust than that. Turning to Slide 5, I want to put some of the recent market trends in context of NRG's multiple levers for value creation as I outlined on our last call.
The first lever is our stable, but growing base on price of the most predictable parts of our portfolio: Retail, which continues to demonstrate the stability of its earnings; capacity revenues that provides visibility multiple years into the future; and contracted assets through NRG yield.
This first level has proven solid over time and there is good reason to believe that our base will only grow and strengthen given current market trends. We are encouraged by the support for constructive capacity markets and strict performance standards, but we're even more encouraged by the increasing need for contracted renewable and quick start gas plans that are required to meet higher renewable portfolio standards and the sustainability targets of corporations across the country. We are ready to capitalize on this market opportunity, which is even further enhanced by our partnership with NRG Yield.
Now turning to the other levels of our value proposition, our leverage to natural gas and power, both less predictable, but with significant upside potential given where we are in the commodity cycle.
Let's start with our leverage to natural gas. We have deliberately maintained fuel diversity in our portfolio and can therefore benefit from the price differential between coal and uranium from natural gas. Our low gas position is about 3.3 BcF per day. I am encouraged by the price supply and demand outlook. We have seen a significant increase in spot prices from the recent lows, production has been stagnant, reflecting a nonsustainable low-price environment and demand is picking up, particularly in the power sector. If the price of gas moves by $0.50, NRG would realize almost $0.5 billion in a national gross margin, 2/3 of which is realized of the NRG level and with minimal impact on our retail business since most of our 6 price obligations are short-term and hedged.
The last lever is our exposure to power prices or hit rates. Our upside is also significant as we have the largest and most diverse fleet in the country, with close to 43 kilowatts of merchant generation. While we're seeing the market tightening due to unit retirements, the outlook for power is more neutral even the increased uncertainty from environmental regulations and the recent actions to subsidize on economic generation by certain state. We will continue to work with our generators, regulators and stakeholders to protect the integrity of competitive market.
As you can see, the outlook for the business overall is positive and no other company offers investors a play in the industry in the same way that our business does. We're not one-dimensional when it comes to creating value. And we're able to handle downtimes better than others. We do not bet on a single fuel or on a single technology. We have embraced vertical integration and diversification as a way to navigate through a sea of uncertainty in our industry. I have no doubt our business is best positioned for both near and longer-term success in the industry.
I want to take a few minutes to share some thoughts on 2 of our key markets, ERCOT and PJM. Let's first start with ERCOT on Slide 6. We're seeing signs of market recovery as dark spreads have increased over 100% from their lows even outpacing the rebounds by a healthy margin. As an owner of environmentally controlled coal units in the region, we certainly welcome this more. 
So far, this summer has been characterized by consistently warm weather. But higher than normal wind production in July and a healthy green had resulted in little to no scarcity pricing. While the forward markets have improved, we have been disappointed that the PUCT have not taken sister action to correct this demand curve to provide better market signals. That said, we do expect positive revisions to the ORVC later this year to better reflect scarcity conditions in pricing.
Finally, there is still an overhead of uncertainty from center environmental regulations in Texas, most notably, Regional Haze. This could delay the decision to retire uneconomic and uncontrolled assets for some time. But ultimately, the investment to comply will prove difficult for this type of units under current market conditions. We remain confident that our large environmentally controlled and favorably located assets are well-positioned to meet compliance thresholds with modest capital investments.
PJM is somewhat a different story. Moving from a market with high energy and capacity prices that incentivizes new generation to one with energy under pressure. The massive turnover from coal and oil to natural gas is starting to impact spark spreads as more efficient combined cycles are coming online. In looking at both energy and capacity prices for the 19 20 period, we're now below the cost of new entry for a new CCGT.
[Audio Gap]
We expect the next auction for 2020 to '21 will be more constructive as we believe our move into 100% capacity performance requirement, a potential slow on new builds and a more moderate load revision will support higher capacity price. We are encouraged by the constructive nature of the capacity market and its efforts to better reward reliability. Our investments are consistent with these market dynamics and rest assured that we will continue to oppose the use of state-based contracts and subsidies that undermines while functioning competitive markets.
During my first goal as CEO back in February, I committed to simplifying our business. This meant not just simplifying how we communicate our value proposition to the market, but also the internal structure and interworking of the organization. In that spirit, it's not lost on me that we need to extend the simplification to our capital structure. So addressing GenOn has been one of my priorities for 2016. 
On Slide 7, I wanted to shed some light on the situation as it currently stands. GenOn portfolio has allowed us to fill a gap with had in PJM, strategic market as we were building a diverse portfolio across all major competitive markets. This position was later complemented with the acquisition of an additional 4,000 megawatts from Edison Nation. Over the last few years, we have taken steps to capitalize on evolving market trends, particularly around changes in the capacity market. However, deteriorating market fundamentals, are adversely impacting the general portfolio. Abundant shale gas, more stringent environmental regulations and an influx of new efficient gas blends, which are costing significant pressure on energy and capacity prices in the region.
These low commodity cycle is impacting the financial of the general entity, as you can see on the upper left-hand table. Currently, the leverage ratio for the consolidated GenOn entity is 7.7x. This level of debt relative to EBITDA, a successive, particularly the synergies to maintain a long-term corporate level leverage ratio target of 4 in a quarter. GenOn has taken several important steps to address the challenges it faces. First, it has appointed 2 independent directors to the GenOn Board. This is a key step in ensuring the interest of all stakeholders in GenOn are considered.
Second, it has retained restructuring advice as to help navigate the process efficiently and judiciously. Third, it has opportunistically sold several noncore assets over the past several quarters to help provide additional financial flexibility within the general companies.
I know that many of you have a lot of questions on GenOn, but I am sure you can appreciate this is a sensitive process. And as GenOn is engaged in ongoing conversations with its stakeholders, we are unable to elaborate on specifics at this time. I expect to provide more information as this process moves forward.
What I can leave with you today is the reminder that as this process progresses and options are evaluated, there are 3 key principles that we will adhere to: simplifying the organization; maximizing value; and from NRG's perspective, maintaining the strength of that NRG balance sheet and credit metrics. With that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review"
413857,376865373,1030749,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to financial summary on Slide 9. NRG delivered $779 million in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, driven by a strong performance by our retail mass business achieving a record EBITDA of $230 million. For the second quarter",998,"Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to financial summary on Slide 9. NRG delivered $779 million in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, driven by a strong performance by our retail mass business achieving a record EBITDA of $230 million. For the second quarter, generation and renewables combined for $326 million and adjusted EBITDA, while NRG Yield continued $240 million. For the first half of the year, NRG generated almost $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $220 million of free cash flow before growth.
Based on both performance year-to-date and our updated outlook for the balance of the year, which has us tracking to the upper end of our EBITDA range, we're reaffirming our 2016 guidance of $3 billion to $3.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1 billion to $1.2 billion in free cash flow before growth. We expect to update and narrow these ranges following the completion of the summer season on our third quarter call in November and will also provide guidance for 2017 at that time.
During the second quarter call and into July, NRG made significant progress in strengthening our balance sheet and financial flexibility as we took advantage of favorable market conditions by significantly expanding corporate maturities while continuing our deleveraging efforts. Since we embarked on our current corporate debt reduction program in the fourth quarter of 2015, we had now retired a total of $642 million of NRG level debt. In addition, successful unsecured notes offerings totaled $2.25 million, NRG significantly extended corporate maturities at lower rates than the show were which are retired using the proceeds from this offering. We also successfully extended both our corporate revolver from 2018 to 2021 and our secured term loan from 2018 to 2023. 
These transactions, when combined with the overall debt reduction achieves since late last year, results in approximately $50 million in annualized interest payments for NRG. Taking into account the $10 million in annualized dividends savings we captured in the second quarter through the redemption of our convertible preferred, interest and dividend savings combined drive incremental improvements in free cash flow before growth on an annual basis at the NRG level of approximately $60 million.
And finally, NRG has just entered into an agreement with NRG Yield to sell our remaining 51% interest in CVSR, resulting in unexpected cash proceeds to NRG of approximately $180 million. These proceeds are derived from 2 sources. First, taking advantage of incremental secured debt capacity impact CVSR. In July, we closed on $200 million in new nonrecourse secured debt. NRG's share of the net cash proceeds of which is $101.5 million. Second, we agreed to sell our remaining 51% stake in CVSR to NRG Yield for $78.5 million in cash and expect that transaction to close this quarter. The total cash proceeds from these transactions further increased NRG level capital for allocation, which you'll find updated on Slide 10.
Turning to that Slide 10. The cash proceeds of $180 million from the CVSR transaction increased total 2016 energy level capital bill for allegation to just under $1.9 billion. The proceeds from CVSR also increase the portion of energy level capital allocated to debtor convertible preferred reduction, which now stands at just under $1.5 billion for 2016. 
On our first quarter call, we had earmarked the net proceeds of $210 million from our Midwest Generation capacity monetization toward the potential redemption of our convertible preferred Stock. Having now redeemed the convert for $226 million versus the $210 million reserve we've established for that purpose, a portion of the CVSR proceeds helps make up the difference for $16 million.
$59 million of the CVSR proceeds was used to offset the financing fees incurred in connection with the maturity extensions, allowing us to maintain the total capital allocated toward absolute debt reduction. The balance of the CVSR proceeds of $105 million will be used to increase the reserve established for the remainder of our 2018 notes, from $325 million to now $430 million.
Turning now to Slide 11 for an update on the NRG level capital structure and leverage ratios. As a result of our significant progress in debt reduction and maturity extension. The remaining balance of our 2018 unsecured notes now stands at only $587 million and is our only remaining outstanding debt maturing prior to 2021.
Looking to NRG's maturity profile in the upper left of the slide. Including our corporate revolver as of the third quarter of last year, NRG had about $6.7 billion in total debt maturities through 2020. To put our progress to strengthening our balance sheet in perspective, as a result of the continuing deleveraging and opportunistic refinancing, today, we have less than $900 million maturing through 2020, a reduction of approximately $5.8 billion in less than a year.
While we will continue to be opportunistic when market conditions are favorable, this increased flexibility allows us to be more selective and less exposed to the type of short-term swings in volatility in the debt markets we saw earlier in 2016. The added benefit, as I mentioned earlier, is that in the process, we already achieved approximately $60 million in annual dividend and interest savings, which similar to the significant decrease in environmental CapEx, which follows 2016, helps further improve our ability to translate EBITDA into free cash flow in 2017 and beyond.
Finally, as you can see in the updated table in the upper right of the slide, remain on track to drive our corporate debt-to-EBITDA ratio well below our long-term target of 4 1/4 [ph] allowing us to maintain adherence with principles of prudent balance sheet management through commodity strike will. We are very pleased with our progress on the balance sheet front, and I want to recognize the folks in our finance, accounting and legal department in particular for their outstanding efforts this year and making these successes possible and moving NRG forward in achieving our balance sheet goals for 2016.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks"

To close, I want to leave you with our score card on Slide 13.

Importantly, I want to know the significant progress we have made in continuing to strengthen the relationship with our strategic partner, NRG Yield. This partnership provides yet another significant point of differentiation between energy and other ITPs, adding to our stable base of earnings and allowing us to replenish capital for assets we develop and drop-down as -- with strong returns.
Last quarter, we focused on strengthening our yield by putting in place a dedicated CEO to focus solely on growing this business. This quarter, we entered into an agreement to drop down NRG's remaining stake in CVSR. Going forward, we remain committed to finding and developing projects that we can phase in the drop-down pipeline.
And while the organization, our performance and progress in meeting our objectives has been impressive. And I look forward to updating you on our continued progress over the coming months. Andrea, we're now ready to open the lines for questions."

On your Slide 6, you show that market conditions have improved amongst the ERCOT. I think some investors are frustrated despite the gas price move, we haven't seen a commensurate move up in power prices in PJM. I put that to sort the way the dispatch curves look, and you're kind of in the deep part of the smile now where gas has to keep moving up for gas plants to move back ahead of coal. But there's also a theory that coal was burning out of dispatch and that's putting pressure on power prices in that market. And now that that's no longer happening, we might see better conditions. Can you comment on whether either or both of those are true? And if not, what's your outlook for PJM power prices?"

I think what I wanted to represent in the slide that in Texas is actually, we had seen gas prices most significantly, both in terms of heat rate expansion and following natural gas. With respect to PJM, I think the story's slightly different. If you look at gas basis in PJM, have actually significantly decreased over the summer. And I think that is putting some pressure on the sparks spreads. I am not of the theory that coal generators are running uneconomically in the region. I just think that you're seeing an influx of combined cycles, you're seeing pretty good gas prices or low gas prices compared to the forward markets a couple of months ago. And I think the combination of those who are just putting some pressure on the SPARC play. On a, I guess, on a long-term basis, as the market implemented capacity performance standards and we're seeing this massive turnover between coal and natural gas, we should expect more pressure on the spark spreads. I mean, the capacity performance market was designed to ensure that generators had more availability during scarcity conditions. So as we look past 2017 and towards end of the decade, I expect to have more pressure on spark spreads in PJM and be more constructive on capacity prices. I mean, that's why we shifted the strategy in the East, particularly in PJM, towards becoming a capacity resource as opposed to providing energy. We still maintain that option on energy and it's such a option, but most of the investments that we have made our on the back of what we think is a more constructive part of the market, which is the capacity one."

If you look at the spark spreads, if you look at our prices, they were completely oversold the last couple of months. And that basically shifted some of the bullishness that we have in that perspective market. When you look at the fundamentals there, even the first half of the year, we had very, very strong loads and if I -- off I'm not mistaking a, Wiest an all-time record in Texas. So load growth continues, load growth is very robust. We like the market structure, we like the higher price caps. I think there are improvements that need to happen, particularly on ORDC and to make sure that we have better price signals when we enter into scarcity conditions. And as you mentioned, I mean, I think there is a risk for rationalization in supply. i.e. retirements. My expectation is that if we continue to see this current level of pricing, there are some old steam units and perhaps some uncontrolled, environmentally under uncontrolled coal plants that will retire because they are not going to be able to make the math work when putting back in controls. 
Look, I mean, I don't want to be myopic in terms of the Regional Haze and what will happen, and it stayed and we're going to go through the process. But behind the Regional Haze, you have the ELG, you have the 1 hour SO2. I mean, you have others, a number of other environmental regulations. I think ultimately, smaller or medium sized cold units that are not controlled or well-controlled, the outlook is not just going to look very promising. And perhaps it delays the retirement decision 1 or 2 years, but I think ultimately, people will make the right economic decision. And the low gas price environment and the low spark spread environment accelerated some of that. I mean, we actually filed 2 mothball, one of our old steamers, it was needed for reliability. Other generators have done the same. I think you're going to continue to see that in the next -- in the coming years if something doesn't drastically change the market.

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our retail business.
Today, we're reporting second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $779 million, a 14% increase when compared to the same period last year, thanks to a solid performance from the generation business and a record second quarter result for retail, which continues to benefit from lower wholesale prices, a proven ability to attract and retain customers, and outstanding execution. These are excellent results, particularly in light of the low commodity prices that we continue to experience in our core markets. And it once again validates our integrated model and diversified approach to competitive power market. Given the back-to-back strong quarterly results and the hedge position we have in place for the remainder of the year, we're not only reaffirming guidance, but we're tracking towards the upper end of our range.
Traditionally, this quarter is a quiet one, our shoulder season, since demand for electricity and respective wholesale prices are the lowest for the year. But for us, it was rather busy. In addition to ensuring our fleet was ready for summer operations, we made significant progress in executing on our debt management plan. We have retired $337 million of corporate level debt year-to-date, reduced our 2018 to 2020 maturity debt obligation by $5.8 billion and bought back $345 million of our convertible preferred stock. Kirk will go into more detail in a few slides, but I want to take a moment to recognize him and the entire finance and legal organizations for a superb execution and timing. The progress made today is an important step to ensure that our leverage ratios remain on target through varying commodity cycles.
In delivering on our commitment to enhance capital flexibility, we have entered into an agreement with NRG Yield to drop down our 51% interest in CVSR, with $180 million in total cash consideration, including financing proceeds and an EV to EBITDA multiple of over 14x. This transaction reinforces the value of our partnership, allowing us to replenish capital efficiently, while further expanding yields portfolio and CAFD, which benefits our nearly 50% economic interest on them. Proceeds from this transaction will be allocated towards deleveraging, specifically to supplement the resource set aside for our 2018 bonds, expanding our total deleveraging target from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. This quarter, we also finalized the sale of Rockford and the Aurora plants for $425 million, bringing total cash consideration from asset sales to $563 million, which surpasses our initial target of $500 million.
We have remained relentless in our pursuit of streamlining the organization and finding additional cost savings. We are on track to achieve our 4 -- NRG cost reduction target of $400 million through 2017 and to reduce our CapEx program by $650 million for 2017. This CapEx reduction followed the successful completion of fuel conversions at New Castle and Joliet, an environmental operate at Avon Lake, with all 3 plans back online and better positioned to take advantage of opportunities in their respective markets.
Now turning to Slide 4, I want to highlight the strong performance of our integrated platform during the second quarter. Safety is always top of mind. And while we remain a top quartile performer year-to-date, we can do and have done better. We're focused on and committed to improving our safety record for the balance of the year.
The mild weather continued from the winter months into the start of the summer, with temperatures that were milder than last year. Needless to say, this kept commodity prices through the end of June lower than last year, but once again, our business delivered results that were even stronger than last year. You have heard me say this before, but this is exactly what differentiates NRG from other our IPPs. We have an integrated platform that can provide stability and deliver strong results even during periods of low prices, while maintaining significant upside, and we continue to demonstrate this quarter after quarter.
Our generation business performed well, with improvements in reliability, availability and operating cost, while realizing higher capacity revenues. We successfully completed multiple CapEx projects, bringing several units back online for the summer. In fact, during the first month of operations, our fuel conversions benefited from low gas prices in PJM and are performing even better than expected. Our fleet was also well positioned to maximize value in the recent 19/20 PJM capacity auction. Results were disappointing, given the reduction in loads an increase in newbuilds; except in COMED, where prices remained strong, benefiting our Midwest gen portfolio. Overall, we cleared about 80% of all our megawatts in PJM for a total revenues of over $0.5 billion.
While these market conditions were not ideal for the generation business, the low wholesale prices benefited our complimentary retail business. Beyond favorable supply costs this quarter, our retail business continued its push for cost efficiencies, customer retention and product expansion. This is a business that continues a trajectory of growth and has proven to be very stable. I want to commend Elizabeth and the retail team for their achievement this quarter and for continued success in growing this business.
But while the retail business and our pivot towards becoming a capacity player are important parts of the story, the NRG value proposition is even more robust than that. Turning to Slide 5, I want to put some of the recent market trends in context of NRG's multiple levers for value creation, as I outlined on our last call. The first lever is our stable but growing base, comprised of the most predictable parts of our portfolio: retail, which continues to demonstrate the stability of its earnings; capacity revenues, provides visibility multiple years into the future; and contracted assets through NRG Yield.
This first lever has proven solid over time, and there is good reason to believe that our base will only grow and strengthen given current market trends. We are encouraged by the support for constructive capacity markets and strict performance standards, but we're even more encouraged by the increasing need for contracted renewable and quick-start gas plants that are required to meet higher renewable portfolio standards and the sustainability targets of corporations across the country. We are ready to capitalize on this market opportunity, which is even further enhanced by our partnership with NRG Yield.
Now turning to the other 2 levers of our value proposition, our leverage to natural gas and power, both less predictable, but with significant upside potential given where we are in the commodity cycle. Let's start with our leverage to natural gas. We have deliberately maintained fuel diversity in our portfolio and can therefore benefit from the price differential between coal and uranium from natural gas. Our long gas position is about 3.3 BcF per day. I am encouraged by the price supply and demand outlook. We have seen a significant increase in spot prices from the recent lows; production has been stagnant, reflecting a nonsustainable low-price environment; and demand is picking up, particularly in the power sector. If the price of gas moves by $0.50, NRG would realize almost $0.5 billion in the national gross margin, 2/3 of which is realized at the NRG level and with minimal impact on our retail business since most of our fixed price obligations are short-term and hedged.
The last lever is our exposure to power prices or heat rates. Our upside is also significant as we have the largest and most diverse fleet in the country, with close to 43 gigawatts of merchant generation. While we're seeing the market tightening due to unit retirements, the outlook for power is more neutral given the increased uncertainty from environmental regulations and the recent actions to subsidize on economic generation by certain states. We will continue to work with our generators, regulators and stakeholders to protect the integrity of competitive market.
As you can see, the outlook for the business overall is positive, and no other company offers investors a play in the industry in the same way that our business does. We're not one-dimensional when it comes to creating value. And we're able to handle downturns better than others. We do not bet on a single fuel or on a single technology. We have embraced vertical integration and diversification as a way to navigate through a sea of uncertainty in our industry. I have no doubt our business is best positioned for both near and longer-term success in the industry.
I want to take a few minutes to share some thoughts on 2 of our key markets, ERCOT and PJM. Let's first start with ERCOT on Slide 6. We're seeing signs of market recovery as dark spreads have increased over 100% from their lows, even outpacing the rebounding spark spreads by a healthy margin. As an owner of environmentally controlled coal units in the region, we certainly welcome this more. So far, this summer has been characterized by consistently warm weather, but higher than normal wind production in July and a healthy grid have resulted in little to no scarcity pricing. While the forward markets have improved, we have been disappointed that the PUCT have not taken sister action to correct this demand curve to provide better market signals. That said, we do expect positive revisions to the ORDC later this year to better reflect scarcity conditions in prices.
Finally, there is still an overhang of uncertainty from several environmental regulations in Texas, most notably Regional Haze. This could delay the decision to retire uneconomic and uncontrolled assets for some time. But ultimately, the investment to comply will prove difficult for this type of units under current market conditions. We remain confident that our large environmentally controlled and favorably located assets are well-positioned to meet compliance thresholds with modest capital investments.
PJM is somewhat a different story. Moving from a market with high energy and capacity prices that incentivizes new generation, to one with energy margins under pressure. The massive turnover from coal and oil to natural gas is starting to impact spark spreads as more efficient combined cycles are coming online. In looking at both energy and capacity prices for the 19/20 period, we're now below the cost of new entry for a new CCGT.
[Audio Gap]
We expect the next auction for 2020 to '21 will be more constructive as we believe our move into 100% capacity performance requirement, a potential slowdown in new builds and a more moderate load revision will support higher capacity pricing. We are encouraged by the constructive nature of the capacity market and its efforts to better reward unit reliability. Our investments are consistent with these market dynamic, and rest assured that we will continue to oppose the usage of state-based contracts and subsidies that undermines well-functioning competitive markets.
During my first call as CEO back in February, I committed to simplifying our business. This meant not just simplifying how we communicate our value proposition to the market, but also the internal structure and interworking of the organization. In that spirit, it's not lost on me that we need to extend the simplification to our capital structure. So addressing GenOn has been one of my priorities for 2016. 
On Slide 7, I wanted to shed some light on the situation as it currently stands. The GenOn portfolio has allowed us to fill a gap with had in PJM, a strategic market as we were building a diverse portfolio across all major competitive markets. This position was later complemented with the acquisition of an additional 4,000 megawatts from Edison Mission. Over the last few years, we have taken steps to capitalize on evolving market trends, particularly around changes in the capacity market. However, deteriorating market fundamentals are adversely impacting the general portfolio. Abundant shale gas, more stringent environmental regulations and an influx of new efficient gas plants, which are costing significant pressure on energy and capacity prices in the region.
This low commodity cycle is impacting the financial health of the GenOn entity, as you can see on the upper left-hand table. Currently, the leverage ratio for the consolidated GenOn entity is 7.7x. This level of debt relative to EBITDA is successive, particularly as NRG seeks to maintain a long-term corporate level leverage ratio target of 4 in a quarter. GenOn has taken several important steps to address the challenges it faces. First, it has appointed 2 independent directors to the GenOn Board. This is a key step in ensuring the interest of all stakeholders in GenOn are considered. Second, it has retained restructuring advisers to help navigate the process efficiently and judiciously. Third, it has opportunistically sold several noncore assets over the past several quarters to help provide additional financial flexibility within the general companies.
I know that many of you have a lot of questions on GenOn, but I am sure you can appreciate this is a sensitive process. And as GenOn is engaged in ongoing conversations with its stakeholders, we are unable to elaborate on specifics at this time. I expect to provide more information as this process moves forward. What I can leave with you today is the reminder that as this process progresses and options are evaluated, there are 3 key principles that we will adhere to: simplifying the organization; maximizing value; and from NRG's perspective, maintaining the strength of that NRG balance sheet and credit metrics.
With that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review"
413857,376865373,1031094,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to financial summary on Slide 9. NRG delivered $779 million in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, driven by a strong performance by our Retail Mass business achieving a record EBITDA of $213 million. For the second quarter",999,"Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to financial summary on Slide 9. NRG delivered $779 million in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, driven by a strong performance by our Retail Mass business achieving a record EBITDA of $213 million. For the second quarter, generation and renewables combined for $326 million in adjusted EBITDA, while NRG Yield contributed $240 million. For the first half of the year, NRG generated almost $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $220 million of free cash flow before growth.
Based on both performance year-to-date and our updated outlook for the balance of the year, which has us tracking to the upper end of our EBITDA range, we're reaffirming our 2016 guidance of $3 billion to $3.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1 billion to $1.2 billion in free cash flow before growth. We expect to update and narrow these ranges following the completion of the summer season on our third quarter call in November, and we'll also provide guidance for 2017 at that time.
During the second quarter call and into July, NRG made significant progress in strengthening our balance sheet and financial flexibility as we took advantage of favorable market conditions by significantly expanding corporate maturities while continuing our deleveraging efforts. Since we embarked on our current corporate debt reduction program in the fourth quarter of 2015, we had now retired a total of $642 million of NRG-level debt. In addition, with 2 successful unsecured notes offerings totaling $2.25 million, NRG significantly extended corporate maturities at lower rates than the shorter-dated maturities, which were retired using the proceeds from this offering. We also successfully extended both our corporate revolver from 2018 to 2021 and our secured term loan from 2018 to 2023. 
These transactions, when combined with the overall debt reduction achieved since late last year, results in approximately $50 million in annualized interest payments for NRG. Taking into account the $10 million in annualized dividends savings we captured in the second quarter through the redemption of our convertible preferred, interest and dividend savings combined drive incremental improvements in free cash flow before growth on an annual basis at the NRG level of approximately $60 million.
And finally, NRG has just entered into an agreement with NRG Yield to sell our remaining 51% interest in CVSR, resulting in unexpected cash proceeds to NRG of approximately $180 million. These proceeds are derived from 2 sources. First, taking advantage of incremental secured debt capacity in -- at CVSR. In July, we closed $200 million in new nonrecourse secured debt, NRG's share of the net cash proceeds of which is $101.5 million. Second, we agreed to sell our remaining 51% stake in CVSR to NRG Yield for $78.5 million in cash, and expect that transaction to close this quarter. The total cash proceeds from these transactions further increased NRG level capital for allocation, which you'll find updated on Slide 10.
Turning to that Slide 10. The cash proceeds of $180 million from the CVSR transaction increased total 2016 NRG level capital available for allocation to just under $1.9 billion. The proceeds from CVSR also increased the portion of NRG level capital allocated to debt or convertible preferred reduction, which now stands at just under $1.5 billion for 2016. 
On our first quarter call, we had earmarked the net proceeds of $210 million from our Midwest Generation capacity monetization toward the potential redemption of our convertible preferred stock. Having now redeemed the convert for $226 million versus the $210 million reserve we've established for that purpose, a portion of the CVSR proceeds helps make up the difference, or $16 million. $59 million of the CVSR proceeds was used to offset the financing fees incurred in connection with the maturity extensions, allowing us to maintain the total capital allocated toward absolute debt reduction. The balance of the CVSR proceeds of $105 million will be used to increase the reserve established for the remainder of our 2018 notes, from $325 million to now $430 million.
Turning now to Slide 11 for an update on the NRG level capital structure and leverage ratios. As a result of our significant progress in debt reduction and maturity extension. The remaining balance of our 2018 unsecured notes now stands at only $587 million and is our only remaining outstanding debt maturing prior to 2021.
Looking to NRG's maturity profile in the upper left of the slide, including our corporate revolver as of the third quarter of last year, NRG had about $6.7 billion in total debt maturities through 2020. To put our progress towards strengthening our balance sheet into perspective, as a result of the continuing deleveraging and opportunistic refinancing, today, we have less than $900 million maturing through 2020, a reduction of approximately $5.8 billion in less than a year.
While we we'll continue to be opportunistic when market conditions are favorable, this increased flexibility allows us to be more selective and less exposed to the type of short-term swings and volatility in the debt markets we saw earlier in 2016. The added benefit, as I mentioned earlier, is that in the process, we've already achieved approximately $60 million in annual dividend and interest savings, which, similar to the significant decrease in environmental CapEx, which follows 2016, helps further improve our ability to translate EBITDA into free cash flow in 2017 and beyond.
Finally, as you can see in the updated table in the upper right of the slide, remain on track to drive our corporate debt-to-EBITDA ratio well below our long-term target of 4.25, allowing us to maintain adherence with principles of prudent balance sheet management through the commodity strike cycle. We're very pleased with our progress on the balance sheet front, and I want to recognize the folks in our finance, accounting and legal departments, in particular, for their outstanding efforts this year in making these successes possible and moving NRG forward in achieving our balance sheet goals for 2016.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks"

To close, I want to leave you with our score card on Slide 13. We have made excellent progress on our stated objectives, from simplifying the company and streamlining costs to strengthening our balance sheet and creating financial flexibility to better manage this commodity cycle.
Importantly, I want to know the significant progress we have made in continuing to strengthen the relationship with our strategic partner, NRG Yield. This partnership provides yet another significant point of differentiation between NRG and other IPPs, adding to our stable base of earnings and allowing us to replenish capital for assets we develop and drop down as -- with strong returns.
Last quarter, we focused on strengthening our yield book by putting in place a dedicated CEO to focus solely on growing this business. This quarter, we entered into an agreement to drop down NRG's remaining stake in CVSR. Going forward, we remain committed to finding and developing projects that we can phase in the drop-down pipeline.
Throughout the organization, our performance and progress in meeting our objectives has been impressive. And I look forward to updating you on our continued progress over the coming months. Andrea, we're now ready to open the lines for questions."

So we need to adjust our operating philosophy.

I think some investors are frustrated that despite the gas price move, we haven't seen a commensurate move up in power prices in PJM. I put that to sort the way the dispatch curves look -- dispatch curve looks and you're kind of in the deep part of this mile now where gas has to keep moving up for gas plants to move back ahead of coal. But there's also a theory that coal was burning out of dispatch and that was -- and that's putting pressure on power prices in that market. And that now that that's no longer happening, we might see better conditions. Can you comment on whether either or both of those are true? And if not, what's your outlook for PJM power prices?"

I think what I wanted to represent in the slide that in Texas it's actually -- we had seen dark spreads move significantly, both in terms of heat rate expansion and following natural gas. With respect to PJM, I think the story is slightly different. If you look at gas basis in PJM, have actually significantly decreased over the summer. And I think that is putting some pressure on the spark spreads. I am not of the theory that coal generators are running uneconomically in the region. I just think that you're seeing an influx of combined cycles, you're seeing pretty good gas prices or low gas prices compared to the forward markets a couple of months ago. And I think the combination of those 2 are just putting some pressure on the spark spreads. On a -- I guess, on a long-term basis, as the market implemented capacity performance standards and we're seeing this massive turnover between coal and natural gas, we should expect more pressure on the spark spreads. I mean, the capacity performance market was designed to ensure that generators had more availability during scarcity conditions. So as we look past 2017 and toward the end of the decade, I expect to have more pressure on spark spreads in PJM and be more constructive on capacity prices. I mean, that's why we shifted the strategy in the East, particularly in PJM, towards becoming a capacity resource as opposed to providing energy. We still maintain that option on energy, and it's a cheap [ph] option. But most of the investments that we have made our on the back of what we think is a more constructive part of the market, which is the capacity one."

And just keep in mind that in the latest auction, actually the COMED area where our Midwest Gen portfolio sits was probably the one that was most constructive in the capacity auction result.

If you look at the spark spreads, if you look at power prices, they were completely oversold the last couple of months. And that basically shifted some of the bullishness that we have in that respective market. When you look at the fundamental there, even the first half of the year, we had very, very strong loads. And if I -- if I'm not mistaken, yesterday we set a new all-time record in Texas. So load growth continues, load growth is very robust. We like the market structure, we like the higher price caps. I think there are improvements that need to happen, particularly on ORDC, and to make sure that we have better price signals when we enter into scarcity conditions. And as you mentioned, I mean, I think there is a risk for rationalization in supply, i.e. retirements. My expectation is that if we continue to see this current level of pricing, there are some old steam units and perhaps some uncontrolled -- environmentally uncontrolled coal plants that will retire because they are not going to be able to make the math work when putting bank in controls. Look, I mean, I don't want to be myopic in terms of the Regional Haze and what will happen, and it stayed and we're going to go through the process. But behind the Regional Haze, you have the ELG, you have the 1-hour SO2. I mean, you have other -- a number of other environmental regulations. I think, ultimately, smaller or medium-sized coal units that are not controlled or well-controlled, the outlook is not just going to look very promising. And perhaps it delays the retirement decision 1 or 2 years, but I think, ultimately, people will make the right economic decision. And the low gas price environment and the low spark spread environment accelerated some of that. I mean, we actually filed 2 mothball one of our old steamers, it was needed for reliability, other generators have done the same. I think you're going to continue to see that in the next -- in the coming years if something doesn't drastically change the market. But we're starting to see some recovery, Julien."

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our retail business.
Today, we're reporting second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $779 million, a 14% increase when compared to the same period last year, thanks to a solid performance from the generation business and a record second quarter result for retail, which continues to benefit from lower wholesale prices, a proven ability to attract and retain customers, and outstanding execution. These are excellent results, particularly in light of the low commodity prices that we continue to experience in our core markets. And it once again validates our integrated model and diversified approach to competitive power market. Given the back-to-back strong quarterly results and the hedge position we have in place for the remainder of the year, we're not only reaffirming guidance, but we're tracking towards the upper end of our range.
Traditionally, this quarter is a quiet one, our shoulder season, since demand for electricity and respective wholesale prices are the lowest for the year. But for us, it was rather busy. In addition to ensuring our fleet was ready for summer operations, we made significant progress in executing on our debt management plan. We have retired $337 million of corporate level debt year-to-date, reduced our 2018 to 2020 maturity debt obligation by $5.8 billion and bought back $345 million of our convertible preferred stock. Kirk will go into more detail in a few slides, but I want to take a moment to recognize him and the entire finance and legal organizations for a superb execution and timing. The progress made today is an important step to ensure that our leverage ratios remain on target through varying commodity cycles.
In delivering on our commitment to enhance capital flexibility, we have entered into an agreement with NRG Yield to drop down our 51% interest in CVSR, with $180 million in total cash consideration, including financing proceeds and an EV to EBITDA multiple of over 14x. This transaction reinforces the value of our partnership, allowing us to replenish capital efficiently, while further expanding yields portfolio and CAFD, which benefits our nearly 50% economic interest on them. Proceeds from this transaction will be allocated towards deleveraging, specifically to supplement the resource set aside for our 2018 bonds, expanding our total deleveraging target from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. This quarter, we also finalized the sale of Rockford and the Aurora plants for $425 million, bringing total cash consideration from asset sales to $563 million, which surpasses our initial target of $500 million.
We have remained relentless in our pursuit of streamlining the organization and finding additional cost savings. We are on track to achieve our 4 -- NRG cost reduction target of $400 million through 2017 and to reduce our CapEx program by $650 million for 2017. This CapEx reduction followed the successful completion of fuel conversions at New Castle and Joliet, an environmental operate at Avon Lake, with all 3 plans back online and better positioned to take advantage of opportunities in their respective markets.
Now turning to Slide 4, I want to highlight the strong performance of our integrated platform during the second quarter. Safety is always top of mind. And while we remain a top quartile performer year-to-date, we can do and have done better. We're focused on and committed to improving our safety record for the balance of the year.
The mild weather continued from the winter months into the start of the summer, with temperatures that were milder than last year. Needless to say, this kept commodity prices through the end of June lower than last year, but once again, our business delivered results that were even stronger than last year. You have heard me say this before, but this is exactly what differentiates NRG from other our IPPs. We have an integrated platform that can provide stability and deliver strong results even during periods of low prices, while maintaining significant upside, and we continue to demonstrate this quarter after quarter.
Our generation business performed well, with improvements in reliability, availability and operating cost, while realizing higher capacity revenues. We successfully completed multiple CapEx projects, bringing several units back online for the summer. In fact, during the first month of operations, our fuel conversions benefited from low gas prices in PJM and are performing even better than expected. Our fleet was also well positioned to maximize value in the recent 19/20 PJM capacity auction. Results were disappointing, given the reduction in loads an increase in newbuilds; except in COMED, where prices remained strong, benefiting our Midwest gen portfolio. Overall, we cleared about 80% of all our megawatts in PJM for a total revenues of over $0.5 billion.
While these market conditions were not ideal for the generation business, the low wholesale prices benefited our complimentary retail business. Beyond favorable supply costs this quarter, our retail business continued its push for cost efficiencies, customer retention and product expansion. This is a business that continues a trajectory of growth and has proven to be very stable. I want to commend Elizabeth and the retail team for their achievement this quarter and for continued success in growing this business.
But while the retail business and our pivot towards becoming a capacity player are important parts of the story, the NRG value proposition is even more robust than that. Turning to Slide 5, I want to put some of the recent market trends in context of NRG's multiple levers for value creation, as I outlined on our last call. The first lever is our stable but growing base, comprised of the most predictable parts of our portfolio: retail, which continues to demonstrate the stability of its earnings; capacity revenues, provides visibility multiple years into the future; and contracted assets through NRG Yield.
This first lever has proven solid over time, and there is good reason to believe that our base will only grow and strengthen given current market trends. We are encouraged by the support for constructive capacity markets and strict performance standards, but we're even more encouraged by the increasing need for contracted renewable and quick-start gas plants that are required to meet higher renewable portfolio standards and the sustainability targets of corporations across the country. We are ready to capitalize on this market opportunity, which is even further enhanced by our partnership with NRG Yield.
Now turning to the other 2 levers of our value proposition, our leverage to natural gas and power, both less predictable, but with significant upside potential given where we are in the commodity cycle. Let's start with our leverage to natural gas. We have deliberately maintained fuel diversity in our portfolio and can therefore benefit from the price differential between coal and uranium from natural gas. Our long gas position is about 3.3 BcF per day. I am encouraged by the price supply and demand outlook. We have seen a significant increase in spot prices from the recent lows; production has been stagnant, reflecting a nonsustainable low-price environment; and demand is picking up, particularly in the power sector. If the price of gas moves by $0.50, NRG would realize almost $0.5 billion in the national gross margin, 2/3 of which is realized at the NRG level and with minimal impact on our retail business since most of our fixed price obligations are short-term and hedged.
The last lever is our exposure to power prices or heat rates. Our upside is also significant as we have the largest and most diverse fleet in the country, with close to 43 gigawatts of merchant generation. While we're seeing the market tightening due to unit retirements, the outlook for power is more neutral given the increased uncertainty from environmental regulations and the recent actions to subsidize on economic generation by certain states. We will continue to work with our generators, regulators and stakeholders to protect the integrity of competitive market.
As you can see, the outlook for the business overall is positive, and no other company offers investors a play in the industry in the same way that our business does. We're not one-dimensional when it comes to creating value. And we're able to handle downturns better than others. We do not bet on a single fuel or on a single technology. We have embraced vertical integration and diversification as a way to navigate through a sea of uncertainty in our industry. I have no doubt our business is best positioned for both near and longer-term success in the industry.
I want to take a few minutes to share some thoughts on 2 of our key markets, ERCOT and PJM. Let's first start with ERCOT on Slide 6. We're seeing signs of market recovery as dark spreads have increased over 100% from their lows, even outpacing the rebounding spark spreads by a healthy margin. As an owner of environmentally controlled coal units in the region, we certainly welcome this more. So far, this summer has been characterized by consistently warm weather, but higher than normal wind production in July and a healthy grid have resulted in little to no scarcity pricing. While the forward markets have improved, we have been disappointed that the PUCT have not taken sister action to correct this demand curve to provide better market signals. That said, we do expect positive revisions to the ORDC later this year to better reflect scarcity conditions in prices.
Finally, there is still an overhang of uncertainty from several environmental regulations in Texas, most notably Regional Haze. This could delay the decision to retire uneconomic and uncontrolled assets for some time. But ultimately, the investment to comply will prove difficult for this type of units under current market conditions. We remain confident that our large environmentally controlled and favorably located assets are well-positioned to meet compliance thresholds with modest capital investments.
PJM is somewhat a different story. Moving from a market with high energy and capacity prices that incentivizes new generation, to one with energy margins under pressure. The massive turnover from coal and oil to natural gas is starting to impact spark spreads as more efficient combined cycles are coming online. In looking at both energy and capacity prices for the 19/20 period, we're now below the cost of new entry for a new CCGT.
[Audio Gap]
We expect the next auction for 2020 to '21 will be more constructive as we believe our move into 100% capacity performance requirement, a potential slowdown in new builds and a more moderate load revision will support higher capacity pricing. We are encouraged by the constructive nature of the capacity market and its efforts to better reward unit reliability. Our investments are consistent with these market dynamic, and rest assured that we will continue to oppose the usage of state-based contracts and subsidies that undermines well-functioning competitive markets.
During my first call as CEO back in February, I committed to simplifying our business. This meant not just simplifying how we communicate our value proposition to the market, but also the internal structure and interworking of the organization. In that spirit, it's not lost on me that we need to extend the simplification to our capital structure. So addressing GenOn has been one of my priorities for 2016. 
On Slide 7, I wanted to shed some light on the situation as it currently stands. The GenOn portfolio has allowed us to fill a gap with had in PJM, a strategic market as we were building a diverse portfolio across all major competitive markets. This position was later complemented with the acquisition of an additional 4,000 megawatts from Edison Mission. Over the last few years, we have taken steps to capitalize on evolving market trends, particularly around changes in the capacity market. However, deteriorating market fundamentals are adversely impacting the general portfolio. Abundant shale gas, more stringent environmental regulations and an influx of new efficient gas plants, which are costing significant pressure on energy and capacity prices in the region.
This low commodity cycle is impacting the financial health of the GenOn entity, as you can see on the upper left-hand table. Currently, the leverage ratio for the consolidated GenOn entity is 7.7x. This level of debt relative to EBITDA is successive, particularly as NRG seeks to maintain a long-term corporate level leverage ratio target of 4 in a quarter. GenOn has taken several important steps to address the challenges it faces. First, it has appointed 2 independent directors to the GenOn Board. This is a key step in ensuring the interest of all stakeholders in GenOn are considered. Second, it has retained restructuring advisers to help navigate the process efficiently and judiciously. Third, it has opportunistically sold several noncore assets over the past several quarters to help provide additional financial flexibility within the general companies.
I know that many of you have a lot of questions on GenOn, but I am sure you can appreciate this is a sensitive process. And as GenOn is engaged in ongoing conversations with its stakeholders, we are unable to elaborate on specifics at this time. I expect to provide more information as this process moves forward. What I can leave you with today is the reminder that as this process progresses and options are evaluated, there are 3 key principles that we will adhere to: simplifying the organization; maximizing value; and from NRG's perspective, maintaining the strength of the NRG balance sheet and credit metrics.
With that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review"
413857,376865373,1031335,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to financial summary on Slide 9. NRG delivered $779 million in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, driven by a strong performance by our Retail Mass business achieving a record EBITDA of $213 million. For the second quarter",998,"Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to financial summary on Slide 9. NRG delivered $779 million in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, driven by a strong performance by our Retail Mass business achieving a record EBITDA of $213 million. For the second quarter, generation and renewables combined for $326 million in adjusted EBITDA, while NRG Yield contributed $240 million. For the first half of the year, NRG generated almost $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $220 million of free cash flow before growth.
Based on both performance year-to-date and our updated outlook for the balance of the year, which has us tracking to the upper end of our EBITDA range, we're reaffirming our 2016 guidance of $3 billion to $3.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1 billion to $1.2 billion in free cash flow before growth. We expect to update and narrow these ranges following the completion of the summer season on our third quarter call in November, and we'll also provide guidance for 2017 at that time.
During the second quarter call and into July, NRG made significant progress in strengthening our balance sheet and financial flexibility as we took advantage of favorable market conditions by significantly expanding corporate maturities while continuing our deleveraging efforts. Since we embarked on our current corporate debt reduction program in the fourth quarter of 2015, we have now retired a total of $642 million of NRG-level debt. In addition, through 2 successful unsecured notes offerings totaling $2.25 million, NRG significantly extended corporate maturities at lower rates than the shorter-dated maturities, which were retired using the proceeds from this offering. We also successfully extended both our corporate revolver from 2018 to 2021 and our secured term loan from 2018 to 2023. 
These transactions, when combined with the overall debt reduction achieved since late last year, results in approximately $50 million in annualized interest savings for NRG. Taking into account the $10 million in annualized dividends savings we captured in the second quarter through the redemption of our convertible preferred, interest and dividend savings combined drive incremental improvements in free cash flow before growth on an annual basis at the NRG level of approximately $60 million.
And finally, NRG has just entered into an agreement with NRG Yield to sell our remaining 51% interest in CVSR, resulting in unexpected cash proceeds to NRG of approximately $180 million. These proceeds are derived from 2 sources. First, taking advantage of incremental secured debt capacity in -- at CVSR. In July, we closed on $200 million in new nonrecourse secured debt, NRG's share of the net cash proceeds of which is $101.5 million. Second, we agreed to sell our remaining 51% stake in CVSR to NRG Yield for $78.5 million in cash, and expect that transaction to close this quarter. The total cash proceeds from these transactions further increase NRG level capital for allocation, which you'll find updated on Slide 10.
Turning to that Slide 10. The cash proceeds of $180 million from the CVSR transaction increased total 2016 NRG level capital available for allocation to just under $1.9 billion. The proceeds from CVSR also increased the portion of NRG level capital allocated to debt or convertible preferred reduction, which now stands at just under $1.5 billion for 2016. 
On our first quarter call, we had earmarked the net proceeds of $210 million from our Midwest Generation capacity monetization toward the potential redemption of our convertible preferred stock. Having now redeemed the convert for $226 million versus the $210 million reserve we've established for that purpose, a portion of the CVSR proceeds helps make up the difference, or $16 million. $59 million of the CVSR proceeds was used to offset the financing fees incurred in connection with the maturity extensions, allowing us to maintain the total capital allocated toward absolute debt reduction. The balance of the CVSR proceeds of $105 million will be used to increase the reserve established for the remainder of our 2018 notes, from $325 million to now $430 million.
Turning now to Slide 11 for an update on the NRG level capital structure and leverage ratios. As a result of our significant progress in debt reduction and maturity extension. The remaining balance of our 2018 unsecured notes now stands at only $587 million and is our only remaining outstanding debt maturing prior to 2021.
Looking to NRG's maturity profile in the upper left of the slide, including our corporate revolver as of the third quarter of last year, NRG had about $6.7 billion in total debt maturities through 2020. To put our progress towards strengthening our balance sheet into perspective, as a result of the continuing deleveraging and opportunistic refinancing, today, we have less than $900 million maturing through 2020, a reduction of approximately $5.8 billion in less than a year.
While we'll continue to be opportunistic when market conditions are favorable, this increased flexibility allows us to be more selective and less exposed to the type of short-term swings and volatility in the debt markets we saw earlier in 2016. The added benefit, as I mentioned earlier, is that in the process, we've already achieved approximately $60 million in annual dividend and interest savings, which, similar to the significant decrease in environmental CapEx, which follows 2016, helps further improve our ability to translate EBITDA into free cash flow in 2017 and beyond.
Finally, as you can see in the updated table in the upper right of the slide, remain on track to drive our corporate debt-to-EBITDA ratio well below our long-term target of 4.25, allowing us to maintain adherence with principles of prudent balance sheet management through the commodity cycle. We're very pleased with our progress on the balance sheet front, and I want to recognize the folks in our finance, accounting and legal departments, in particular, for their outstanding efforts this year in making these successes possible and moving NRG forward in achieving our balance sheet goals for 2016.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks"

To close, I want to leave you with our score card on Slide 13. We have made excellent progress on our stated objectives, from simplifying the company and streamlining costs to strengthening our balance sheet and creating financial flexibility to better manage this commodity cycle.
Importantly, I want to know the significant progress we have made in continuing to strengthen the relationship with our strategic partner, NRG Yield. This partnership provides yet another significant point of differentiation between NRG and other IPPs, adding to our stable base of earnings and allowing us to replenish capital for assets we develop and drop down as -- with strong returns.
Last quarter, we focused on strengthening our yield book by putting in place a dedicated CEO to focus solely on growing this business. This quarter, we entered into an agreement to drop down NRG's remaining stake in CVSR. Going forward, we remain committed to finding and developing projects that we can place in the drop-down pipeline.
Throughout the organization, our performance and progress in meeting our objectives has been impressive. And I look forward to updating you on our continued progress over the coming months. Andrea, we're now ready to open the lines for questions."

We looked at optimizing our maintenance CapEx, our outages, and we're trying to be consistent with the way the portfolio is running today, which is not the same way the portfolio ran before. So we need to adjust our operating philosophy. And then last one, I think we also benefited from capacity revenues coming from our South Central region, where, in the past, we've said that we were able to move some megawatts into the PJM capacity auction.

I think some investors are frustrated that despite the gas price move, we haven't seen a commensurate move up in power prices in PJM. I put that to sort the way the dispatch curves look -- dispatch curve looks and you're kind of in the deep part of the smile now where gas has to keep moving up for gas plants to move back ahead of coal. But there's also a theory that coal was burning out of dispatch and that was -- and that's putting pressure on power prices in that market. And that now that that's no longer happening, we might see better conditions. Can you comment on whether either or both of those are true? And if not, what's your outlook for PJM power prices?"

I think what I wanted to represent in the slide that in Texas it's actually -- we had seen dark spreads move significantly, both in terms of heat rate expansion and following natural gas. With respect to PJM, I think the story is slightly different. If you look at gas basis in PJM, have actually significantly decreased over the summer. And I think that is putting some pressure on the spark spreads. I am not of the theory that coal generators are running uneconomically in the region. I just think that you're seeing an influx of combined cycles, you're seeing pretty good gas prices or low gas prices compared to the forward markets a couple of months ago. And I think the combination of those 2 are just putting some pressure on the spark spreads. On a -- I guess, on a long-term basis, as the market implemented capacity performance standards and we're seeing this massive turnover between coal and natural gas, we should expect more pressure on the spark spreads. I mean, the capacity performance market was designed to ensure that generators had more availability during scarcity conditions. So as we look past 2017 and toward the end of the decade, I expect to have more pressure on spark spreads in PJM and be more constructive on capacity prices. I mean, that's why we shifted the strategy in the East, particularly in PJM, towards becoming a capacity resource as opposed to providing energy. We still maintain that option on energy, and it's a cheap option. But most of the investments that we have made our on the back of what we think is a more constructive part of the market, which is the capacity one."

So when we think about the portfolio, even without -- in the possibility of not having the GenOn entity, we feel very comfortable with the geographic diversification that we have across all competitive markets, including PJM. And just keep in mind that in the latest auction, actually the COMED area where our Midwest Gen portfolio sits was probably the one that was most constructive in the capacity auction result. So clearly, we will reevaluate the makeup of our portfolio, but I think that doesn't necessarily changes the underlying value proposition of an integrated platform with diversity across fuel, merit order and geographic location.

If you look at the spark spreads, if you look at power prices, they were completely oversold the last couple of months. And that basically shifted some of the bullishness that we have in that respective market. When you look at the fundamental there, even the first half of the year, we had very, very strong growth. And if I -- if I'm not mistaken, yesterday we set a new all-time record in Texas. So load growth continues, load growth is very robust. We like the market structure, we like the higher price caps. I think there are improvements that need to happen, particularly on ORDC, and to make sure that we have better price signals when we enter into scarcity conditions. And as you mentioned, I mean, I think there is a risk for rationalization in supply, i.e. retirements. My expectation is that if we continue to see this current level of pricing, there are some old steam units and perhaps some uncontrolled -- environmentally uncontrolled coal plants that will retire because they are not going to be able to make the math work when putting bank in controls. Look, I mean, I don't want to be myopic in terms of the Regional Haze and what will happen, and it stayed and we're going to go through the process. But behind the Regional Haze, you have the ELG, you have the 1-hour SO2. I mean, you have other -- a number of other environmental regulations. I think, ultimately, smaller or medium-sized coal units that are not controlled or well-controlled, the outlook is just not going to look very promising. And perhaps it delays the retirement decision 1 or 2 years, but I think, ultimately, people will make the right economic decision. And the low gas price environment and the low spark spread environment accelerated some of that. I mean, we actually filed 2 mothball one of our old steamers, it was needed for reliability, other generators have done the same. I think you're going to continue to see that in the next -- in the coming years if something doesn't drastically change in the market. But we're starting to see some recovery, Julien."

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our retail business.
Today, we're reporting second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $779 million, a 14% increase when compared to the same period last year, thanks to a solid performance from the generation business and a record second quarter result for retail, which continues to benefit from lower wholesale prices, a proven ability to attract and retain customers, and outstanding execution. These are excellent results, particularly in light of the low commodity prices that we continue to experience in our core markets. And it once again validates our integrated model and diversified approach to competitive power market. Given the back-to-back strong quarterly results and the hedge position we have in place for the remainder of the year, we're not only reaffirming guidance, but we're tracking towards the upper end of our range.
Traditionally, this quarter is a quiet one, our shoulder season, since demand for electricity and respective wholesale prices are the lowest for the year. But for us, it was rather busy. In addition to ensuring our fleet was ready for summer operations, we made significant progress in executing on our debt management plan. We have retired $337 million of corporate level debt year-to-date, reduced our 2018 to 2020 maturity debt obligation by $5.8 billion and bought back $345 million of our convertible preferred stock. Kirk will go into more detail in a few slides, but I want to take a moment to recognize him and the entire finance and legal organizations for a superb execution and timing. The progress made today is an important step to ensure that our leverage ratios remain on target through varying commodity cycles.
In delivering on our commitment to enhance capital flexibility, we have entered into an agreement with NRG Yield to drop down our 51% interest in CVSR, with $180 million in total cash consideration, including financing proceeds and an EV to EBITDA multiple of over 14x. This transaction reinforces the value of our partnership, allowing us to replenish capital efficiently, while further expanding yields portfolio and CAFD, which benefits our nearly 50% economic interest on them. Proceeds from this transaction will be allocated towards deleveraging, specifically to supplement the resource set aside for our 2018 bonds, expanding our total deleveraging target from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. This quarter, we also finalized the sale of Rockford and the Aurora plants for $425 million, bringing total cash consideration from asset sales to $563 million, which surpasses our initial target of $500 million.
We have remained relentless in our pursuit of streamlining the organization and finding additional cost savings. We are on track to achieve our 4 -- NRG cost reduction target of $400 million through 2017 and to reduce our CapEx program by $650 million for 2017. This CapEx reduction followed the successful completion of fuel conversions at New Castle and Joliet, an environmental operate at Avon Lake, with all 3 plans back online and better positioned to take advantage of opportunities in their respective markets.
Now turning to Slide 4, I want to highlight the strong performance of our integrated platform during the second quarter. Safety is always top of mind. And while we remain a top quartile performer year-to-date, we can do and have done better. We're focused on and committed to improving our safety record for the balance of the year.
The mild weather continued from the winter months into the start of the summer, with temperatures that were milder than last year. Needless to say, this kept commodity prices through the end of June lower than last year, but once again, our business delivered results that were even stronger than last year. You have heard me say this before, but this is exactly what differentiates NRG from other our IPPs. We have an integrated platform that can provide stability and deliver strong results even during periods of low prices, while maintaining significant upside, and we continue to demonstrate this quarter after quarter.
Our generation business performed well, with improvements in reliability, availability and operating cost, while realizing higher capacity revenues. We successfully completed multiple CapEx projects, bringing several units back online for the summer. In fact, during the first month of operations, our fuel conversions benefited from low gas prices in PJM and are performing even better than expected. Our fleet was also well positioned to maximize value in the recent 19/20 PJM capacity auction. Results were disappointing, given the reduction in loads an increase in newbuilds; except in COMED, where prices remained strong, benefiting our Midwest gen portfolio. Overall, we cleared about 80% of all our megawatts in PJM for a total revenues of over $0.5 billion.
While these market conditions were not ideal for the generation business, the low wholesale prices benefited our complimentary retail business. Beyond favorable supply costs this quarter, our retail business continued its push for cost efficiencies, customer retention and product expansion. This is a business that continues a trajectory of growth and has proven to be very stable. I want to commend Elizabeth and the retail team for their achievement this quarter and for continued success in growing this business.
But while the retail business and our pivot towards becoming a capacity player are important parts of the story, the NRG value proposition is even more robust than that. Turning to Slide 5, I want to put some of the recent market trends in context of NRG's multiple levers for value creation, as I outlined on our last call. The first lever is our stable but growing base, comprised of the most predictable parts of our portfolio: retail, which continues to demonstrate the stability of its earnings; capacity revenues, provides visibility multiple years into the future; and contracted assets through NRG Yield.
This first lever has proven solid over time, and there is good reason to believe that our base will only grow and strengthen given current market trends. We are encouraged by the support for constructive capacity markets and strict performance standards, but we're even more encouraged by the increasing need for contracted renewable and quick-start gas plants that are required to meet higher renewable portfolio standards and the sustainability targets of corporations across the country. We are ready to capitalize on this market opportunity, which is even further enhanced by our partnership with NRG Yield.
Now turning to the other 2 levers of our value proposition, our leverage to natural gas and power, both less predictable, but with significant upside potential given where we are in the commodity cycle. Let's start with our leverage to natural gas. We have deliberately maintained fuel diversity in our portfolio and can therefore benefit from the price differential between coal and uranium from natural gas. Our long gas position is about 3.3 BcF per day. I am encouraged by the price supply and demand outlook. We have seen a significant increase in spot prices from the recent lows; production has been stagnant, reflecting a nonsustainable low-price environment; and demand is picking up, particularly in the power sector. If the price of gas moves by $0.50, NRG would realize almost $0.5 billion in the national gross margin, 2/3 of which is realized at the NRG level and with minimal impact on our retail business since most of our fixed price obligations are short-term and hedged.
The last lever is our exposure to power prices or heat rates. Our upside is also significant as we have the largest and most diverse fleet in the country, with close to 43 gigawatts of merchant generation. While we're seeing the market tightening due to unit retirements, the outlook for power is more neutral given the increased uncertainty from environmental regulations and the recent actions to subsidize on economic generation by certain states. We will continue to work with our generators, regulators and stakeholders to protect the integrity of competitive market.
As you can see, the outlook for the business overall is positive, and no other company offers investors a play in the industry in the same way that our business does. We're not one-dimensional when it comes to creating value. And we're able to handle downturns better than others. We do not bet on a single fuel or on a single technology. We have embraced vertical integration and diversification as a way to navigate through a sea of uncertainty in our industry. I have no doubt our business is best positioned for both near and longer-term success in the industry.
I want to take a few minutes to share some thoughts on 2 of our key markets, ERCOT and PJM. Let's first start with ERCOT on Slide 6. We're seeing signs of market recovery as dark spreads have increased over 100% from their lows, even outpacing the rebounding spark spreads by a healthy margin. As an owner of environmentally controlled coal units in the region, we certainly welcome this more. So far, this summer has been characterized by consistently warm weather, but higher than normal wind production in July and a healthy grid have resulted in little to no scarcity pricing. While the forward markets have improved, we have been disappointed that the PUCT have not taken sister action to correct this demand curve to provide better market signals. That said, we do expect positive revisions to the ORDC later this year to better reflect scarcity conditions in prices.
Finally, there is still an overhang of uncertainty from several environmental regulations in Texas, most notably Regional Haze. This could delay the decision to retire uneconomic and uncontrolled assets for some time. But ultimately, the investment to comply will prove difficult for this type of units under current market conditions. We remain confident that our large environmentally controlled and favorably located assets are well-positioned to meet compliance thresholds with modest capital investments.
PJM is somewhat a different story. Moving from a market with high energy and capacity prices that incentivizes new generation, to one with energy margins under pressure. The massive turnover from coal and oil to natural gas is starting to impact spark spreads as more efficient combined cycles are coming online. In looking at both energy and capacity prices for the 19/20 period, we're now below the cost of new entry for a new CCGT.
[Audio Gap]
We expect the next auction for 2020 to '21 will be more constructive as we believe our move into 100% capacity performance requirement, a potential slowdown in new builds and a more moderate load revision will support higher capacity pricing. We are encouraged by the constructive nature of the capacity market and its efforts to better reward unit reliability. Our investments are consistent with these market dynamic, and rest assured that we will continue to oppose the usage of state-based contracts and subsidies that undermines well-functioning competitive markets.
During my first call as CEO back in February, I committed to simplifying our business. This meant not just simplifying how we communicate our value proposition to the market, but also the internal structure and interworking of the organization. In that spirit, it's not lost on me that we need to extend the simplification to our capital structure. So addressing GenOn has been one of my priorities for 2016. 
On Slide 7, I wanted to shed some light on the situation as it currently stands. The GenOn portfolio has allowed us to fill a gap with had in PJM, a strategic market as we were building a diverse portfolio across all major competitive markets. This position was later complemented with the acquisition of an additional 4,000 megawatts from Edison Mission. Over the last few years, we have taken steps to capitalize on evolving market trends, particularly around changes in the capacity market. However, deteriorating market fundamentals are adversely impacting the general portfolio. Abundant shale gas, more stringent environmental regulations and an influx of new efficient gas plants, which are costing significant pressure on energy and capacity prices in the region.
This low commodity cycle is impacting the financial health of the GenOn entity, as you can see on the upper left-hand table. Currently, the leverage ratio for the consolidated GenOn entity is 7.7x. This level of debt relative to EBITDA is successive, particularly as NRG seeks to maintain a long-term corporate level leverage ratio target of 4 in a quarter. GenOn has taken several important steps to address the challenges it faces. First, it has appointed 2 independent directors to the GenOn Board. This is a key step in ensuring the interest of all stakeholders in GenOn are considered. Second, it has retained restructuring advisers to help navigate the process efficiently and judiciously. Third, it has opportunistically sold several noncore assets over the past several quarters to help provide additional financial flexibility within the general companies.
I know that many of you have a lot of questions on GenOn, but I am sure you can appreciate this is a sensitive process. And as GenOn is engaged in ongoing conversations with its stakeholders, we are unable to elaborate on specifics at this time. I expect to provide more information as this process moves forward. What I can leave you with today is the reminder that as this process progresses and options are evaluated, there are 3 key principles that we will adhere to: simplifying the organization; maximizing value; and from NRG's perspective, maintaining the strength of the NRG balance sheet and credit metrics.
With that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review"

For the second quarter, generation and renewables combined for $326 million in adjusted EBITDA, while NRG Yield contributed $240 million. For the first half of the year, NRG generated almost $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $220 million of free cash flow before growth.
Based on both performance year-to-date and our updated outlook for the balance of the year, which has us tracking to the upper end of our EBITDA range, we're reaffirming our 2016 guidance of $3 billion to $3.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1 billion to $1.2 billion in free cash flow before growth. We expect to update and narrow these ranges following the completion of the summer season on our third quarter call in November, and we'll also provide guidance for 2017 at that time.
During the second quarter call and into July, NRG made significant progress in strengthening our balance sheet and financial flexibility as we took advantage of favorable market conditions by significantly expanding corporate maturities while continuing our deleveraging efforts. Since we embarked on our current corporate debt reduction program in the fourth quarter of 2015, we have now retired a total of $642 million of NRG-level debt. In addition, through 2 successful unsecured notes offerings totaling $2.25 million, NRG significantly extended corporate maturities at lower rates than the shorter-dated maturities, which were retired using the proceeds from this offering. We also successfully extended both our corporate revolver from 2018 to 2021 and our secured term loan from 2018 to 2023. 
These transactions, when combined with the overall debt reduction achieved since late last year, results in approximately $50 million in annualized interest savings for NRG. Taking into account the $10 million in annualized dividends savings we captured in the second quarter through the redemption of our convertible preferred, interest and dividend savings combined drive incremental improvements in free cash flow before growth on an annual basis at the NRG level of approximately $60 million.
And finally, NRG has just entered into an agreement with NRG Yield to sell our remaining 51% interest in CVSR, resulting in unexpected cash proceeds to NRG of approximately $180 million. These proceeds are derived from 2 sources. First, taking advantage of incremental secured debt capacity in -- at CVSR. In July, we closed on $200 million in new nonrecourse secured debt, NRG's share of the net cash proceeds of which is $101.5 million. Second, we agreed to sell our remaining 51% stake in CVSR to NRG Yield for $78.5 million in cash, and expect that transaction to close this quarter. The total cash proceeds from these transactions further increase NRG level capital for allocation, which you'll find updated on Slide 10.
Turning to that Slide 10. The cash proceeds of $180 million from the CVSR transaction increased total 2016 NRG level capital available for allocation to just under $1.9 billion. The proceeds from CVSR also increased the portion of NRG level capital allocated to debt or convertible preferred reduction, which now stands at just under $1.5 billion for 2016. 
On our first quarter call, we had earmarked the net proceeds of $210 million from our Midwest Generation capacity monetization toward the potential redemption of our convertible preferred stock. Having now redeemed the convert for $226 million versus the $210 million reserve we've established for that purpose, a portion of the CVSR proceeds helps make up the difference, or $16 million. $59 million of the CVSR proceeds was used to offset the financing fees incurred in connection with the maturity extensions, allowing us to maintain the total capital allocated toward absolute debt reduction. The balance of the CVSR proceeds of $105 million will be used to increase the reserve established for the remainder of our 2018 notes, from $325 million to now $430 million.
Turning now to Slide 11 for an update on the NRG level capital structure and leverage ratios. As a result of our significant progress in debt reduction and maturity extension. The remaining balance of our 2018 unsecured notes now stands at only $587 million and is our only remaining outstanding debt maturing prior to 2021.
Looking to NRG's maturity profile in the upper left of the slide, including our corporate revolver as of the third quarter of last year, NRG had about $6.7 billion in total debt maturities through 2020. To put our progress towards strengthening our balance sheet into perspective, as a result of the continuing deleveraging and opportunistic refinancing, today, we have less than $900 million maturing through 2020, a reduction of approximately $5.8 billion in less than a year.
While we'll continue to be opportunistic when market conditions are favorable, this increased flexibility allows us to be more selective and less exposed to the type of short-term swings and volatility in the debt markets we saw earlier in 2016. The added benefit, as I mentioned earlier, is that in the process, we've already achieved approximately $60 million in annual dividend and interest savings, which, similar to the significant decrease in environmental CapEx, which follows 2016, helps further improve our ability to translate EBITDA into free cash flow in 2017 and beyond.
Finally, as you can see in the updated table in the upper right of the slide, remain on track to drive our corporate debt-to-EBITDA ratio well below our long-term target of 4.25, allowing us to maintain adherence with principles of prudent balance sheet management through the commodity cycle. We're very pleased with our progress on the balance sheet front, and I want to recognize the folks in our finance, accounting and legal departments, in particular, for their outstanding efforts this year in making these successes possible and moving NRG forward in achieving our balance sheet goals for 2016.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks"

To close, I want to leave you with our score card on Slide 13. We have made excellent progress on our stated objectives, from simplifying the company and streamlining costs to strengthening our balance sheet and creating financial flexibility to better manage this commodity cycle.
Importantly, I want to know the significant progress we have made in continuing to strengthen the relationship with our strategic partner, NRG Yield. This partnership provides yet another significant point of differentiation between NRG and other IPPs, adding to our stable base of earnings and allowing us to replenish capital for assets we develop and drop down as -- with strong returns.
Last quarter, we focused on strengthening our yield book by putting in place a dedicated CEO to focus solely on growing this business. This quarter, we entered into an agreement to drop down NRG's remaining stake in CVSR. Going forward, we remain committed to finding and developing projects that we can place in the drop-down pipeline.
Throughout the organization, our performance and progress in meeting our objectives has been impressive. And I look forward to updating you on our continued progress over the coming months. Andrea, we're now ready to open the lines for questions."

I put that to sort the way the dispatch curves look -- dispatch curve looks and you're kind of in the deep part of the smile now where gas has to keep moving up for gas plants to move back ahead of coal. But there's also a theory that coal was burning out of dispatch and that was -- and that's putting pressure on power prices in that market.

I think what I wanted to represent in the slide that in Texas it's actually -- we had seen dark spreads move significantly, both in terms of heat rate expansion and following natural gas. With respect to PJM, I think the story is slightly different. If you look at gas basis in PJM, have actually significantly decreased over the summer. And I think that is putting some pressure on the spark spreads. I am not of the theory that coal generators are running uneconomically in the region. I just think that you're seeing an influx of combined cycles, you're seeing pretty good gas prices or low gas prices compared to the forward markets a couple of months ago. And I think the combination of those 2 are just putting some pressure on the spark spreads. On a -- I guess, on a long-term basis, as the market implemented capacity performance standards and we're seeing this massive turnover between coal and natural gas, we should expect more pressure on the spark spreads. I mean, the capacity performance market was designed to ensure that generators had more availability during scarcity conditions. So as we look past 2017 and toward the end of the decade, I expect to have more pressure on spark spreads in PJM and be more constructive on capacity prices. I mean, that's why we shifted the strategy in the East, particularly in PJM, towards becoming a capacity resource as opposed to providing energy. We still maintain that option on energy, and it's a cheap option. But most of the investments that we have made our on the back of what we think is a more constructive part of the market, which is the capacity one."

So when we think about the portfolio, even without -- in the possibility of not having the GenOn entity, we feel very comfortable with the geographic diversification that we have across all competitive markets, including PJM. And just keep in mind that in the latest auction, actually the COMED area where our Midwest Gen portfolio sits was probably the one that was most constructive in the capacity auction result. So clearly, we will reevaluate the makeup of our portfolio, but I think that doesn't necessarily changes the underlying value proposition of an integrated platform with diversity across fuel, merit order and geographic location.

If you look at the spark spreads, if you look at power prices, they were completely oversold the last couple of months. And that basically shifted some of the bullishness that we have in that respective market. When you look at the fundamental there, even the first half of the year, we had very, very strong growth. And if I -- if I'm not mistaken, yesterday we set a new all-time record in Texas. So load growth continues, load growth is very robust. We like the market structure, we like the higher price caps. I think there are improvements that need to happen, particularly on ORDC, and to make sure that we have better price signals when we enter into scarcity conditions. And as you mentioned, I mean, I think there is a risk for rationalization in supply, i.e. retirements. My expectation is that if we continue to see this current level of pricing, there are some old steam units and perhaps some uncontrolled -- environmentally uncontrolled coal plants that will retire because they are not going to be able to make the math work when putting bank in controls. Look, I mean, I don't want to be myopic in terms of the Regional Haze and what will happen, and it stayed and we're going to go through the process. But behind the Regional Haze, you have the ELG, you have the 1-hour SO2. I mean, you have other -- a number of other environmental regulations. I think, ultimately, smaller or medium-sized coal units that are not controlled or well-controlled, the outlook is just not going to look very promising. And perhaps it delays the retirement decision 1 or 2 years, but I think, ultimately, people will make the right economic decision. And the low gas price environment and the low spark spread environment accelerated some of that. I mean, we actually filed 2 mothball one of our old steamers, it was needed for reliability, other generators have done the same. I think you're going to continue to see that in the next -- in the coming years if something doesn't drastically change in the market. But we're starting to see some recovery, Julien."

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Business; and Craig Cornelius, Head of our Renewables Business.
I want to start by highlighting the key messages for today's call on Slide 3. First, we're narrowing and increasing our 2016 EBITDA guidance by $200 million at the midpoint. Our exceptional performance by everyone in the company once again highlights the value of our integrated platform and its continued ability to perform under a variety of market conditions. 
Second, after reintegrating the renewables business into NRG earlier this year, we're now fully leveraging our proven operational platform. As you will hear later in the presentation, we have a robust and growing renewables business that not only enables us to acquire and operate assets in one of the fastest-growing parts of the energy industry but also helps to strengthen our partnership with NRG Yield. This business is executing on market opportunities and, with the SunEdison transaction, is only getting stronger.
Last, I am extremely pleased with our progress in strengthening the balance sheet. As of today, we have reduced our corporate debt obligation by $1 billion, bought back $345 million in convertible preferred shares and extended over $6 billion in near-term maturities well beyond 2020. These are impressive numbers given we started off our efforts only 1 year ago, and this has been one of my primary objectives since becoming CEO. I wanted to thank everyone in the organization who worked hard to achieve our targets in such a short time frame.
Now moving on to the third quarter results on Slide 4. Today, we're reporting third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.173 billion, a testament to the continued operational and financial strength of our business. Once again, despite the sustained low commodity price environment, our platform delivered. 
I want to highlight the outstanding results of our retail business for the quarter, which increased by 18% year-over-year, recording one of its strongest performances ever. Elizabeth and her team continue to operate a best-in-class retail business and, together with our commercial team, have proven extremely effective in supply and risk management and in strengthening customer relationships. Well done to the entire retail and commercial teams on your continued success. I also want to recognize everyone in the organization for improving our safety record over the quarter and returning us to a top-decile performer.
Our generation business performed well during some very challenging market conditions. Not only did we protect the value of our fleet during very low summer prices, but we also executed our asset optimization projects on time and on budget, including 3 coal-to-gas conversions this year. We remain focused on strengthening our yield growth during the quarter by expanding the potential pipeline of projects. 
In addition to the SunEdison transaction, we also completed the drop-down of CVSR, and today, we are announcing an agreement to build 73 megawatts thermal equivalent at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center on behalf of NRG Yield. Last, we have been making good progress in streamlining our cost structure and remain on track to achieve $400 million in savings by the end of 2017 under our FORNRG program.
Underpinned by our hedge profile and integrated model, we're initiating 2017 financial guidance of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. Later in the presentation, Kirk will provide additional details. But for now, I want to highlight our consolidated free cash flow range of $800 million to $1 billion.  As we have done in the past, we manage our business for cash, and this guidance speaks to the stability and strength of our free cash flow-generating ability, which, at current prices, implies a 30% free cash flow yield.
Let me turn now to our market slide on Slide 5. This summer proved to be a disappointing one from a pricing standpoint, particularly in the East, where temperatures were almost 30% above the 10-year average but prices were flat compared to the forward market. This was due to a lack of load growth and much lower gas basis. 
In Texas, we experienced mild weather, but even under these conditions, ERCOT still managed to post a record peak load of 71 gigawatts, a roughly 2% increase from the previous peak 1 year ago. We have consistently said that this is the only market where we are seeing load growth, and this summer is evidence of that. Unfortunately, prices came in much lower than expected, in large part due to the over performance of wind, which was about twice the expected production during peak hours, eliminating the potential for scarcity pricing. As you can see on the right side of the slide, disappointing summer prices and the recent selloff in gas have been putting some pressure on the forward market.
Longer term and turning to Slide 6, we remain bullish in our outlook for ERCOT, particularly at these price levels, where we see a clear opportunity for a market correction in the near future. As I just noted, ERCOT is experiencing real demand growth, about 1.4% year-to-date, which is the strongest in the country. But despite the new peak load this summer, we did not see scarcity pricing, and we actually have not seen it for a number of years. 
I want to reiterate that the ORDC is not providing the right scarcity price signals to existing or new generation. As an energy-only market, correct price signals are imperative for its proper functioning. We are hopeful that with the resolution of EFH restructuring, the PUCT will turn its attention to ORDC reform, and we look forward to working with both the PUCT and ERCOT to improve the market.
We're also starting to see units retire, given persistent low power prices. These retirements will only be accentuated by additional environmental compliance requirements. We believe there are at least 4 to 8 more gigawatts currently at risk, none of which are NRG units. A combination of strong load growth, units at risk, higher environmental cost, potential delays in new builds and market structure reforms drives our constructive view in ERCOT.
Turning to the East. Energy margins in PJM remain under pressure given the new capacity performance requirements, but, in essence, we view the probability of scarcity pricing. This, combined with no load growth and the significant amount of new gas builds coming online in the next few years, results in a less-than-favorable outlook for energy margins.
Capacity, on the other hand, is a different story. The next PJM auction will be the first with 100% capacity performance requirement. These CP-only market construct will impose significant risk on the 17 gigawatts of generation that clear at base capacity in the last auction as well as the 10 gigawatts of demand response and energy efficiencies that also cleared as base capacity. Let me be clear. That's 27 gigawatts of capacity that has a decision to make on how and what to bid into the CP auction in May.
One last thought on the markets. Now it is important to reiterate that we will take firm action against any out-of-market efforts that undermine the integrity of competitive markets, like the ones we have seen in New York, Ohio and Illinois. As proponents of competitive markets, you can expect us to be vocal advocates of our position.
Let me turn to our renewable business on Slide 7. In the past, I have discussed with you the importance of renewable generation in our future and the positive trends we see in that market. Higher renewable portfolio standards, increasing corporate sustainability targets and cost efficiencies are the basis for sustained growth in renewables demand.
In my first goal as CEO and consistent with this outlook, I announced the reintegration of our renewables business back into NRG, recognizing the changing landscape of the power industry and the compelling growth opportunities for NRG. Our renewables business is unique as it leverages NRG's existing operational platform and customer relationships from the traditional generation and retail businesses. We also have the ability to augment our renewables business by acquiring or developing renewable assets that can be dropped down to NRG Yield. This puts NRG in an excellent competitive position to execute and play in this space in a meaningful way.
Today, we operate over 4 gigawatts of wind and solar assets, making us one of the largest renewable generators in the country. We are focused on building out our pipeline and creating line of sight several years into the future. We have been hard at work developing projects, and currently, we have approximately 800 megawatts in near-term and backlog assets and an additional 2.6 gigawatts of pipeline capacity. Renewables provides not just an opportunity to execute on low-cost growth but also a way to enhance our value proposition by contributing to our stable base of earnings and providing visibility into future cash flows. This is an important business that is strong today and only getting stronger.
Turning now to our SunEdison asset transaction on Slide 8. In September, NRG selected -- was selected as the winning bidder for a 1.5-gigawatt portfolio of utility-scale wind and solar assets at an initial purchase price of $129 million, with $59 million in earn-out potential. In October, we completed the purchase of 29 megawatts of distributed generation assets for $68 million. Our scale, diverse platform and partnership with NRG Yield afforded us significant advantages during the bidding process, and these same characteristics will continue to be advantageous as a developer and operator of these assets in the future. 
On the utility-scale transaction, we were able to mitigate risk and maximize rewards by purchasing a portfolio of assets in which we could ascribe the majority of the transaction value of the operational assets and maintain the pipeline as an option [indiscernible] to market prices. To be more specific, over 85% of the total purchase price is justified by the expected value of the operating assets in Utah. The balance will come from the development and optimization of the 1.2-gigawatt backlog and pipeline, representing a low-cost option for growth. With our distributed assets, NRG would expect to achieve strong returns as a result of placing these megawatts into our DG partnership with NRG Yield. 
This transaction is a significant win for NRG as we continue to build out our position as a leader in renewable generation. We executed on a unique opportunity to accelerate the growth of our renewables business while setting the foundation for strengthened partnership with NRG Yield. It is our expectation that this will be temporary use of capital that can be recovered in a short period of time.
Turning to Slide 9. I'd like to discuss our current thinking on capital allocation for 2017. Although details will come out on our next call, I'd like to provide you with my current assessment of our options as I see them today, particularly on the 30% of the capital that is yet to be allocated. I want to, first, remind you of our philosophy on capital allocation. Maintaining the robustness of the balance sheet and making decisions that are cycle appropriate [indiscernible] our approach to allocating capital. We're in a deeply cyclical sector, which means that we must plan ahead, anticipate markets and leave no doubt about our financial strength, particularly during down cycles, such as the one we're currently facing.
Last year, given the market outlook and to reduce our overall leverage, we initiated a $1.5 billion deleveraging program. Over the course of the past year, we have made significant progress toward this target, and as we are finishing these commitments, I want to ensure the market that cycle-appropriate leverage and capital discipline will continue across the organization into 2017. With respect to growth, even in the low commodity price environment, we are focused on low-cost options or areas of quick capital replenishment, such as the SunEdison transaction.
Finally, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders when we feel our capital structure is strong enough to allow for flexibility. At the beginning of the year, we revised our dividend program to be consistent with the cyclical nature of our industry, and I remain comfortable with our dividend policy. We continue to evaluate the potential for share buybacks, given our current share price and free cash flow yields. 
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review."

Turning to financial summary on Slide 11. NRG delivered $1.173 billion in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, led by strong performance by our Retail Mass business, which contributed EBITDA of $266 millio",1302,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to financial summary on Slide 11. NRG delivered $1.173 billion in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, led by strong performance by our Retail Mass business, which contributed EBITDA of $266 million. Generation and renewables combined for $605 million in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter while NRG Yield contributed $246 million. As required by GAAP, following completion of the drop-down of NRG's remaining interest in CVSR to NRG Yield, adjusted EBITDA at NRG Yield now reflects 100% of consolidated CVSR results with an equal reduction in generation and renewables results.
Through the first 9 months of the year, NRG generated almost $2.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.1 billion of free cash flow before growth. Based on performance year-to-date and our updated outlook for the balance of the year, we're increasing and narrowing our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion, which I'll review in greater detail shortly.
As of this week, we've now completed over $1 billion in corporate debt reduction over the course of the last 12 months, with $777 million completed year-to-date and $246 million retired in the fourth quarter of 2015. This significant reduction in corporate debt helps ensure we can maintain our balance sheet targets through the low commodity price cycle. In addition, when combined with the retirement of our convertible preferred and the extension of corporate debt maturities at more favorable rates, our deleveraging efforts also help generate nearly $90 million in annual interest and dividend savings, improving NRG-level free cash flow.
While the specifics of the 2017 capital allocation plan will be laid out in more detail on our year-end earnings call, we do intend to reduce corporate debt by an additional $400 million through the retirement of the remaining balance of our 2018 senior unsecured notes. This will further enhance balance sheet strength, reduce interest expense and extend our nearest unsecured maturity to 2021, the balance of which is now only $200 million. During the third quarter, NRG also completed the drop-down of our remaining 51% interest in CVSR to NRG Yield, which, when combined with the proceeds from the CVSR nonrecourse debt financing, generated total cash proceeds to NRG of approximately $180 million.
Turning to Slide 12. I'll provide some greater detail on our revised 2016 guidance as well as initiate guidance for 2017. As I mentioned earlier, we're narrowing and increasing our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion. As noted on this slide, this revised 2016 guidance range includes the impact of $120 million of adjusted EBITDA, resulting from the monetization of hedges at GenOn, which would have otherwise been realized in future years. 
The updated 2016 business and renewables range also reflects this increase from the GenOn hedge monetization as well as the movement of CVSR EBITDA to the Yield segment following the drop-down, which closed this past quarter. Based on the strong Retail Mass performance through the first 9 months of the year, we're also increasing this component of 2016 EBITDA guidance to $7.25  to $7.75 -- excuse me, $725 million to $775 million. Finally, the increase in the NRG Yield component of guidance is primarily driven by the movement of CVSR adjusted EBITDA from generation to Yield following the drop-down as well as stronger-than-expected year-to-date performance across the wind portfolio.
We're also narrowing the consolidated free cash flow before growth guidance range to $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, which reflects the impact of the $120 million in nonrecurring debt extinguishment costs incurred in connection with our successful debt reduction and maturity-extension efforts during the year. This reduction in expected NRG level free cash flow before growth is solely due to these onetime debt extinguishment costs.
Moving to 2017, on the right side of the slide. We're initiating consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. $100 million of the GenOn hedge monetization EBITDA, which was realized in 2016, served to reduce expected 2017 EBITDA and is reflected in both our generation and renewables and consolidated EBITDA guidance range for 2017. Greater than 75% of the year-over-year drop in adjusted EBITDA in the generation and renewables segment is due to declines at the GenOn level, which includes the year-over-year impact of the hedge monetization. The remaining components of 2017 adjusted EBITDA guidance consists of $700 million to $780 million at Retail Mass and $865 million at NRG Yield, where the year-over-year difference simply reflects the impact of outperformance in 2016 wind generation versus median wind production expectations embedded in our 2017 guidance.
Moving to free cash flow guidance. The drop in GenOn in adjusted EBITDA is also reflected in the 2017 consolidated free cash flow before growth of $800 million to $1 billion, which includes approximately $300 million of negative free cash flow at GenOn. 
Finally, to arrive at 2017 NRG level of free cash flow before growth, we add back that negative free cash flow at the GenOn level and deduct free cash flow net of distributions from NRG Yield and other guarantors, which leads to an expected range of $700 million to $900 million of NRG level free cash flow in 2017.
Importantly, expected NRG level free cash flow in 2017 is in line with 2016, net of those one-time debt extinguishment costs, primarily due to the significant year-over-year decline in NRG Level capital expenditures as well as the full year impact of interest savings from our corporate level debt reduction program.
Turning to Slide 13 for an update on 2016 NRG level capital allocation, I've highlighted in blue the changes since our prior quarter update, which include the impact of the $120 million in debt extinguishment cost I mentioned previously as well as the increasing growth investments of approximately $190 million, which reflects the SunEdison transaction.
These 2 items serve to temporarily reduce the excess capital balance reserved for the 2018 NRG senior notes, which now stands at $120 million. The balance of our 2018 senior notes has been reduced by $200 million following the quarter end as we completed our 2016 debt reduction program and the remaining balance of these notes now stands at only $400 million.
During 2017, we plan to replenish the 2018 debt reserve to $400 million to ultimately retire the remaining balance using 2017 excess capital generated through NRG level free cash flow and the continuing monetization of our NRG Yield eligible assets, which now include the operating portion of the SunEdison portfolio. When combined with over $1 billion in debt reduction already achieved over the past year, this leads to over $1.4 billion in debt reduction through 2017.
Finally, Slide 14 provides an update on expected corporate 2016 balance sheet metrics as well as the first look at 2017. 
Starting with 2016, having repurchased a portion of our 2018 and 2021 notes following the third quarter end, we've completed our 2016 deleveraging objectives driving corporate debt to $7.8 billion, the exact target core balance first established as part of our 2016 capital allocation plan, which was announced during our February earnings presentation. Based on midpoint 2016 guidance, this gives an applied corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio of just under 4x.
Turning to 2017 metrics on the far right of the slide, we intend to further reduce corporate level debt by an additional $400 million, as I mentioned, by retiring the remaining balance of those 2018 senior notes, which bring corporate level debt to $7.4 billion, which when combined with the 2017 corporate EBITDA based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance, places us just under our target ratio of 4 a quarter [ph] as we continue to ensure we receive our balance sheet target through the low commodity price cycle. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for closing remarks"

As I look at this scorecard, I want to commend the entire team for their efforts in strengthening our business. 
On our next call, I will outline my 2017 objectives. But for now, I would like to quickly touch upon a very important priority, GenOn. Both NRG and GenOn continue to be focused on a comprehensive strategy of maximizing value for all stakeholders. As we are at the initial stages of evaluating available options, it's too early to provide any more specificity, but please know that we will update the market as appropriate.

Obviously, we've weighed in or added the capital allocated in 2016 relative to the SunEdison acquisition that we announced. And it is true of SunEd and not only of SunEd, but a lot of the other projects that we look and evaluate in the pipeline. Certainly, the long-term contracted nature of those projects lends itself to significant levels of debt capacity. In some cases, the existing project level debt, like with the case in fact with CVSR, which is what helped facilitate the capital return to sort of a two-pronged effect, that was optimizing the leverage on the one hand, increasing that, which gave proceeds back to NRG and dropping that asset down the Yield, we're basically able to mirror that same approach by taking advantage of the significant debt capacity first, which totally reduces the amount of equity capital and that's really what we referred to with our capital allocated to renewables because Mauricio said, because that's relatively low capital intensity given the highest degree of leverage capacity, combined with the fact that we can have a line of sight of a healthy and robust CAFD yield, it gives us good line of said that we can continue our relationship with NRG Yield, be compensated for taking out the development and construction risk and still provide Yield an opportunity for an acquisition, providing us that premium income to compensate us for the risk and still delivering an accretion to Yield. So that's really overall, how we think about the ongoing model. Not only it is a high velocity return, it is relatively low capital intensity because NRG's capital allocation is simply to the equity side of that equation."

I'll offer Elizabeth opportunity explain all my response on retail. What I tell you, with respect to 2017, [indiscernible] details Mauricio said, when we expand on our capital allocation plans, but the overall amount of capital there that's represented in that percentage on the slide relative to renewables is relatively small. And by that, I mean probably 10% to 20% of that at most right now is renewable investments. The balance of that is your -- majority of our ongoing efforts, in particular some of the repowerings for the conventional projects, which are also Yield eligible. So the capital there is about 20% at most is currently the renewable committed capital within that. And again, that's a byproduct of what I talked about before. It lends itself to a high degree of leverage, which means that the capital required for NRG is relatively small on a per megawatt basis. As far as retail is concerned, touching on some of the point that Elizabeth made a few minutes ago, our diverse product backlog or offering, I should say, combined with the diversity of different channels through which we market, give us a high degree of visibility and resilience to be in that customer base. Combined with the fact that obviously, on the wind side, as we've said, we'll continuing to see especially most acutely in 2017 in that low commodity price cycle, that's obviously beneficial on the retail side as manifested this year and we certainly see that given the outlook for commodity prices going into '17. But Elizabeth, anything you can add there?"

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Business; and Craig Cornelius, Head of our Renewables Business.
I want to start by highlighting the key messages for today's call on Slide 3. First, we're narrowing and increasing our 2016 EBITDA guidance by $200 million at the midpoint. Our exceptional performance by everyone in the company once again highlights the value of our integrated platform and its continued ability to perform under a variety of market conditions. 
Second, after reintegrating the renewables business into NRG earlier this year, we're now fully leveraging our proven operational platform. As you will hear later in the presentation, we have a robust and growing renewables business that not only enables us to acquire and operate assets in one of the fastest-growing parts of the energy industry but also helps to strengthen our partnership with NRG Yield. This business is executing on market opportunities and, with the SunEdison transaction, is only getting stronger.
Last, I am extremely pleased with our progress in strengthening the balance sheet. As of today, we have reduced our corporate debt obligation by $1 billion, bought back $345 million in convertible preferred shares and extended over $6 billion in near-term maturities well beyond 2020. These are impressive numbers given we started off our efforts only 1 year ago, and this has been one of my primary objectives since becoming CEO. I wanted to thank everyone in the organization who worked hard to achieve our targets in such a short time frame.
Now moving on to the third quarter results on Slide 4. Today, we're reporting third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.173 billion, a testament to the continued operational and financial strength of our business. Once again, despite the sustained low commodity price environment, our platform delivered. 
I want to highlight the outstanding results of our retail business for the quarter, which increased by 18% year-over-year, recording one of its strongest performances ever. Elizabeth and her team continue to operate a best-in-class retail business and, together with our commercial team, have proven extremely effective in supply and risk management and in strengthening customer relationships. Well done to the entire retail and commercial teams on your continued success. I also want to recognize everyone in the organization for improving our safety record over the quarter and returning us to a top-decile performer.
Our generation business performed well during some very challenging market conditions. Not only did we protect the value of our fleet during very low summer prices, but we also executed our asset optimization projects on time and on budget, including 3 coal-to-gas conversions this year. We remain focused on strengthening our yield growth during the quarter by expanding the potential pipeline of projects. 
In addition to the SunEdison transaction, we also completed the drop-down of CVSR, and today, we are announcing an agreement to build 73 megawatts thermal equivalent at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center on behalf of NRG Yield. Last, we have been making good progress in streamlining our cost structure and remain on track to achieve $400 million in savings by the end of 2017 under our FORNRG program.
Underpinned by our hedge profile and integrated model, we're initiating 2017 financial guidance of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. Later in the presentation, Kirk will provide additional details. But for now, I want to highlight our consolidated free cash flow range of $800 million to $1 billion.  As we have done in the past, we manage our business for cash, and this guidance speaks to the stability and strength of our free cash flow-generating ability, which, at current prices, implies a 30% free cash flow yield.
Let me turn now to our market slide on Slide 5. This summer proved to be a disappointing one from a pricing standpoint, particularly in the East, where temperatures were almost 30% above the 10-year average but prices were flat compared to the forward market. This was due to a lack of load growth and much lower gas basis. 
In Texas, we experienced mild weather, but even under these conditions, ERCOT still managed to post a record peak load of 71 gigawatts, a roughly 2% increase from the previous peak 1 year ago. We have consistently said that this is the only market where we are seeing load growth, and this summer is evidence of that. Unfortunately, prices came in much lower than expected, in large part due to the over performance of wind, which was about twice the expected production during peak hours, eliminating the potential for scarcity pricing. As you can see on the right side of the slide, disappointing summer prices and the recent selloff in gas have been putting some pressure on the forward market.
Longer term and turning to Slide 6, we remain bullish in our outlook for ERCOT, particularly at these price levels, where we see a clear opportunity for a market correction in the near future. As I just noted, ERCOT is experiencing real demand growth, about 1.4% year-to-date, which is the strongest in the country. But despite the new peak load this summer, we did not see scarcity pricing, and we actually have not seen it for a number of years. 
I want to reiterate that the ORDC is not providing the right scarcity price signals to existing or new generation. As an energy-only market, correct price signals are imperative for its proper functioning. We are hopeful that with the resolution of EFH restructuring, the PUCT will turn its attention to ORDC reform, and we look forward to working with both the PUCT and ERCOT to improve the market.
We're also starting to see units retire, given persistent low power prices. These retirements will only be accentuated by additional environmental compliance requirements. We believe there are at least 4 to 8 more gigawatts currently at risk, none of which are NRG units. A combination of strong load growth, units at risk, higher environmental cost, potential delays in new builds and market structure reforms drives our constructive view in ERCOT.
Turning to the East. Energy margins in PJM remain under pressure given the new capacity performance requirements, but, in essence, we view the probability of scarcity pricing. This, combined with no load growth and the significant amount of new gas builds coming online in the next few years, results in a less-than-favorable outlook for energy margins.
Capacity, on the other hand, is a different story. The next PJM auction will be the first with 100% capacity performance requirement. These CP-only market construct will impose significant risk on the 17 gigawatts of generation that clear at base capacity in the last auction as well as the 10 gigawatts of demand response and energy efficiencies that also cleared as base capacity. Let me be clear. That's 27 gigawatts of capacity that has a decision to make on how and what to bid into the CP auction in May.
One last thought on the markets. Now it is important to reiterate that we will take firm action against any out-of-market efforts that undermine the integrity of competitive markets, like the ones we have seen in New York, Ohio and Illinois. As proponents of competitive markets, you can expect us to be vocal advocates of our position.
Let me turn to our renewable business on Slide 7. In the past, I have discussed with you the importance of renewable generation in our future and the positive trends we see in that market. Higher renewable portfolio standards, increasing corporate sustainability targets and cost efficiencies are the basis for sustained growth in renewables demand.
In my first goal as CEO and consistent with this outlook, I announced the reintegration of our renewables business back into NRG, recognizing the changing landscape of the power industry and the compelling growth opportunities for NRG. Our renewables business is unique as it leverages NRG's existing operational platform and customer relationships from the traditional generation and retail businesses. We also have the ability to augment our renewables business by acquiring or developing renewable assets that can be dropped down to NRG Yield. This puts NRG in an excellent competitive position to execute and play in this space in a meaningful way.
Today, we operate over 4 gigawatts of wind and solar assets, making us one of the largest renewable generators in the country. We are focused on building out our pipeline and creating line of sight several years into the future. We have been hard at work developing projects, and currently, we have approximately 800 megawatts in near-term and backlog assets and an additional 2.6 gigawatts of pipeline capacity. Renewables provides not just an opportunity to execute on low-cost growth but also a way to enhance our value proposition by contributing to our stable base of earnings and providing visibility into future cash flows. This is an important business that is strong today and only getting stronger.
Turning now to our SunEdison asset transaction on Slide 8. In September, NRG selected -- was selected as the winning bidder for a 1.5-gigawatt portfolio of utility-scale wind and solar assets at an initial purchase price of $129 million, with $59 million in earn-out potential. In October, we completed the purchase of 29 megawatts of distributed generation assets for $68 million. Our scale, diverse platform and partnership with NRG Yield afforded us significant advantages during the bidding process, and these same characteristics will continue to be advantageous as a developer and operator of these assets in the future. 
On the utility-scale transaction, we were able to mitigate risk and maximize rewards by purchasing a portfolio of assets in which we could ascribe the majority of the transaction value of the operational assets and maintain the pipeline as an option at a steep distance [ph] to market prices. To be more specific, over 85% of the total purchase price is justified by the expected value of the operating assets in Utah. The balance will come from the development and optimization of the 1.2-gigawatt backlog and pipeline, representing a low-cost option for growth. With our distributed assets, NRG would expect to achieve strong returns as a result of placing these megawatts into our DG partnership with NRG Yield. 
This transaction is a significant win for NRG as we continue to build out our position as a leader in renewable generation. We executed on a unique opportunity to accelerate the growth of our renewables business while setting the foundation for strength and partnership with NRG Yield. It is our expectation that this will be temporary use of capital that can be recovered in a short period of time.
Turning to Slide 9. I'd like to discuss our current thinking on capital allocation for 2017. Although details will come out on our next call, I'd like to provide you with my current assessment of our options as I see them today, particularly on the 30% of the capital that is yet to be allocated. I want to, first, remind you of our philosophy on capital allocation. Maintaining the robustness of the balance sheet and making decisions that are cycle appropriate are what guides our approach to allocating capital. We're in a deeply cyclical sector, which means that we must plan ahead, anticipate markets and leave no doubt about our financial strength, particularly during down cycles, such as the one we're currently facing.
Last year, given the market outlook and to reduce our overall leverage, we initiated a $1.5 billion deleveraging program. Over the course of the past year, we have made significant progress toward this target, and as we are finishing these commitments, I want to ensure the market that cycle-appropriate leverage and capital discipline will continue across the organization into 2017. With respect to growth, even in the low commodity price environment, we are focused on low-cost options or areas of quick capital replenishment, such as the SunEdison transaction.
Finally, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders when we feel our capital structure is strong enough to allow for flexibility. At the beginning of the year, we revised our dividend program to be consistent with the cyclical nature of our industry, and I remain comfortable with our dividend policy. We continue to evaluate the potential for share buybacks, given our current share price and free cash flow yields. 
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review."

Turning to financial summary on Slide 11. NRG delivered $1.173 billion in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, led by strong performance by our Retail Mass business, which contributed EBITDA of $266 millio",1285,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to financial summary on Slide 11. NRG delivered $1.173 billion in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, led by strong performance by our Retail Mass business, which contributed EBITDA of $266 million. Generation and renewables combined for $605 million in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter while NRG Yield contributed $246 million. As required by GAAP, following completion of the drop-down of NRG's remaining interest in CVSR to NRG Yield, adjusted EBITDA at NRG Yield now reflects 100% of consolidated CVSR results with an equal reduction in generation and renewables results.
Through the first 9 months of the year, NRG generated almost $2.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.1 billion of free cash flow before growth. Based on performance year-to-date and our updated outlook for the balance of the year, we're increasing and narrowing our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion, which I'll review in greater detail shortly.
As of this week, we've now completed over $1 billion in corporate debt reduction over the course of the last 12 months, with $777 million completed year-to-date and $246 million retired in the fourth quarter of 2015. This significant reduction in corporate debt helps ensure we can maintain our balance sheet targets through the low commodity price cycle. In addition, when combined with the retirement of our convertible preferred and the extension of corporate debt maturities at more favorable rates, our deleveraging efforts also help generate nearly $90 million in annual interest and dividend savings, improving NRG-level free cash flow.
While the specifics of the 2017 capital allocation plan will be laid out in more detail on our year-end earnings call, we do intend to reduce corporate debt by an additional $400 million through the retirement of the remaining balance of our 2018 senior unsecured notes. This will further enhance balance sheet strength, reduce interest expense and extend our nearest unsecured maturity to 2021, the balance of which is now only $200 million. During the third quarter, NRG also completed the drop-down of our remaining 51% interest in CVSR to NRG Yield, which, when combined with the proceeds from the CVSR nonrecourse debt financing, generated total cash proceeds to NRG of approximately $180 million.
Turning to Slide 12. I'll provide some greater detail on our revised 2016 guidance as well as initiate guidance for 2017. As I mentioned earlier, we're narrowing and increasing our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion. As noted on this slide, this revised 2016 guidance range includes the impact of $120 million of adjusted EBITDA, resulting from the monetization of hedges at GenOn, which would have otherwise been realized in future years. 
The updated 2016 business and renewables range also reflects this increase from the GenOn hedge monetization as well as the movement of CVSR EBITDA to the Yield segment following the drop-down, which closed this past quarter. Based on the strong Retail Mass performance through the first 9 months of the year, we're also increasing this component of 2016 EBITDA guidance to $7.25  to $7.75 -- excuse me, $725 million to $775 million. Finally, the increase in the NRG Yield component of guidance is primarily driven by the movement of CVSR adjusted EBITDA from generation to Yield following the drop-down as well as stronger-than-expected year-to-date performance across the wind portfolio.
We're also narrowing the consolidated free cash flow before growth guidance range to $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, which reflects the impact of the $120 million in nonrecurring debt extinguishment costs incurred in connection with our successful debt reduction and maturity-extension efforts during the year. This reduction in expected NRG level free cash flow before growth is solely due to these onetime debt extinguishment costs.
Moving to 2017, on the right side of the slide. We're initiating consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. $100 million of the GenOn hedge monetization EBITDA, which was realized in 2016, served to reduce expected 2017 EBITDA and is reflected in both our generation and renewables and consolidated EBITDA guidance range for 2017. Greater than 75% of the year-over-year drop in adjusted EBITDA in the generation and renewables segment is due to declines at the GenOn level, which includes the year-over-year impact of the hedge monetization. The remaining components of 2017 adjusted EBITDA guidance consists of $700 million to $780 million at Retail Mass and $865 million at NRG Yield, where the year-over-year difference simply reflects the impact of outperformance in 2016 wind generation versus median wind production expectations embedded in our 2017 guidance.
Moving to free cash flow guidance. The drop in GenOn adjusted EBITDA is also reflected in the 2017 consolidated free cash flow before growth of $800 million to $1 billion, which includes approximately $300 million of negative free cash flow at GenOn. Finally, to arrive at 2017 NRG-level free cash flow before growth, we add back that negative free cash flow at the GenOn level and deduct free cash flow, net of distributions from NRG Yield and other guarantors, which leads to an expected range of $700 million to $900 million of NRG-level free cash flow in 2017. Importantly, expected NRG-level free cash flow in 2017 is in line with 2016, net of those onetime debt extinguishment costs, primarily due to the significant year-over-year decline in NRG-level capital expenditures as well as the full year impact of interest savings from our corporate-level debt reduction program.
Turning to Slide 13 for an update on 2016 NRG-level capital allocation. I've highlighted in blue the changes since our prior quarter update, which include the impact of the $120 million in debt extinguishment costs I mentioned previously as well as the increasing growth investments of approximately $190 million, which reflects the SunEdison transaction. These 2 items serve to temporarily reduce the excess capital balance reserved for the 2018 NRG senior notes, which now stands at $120 million. The balance of our 2018 senior notes has been reduced by $200 million following the quarter end as we completed our 2016 debt reduction program, and the remaining balance of these notes now stands at only $400 million.
During 2017, we plan to replenish the 2018 debt reserve to $400 million to ultimately retire the remaining balance using 2017 excess capital generated through NRG-level free cash flow and the continuing monetization of our NRG Yield eligible assets, which now include the operating portion of the SunEd portfolio. When combined with over $1 billion in debt reduction already achieved over the past year, this leads to over $1.4 billion in debt reduction through 2017. 
Finally, Slide 14 provides an update on expected corporate 2016 balance sheet metrics as well as the first look at 2017. Starting with 2016. Having repurchased a portion of our 2018 and 2021 notes following the third quarter end, we've completed our 2016 deleveraging objectives, driving corporate debt to $7.8 billion, the exact target corporate debt balance first established as part of our 2016 capital allocation plan, which was announced during our February earnings presentation. Based on midpoint 2016 guidance, this gives an implied corporate-debt-to-corporate-EBITDA ratio of just under 4x.
Turning to 2017 metrics on the far right of the slide. We intend to further reduce corporate-level debt by an additional $400 million, as I mentioned, by retiring the remaining balance of those 2018 senior notes, which brings corporate-level debt to $7.4 billion, which, when combined with the 2017 corporate EBITDA based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance, places us just under our target ratio of 4.25x as we continue to ensure we achieve our balance sheet target through the low commodity price cycle. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for closing remarks"

We're talking about 20,000 to 30,000 to over 100,000 customers a year organically, in addition to some of the acquisitions that we've done over the years. We also have a distinct approach in the market. We have a more diversified business than many of the competitors. We have multiple very strong brands that focus on a particular customer segment. We have a variety of products so customers can buy more than one recurring product or service from us. And we also have a strength both in Texas and the East. So overall, with that momentum and ability to focus on the customer, have strong renewals and strong acquisition performance, I feel like we're well positioned to compete in the marketplace as we have done so successfully for a number of years."

Can you talk about, at least initially, the capital allocation to the renewables business? I know you've laid out some numbers on the slides here, but can you try to tie that back in to what that means not just for '17 but onwards? And also, what is the return profile or EV-to-EBITDA development multiple, however you want to think about it, in terms of the projects that you're pursuing under this 1.2-gigawatt backlog?"

I mean, we're looking at the current operational assets, particularly the utility-scale, mid-teens CAFD yield. I mean, that's what we're targeting. Clearly, on the DG side, those returns are slightly higher, just the nature of the markets. With respect to the capital allocation, one thing that is important to recognize is that this capital allocation has a high velocity of replenishment. We -- that's why it's so important and so strategic, the partnership and strengthening NRG Yield because this -- all these assets -- all these renewable assets that are under long-term contracts are Yield eligible for drop-downs, which allows us to replenish the capital very quickly and, at the same time, achieve very attractive returns. But I mean, Kirk, is there any more specificity in terms of the 2017? I think Julien wanted to get -- I mean, Julien, if I'm not mistaken, do you wanted to get even more specificity than that?

Obviously, we've layered in or added the capital allocated in 2016 relative to the SunEd acquisition that we announced. And it is true of SunEd and not only of SunEd but a lot of the other projects that we look at and evaluate all the time in the pipeline. Certainly, the long-term contracted nature of those projects lends itself to significant levels of debt capacity. In some cases, the existing project-level debt, like with the case, in fact, with CVSR, which is what helped facilitate the capital return through sort of a 2-pronged effect, that was optimizing the leverage on the one hand, increasing that, which gave proceeds back to NRG as we dropped that asset down to Yield. We're basically able to mirror that same approach by taking advantage of the significant debt capacity first, which totally reduces the amount of equity capital, and that's really what we refer to when we talk about capital allocated to renewables. And as Mauricio said, because that's relatively low capital intensity given the high degree of leverage capacity, combined with the fact that we can have line of sight of a healthy and robust free -- or CAFD yield, it gives us good line of sight that we can continue our relationship with NRG Yield, be compensated for taking out development and construction risk and still provide Yield an opportunity for an acquisition, providing us that premium income to compensate us for the risk and still delivering accretion to Yield. So that's really, overall, how we think about the ongoing model. Not only is it a high-velocity return, it is relatively low capital intensity because NRG's capital allocation is simply to the equity side of that equation."

I may offer Elizabeth the opportunity to expand on my response on retail. What I'd tell you with respect to 2017, and we'll roll this out certainly in greater detail, as Mauricio said, when we expand on our capital allocation plans, but the overall amount of capital there that's represented in that percentage on the slide relative to renewables is relatively small. And by that I mean probably 10% to 20% of that at most, right now, is renewable investments. The balance of that is your -- majority of our ongoing efforts, in particular some of the repowerings for the conventional projects, which are also Yield eligible. So the capital there, about 20% at most is currently the renewable committed capital within that. And again, that's a byproduct of what I talked about before. It lends itself to a high degree of leverage, which means that the capital required from NRG is relatively small on a per-megawatt basis. As far as retail is concerned, touching on some of the points that Elizabeth made a few minutes ago. Our diverse product backlog -- or offering, I should say, combined with the diversity of different channels through which we market, give us a high degree of visibility and resilience in that customer base. Combined with the fact that, obviously, on the wind side, as we've said, we're continuing to see, especially most acutely in 2017, that low commodity price cycle, that's obviously beneficial on the retail side of things, as manifested this year. And we certainly see that given the outlook for commodity prices going into '17. But Elizabeth, anything you'd add there?"

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Business; and Craig Cornelius, Head of our Renewables Business.
I want to start by highlighting the key messages for today's call on Slide 3. First, we're narrowing and increasing our 2016 EBITDA guidance by $200 million at the midpoint. Our exceptional performance by everyone in the company once again highlights the value of our integrated platform and its continued ability to perform under a variety of market conditions. 
Second, after reintegrating the renewables business into NRG earlier this year, we're now fully leveraging our proven operational platform. As you will hear later in the presentation, we have a robust and growing renewables business that not only enables us to acquire and operate assets in one of the fastest-growing parts of the energy industry, but also helps to strengthen our partnership with NRG Yield. This business is executing on market opportunities and, with the SunEdison transaction, is only getting stronger.
Last, I am extremely pleased with our progress in strengthening the balance sheet. As of today, we have reduced our corporate debt obligation by $1 billion, bought back $345 million in convertible preferred shares and extended over $6 billion in near-term maturities well beyond 2020. These are impressive numbers given we started our efforts only 1 year ago, and this has been one of my primary objectives since becoming CEO. I wanted to thank everyone in the organization who worked hard to achieve our targets in such a short time frame.
Now moving on to the third quarter results on Slide 4. Today, we're reporting third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.173 billion, a testament to the continued operational and financial strength of our business. Once again, despite the sustained low commodity price environment, our platform delivered. 
I want to highlight the outstanding results of our retail business for the quarter, which increased by 18% year-over-year, recording one of its strongest performances ever. Elizabeth and her team continue to operate a best-in-class retail business and, together with our commercial team, have proven extremely effective in supply and risk management and in strengthening customer relationships. Well done to the entire retail and commercial teams on your continued success. 
I also want to recognize everyone in the organization for improving our safety record over the quarter and returning us to a top-decile performer.
Our generation business performed well during some very challenging market conditions. Not only did we protect the value of our fleet during very low summer prices, but we also executed our asset optimization projects on time and on budget, including 3 coal-to-gas conversions this year. We remain focused on strengthening our yield growth during the quarter by expanding the potential pipeline of projects. 
In addition to the SunEdison transaction, we also completed the drop-down of CVSR, and today, we are announcing an agreement to build 73 megawatts thermal equivalent at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center on behalf of NRG Yield. 
Last, we have been making good progress in streamlining our cost structure and remain on track to achieve $400 million in savings by the end of 2017 under our FORNRG program.
Underpinned by our hedge profile and integrated model, we're initiating 2017 financial guidance of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. Later in the presentation, Kirk will provide additional details. But for now, I want to highlight our consolidated free cash flow range of $800 million to $1 billion.  As we have done in the past, we manage our business for cash, and this guidance speaks to the stability and strength of our free cash flow-generating ability, which, at current prices, implies a 30% free cash flow yield.
Let me turn now to our markets slide on Slide 5. This summer proved to be a disappointing one from a pricing standpoint, particularly in the East, where temperatures were almost 30% above the 10-year average but prices were flat compared to the forward market. This was due to a lack of load growth and much lower gas basis. 
In Texas, we experienced mild weather, but even under these conditions, ERCOT still managed to post a record peak load of 71 gigawatts, a roughly 2% increase from the previous peak 1 year ago. We have consistently said that this is the only market where we are seeing load growth, and this summer is evidence of that. Unfortunately, prices came in much lower than expected, in large part due to the over-performance of wind, which was about twice the expected production during peak hours, eliminating the potential for scarcity pricing. As you can see on the right side of the slide, disappointing summer prices and the recent selloff in gas have been putting some pressure on the forward market.
Longer term and turning to Slide 6, we remain bullish in our outlook for ERCOT, particularly at these price levels, where we see a clear opportunity for a market correction in the near future. As I just noted, ERCOT is experiencing real demand growth, about 1.4% year-to-date, which is the strongest in the country. But despite the new peak load this summer, we did not see scarcity pricing, and we actually have not seen it for a number of years. 
I want to reiterate that the ORDC is not providing the right scarcity price signals to existing or new generation. As an energy-only market, correct price signals are imperative for its proper functioning. We are hopeful that with the resolution of EFH restructuring, the PUCT will turn its attention to ORDC reform, and we look forward to working with both the PUCT and ERCOT to improve the market.
We're also starting to see units retire, given persistent low power prices. These retirements will only be accentuated by additional environmental compliance requirements. We believe there are at least 4 to 8 more gigawatts currently at risk, none of which are NRG units. A combination of strong load growth, units at risk, higher environmental cost, potential delays in new builds and market structure reforms drives our constructive view in ERCOT.
Turning to the East. Energy margins in PJM remain under pressure given the new capacity performance requirements that, in essence, review the probability of scarcity pricing. This, combined with no load growth and the significant amount of new gas builds coming online in the next few years, results in a less-than-favorable outlook for energy margins.
Capacity, on the other hand, is a different story. The next PJM auction will be the first with 100% capacity performance requirement. This CP-only market construct will impose significant risk on the 17 gigawatts of generation that clear at base capacity in the last auction as well as the 10 gigawatts of demand response and energy efficiencies that also cleared as base capacity. Let me be clear. That's 27 gigawatts of capacity that has a decision to make on how and what to bid into the CP auction in May.
One last thought on the markets. Now, it is important to reiterate that we will take firm action against any out-of-market efforts that undermine the integrity of competitive markets, like the ones we have seen in New York, Ohio and Illinois. As proponents of competitive markets, you can expect us to be vocal advocates of our position.
Let me turn to our renewable business on Slide 7. In the past, I have discussed with you the importance of renewable generation in our future and the positive trends we see in that market. Higher renewable portfolio standards, increasing corporate sustainability targets and cost efficiencies are the basis for sustained growth in renewables demand.
In my first goal as CEO and consistent with this outlook, I announced the reintegration of our renewables business back into NRG, recognizing the changing landscape of the power industry and the compelling growth opportunities for NRG. Our renewables business is unique as it leverages NRG's existing operational platform and customer relationships from the traditional generation and retail businesses. We also have the ability to augment our renewables business by acquiring or developing renewable assets that can be dropped down to NRG Yield. This puts NRG in an excellent competitive position to execute and play in this space in a meaningful way.
Today, we operate over 4 gigawatts of wind and solar assets, making us one of the largest renewable generators in the country. We are focused on building out our pipeline and creating line of sight several years into the future. We have been hard at work developing projects, and currently, we have approximately 800 megawatts in near-term and backlog assets and an additional 2.6 gigawatts of pipeline capacity. 
Renewables provides not just an opportunity to execute on low-cost growth but also a way to enhance our value proposition by contributing to our stable base of earnings and providing visibility into future cash flows. This is an important business that is strong today and only getting stronger.
Turning now to our SunEdison asset transaction on Slide 8. In September, NRG selected -- was selected as the winning bidder for a 1.5-gigawatt portfolio of utility-scale wind and solar assets at an initial purchase price of $129 million, with $59 million in earn-out potential. In October, we completed the purchase of 29 megawatts of distributed generation assets for $68 million. Our scale, diverse platform and partnership with NRG Yield afforded us significant advantages during the bidding process, and these same characteristics will continue to be advantageous as a developer and operator of these assets in the future. 
For the utility-scale transaction, we were able to mitigate risk and maximize reward by purchasing a portfolio of assets in which we could ascribe the majority of the transaction value on the operational assets and maintain the pipeline as an option at a steep discount to market prices. To be more specific, over 85% of the total purchase price is justified by the expected value of the operating assets in Utah. The balance will come from the development and optimization of the 1.2-gigawatt backlog and pipeline, representing a low-cost option for growth. With our distributed assets, NRG would expect to achieve strong returns as a result of placing these megawatts into our DG partnership with NRG Yield. 
This transaction is a significant win for NRG as we continue to build out our position as a leader in renewable generation. We executed on a unique opportunity to accelerate the growth of our renewables business while setting the foundation for strength and partnership with NRG Yield. It is our expectation that this will be temporary use of capital that can be recovered in a short period of time.
Turning to Slide 9. I'd like to discuss our current thinking on capital allocation for 2017. Although details will come out on our next call, I'd like to provide you with my current assessment of our options as I see them today, particularly on the 30% of the capital that is yet to be allocated. 
I want to, first, remind you of our philosophy on capital allocation. Maintaining the robustness of the balance sheet and making decisions that are cycle-appropriate are what guides our approach to allocating capital. We're in a deeply cyclical sector, which means that we must plan ahead, anticipate markets and leave no doubt about our financial strength, particularly during down cycles, such as the one we're currently facing.
Last year, given the market outlook and to reduce our overall leverage, we initiated a $1.5 billion deleveraging program. Over the course of the past year, we have made significant progress toward this target, and as we are finishing these commitments, I want to assure the market that cycle-appropriate leverage and capital discipline will continue across the organization into 2017. 
With respect to growth, even the low commodity price environment, we are focused on low-cost options or areas of quick capital replenishment, such as the SunEdison transaction.
Finally, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders when we feel our capital structure is strong enough to allow for flexibility. At the beginning of the year, we revised our dividend program to be consistent with the cyclical nature of our industry, and I remain comfortable with our dividend policy. We continue to evaluate the potential for share buybacks, given our current share price and free cash flow yields. 
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review."

Turning to financial summary on Slide 11. NRG delivered $1.173 billion in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, led by strong performance by our Retail Mass business, which contributed EBITDA of $266 millio",1285,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to financial summary on Slide 11. NRG delivered $1.173 billion in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, led by strong performance by our Retail Mass business, which contributed EBITDA of $266 million. Generation and renewables combined for $605 million in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter while NRG Yield contributed $246 million. As required by GAAP, following completion of the drop-down of NRG's remaining interest in CVSR to NRG Yield, adjusted EBITDA at NRG Yield now reflects 100% of consolidated CVSR results with an equal reduction in generation and renewables results.
Through the first 9 months of the year, NRG generated almost $2.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.1 billion of free cash flow before growth. Based on performance year-to-date and our updated outlook for the balance of the year, we're increasing and narrowing our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion, which I'll review in greater detail shortly.
As of this week, we've now completed over $1 billion in corporate debt reduction over the course of the last 12 months, with $777 million completed year-to-date and $246 million retired in the fourth quarter of 2015. This significant reduction in corporate debt helps ensure we can maintain our balance sheet targets through the low commodity price cycle. In addition, when combined with the retirement of our convertible preferred and the extension of corporate debt maturities at more favorable rates, our deleveraging efforts also help generate nearly $90 million in annual interest and dividend savings, improving NRG-level free cash flow.
While the specifics of the 2017 capital allocation plan will be laid out in more detail on our year-end earnings call, we do intend to reduce corporate debt by an additional $400 million through the retirement of the remaining balance of our 2018 senior unsecured notes. This will further enhance balance sheet strength, reduce interest expense and extend our nearest unsecured maturity to 2021, the balance of which is now only $200 million. During the third quarter, NRG also completed the drop-down of our remaining 51% interest in CVSR to NRG Yield, which, when combined with the proceeds from the CVSR nonrecourse debt financing, generated total cash proceeds to NRG of approximately $180 million.
Turning to Slide 12. I'll provide some greater detail on our revised 2016 guidance as well as initiate guidance for 2017. As I mentioned earlier, we're narrowing and increasing our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion. As noted on this slide, this revised 2016 guidance range includes the impact of $120 million of adjusted EBITDA, resulting from the monetization of hedges at GenOn, which would have otherwise been realized in future years. 
The updated 2016 business and renewables range also reflects this increase from the GenOn hedge monetization as well as the movement of CVSR EBITDA to the Yield segment following the drop-down, which closed this past quarter. 
Based on the strong Retail Mass performance through the first 9 months of the year, we're also increasing this component of 2016 EBITDA guidance to $7.25  to $7.75 -- or, excuse me, $725 million to $775 million. Finally, the increase in the NRG Yield component of guidance is primarily driven by the movement of CVSR adjusted EBITDA from generation to Yield following the drop-down as well as stronger-than-expected year-to-date performance across the wind portfolio.
We're also narrowing the consolidated free cash flow before growth guidance range to $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, which reflects the impact of the $120 million in nonrecurring debt extinguishment costs incurred in connection with our successful debt reduction and maturity-extension efforts during the year. This reduction in expected NRG level free cash flow before growth is solely due to these onetime debt extinguishment costs.
Moving to 2017, on the right side of the slide. We're initiating consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. $100 million of the GenOn hedge monetization EBITDA, which was realized in 2016, served to reduce expected 2017 EBITDA and is reflected in both our generation and renewables and consolidated EBITDA guidance range for 2017. Greater than 75% of the year-over-year drop in adjusted EBITDA in the generation and renewables segment is due to declines at the GenOn level, which includes the year-over-year impact of the hedge monetization. 
The remaining components of 2017 adjusted EBITDA guidance consists of $700 million to $780 million at Retail Mass and $865 million at NRG Yield, where the year-over-year difference simply reflects the impact of outperformance in 2016 wind generation versus median wind production expectations embedded in our 2017 guidance.
Moving to free cash flow guidance. The drop in GenOn adjusted EBITDA is also reflected in the 2017 consolidated free cash flow before growth of $800 million to $1 billion, which includes approximately $300 million of negative free cash flow at GenOn. 
Finally, to arrive at 2017 NRG-level free cash flow before growth, we add back that negative free cash flow at the GenOn level and deduct free cash flow, net of distributions from NRG Yield and other guarantors, which leads to an expected range of $700 million to $900 million of NRG-level free cash flow in 2017. Importantly, expected NRG-level free cash flow in 2017 is in line with 2016, net of those onetime debt extinguishment costs, primarily due to the significant year-over-year decline in NRG-level capital expenditures as well as the full year impact of interest savings from our corporate-level debt reduction program.
Turning to Slide 13 for an update on 2016 NRG-level capital allocation. I've highlighted in blue the changes since our prior-quarter update, which include the impact of the $120 million in debt extinguishment costs I mentioned previously as well as the increase in growth investments of approximately $190 million, which reflects the SunEdison transaction. These 2 items serve to temporarily reduce the excess capital balance reserved for the 2018 NRG senior notes, which now stands at $120 million. The balance of our 2018 senior notes has been reduced by $200 million following the quarter end as we completed our 2016 debt-reduction program, and the remaining balance of these notes now stands at only $400 million.
During 2017, we plan to replenish the 2018 debt reserve to $400 million to ultimately retire the remaining balance using 2017 excess capital generated through NRG-level free cash flow and the continuing monetization of our NRG Yield eligible assets, which now include the operating portion of the SunEd portfolio. When combined with over $1 billion in debt reduction already achieved over the past year, this leads to over $1.4 billion in debt reduction through 2017. 
Finally, Slide 14 provides an update on expected corporate 2016 balance sheet metrics as well as a first look at 2017. Starting with 2016. Having repurchased a portion of our 2018 and 2021 notes following the third quarter end, we've completed our 2016 deleveraging objectives, driving corporate debt to $7.8 billion, the exact target corporate debt balance first established as part of our 2016 capital allocation plan, which was announced during our February earnings presentation. Based on midpoint 2016 guidance, this gives an implied corporate-debt-to-corporate-EBITDA ratio of just under 4x.
Turning to 2017 metrics on the far right of the slide. We intend to further reduce corporate-level debt by an additional $400 million, as I mentioned, by retiring the remaining balance of those 2018 senior notes, which brings corporate-level debt to $7.4 billion, which, when combined with the 2017 corporate EBITDA based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance, places us just under our target ratio of 4.25x as we continue to ensure we achieve our balance sheet target through the low commodity price cycle. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for closing remarks"

While we do see new entrants to the space, both in sources of permanent equity for assets as well as development, we think the current environment actually favors incumbent players with development and operational capabilities like our own and with a significant access to both commercial and mass retail customers as well as utility customers that we service today. So when we look at the market complexion over the next 3 to 4 years, we believe an enterprise like our own that has significant access to customers, scale and stability over almost all renewable pure-play companies, access to a competitive cost of capital through Yield, that's technology-agnostic and can take full advantage of cost declines that are being realized in wind and solar, that's advantaged by virtue of our ownership of assets and our operational capabilities and a development platform that can address the full spectrum of distributed and utility-scale opportunities exhibits advantages that smaller-scale, pure-play developers don't have and can benefit from the trends of additional capital formation that's being observed in the industry."

I mean, when you think about retail platform, number one, I would say that we have a leading platform in the best market for retail in the United States that is incredibly difficult to replicate, particularly in the residential side. Most of the move that we have seen from IPPs into the retail space has been for C&I, which is slight -- it's a very different value proposition, and it's a very different approach to that market. Having said that, I always welcome new entrants in the space because it allows us and it allows the market to provide some benchmark in terms of best practices. And I think, as you said it, we were the first mover. We have benefited significantly from it. I think the fact that other IPPs are following suit is a testament of the integrated platform that we have been able to put in place and the winning formula, I guess, to navigate through this incredible transition that we're going through in the energy markets. But, Elizabeth, is there something else that you can provide in terms of the competitive landscape as you're seeing more IPPs going into the retail business?"

I would say our retail business has extraordinarily strong momentum that's really underpinned by our scalable platform and the strength that we have in supply and risk management, and we've demonstrated year-over-year the ability to grow in both customer count and earnings. We're talking about 20,000 to 30,000 to over 100,000 customers a year organically, in addition to some of the acquisitions that we've done over the years. We also have a distinct approach in the market. We have a more diversified business than many of the competitors. We have multiple very strong brands that focus on a particular customer segment. We have a variety of products so customers can buy more than one recurring product or service from us. And we also have a strength both in Texas and the East.

Clearly, on the DG side, those returns are slightly higher, just the nature of the markets. With respect to the capital allocation, one thing that it's important to recognize is that this capital allocation has a high velocity of replenishment. We -- that's why it's so important and so strategic, the partnership and strengthening NRG Yield because this -- all these assets -- all these renewable assets that are under long-term contracts are Yield eligible for drop-downs, which allows us to replenish the capital very quickly and, at the same time, achieve very attractive returns. But I mean, Kirk, is there any more specificity in terms of the 2017? I think Julien wanted to get -- I mean, Julien, if I'm not mistaken, do you wanted to get even more specificity than that?

Obviously, we've layered in or added the capital allocated in 2016 relative to the SunEd acquisition that we announced. And this is true of SunEd and not only of SunEd but a lot of the other projects that we look at and evaluate all the time in the pipeline. Certainly, the long-term contracted nature of those projects lends itself to significant levels of debt capacity. In some cases, the existing project-level debt, like was the case, in fact, with CVSR, which is what helped facilitate the capital return through sort of a 2-pronged effect, that was optimizing the leverage on the one hand, increasing that, which gave proceeds back to NRG and ultimately dropping that asset down to Yield. We're basically able to mirror that same approach by taking advantage of the significant debt capacity first, which certainly  reduces the amount of equity capital, and that's really what we refer to when we talk about capital allocated to renewables. And as Mauricio said, because that's relatively low capital intensity given the high degree of leverage capacity, combined with the fact that we can have line of sight of a healthy and a robust free -- or CAFD yield, it gives us good line of sight that we can continue our relationship with NRG Yield, be compensated for taking out development and construction risk and still provide Yield an opportunity for an acquisition, providing us that premium income to compensate us for the risk and still delivering accretion to Yield. So that's really, overall, how we think about the ongoing model. Not only is it a high-velocity return, it is relatively low-capital intensity because NRG's capital allocated is simply to the equity side of that equation."

I may offer Elizabeth the opportunity to expand on my response on retail. What I'd tell you with respect to 2017, and we'll roll this out certainly in greater detail, as Mauricio said, when we expand on our capital allocation plans, but the overall amount of capital there that's represented in that percentage on the slide relative to renewables is relatively small. And by that I mean probably 10% to 20% of that at most, right now, is renewable investments. The balance of that is your -- majority of our ongoing efforts, in particular some of the repowerings for the conventional projects, which are also Yield eligible. So the capital there, about 20% at most is currently the renewable committed capital within that. And again, that's a byproduct of what I talked about before. It lends itself to a high degree of leverage, which means that the capital required from NRG is relatively small on a per-megawatt basis. As far as retail is concerned, touching on some of the points that Elizabeth made a few minutes ago, our diverse product backlog -- or offering, I should say, combined with the diversity of different channels through which we market, give us a high degree of visibility and the resilience to be in that customer base. Combined with the fact that, obviously, on the one side, as we've said, we're continuing to see, especially most acutely in 2017, in that low commodity price cycle, that's obviously beneficial on the retail side of things, as manifested this year. And we certainly see that given the outlook for commodity prices going into '17. But Elizabeth, anything you'd add there?"

And based on its progress in terms of permitting and interconnection and power marketing opportunities and how that pipeline compares to other potential uses of development and equity capital, we would look to advance those projects. But it's reasonable to think of those projects as 2019 or 2020 type COD assets."

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Business; and Craig Cornelius, Head of our Renewables Business.
I want to start by highlighting the key messages for today's call on Slide 3. First, we're narrowing and increasing our 2016 EBITDA guidance by $200 million at the midpoint. Our exceptional performance by everyone in the company once again highlights the value of our integrated platform and its continued ability to perform under a variety of market conditions. 
Second, after reintegrating the renewables business into NRG earlier this year, we're now fully leveraging our proven operational platform. As you will hear later in the presentation, we have a robust and growing renewables business that not only enables us to acquire and operate assets in one of the fastest-growing parts of the energy industry, but also helps to strengthen our partnership with NRG Yield. This business is executing on market opportunities and, with the SunEdison transaction, is only getting stronger.
Last, I am extremely pleased with our progress in strengthening the balance sheet. As of today, we have reduced our corporate debt obligation by $1 billion, bought back $345 million in convertible preferred shares and extended over $6 billion in near-term maturities well beyond 2020. These are impressive numbers given we started our efforts only 1 year ago, and this has been one of my primary objectives since becoming CEO. I wanted to thank everyone in the organization who worked hard to achieve our targets in such a short time frame.
Now moving on to the third quarter results on Slide 4. Today, we're reporting third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.173 billion, a testament to the continued operational and financial strength of our business. Once again, despite the sustained low commodity price environment, our platform delivered. 
I want to highlight the outstanding results of our retail business for the quarter, which increased by 18% year-over-year, recording one of its strongest performances ever. Elizabeth and her team continue to operate a best-in-class retail business and, together with our commercial team, have proven extremely effective in supply and risk management and in strengthening customer relationships. Well done to the entire retail and commercial teams on your continued success. 
I also want to recognize everyone in the organization for improving our safety record over the quarter and returning us to a top-decile performer.
Our generation business performed well during some very challenging market conditions. Not only did we protect the value of our fleet during very low summer prices, but we also executed our asset optimization projects on time and on budget, including 3 coal-to-gas conversions this year. We remain focused on strengthening our yield growth during the quarter by expanding the potential pipeline of projects. 
In addition to the SunEdison transaction, we also completed the drop-down of CVSR, and today, we are announcing an agreement to build 73 megawatts thermal equivalent at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center on behalf of NRG Yield. 
Last, we have been making good progress in streamlining our cost structure and remain on track to achieve $400 million in savings by the end of 2017 under our FORNRG program.
Underpinned by our hedge profile and integrated model, we're initiating 2017 financial guidance of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. Later in the presentation, Kirk will provide additional details. But for now, I want to highlight our consolidated free cash flow range of $800 million to $1 billion.  As we have done in the past, we manage our business for cash, and this guidance speaks to the stability and strength of our free cash flow-generating ability, which, at current prices, implies a 30% free cash flow yield.
Let me turn now to our markets slide on Slide 5. This summer proved to be a disappointing one from a pricing standpoint, particularly in the East, where temperatures were almost 30% above the 10-year average but prices were flat compared to the forward market. This was due to a lack of load growth and much lower gas basis. 
In Texas, we experienced mild weather, but even under these conditions, ERCOT still managed to post a record peak load of 71 gigawatts, a roughly 2% increase from the previous peak 1 year ago. We have consistently said that this is the only market where we are seeing load growth, and this summer is evidence of that. Unfortunately, prices came in much lower than expected, in large part due to the over-performance of wind, which was about twice the expected production during peak hours, eliminating the potential for scarcity pricing. As you can see on the right side of the slide, disappointing summer prices and the recent selloff in gas have been putting some pressure on the forward market.
Longer term and turning to Slide 6, we remain bullish in our outlook for ERCOT, particularly at these price levels, where we see a clear opportunity for a market correction in the near future. As I just noted, ERCOT is experiencing real demand growth, about 1.4% year-to-date, which is the strongest in the country. But despite the new peak load this summer, we did not see scarcity pricing, and we actually have not seen it for a number of years. 
I want to reiterate that the ORDC is not providing the right scarcity price signals to existing or new generation. As an energy-only market, correct price signals are imperative for its proper functioning. We are hopeful that with the resolution of EFH restructuring, the PUCT will turn its attention to ORDC reform, and we look forward to working with both the PUCT and ERCOT to improve the market.
We're also starting to see units retire, given persistent low power prices. These retirements will only be accentuated by additional environmental compliance requirements. We believe there are at least 4 to 8 more gigawatts currently at risk, none of which are NRG units. A combination of strong load growth, units at risk, higher environmental cost, potential delays in new builds and market structure reforms drives our constructive view in ERCOT.
Turning to the East. Energy margins in PJM remain under pressure given the new capacity performance requirements that, in essence, review the probability of scarcity pricing. This, combined with no load growth and the significant amount of new gas builds coming online in the next few years, results in a less-than-favorable outlook for energy margins.
Capacity, on the other hand, is a different story. The next PJM auction will be the first with 100% capacity performance requirement. This CP-only market construct will impose significant risk on the 17 gigawatts of generation that clear at base capacity in the last auction as well as the 10 gigawatts of demand response and energy efficiencies that also cleared as base capacity. Let me be clear. That's 27 gigawatts of capacity that has a decision to make on how and what to bid into the CP auction in May.
One last thought on the markets. Now, it is important to reiterate that we will take firm action against any out-of-market efforts that undermine the integrity of competitive markets, like the ones we have seen in New York, Ohio and Illinois. As proponents of competitive markets, you can expect us to be vocal advocates of our position.
Let me turn to our renewable business on Slide 7. In the past, I have discussed with you the importance of renewable generation in our future and the positive trends we see in that market. Higher renewable portfolio standards, increasing corporate sustainability targets and cost efficiencies are the basis for sustained growth in renewables demand.
In my first goal as CEO and consistent with this outlook, I announced the reintegration of our renewables business back into NRG, recognizing the changing landscape of the power industry and the compelling growth opportunities for NRG. Our renewables business is unique as it leverages NRG's existing operational platform and customer relationships from the traditional generation and retail businesses. We also have the ability to augment our renewables business by acquiring or developing renewable assets that can be dropped down to NRG Yield. This puts NRG in an excellent competitive position to execute and play in this space in a meaningful way.
Today, we operate over 4 gigawatts of wind and solar assets, making us one of the largest renewable generators in the country. We are focused on building out our pipeline and creating line of sight several years into the future. We have been hard at work developing projects, and currently, we have approximately 800 megawatts in near-term and backlog assets and an additional 2.6 gigawatts of pipeline capacity. 
Renewables provides not just an opportunity to execute on low-cost growth but also a way to enhance our value proposition by contributing to our stable base of earnings and providing visibility into future cash flows. This is an important business that is strong today and only getting stronger.
Turning now to our SunEdison asset transaction on Slide 8. In September, NRG selected -- was selected as the winning bidder for a 1.5-gigawatt portfolio of utility-scale wind and solar assets at an initial purchase price of $129 million, with $59 million in earn-out potential. In October, we completed the purchase of 29 megawatts of distributed generation assets for $68 million. Our scale, diverse platform and partnership with NRG Yield afforded us significant advantages during the bidding process, and these same characteristics will continue to be advantageous as a developer and operator of these assets in the future. 
For the utility-scale transaction, we were able to mitigate risk and maximize reward by purchasing a portfolio of assets in which we could ascribe the majority of the transaction value on the operational assets and maintain the pipeline as an option at a steep discount to market prices. To be more specific, over 85% of the total purchase price is justified by the expected value of the operating assets in Utah. The balance will come from the development and optimization of the 1.2-gigawatt backlog and pipeline, representing a low-cost option for growth. With our distributed assets, NRG would expect to achieve strong returns as a result of placing these megawatts into our DG partnership with NRG Yield. 
This transaction is a significant win for NRG as we continue to build out our position as a leader in renewable generation. We executed on a unique opportunity to accelerate the growth of our renewables business while setting the foundation for strength and partnership with NRG Yield. It is our expectation that this will be temporary use of capital that can be recovered in a short period of time.
Turning to Slide 9. I'd like to discuss our current thinking on capital allocation for 2017. Although details will come out on our next call, I'd like to provide you with my current assessment of our options as I see them today, particularly on the 30% of the capital that is yet to be allocated. 
I want to, first, remind you of our philosophy on capital allocation. Maintaining the robustness of the balance sheet and making decisions that are cycle-appropriate are what guides our approach to allocating capital. We're in a deeply cyclical sector, which means that we must plan ahead, anticipate markets and leave no doubt about our financial strength, particularly during down cycles, such as the one we're currently facing.
Last year, given the market outlook and to reduce our overall leverage, we initiated a $1.5 billion deleveraging program. Over the course of the past year, we have made significant progress toward this target, and as we are finishing these commitments, I want to assure the market that cycle-appropriate leverage and capital discipline will continue across the organization into 2017. 
With respect to growth, even the low commodity price environment, we are focused on low-cost options or areas of quick capital replenishment, such as the SunEdison transaction.
Finally, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders when we feel our capital structure is strong enough to allow for flexibility. At the beginning of the year, we revised our dividend program to be consistent with the cyclical nature of our industry, and I remain comfortable with our dividend policy. We continue to evaluate the potential for share buybacks, given our current share price and free cash flow yields. 
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review."

Turning to financial summary on Slide 11. NRG delivered $1.173 billion in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, led by strong performance by our Retail Mass business, which contributed EBITDA of $266 millio",1286,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to financial summary on Slide 11. NRG delivered $1.173 billion in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, led by strong performance by our Retail Mass business, which contributed EBITDA of $266 million. Generation and renewables combined for $605 million in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter while NRG Yield contributed $246 million. As required by GAAP, following completion of the drop-down of NRG's remaining interest in CVSR to NRG Yield, adjusted EBITDA at NRG Yield now reflects 100% of consolidated CVSR results with an equal reduction in generation and renewables results.
Through the first 9 months of the year, NRG generated almost $2.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.1 billion of free cash flow before growth. Based on performance year-to-date and our updated outlook for the balance of the year, we're increasing and narrowing our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion, which I'll review in greater detail shortly.
As of this week, we've now completed over $1 billion in corporate debt reduction over the course of the last 12 months, with $777 million completed year-to-date and $246 million retired in the fourth quarter of 2015. This significant reduction in corporate debt helps ensure we can maintain our balance sheet targets through the low commodity price cycle. In addition, when combined with the retirement of our convertible preferred and the extension of corporate debt maturities at more favorable rates, our deleveraging efforts also help generate nearly $90 million in annual interest and dividend savings, improving NRG-level free cash flow.
While the specifics of the 2017 capital allocation plan will be laid out in more detail on our year-end earnings call, we do intend to reduce corporate debt by an additional $400 million through the retirement of the remaining balance of our 2018 senior unsecured notes. This will further enhance balance sheet strength, reduce interest expense and extend our nearest unsecured maturity to 2021, the balance of which is now only $200 million. During the third quarter, NRG also completed the drop-down of our remaining 51% interest in CVSR to NRG Yield, which, when combined with the proceeds from the CVSR nonrecourse debt financing, generated total cash proceeds to NRG of approximately $180 million.
Turning to Slide 12. I'll provide some greater detail on our revised 2016 guidance as well as initiate guidance for 2017. As I mentioned earlier, we're narrowing and increasing our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion. As noted on this slide, this revised 2016 guidance range includes the impact of $120 million of adjusted EBITDA, resulting from the monetization of hedges at GenOn, which would have otherwise been realized in future years. 
The updated 2016 business and renewables range also reflects this increase from the GenOn hedge monetization as well as the movement of CVSR EBITDA to the Yield segment following the drop-down, which closed this past quarter. 
Based on the strong Retail Mass performance through the first 9 months of the year, we're also increasing this component of 2016 EBITDA guidance to $7.25  to $7.75 -- or, excuse me, $725 million to $775 million. Finally, the increase in the NRG Yield component of guidance is primarily driven by the movement of CVSR adjusted EBITDA from generation to Yield following the drop-down as well as stronger-than-expected year-to-date performance across the wind portfolio.
We're also narrowing the consolidated free cash flow before growth guidance range to $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, which reflects the impact of the $120 million in nonrecurring debt extinguishment costs incurred in connection with our successful debt reduction and maturity-extension efforts during the year. This reduction in expected NRG level free cash flow before growth is solely due to these onetime debt extinguishment costs.
Moving to 2017, on the right side of the slide. We're initiating consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. $100 million of the GenOn hedge monetization EBITDA, which was realized in 2016, served to reduce expected 2017 EBITDA and is reflected in both our generation and renewables and consolidated EBITDA guidance range for 2017. Greater than 75% of the year-over-year drop in adjusted EBITDA in the generation and renewables segment is due to declines at the GenOn level, which includes the year-over-year impact of the hedge monetization. 
The remaining components of 2017 adjusted EBITDA guidance consists of $700 million to $780 million at Retail Mass and $865 million at NRG Yield, where the year-over-year difference simply reflects the impact of outperformance in 2016 wind generation versus median wind production expectations embedded in our 2017 guidance.
Moving to free cash flow guidance. The drop in GenOn adjusted EBITDA is also reflected in the 2017 consolidated free cash flow before growth of $800 million to $1 billion, which includes approximately $300 million of negative free cash flow at GenOn. 
Finally, to arrive at 2017 NRG-level free cash flow before growth, we add back that negative free cash flow at the GenOn level and deduct free cash flow, net of distributions from NRG Yield and other guarantors, which leads to an expected range of $700 million to $900 million of NRG-level free cash flow in 2017. Importantly, expected NRG-level free cash flow in 2017 is in line with 2016, net of those onetime debt extinguishment costs, primarily due to the significant year-over-year decline in NRG-level capital expenditures as well as the full year impact of interest savings from our corporate-level debt reduction program.
Turning to Slide 13 for an update on 2016 NRG-level capital allocation. I've highlighted in blue the changes since our prior quarter update, which include the impact of the $120 million in debt extinguishment costs I mentioned previously as well as the increase in growth investments of approximately $190 million, which reflects the SunEdison transaction. These 2 items serve to temporarily reduce the excess capital balance reserved for the 2018 NRG senior notes, which now stands at $120 million. The balance of our 2018 senior notes has been reduced by $200 million following the quarter end as we completed our 2016 debt-reduction program, and the remaining balance of these notes now stands at only $400 million.
During 2017, we plan to replenish the 2018 debt reserve to $400 million to ultimately retire the remaining balance using 2017 excess capital generated through NRG-level free cash flow and the continuing monetization of our NRG Yield eligible assets, which now include the operating portion of the SunEd portfolio. When combined with over $1 billion in debt reduction already achieved over the past year, this leads to over $1.4 billion in debt reduction through 2017. 
Finally, Slide 14 provides an update on expected corporate 2016 balance sheet metrics as well as a first look at 2017. Starting with 2016. Having repurchased a portion of our 2018 and 2021 notes following the third quarter end, we've completed our 2016 deleveraging objectives, driving corporate debt to $7.8 billion, the exact target corporate debt balance first established as part of our 2016 capital allocation plan, which was announced during our February earnings presentation. Based on midpoint 2016 guidance, this gives an implied corporate-debt-to-corporate-EBITDA ratio of just under 4x.
Turning to 2017 metrics on the far right of the slide. We intend to further reduce corporate-level debt by an additional $400 million, as I mentioned, by retiring the remaining balance of those 2018 senior notes, which brings corporate-level debt to $7.4 billion, which, when combined with the 2017 corporate EBITDA based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance, places us just under our target ratio of 4.25x as we continue to ensure we achieve our balance sheet target through the low commodity price cycle. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for closing remarks"

We also have a distinct approach in the market. We have a more diversified business than many of the competitors. We have multiple very strong brands that focus on a particular customer segment. We have a variety of products so customers can buy more than one recurring product or service from us. And we also have a strength both in Texas and the East.

With respect to the capital allocation, one thing that it's important to recognize is that this capital allocation has a high velocity of replenishment. We -- that's why it's so important and so strategic, the partnership and strengthening NRG Yield because this -- all these assets -- all these renewable assets that are under long-term contracts are Yield eligible for drop-downs, which allows us to replenish the capital very quickly and, at the same time, achieve very attractive returns.

Obviously, we've layered in or added the capital allocated in 2016 relative to the SunEd acquisition that we announced. And this is true of SunEd and not only of SunEd but a lot of the other projects that we look at and evaluate all the time in the pipeline. Certainly, the long-term contracted nature of those projects lends itself to significant levels of debt capacity. In some cases, the existing project-level debt, like was the case, in fact, with CVSR, which is what helped facilitate the capital return through sort of a 2-pronged effect, that was optimizing the leverage on the one hand, increasing that, which gave proceeds back to NRG and ultimately dropping that asset down to Yield. We're basically able to mirror that same approach by taking advantage of the significant debt capacity first, which certainly  reduces the amount of equity capital, and that's really what we refer to when we talk about capital allocated to renewables. And as Mauricio said, because that's relatively low capital intensity given the high degree of leverage capacity, combined with the fact that we can have line of sight of a healthy and a robust free -- or CAFD yield, it gives us good line of sight that we can continue our relationship with NRG Yield, be compensated for taking out development and construction risk and still provide Yield an opportunity for an acquisition, providing us that premium income to compensate us for the risk and still delivering accretion to Yield. So that's really, overall, how we think about the ongoing model. Not only is it a high-velocity return, it is relatively low-capital intensity because NRG's capital allocated is simply to the equity side of that equation."

I may offer Elizabeth the opportunity to expand on my response on retail. What I'd tell you with respect to 2017, and we'll roll this out certainly in greater detail, as Mauricio said, when we expand on our capital allocation plans, but the overall amount of capital there that's represented in that percentage on the slide relative to renewables is relatively small. And by that I mean probably 10% to 20% of that at most, right now, is renewable investments. The balance of that is your -- majority of our ongoing efforts, in particular some of the repowerings for the conventional projects, which are also Yield eligible. So the capital there, about 20% at most is currently the renewable committed capital within that. And again, that's a byproduct of what I talked about before. It lends itself to a high degree of leverage, which means that the capital required from NRG is relatively small on a per-megawatt basis. As far as retail is concerned, touching on some of the points that Elizabeth made a few minutes ago, our diverse product backlog -- or offering, I should say, combined with the diversity of different channels through which we market, give us a high degree of visibility and the resilience to be in that customer base. Combined with the fact that, obviously, on the one side, as we've said, we're continuing to see, especially most acutely in 2017, in that low commodity price cycle, that's obviously beneficial on the retail side of things, as manifested this year. And we certainly see that given the outlook for commodity prices going into '17. But Elizabeth, anything you'd add there?"

We came into 2016 with a significant surplus of coal inventory, gave us the opportunity to rightsize that coal inventory remember, as we burned what was on the pile a little bit more disproportionately than in years past because of that high level of inventory. And as we move into 2017, that's just a little bit of the natural rebuilding or recalibrating towards that. I would say -- and I can't give you the number off the top of my head, but I think that's probably a little bit of a high watermark. I wouldn't say we've returned to just double-digit working -- uses of working capital, but certainly, that over $200 million is a little bit of a high watermark in terms of the outlook, right. We're just -- we're recalibrating the inventories there. And some of that coal burned that took place, was we had at least 1 plant or a couple of plants in the portfolio where we were in the process of transitioning from gas to -- or from coal to gas, I should say, and burning through that. So a lot of that is why that is exacerbated in sort of the year-over-year change in working capital."

What I'm saying is, in 2016, a lot of the positive benefits from working capital is just that we literally took the coal power down at those plants, were converting to gas, basically down to 0 during that period of time.

That project has a completion date that would be targeted in the first half of 2018. The balance of the pipeline is to be contracted. 111 megawatts worth of that pipeline is largely construction-ready and actually was previously contracted. We're in discussions around a targeted time line for that mix, and the balance of the pipeline is at various stages of development. And based on its progress in terms of permitting and interconnection and power marketing opportunities and how that pipeline compares to other potential uses of development and equity capital, we would look to advance those projects. But it's reasonable to think of those projects as 2019 or 2020 type COD assets."
