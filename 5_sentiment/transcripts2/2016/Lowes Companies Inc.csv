We delivered another solid quarter with comparable sales growth of 5.2%, which exceeded our expectations.

We delivered another solid quarter with comparable sales growth of 5.2%, which exceeded our expectations. Our efforts to drive traffic, which Mike will share in more detail, have resonated with customers, resulting in a 3.6% increase in comp transactions, along with a 1.6% increase in average ticket. Our U.S. Home Improvement business achieved 5.5% comps for the quarter with all 14 regions generating positive comps and our strong performance in Canada continues with double-digit comps in local currency for the third year in a row. 
During the quarter, we generated positive comps in all 13 product categories. We capitalized on increased demand for exterior products as a result of normal weather, with strength in lumber and building materials, outdoor power equipment, lawn and garden and millwork, about the same time driving strong mid-single-digit comps in interior project categories such as paint and fashion fixtures. And as a result of our strong brand and service advantages, we continue to drive strong comps in appliances. Lastly, our Pro business performed above the company average as we continue to build deeper relationships with the Pro by enhancing our product and service offering to meet their unique needs. 
For the quarter, we drove 79 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.59, a 28% increase over last year's fourth quarter. For the year, we delivered comparable sales growth of 4.8% and adjusted earnings per share of $3.29, a 21% increase over 2014. Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $562 million of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $257 million in dividends. For the year, we repurchased $3.8 billion of stock and paid $957 million in dividends. 
As we head into 2016, the outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive. Continued support from steady job gains and improved incomes, as well as favorable trends in housing, should keep home improvement growth buoyant. Further, despite recent volatility in the financial markets, the fundamentals for continued growth in consumer spending remain intact. Consumers should continue to benefit from improved household financial conditions and lower gas prices on top of broader job and income gains. These trends aligned with results for our most recent consumer sentiment survey, where favorable perceptions around personal finances remains stable, even though respondents' assessment of the national economy declined slightly. For the home improvement industry specifically, we continue to see favorable trends as the desire to invest in the home continues to grow. Roughly half of homeowners believe the value of their home has increased, which has doubled the number feeling that way in 2009 and many believe this trend will continue as we saw a significant increase in future home value expectations. And while most homeowners indicated their spending levels are staying the same, they are more likely to allocate funds to home improvement compared to other areas. In 2016, we will continue to leverage the favorable backdrop for home improvement, delivering great service to customers while also anticipating how Lowe's will meet their needs in the future. 
We take a prudent approach to managing our portfolio of businesses, making decisions that shape how we serve and connect with customers. Giving careful consideration to how we position Lowe's favorably for sustainable growth, we invest to obtain compelling returns over the long run. As we carry out our capital allocation priorities, which remain unchanged from what we share previously, our first priority is to invest in the business. We then state to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We demonstrated our disciplined approach to capital allocation with the recent changes in our international business. First, after a comprehensive strategic analysis, we decided to exit the Australian home improvement market by withdrawing from our joint venture with Woolworths. We made the decision to focus our resources on areas of the business where we see greater potential return of investment. Second, seeking to reinforce our portfolio of businesses in North America, we committed to accelerating our growth in Canada by announcing our agreement to acquire RONA. The time is try to strengthen the company's Canadian operations to take advantage of the significant long-term potential we see. We expect to build on the build on the recent progress our team in Canada has made and the positive results RONA has achieved over the past several years as a result of the restructuring efforts. With this transaction, we see opportunities to further increase revenue and operating profitability in Canada, including enhancing customer relevance by utilizing our strengths as a leading omni-channel home improvement company and drawing on our customer experience design capabilities; expanding customer reach and serving a new portion of the market by applying our expertise in certain product categories, including our best-in-class appliance offering; driving increased profitability in Canada by leveraging share supplier relationships and enhanced scale, as well as Lowe's private-label capabilities in addition to eliminating RONA's private company cost. At the same time, we're reinforcing our international businesses, our U.S. home improvement business with a dedicated focus from Mike and Rick's team is diligently working to drive profitable share gains within the U.S. market. In 2016, their efforts will continue to focus on improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer and differentiating ourselves to better customer experiences that make us the project authority. 
Across the enterprise, we strive to be a customer-centric omni-channel company, so we'll continue to enhance our omni-channel capabilities, evolving from a multichannel offering to an omni-channel experience, where all of our channels work in concert with one another. We will support customers in every step of their home improvement journey and build greater affinity for the Lowe's brand. This strategic framework, along with our efforts to improve our productivity and profitability, give us confidence in our business outlook for 2016. Bob will share those details in a few minutes. 
This is an exciting time for Lowe's, and I would like to thank our employees for their incredible contributions they make everyday. It's their hard work and commitment to delivering outstanding customer service that makes this company great, and I look forward to what their efforts produce in 2016. 
Thanks, again, for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Mike."

As Robert shared with you, we delivered another solid quarter with positive comps across all regions and product categories. We executed well in the fourth quarter, growing both average ticket and transaction. We drove traffic through our Black Friday event, which drove sales increases of 8% overall and 26% online, with compelling offers and special buys and tools, decor, appliance and other traffic drivers, creating strong values for customers while remaining true to our strategic focus and core strength in home improvement. We drove increases in traffic for the quarter through competitive offers, enhanced online selling capabilities and improved marketing speed and flexibility from a digital capabilities where we tested new concepts like Deal Of the Day. We also rebalanced year end promotions to take advantage of the extended outdoor selling season. 
Looking at product category performance, we recorded above average comps in lumber and building materials, appliances, lawn and garden and paint. We saw particular strength in outdoor project categories led by lumber and building materials, lawn and garden, and to a lesser extent, outdoor power equipment and millwork as customers took advantage of mild weather to complete exterior projects such as roofs, fence and decks. And outdoor power equipment, we drove double-digit comps in off season product such as pressure washers, [indiscernible] motors. And in lawn and garden we saw double-digit comps in soil, mulch and lawn care. On the landscape lighting experience drove strong performance as well, bringing outdoor dining projects to light by providing inspiration and making selection installation easy for customers by offering new product technologies like LED. We also achieved strong comps in appliances for another quarter, leveraging our investment in customer experience both in-store and online. In-store, our 17 appliance suites showcasing coordinate appliances allows customers to visualize how their appliance purchase will look in their existing or remodeled kitchen. Not just as a same replacement purchase, there's a full set of new appliances and allows us to showcase innovations such as black stainless steel, new appliance finish and new product selections like the Frigidaire Professional Collection, a Lowe's Home Channel exclusive. Online, we have enhanced our customer experience and presentation on Lowes.com, including improved product search, integrated and upgraded product videos, enhanced product presentation like 360 views and signified product groupings to make it easier for customers to make their selection. 
Our continued focus on omnichannel customer experience together with leading brands, [indiscernible] assortment, competitive price, a lot of sales specialists, as well as delivery service, combined to drive our sustained share gains in appliances. In fact, J.D. Power & Associates ranked Lowe's the #1 appliance provider for 2015. Paint benefited from increased project activity as well as product awareness of our [indiscernible] brand offering with the launch of HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams in the beginning of second quarter we are now providing customers with a full suite of top brands they trust for the next paint project. Olympic provides quality at a great value and easy application. Valspar specializes in color authority with the Love Your Color Guarantee and HDTV Home by Sherwin-Williams provides strong brand recognition, designer-coordinated colors and quality that customers trust. We're also proud to announce the expansion of HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams with the introduction of Infinity, our premium one poll paint and primer with the exception of hiding power and coverage available on our stores in March. As customers engage in both indoor and outdoor projects, we leverage our omni-channel capabilities to help them achieve great results, not only in our stores and online, but also through our project specialists, we meet the customers in their homes. This capability represents another important element of our omnichannel strategy. We have project specialists who focus on the exterior of the home available across all U.S. stores, and we're expanding our interior project specialist program reaching all stores by the end of 2016. We're very pleased with our in-home sales program performance with above average comp again this quarter. 
With our ability to coordinate style, provide designer expertise and find the right contract for the job, we are rapidly becoming the project authority in home improvement. And our customer experience design capabilities continue to pay dividends, leveraging our largest store format in space initially created for the outdoor living experience, we again showcased our holiday decor experience, an inspirational hardware showroom where customers can see everything from point setters, artificial trees to indoor and outdoor decorations and gifts. Developed in collaboration between our merchants, stores and dedicated customer experience design team, the holiday decor inspire customers to decorate, raise the awareness of the breadth of holiday decor and gift offerings and provide project solutions relevant to the holiday microseasons. The customer response is very positive, driving strong sales and attachments for the products included in the set. We now transition this space back to our outdoor living experience in preparation for the critical spring selling season. 
Toward the end of the quarter, as winter storm's approach we're able to serve customers needs as a they're able to prepare for and clean up after the storm. Our supply chain demonstrate agility and flexibility as we work with inventories such as Bill trawlers, generators, ice metal and heaters to the areas in the path of the storm. We are proud that we are supply chain teams and our associates respond to the needs of customers during winter storm [indiscernible]. We also continue to our Pro business, driving comps above the company average by continuing to advance our product and service offering to meet their unique needs. Throughout the year, we strengthened our portfolio of Pro-focused brands with the addition of [indiscernible] tools,  GF roofing, [indiscernible] insulation [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] and interior doors. In addition to leveraging our long-standing partnership with Hitachi, Bostick, Bosch, Bon and Paslode to develop a broad relevant selection of tools and fasteners. We're also proud to introduce Cabbage Stains, one of America's recognized stain brands rolling to our stores in the first quarter. We continue to incorporate feedback from the Pro customer and store employees into better offering experience by working closely with our field-based merchandising managers to identify local market opportunities and introduce products optimized to local norms to further increase our relevance with Pros. 
Along with strengthening our brand portfolio, we relaunched LowesForPros.com at the beginning of the second quarter, making it easy for Pros to manage multiple properties and easily purchase items for their locations nationwide. We're also actively serving the Pro through our [indiscernible] services, or EAPs. EAP call on regional customers top them order and replenish products across multiple stores. Our EAPs have been very effective in growing our business with larger Pro customers, especially maintenance repair and operations or MRO customers. We currently have over 160 Pro outside sales representatives in the field and are very pleased with the program's results. Excluding the AEPs we added this year, we saw a double-digit growth in AEPs sales which contributed to solid Pro comp sales growth in the quarter. Leading on this success, we plan to add an additional 35 AEPs in the first half of 2016.  We also reconnected with pros who have not recently purchased with Lowe's to show them what's changed in our stores and online using targeted marketing as well as Pro-focused events to drive awareness and generate new business. For example, our Pro services team engaged with customers at the International Builders Show in Las Vegas, driving awareness of the platform and services we provide. We then extended the interaction to our stores for a first-time builder week, with special product and credit offers for the Pro. Our focus on strengthening our portfolio of brands, serving the Pro customers through our Pro services team as well as our relaunch of LowesForPros.com are part of broader commitment to put in a strong foundation with the Pro. 
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. Gross margin was flat year-over-year as improvements driven by our [indiscernible] process and inflation were offset by the impact of product mix and promotions. Once again, our stores effectively managed payroll hours on solid comp store growth, driving 25 basis points of payroll expense leverage, but also driving strong customer satisfaction scores. We also continue to drive productivity in marketing by optimizing our media allocation, increasing our presence in targeted digital advertising, expanding our social media presence and reducing print advertising, thereby increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our media buy by improving our advertising spend, all while maintaining our customer reach and improving exposure. And we continue to identify and implement additional expense efficiencies by consolidating the procurement of some of the types of goods and services across our store functions. 
During the quarter, we demonstrated the flexibility and capabilities of our supply chain as our distribution teams worked efficiently to meet inventory customer needs, not only as they prepare for winter storms in the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, but also to meet the high demand in the Pacific Northwest. While inventory [indiscernible] 6% to last year, it reflects our commitment to being in stock for items that are most relevant to our customers, as well as timing of spring buys including the impact of Chinese New Year's and a higher level of inventory to support strong sales growth in categories such as appliances. 
As you can see, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results and the progress we continue to make on our initiatives to drive top line growth, productivity and profitability. We look forward to sharing our progress with you over the coming quarters. Thank you for interest and Lowe's. I will now turn the call over to Bob."
180871,312256575,939123,"Lowe's Companies Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2016",2016-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Lowe's Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the fourth quarter were $13.2 billion, a 5.6% increase over last year's fourth quarter. Total transactions increased by 4% and total average ticket increased 1.5% to $67.15. Comp sales were 5.2% for the",1444,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the fourth quarter were $13.2 billion, a 5.6% increase over last year's fourth quarter. Total transactions increased by 4% and total average ticket increased 1.5% to $67.15. Comp sales were 5.2% for the quarter. As you heard from Mike, solid execution drove balanced performance in the quarter. 
Account transactions increased 3.6% and comp average ticket increased 1.6%. Looking at monthly trends, comps were 2.8% in November, 7.3% in December and 5.3% in January. For the year, total sales were $59.1 billion, an increase of 5.1% driven by comp sales of 4.3% to 10 [ph] new stores. For 2015, comp average ticket increased 2.5% and comp transactions increased 2.2%. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 34.66% of sales, which is flat to last year. In the quarter, product cost deflation and value improvement aided gross margin, but were offset by pressure from the mix of products sold and promotions. For the year, gross margin of 34.82% of sales represented an increase of 3 basis points over 2014. 
In January, we made the decision to exit our joint venture in Australia. There is a process in the joint venture agreement for purposes of determining the value of our portion of the joint venture. We are working our way through that process and expect it to be completed in the next month or so. We reported a $530 million non-cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter. The charge includes the cumulative impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar over the life of the investment. The valuation is based on our best estimate of our 1/3 interest in the joint venture. This valuation is subject to potential adjustment as additional information becomes available as we complete the process.  For the quarter, the impairment charge impacted SG&A leverage and EBIT by 401 basis points and earnings per share by $0.58. For the year, the SG&A EBIT impact was 90 basis points, while the earnings per share reduction was $0.56. 
Finally, as a majority investor, we have been recognizing our share of the losses which were reflected in SG&A. In 2015, we recorded $11 million and $48 million for Q4 and the year respectively. As the result of our decision to exercise our option, we are no longer required to make capital contributions or absorb future operating losses.  My comments from this point will be focused on our operating performance and will exclude the impact of the joint venture impairment. Adjusted SG&A was 24.55% of sales, which leveraged 69 basis points. The leverage came from a number of areas. Mike mentioned 2, store payroll and marketing, which leveraged 25 and 20 basis points respectively. Utilities expense leveraged 12 basis points primarily the result of normal weather. Employee interest leveraged 12 basis points in the quarter due to a reduction in both the number and severity of claims. Also, given the sales growth, we were able to leverage fixed costs. For the year, adjusted SG&A was 23% of sales and leveraged 62 basis points versus 2014. Depreciation expense was $369 million for the quarter, which is 2.79% of sales and leveraged 10 basis points. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes for the quarter were 7.32% to sales which represented a 79 basis point increase. 
For the year, adjusted EBIT of 9.31% represented increase of 78 basis points over 2014. Interest expense at $144 million for the quarter deleveraged 3 basis points as a percentage of sales. Regarding the reported tax rate, the impairment gives rise to a capital loss versus an operating loss and therefore is not immediately deductible. To the extent the company has future capital gains we'll be able to offset this loss. Adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $541 million, which increased 20.2% versus last year. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 for the quarter were up 28.3% to last year. For 2015, adjusted earnings per share of $3.29 were up 21.4% versus 2014. 
Transitioning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $405 million. Inventory at $9.5 billion was up $547 million or 6.1% over last year. Roughly $200 million for 2.2% of the growth was driven by the timing of Chinese New Year with the rest of the increase to support sales growth. Inventory turnover was 3.92, an increase of 7 basis points over last year. 
Moving on to liabilities, accounts payable at $5.6 billion was up $509 million or 10% over last year. The increase relates to both higher inventory levels and a 2-day improvement in days payable outstanding. At the fourth quarter, we suggested debt-to-EBITDAR was 2.14. Return on invested capital increased 18 basis points to 14.1%. We estimate that the impairment charge negatively impacted ROIC by 238 basis points. 2015 was the third consecutive year that ROIC improved by more than 200 basis points. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows, cash flow from operations was $4.8 billion. Capital expenditures were $1.2 million resulting in free cash flow of $3.6 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $7.6 billion shares or $562 million through the open market. For the year, we repurchased almost 54 million shares, which included $3.8 billion from the company's share repurchase program, as well as shares withheld from employees to satisfy statutory tax withholding liabilities for a total of $3.9 billion. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook, but first, I want to highlight that fiscal 2016 will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for a total of 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the year. Lowe's fiscal year-end on the Friday nearest the end of January. This means we have a 53-week year roughly every 5 years. Our last 53 week year was 2011. For 2016, we estimate that the 53rd week will aid [ph] total sales by approximately 1.5% and earnings per share by $0.05 to $0.06. Secondly, while we have reached an agreement to acquire RONA, we have shareholder and regulatory approvals ahead of us. As a result, our outlook excludes the impact of the RONA transaction. 
Now let's get into the outlook. As Robert noted, the forecast for the home improvement industry remains positive. While we're optimistic about that forecast, we've taken a prudent approach to our 2016 outlook. For 2016, we expect total sales increase of approximately 6%, driven by a comp sales increase of 4%, the impact of the 53rd week and the opening of approximately 45 stores, which includes 20 Orchard locations and 12 stores in Canada, largely the result of the target lease acquisition. For ease of modeling, the EBIT and EPS growth rates exclude the impact of the impairment charge. We are anticipating EBIT increase of 80 to 90 basis points from a combination of gross margin, SG&A and depreciation. As you heard from others, there is wage pressure in the marketplace. Our outlook for 2016 assumes roughly 7 basis points or $0.03 per share of pressure associated with above average wage inflation. For 2016, we expect 25 to 30 basis points of EBIT expansion for point above 1%. While this is our expectation for the year, there will be some choppiness quarter-to-quarter. Similar to last year, 2000 EBIT expansion will be stronger in the second half of the year, primarily driven by gross margin, bonus and the impact of the 53rd week. As a result, we are forecasting EBIT expansion of 50 to 60 basis points for the first half and 115 to 125 basis points for the second half of the year. And looking at our guidance model relative to first call, the mean estimate for the first half of the year appears to be heavy by about $0.02 per share in both Q1 and Q2, and the fourth quarter looks wide likely as a result of the 53rd week. The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. For the year, we expect earnings per share of approximately $4, which represents an increase of 21.6% over 2015 adjusted EPS. We are forecasting cash flow from operations to be approximately $5.4 billion. Our capital plan for 2016 is approximately $1.5 billion. This results in estimated free cash flow of $3.9 billion for 2016. We expect to issue incremental debt during the year as we managed the 2.25 lease adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR target. We had approximately $3.6 billion remaining under share repurchase authorization at the end of the fiscal year. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.5 billion in share repurchases for 2016. The share repurchases option of $3.5 billion is not expected to be affected by the RONA acquisition.

Gross margin really based on the mix of products, primarily with a greater mix impact in the fourth quarter and the second half of the year that we did in the year as a whole, that's a primary difference, driving a little heavier gross margin expansion in the second half than the first half. For bonus, we came into the year expecting to leverage bonus roughly 10 basis points it being flat as percent of sales for 2015 relative to 2014. A lot of difference came from the fourth quarter on the strength of our sales performance. Our bonus programs are predicated on sales and earnings performance and based on the strength of the sales results for the fourth quarter, we increased bonus accruals. As a result, we'll have the opportunity to leverage against that build in Q4 2015. Another smaller item store environment just the timing of projects weighted more on the first half versus second half as we think about 2016 versus 2015. And it impacted the 53rd week, we have roughly $900 million of additional sales in the fourth quarter. That's going to drive roughly 15 basis points of higher EBIT in the second half of the year as a result of that.

We delivered another solid quarter, with comparable sales growth of 5.2%, which exceeded our expectations. Our efforts to drive traffic, which Mike will share in more detail, have resonated with customers, resulting in a 3.6% increase in comp transactions, along with a 1.6% increase in average ticket. 
Our U.S. Home Improvement business achieved 5.5% comps for the quarter, with all 14 regions generating positive comps. And our strong performance in Canada continues, with double-digit comps in local currency for the third year in a row. 
During the quarter, we generated positive comps in all 13 product categories. We capitalized on increased demand for exterior products as a result of warmer weather, with strength in lumber and building materials, outdoor power equipment, lawn and garden and millwork, while at the same time, driving strong mid-single-digit comps in interior project categories, such as paint and fashion fixtures. And as a result of our strong brand and service advantages, we continue to drive strong comps in appliances. 
Lastly, our Pro business performed above the company average as we continued to build deeper relationships with the Pro by enhancing our product and service offering to meet their unique needs. 
For the quarter, we drove 79 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.59, a 28% increase over last year's fourth quarter. For the year, we delivered comparable sales growth of 4.8% and adjusted earnings per share of $3.29, a 21% increase over 2014. Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $562 million of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $257 million in dividends. For the year, we repurchased $3.8 billion of stock and paid $957 million in dividends. 
As we head into 2016, the outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive. Continued support from steady job gains and improved incomes, as well as favorable trends in housing, should keep home improvement growth buoyant. 
Further, despite recent volatility in the financial markets, the fundamentals for continued growth in consumer spending remain intact. Consumers should continue to benefit from improved household financial conditions and lower gas prices on top of broader job and income gains. These trends aligned with results for our most recent consumer sentiment survey, where favorable perceptions around personal finances remained stable, even though respondents' assessment of the national economy declined slightly. 
For the home improvement industry specifically, we continue to see favorable trends, as the desire to invest in the home continues to grow. Roughly half of homeowners believe the value of their home has increased, which is double the number feeling that way in 2009. And many believe this trend will continue, as we saw a significant increase in future home value expectations. And while most homeowners indicated their spending levels are staying the same, they are more likely to allocate funds to home improvement compared to other areas. 
In 2016, we will continue to leverage the favorable backdrop for home improvement, delivering great service to customers while also anticipating how Lowe's will meet their needs in the future. 
We take a prudent approach to managing our portfolio of businesses, making decisions that shape how we serve and connect with customers. Giving careful consideration to how we position Lowe's favorably for sustainable growth, we invest to obtain compelling returns over the long run. As we carry out our capital allocation priorities, which remain unchanged from what we shared previously, our first priority is to invest in the business. We then seek to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
We demonstrated our disciplined approach to capital allocation with the recent changes in our international business. First, after a comprehensive strategic analysis, we decided to exit the Australian home improvement market by withdrawing from our joint venture with Woolworths. We made the decision to focus our resources on areas of the business where we see greater potential return of investment. 
Second, seeking to reinforce our portfolio of businesses in North America, we committed to accelerating our growth in Canada by announcing our agreement to acquire RONA. The time is ripe to strengthen the company's Canadian operations to take advantage of the significant long-term potential we see. We expect to build on the recent progress our team in Canada has made and the positive results RONA has achieved over the past several years as a result of their restructuring efforts. 
With this transaction, we see opportunities to further increase revenue and operating profitability in Canada, including: Enhancing customer relevance by utilizing our strengths as a leading omnichannel home improvement company and drawing on our customer experience design capabilities; expanding customer reach and serving a new portion of the market by applying our expertise in certain product categories, including our best-in-class appliance offering; driving increased profitability in Canada by leveraging shared supplier relationships and enhanced scale, as well as Lowe's private-label capabilities in addition to eliminating RONA's public company cost. 
At the same time we're reinforcing our international businesses, our U.S. home improvement business, with a dedicated focus from Mike and Rick's team, is diligently working to drive profitable share gains within the U.S. market. In 2016, their efforts will continue to focus on improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer and differentiating ourselves through better customer experiences that make us the project authority. 
Across the enterprise, we strive to be a customer-centric omnichannel company. So we'll continue to enhance our omnichannel capabilities, evolving from a multichannel offering to an omnichannel experience, where all of our channels work in concert with one another. We will support customers at every step of their home improvement journey and build greater affinity for the Lowe's brand. 
This strategic framework, along with our efforts to improve our productivity and profitability, give us confidence in our business outlook for 2016. Bob will share those details in a few minutes. 
This is an exciting time for Lowe's, and I would like to thank our employees for their incredible contribution they make every day. It's their hard work and commitment to delivering outstanding customer service that makes this company great, and I look forward to what their efforts produce in 2016. 
Thanks, again, for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Mike."

As Robert shared with you, we delivered another solid quarter, with positive comps across all regions and product categories. We executed well in the fourth quarter, growing both average ticket and transaction. 
We drove traffic through our Black Friday event, which drove sales increases of 8% overall and 26% online, with compelling offers and special buys in tools, holiday decor, appliance and other traffic drivers, creating strong values for customers while remaining true to our strategic focus and core strength in home improvement. We drove increases in traffic for the quarter through competitive offers, enhanced online selling capabilities and improved marketing speed and flexibility from our digital capabilities, where we tested new concepts like deal of the day. We also rebalanced year-end promotions to take advantage of the extended outdoor selling season. 
Looking at product category performance, we recorded above average comps in lumber and building materials, appliances, lawn and garden and paint. We saw particular strength in outdoor project categories, led by lumber and building materials, lawn and garden, and to a lesser extent, outdoor power equipment and millwork, as customers took advantage of mild weather to complete exterior projects, such as roofs, fence and decks. 
In outdoor power equipment, we drove double-digit comps in off-season products, such as pressure washers, walk-behind and riding mowers. And in lawn and garden, we saw double-digit comps in soil, mulch and lawn care. Our new landscape lighting experience drove strong performance as well, bringing outdoor lighting projects to life by providing inspiration and making selection and installation easy for customers while offering new product technologies, like LED. 
We also achieved strong comps in appliances for yet another quarter, leveraging our investment in customer experience both in-store and online. In-store, our 17 appliance suites showcasing coordinate appliances allows customers to visualize how their appliance purchase will look in their existing or remodeled kitchen. Not just as a same replacement purchase, there's a full set of new appliances and allows us to showcase innovations, such as black stainless steel, our new appliance finish, and new product selections, like the Frigidaire Professional Collection, a Lowe's Home Channel exclusive. 
Online, we have enhanced our customer experience and presentation on Lowes.com, including improved product search, integrated and upgraded product videos, enhanced product presentation, like 360 views, and simplified product groupings to make it easy for customers to make their selection. 
Our continued focus on omnichannel customer experience, together with leading brands, breadth of assortment, competitive price, knowledgable sales specialists, as well as delivery and haul-away service, combine to drive our sustained share gains in appliances. In fact, J.D. Power & Associates ranked Lowe's the #1 appliance retailer for 2015. 
Paint benefited from increased project activity, as well as broader awareness of our 3-brand offering. With the launch of HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams in the beginning of second quarter we are now providing customers with a full suite of top brands they trust for their next paint project. Olympic provides quality at a great value and easy application. Valspar specializes in color authority with their love your color guarantee. And HGTV Home by Sherwin-Williams provides strong brand recognition, designer-coordinated colors and quality that customers trust. We are also proud to announce the expansion of HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams with the introduction of Infinity, our premium one-coat paint and primer with exceptional hiding power and coverage available on our stores in March. 
As customers engage in both indoor and outdoor projects, we leverage our omnichannel capabilities to help them achieve great results, not only in our stores and online, but also through our project specialists, we meet the customers in their homes. This capability represents another important element of our omnichannel strategy. We have project specialists who focus on the exterior of the home available across all U.S. stores, and we're expanding our interior project specialist program, reaching all stores by the end of 2016. 
We're very pleased with our in-home sales program performance with above average comp again this quarter. With our ability to coordinate style, provide design expertise and find the right contractors for the job, we are rapidly becoming the project authority in home improvement. 
And our customer experience design capabilities continue to pay dividends, leveraging our largest store format in space initially created for the outdoor living experience, we again showcased our holiday decor experience, an inspirational holiday showroom, where customers can see everything, from point setters and artificial trees to indoor and outdoor decorations and gifts. Developed in collaboration between our merchants, stores and dedicated customer experience design team, the holiday decor experience inspire customers to decorate, raise the awareness of the breadth of our holiday decor and gift offerings and provide the project solutions relevant to the holiday microseasons. The customer response is very positive, driving strong sales and attachments for the products included in the set. We're now transitioning this space back to our outdoor living experience in preparation for the critical spring selling season. 
Toward the end of the quarter, as Winter Storm Jonas approached, we're able to serve customers' needs as they worked to prepare for and clean up from the storm. Our supply chain demonstrated agility and flexibility, as we worked with inventories such as snow throwers, generators, ice melt and heaters to the areas in the path of the storm. We're proud of the way our supply chain teams and associates responded to the needs of customers during Winter Storm Jonas . 
We also continue to strengthen our Pro business, driving comps above the company average by continuing to advance our product and service offering to meet their unique needs. Throughout the year, we strengthened our portfolio of Pro-focused brands with the addition of Goldblatt masonry tools, GAF roofing, Owens Corning insulation, Lennox A-sat [ph] and Masonite entry and interior doors, in addition to leveraging our long-standing partnerships with Hitachi, Stanley Bostitch, Bosch, Vaughan and Paslode to develop a broad Pro-relevant selection of tools and fasteners. We're also proud to introduce Cabot Stains, one of America's most recognized stain brands, rolling to our stores in the first quarter. 
We continue to incorporate feedback from the Pro customer and store employees into a better offering and experience by working closely with our field-based merchandising managers to identify local market opportunities and introduce products optimized to local norms to further increase our relevance with Pros. 
Along with strengthening our brand portfolio, we relaunched LowesForPros.com at the beginning of the second quarter, making it easy for Pros to manage multiple properties and easily purchase items for their locations nationwide. We're also actively serving the Pro through our account executive pro services, or AEPs. AEPs call our regional customers to help them order and replenish products across multiple stores. Our AEPs have been very effective in growing our business with larger Pro customers, especially maintenance, repair and operations, or MRO, customers. 
We currently have over 160 Pro outside sales representatives in the field and are very pleased with the program's results. Excluding the AEPs we added this year, we saw a double-digit growth in AEP sales, which contributed to solid Pro comp sales growth in the quarter. Building on this success, we plan to add an additional 35 AEPs in the first half of 2016.  
We're also reconnecting with Pros who have not recently purchased from Lowe's to show them what's changed in our stores and online, using targeted marketing as well as Pro-focused events to drive awareness and generate new business. For example, our Pro services team engaged with customers at the International Builders Show in Las Vegas, driving awareness of the platform and services we provide. We then extended the interaction to our stores for a first-time builder week, with special product and credit offers for the Pro. Our focus on strengthening our portfolio of brands, serving Pro customers through our Pro services team as well as our relaunch of LowesForPros.com are part of a broader commitment to put in a strong foundation with the Pro. 
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. Gross margin was flat year-over-year, as improvements driven by our line review process and inflation were offset by the impact of product mix and promotions. Once again, our stores effectively managed payroll hours on solid comp sales growth, driving 25 basis points of payroll expense leverage, but also driving strong customer satisfaction scores. 
We also continue to drive productivity in marketing by optimizing our media allocation, increasing our presence in targeted digital advertising, expanding our social media presence and reducing print advertising, thereby increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our media buy by improving our advertising spend, all while maintaining our customer reach and improving exposure. 
And we continue to identify and implement additional expense efficiencies by consolidating the procurement of some of the types of goods and services across our corporate and store functions. 
During the quarter, we demonstrated the flexibility and capabilities of our supply chain as our distribution teams worked efficiently to move inventory to meet customer needs, not only as they prepare for winter storms in the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, but also to meet the heightened demand in the Pacific Northwest. While inventory at quarter end was up 6% to last year, it reflects our commitment to being in stock for items that are most relevant to our customers, as well as timing of spring buys, including the impact of Chinese New Year's, and a higher level of inventory to support strong sales growth in categories, such as appliances. 
As you can see, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results and the progress we continue to make on our initiatives to drive top line growth, productivity and profitability. We look forward to sharing further progress with you over the coming quarters. 
Thank you for interest and Lowe's. And I will now turn the call over to Bob."
180871,312256575,939443,"Lowe's Companies Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2016",2016-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Lowe's Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the fourth quarter were $13.2 billion, a 5.6% increase over last year's fourth quarter. Total transactions increased by 4% and total average ticket increased 1.5% to $67.15. Comp sales were 5.2% for th",1455,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. 
Sales for the fourth quarter were $13.2 billion, a 5.6% increase over last year's fourth quarter. Total transactions increased by 4% and total average ticket increased 1.5% to $67.15. Comp sales were 5.2% for the quarter. As you heard from Mike, solid execution drove balanced performance in the quarter. Comp transactions increased 3.6% and comp average ticket increased 1.6%. Looking at monthly trends, comps were 2.8% in November, 7.3% in December and 5.3% in January. 
For the year, total sales were $59.1 billion, an increase of 5.1%, driven by comp sales of 4.8% and new stores. For 2015, comp average ticket increased 2.5%, and comp transactions increased 2.2%. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 34.66% of sales, which is flat to last year. In the quarter, product cost deflation and value improvement aided gross margin, but were offset by pressure from the mix of products sold and promotions. For the year, gross margin of 34.82% of sales represented an increase of 3 basis points over 2014. 
In January, we made the decision to exit our joint venture in Australia. There is a process in the joint venture agreement for purposes of determining the value of our portion of the joint venture. We are working our way through that process and expect it to be completed in the next month or so. 
We recorded a $530 million non-cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter. The charge includes the cumulative impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar over the life of the investment. The valuation is based on our best estimate of our 1/3 interest in the joint venture. This valuation is subject to potential adjustment as additional information becomes available as we complete the process. For the quarter, the impairment charge impacted SG&A leverage and EBIT by 401 basis points and earnings per share by $0.58. For the year, the SG&A EBIT impact was 90 basis points, while the earnings per share reduction was $0.56. 
Finally, as a majority investor, we have been recognizing our share of the losses which were reflected in SG&A. In 2015, we recorded $11 million and $48 million for Q4 and the year respectively. As a result of our decision to exercise our put option, we are no longer required to make capital contributions or absorb future operating losses. 
My comments from this point will be focused on our operating performance and will exclude the impact of the joint venture impairment. Adjusted SG&A was 24.55% of sales, which leveraged 69 basis points. The leverage came from a number of areas. Mike mentioned 2: Store payroll and marketing, which leveraged 25 and 20 basis points, respectively. Utilities expense leveraged 12 basis points, primarily the result of warmer weather. Employee insurance leveraged 12 basis points in the quarter due to a reduction in both the number and severity of claims. Also, given the sales growth, we were able to leverage fixed costs. For the year, adjusted SG&A was 23% of sales and leveraged 62 basis points versus 2014. 
Depreciation expense was $369 million for the quarter, which is 2.79% of sales and leveraged 10 basis points. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes for the quarter were 7.32% to sales, which represented a 79 basis point increase. For the year, adjusted EBIT of 9.31% represented an increase of 78 basis points over 2014. Interest expense at $144 million for the quarter deleveraged 3 basis points as a percentage of sales. 
Regarding the reported tax rate. The impairment gives rise to a capital loss versus an operating loss and therefore is not immediately deductible. To the extent the company has future capital gains, we'll be able to offset this loss. 
Adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $541 million, which increased 20.2% versus last year. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 for the quarter were up 28.3% to last year. For 2015, adjusted earnings per share of $3.29 were up 21.4% versus 2014. 
Transitioning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $405 million. Inventory at $9.5 billion was up $547 million or 6.1% over last year. Roughly $200 million or 2.2% of the growth was driven by the timing of Chinese New Year, with the rest of the increase to support sales growth. Inventory turnover was 3.92, an increase of 7 basis points over last year. 
Moving on to liabilities. Accounts payable at $5.6 billion was up $509 million or 10% over last year. The increase relates to both higher inventory levels and a 2-day improvement in days payable outstanding. At the end of the fourth quarter, lease-adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 2.14. Return on invested capital increased 18 basis points to 14.1%. We estimate that the impairment charge negatively impacted ROIC by 238 basis points. 2015 was the third consecutive year that ROIC improved by more than 200 basis points. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Cash flow from operations was $4.8 billion, capital expenditures were $1.2 million, resulting in free cash flow of $3.6 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased 7.6 billion (sic) [ 7.6 million ] shares for $562 million through the open market. For the year, we repurchased almost 54 million shares, which included $3.8 billion from the company's share repurchase program, as well as shares withheld from employees to satisfy statutory tax withholding liabilities, for a total of $3.9 billion. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. But first, I want to highlight that fiscal 2016 will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for a total of 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the year. Lowe's fiscal year ended on the Friday nearest the end of January, this means we have a 53-week year roughly every 5 years. Our last 53-week year was 2011. For 2016, we estimate that the 53rd week will aid total sales by approximately 1.5% and earnings per share by $0.05 to $0.06. Secondly, while we have reached an agreement to acquire RONA, we have shareholder and regulatory approvals ahead of us. As a result, our outlook excludes the impact of the RONA transaction. 
Now let's get into the outlook. As Robert noted, the forecast for the home improvement industry remains positive. While we're optimistic about that forecast, we've taken a prudent approach to our 2016 outlook. 
For 2016, we expect total sales increase of approximately 6%, driven by a comp sales increase of 4%, the impact of the 53rd week and the opening of approximately 45 stores, which includes 20 Orchard locations and 12 stores in Canada, largely the result of the Target lease acquisition. For ease of modeling, the EBIT and EPS growth rates exclude the impact of the impairment charge. 
We are anticipating an EBIT increase of 80 to 90 basis points from a combination of gross margin, SG&A and depreciation. As you've heard from others, there is wage pressure in the marketplace. Our outlook for 2016 assumes roughly 7 basis points or $0.03 per share of pressure associated with above average wage inflation. For 2016, we expect 25 to 30 basis points of EBIT expansion per point up above 1%. While this is our expectation for the year, there will be some choppiness quarter-to-quarter. 
Similar to last year, 2000 -- EBIT expansion will be stronger in the second half of the year, primarily driven by gross margin, bonus and the impact of the 53rd week. As a result, we are forecasting EBIT expansion of 50 to 60 basis points for the first half and 115 to 125 basis points for the second half of the year. 
And looking at our guidance model relative to First Call, the mean estimate for the first half of the year appears to be heavy by about $0.02 per share in both Q1 and Q2, and the fourth quarter looks light, likely as a result of the 53rd week. 
The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. For the year, we expect earnings per share of approximately $4, which represents an increase of 21.6% over 2015 adjusted EPS. We are forecasting cash flow from operations to be approximately $5.4 billion. Our capital plan for 2016 is approximately $1.5 billion. This results in estimated free cash flow of $3.9 billion for 2016. We expect to issue incremental debt during the year as we manage to the 2.25 lease-adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR target. 
We had approximately $3.6 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization at the end of the fiscal year. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.5 billion in share repurchases for 2016. The share repurchase assumption of $3.5 billion is not expected to be affected by the RONA acquisition. 
Regina, we are now ready for questions."

I guess that we were under the impression there were some indirect cost that had come out in the middle part of this -- the last year, and that would still roll through the model in the first part of '16. And so why, I guess, isn't that the case? And then can you just put a little more color around a wide bonus in GM? I don't know if those were mentioned any part of the year, but what are the factors that aren't going to, I think, help you with flow-through in those areas?"

Gross margin really based on the mix of products, primarily, with a greater mix impact in the fourth quarter and the second half of the year than we did in the year as a whole, that's a primary difference, driving a little heavier gross margin expansion in the second half than the first half. For bonus, we came into the year expecting to leverage bonus roughly 10 basis points, ended up being flat as percent of sales for 2015 relative to 2014. A lot of that difference came in the fourth quarter on the strength of our sales performance. Our bonus programs are predicated on sales and earnings performance. And based on the strength of the sales results for the fourth quarter, we increased bonus accruals. As a result, we'll have the opportunity to leverage against that build in Q4 2015. Another smaller item, store environment, so just the timing of projects weighted more in the first half versus second half as we think about 2016 versus 2015. And the impact of the 53rd week, we have roughly $900 million of additional sales in the fourth quarter. That's going to drive roughly 15 basis points of higher EBIT in the second half of the year as a result of that. So those are the major factors giving rise to the difference in flow-through second half versus first quarter."

And what I'll to tell you is that every year, we looked at a set of competition programs all the way across the organization, and try and set us up for what we think is going to drive the right response across the organization to take care of the customer and drive the business. And this has been an evolution that we've been on all the way back from when we were just single channel and everything, the incentive compensations were heavily focused to what took place in the 4 walls of that store, to really now today, being an omnichannel organization, where a store manager is not only compensated on what happens inside their store but also what happens in their market as well. So it's an evolution we're gone through as we're going from single channel to multichannel to now omnichannel. But that's part of what Rick and his team do every year, is look at the incentive compensation structure and make sure that it's appropriately aligned. We're very happy with the behaviors that it's driving, but it is something, as we continue to evolve, the other parts of our business become bigger parts of the total sales, it is something we look at to make sure that we're driving the right behavior of keeping the customer in the center and always focus on what's best for the customer. That's our job, and we'll be doing that, so.
Well, great. Thanks. And as always, thanks for your continued interest in Lowe's. We look forward to speaking with you again when we report our first quarter results on Wednesday, May 18. Have a great day."

We delivered another solid quarter, with comparable sales growth of 5.2%, which exceeded our expectations.

We delivered another solid quarter, with comparable sales growth of 5.2%, which exceeded our expectations. Our efforts to drive traffic, which Mike will share in more detail, have resonated with customers, resulting in a 3.6% increase in comp transactions, along with a 1.6% increase in average ticket. 
Our U.S. Home Improvement business achieved 5.5% comps for the quarter, with all 14 regions generating positive comps. And our strong performance in Canada continues, with double-digit comps in local currency for the third year in a row. 
During the quarter, we generated positive comps in all 13 product categories. We capitalized on increased demand for exterior products as a result of warmer weather, with strength in lumber and building materials, outdoor power equipment, lawn and garden and millwork, while at the same time, driving strong mid-single-digit comps in interior project categories, such as paint and fashion fixtures. And as a result of our strong brand and service advantages, we continue to drive strong comps in appliances. 
Lastly, our Pro business performed above the company average as we continue to build deeper relationships with the Pro by enhancing our product and service offering to meet their unique needs. 
For the quarter, we drove 79 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.59, a 28% increase over last year's fourth quarter. For the year, we delivered comparable sales growth of 4.8% and adjusted earnings per share of $3.29, a 21% increase over 2014. Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $562 million of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $257 million in dividends. For the year, we repurchased $3.8 billion of stock and paid $957 million in dividends. 
As we head into 2016, the outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive. Continued support from steady job gains and improved incomes, as well as favorable trends in housing, should keep home improvement growth buoyant. 
Further, despite recent volatility in the financial markets, the fundamentals for continued growth in consumer spending remain intact. Consumers should continue to benefit from improved household financial conditions and lower gas prices on top of broader job and income gains. These trends aligned with results for our most recent consumer sentiment survey, where favorable perceptions around personal finances remained stable, even though respondents' assessment of the national economy declined slightly. 
For the home improvement industry specifically, we continue to see favorable trends, as the desire to invest in the home continues to grow. Roughly half of homeowners believe the value of their home has increased, which is double the number feeling that way in 2009. And many believe this trend will continue, as we saw a significant increase in future home value expectations. And while most homeowners indicated their spending levels are staying the same, they are more likely to allocate funds to home improvement compared to other areas. 
In 2016, we will continue to leverage the favorable backdrop for home improvement, delivering great service to customers while also anticipating how Lowe's will meet their needs in the future. 
We take a prudent approach to managing our portfolio of businesses, making decisions that shape how we serve and connect with customers. Giving careful consideration to how we position Lowe's favorably for sustainable growth, we invest to obtain compelling returns over the long run. As we carry out our capital allocation priorities, which remain unchanged from what we shared previously, our first priority is to invest in the business. We then seek to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
We demonstrated our disciplined approach to capital allocation with the recent changes in our international business. First, after a comprehensive strategic analysis, we decided to exit the Australian home improvement market by withdrawing from our joint venture with Woolworths. We made the decision to focus our resources on areas of the business where we see greater potential return on investment. 
Second, seeking to reinforce our portfolio of businesses in North America, we committed to accelerating our growth in Canada by announcing our agreement to acquire RONA. The time is right to strengthen the company's Canadian operations to take advantage of the significant long-term potential we see. We expect to build on the recent progress our team in Canada has made and the positive results RONA has achieved over the past several years as a result of their restructuring efforts. 
With this transaction, we see opportunities to further increase revenue and operating profitability in Canada, including: Enhancing customer relevance by utilizing our strengths as a leading omnichannel home improvement company and drawing on our customer experience design capabilities; expanding customer reach and serving a new portion of the market by applying our expertise in certain product categories, including our best-in-class appliance offering; driving increased profitability in Canada by leveraging shared supplier relationships and enhanced scale, as well as Lowe's private-label capabilities in addition to eliminating RONA's public company cost. 
At the same time we're reinforcing our international businesses, our U.S. home improvement business, with a dedicated focus from Mike and Rick's team, is diligently working to drive profitable share gains within the U.S. market. In 2016, their efforts will continue to focus on improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer and differentiating ourselves through better customer experiences that make us the project authority. 
Across the enterprise, we strive to be a customer-centric omnichannel company. So we'll continue to enhance our omnichannel capabilities, evolving from a multichannel offering to an omnichannel experience, where all of our channels work in concert with one another. We will support customers at every step of their home improvement journey and build a greater affinity for the Lowe's brand. 
This strategic framework, along with our efforts to improve our productivity and profitability, give us confidence in our business outlook for 2016. Bob will share those details in a few minutes. 
This is an exciting time for Lowe's, and I would like to thank our employees for their incredible contribution they make every day. It's their hard work and commitment to delivering outstanding customer service that makes this company great, and I look forward to what their efforts produce in 2016. 
Thanks, again, for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Mike."

As Robert shared with you, we delivered another solid quarter, with positive comps across all regions and product categories. We executed well in the fourth quarter, growing both average ticket and transaction. 
We drove traffic through our Black Friday event, which drove sales increases of 8% overall and 26% online, with compelling offers and special buys in tools, holiday decor, appliance and other traffic drivers, creating strong values for customers while remaining true to our strategic focus and core strength in home improvement. We drove increases in traffic for the quarter through competitive offers, enhanced online selling capabilities and improved marketing speed and flexibility from our digital capabilities, where we tested new concepts like deal of the day. We also rebalanced year-end promotions to take advantage of the extended outdoor selling season. 
Looking at product category performance, we recorded above average comps in lumber and building materials, appliances, lawn and garden and paint. We saw particular strength in outdoor project categories, led by lumber and building materials, lawn and garden, and to a lesser extent, outdoor power equipment and millwork, as customers took advantage of mild weather to complete exterior projects, such as roofs, fence and decks. 
In outdoor power equipment, we drove double-digit comps in off-season products, such as pressure washers, walk-behind and riding mowers. And in lawn and garden, we saw double-digit comps in soil, mulch and lawn care. Our new landscape lighting experience drove strong performance as well, bringing outdoor lighting projects to life by providing inspiration and making selection and installation easy for customers while offering new product technologies, like LED. 
We also achieved strong comps in appliances for yet another quarter, leveraging our investment in customer experience both in-store and online. In-store, our 17 appliance suites showcasing coordinate appliances allows customers to visualize how their appliance purchase will look in their existing or remodeled kitchen not just as a same replacement purchase, but as a full set of new appliances, and allows us to showcase innovations, such as black stainless steel, a new appliance finish, and new product collections, like the Frigidaire Professional Collection, a Lowe's Home Channel exclusive. 
Online, we have enhanced our customer experience and presentation on Lowes.com, including improved product search, integrated and upgraded product videos, enhanced product presentation, like 360-degree views, and simplified product groupings to make it easy for customers to make their selection. 
Our continued focus on omnichannel customer experience, together with leading brands, breadth of assortment, competitive price, knowledgeable sales specialists, as well as delivery and haul-away service, combine to drive our sustained share gains in appliances. In fact, J.D. Power & Associates ranked Lowe's the #1 appliance retailer for 2015. 
Paint benefited from increased project activity, as well as broad awareness of our 3-brand offering. With the launch of HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams in the beginning of second quarter we are now providing customers with a full suite of top brands they trust for their next paint project. Olympic provides quality at a great value and easy application. Valspar specializes in color authority with their love your color guarantee. And HGTV Home by Sherwin-Williams provides strong brand recognition, designer-coordinated colors and quality that customers trust. We are also proud to announce the expansion of HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams with the introduction of Infinity, our premium one-coat paint and primer with exceptional hiding power and coverage, available on our stores in March. 
As customers engage in both indoor and outdoor projects, we leverage our omnichannel capabilities to help them achieve great results, not only in our stores and online, but also through our project specialists, who meet the customers in their homes. This capability represents another important element of our omnichannel strategy. We have project specialists who focus on the exterior of the home available across all U.S. stores, and we're expanding our interior project specialist program, reaching all stores by the end of 2016. 
We're very pleased with our in-home sales program performance with above average comp again this quarter. With our ability to coordinate style, provide design expertise and find the right contractors for the job, we are rapidly becoming the project authority in home improvement. 
And our customer experience design capabilities continue to pay dividends, leveraging our largest store format in space initially created for the outdoor living experience, we again showcased our holiday decor experience, an inspirational holiday showroom where customers can see everything, from point setters (sic) [poinsettias] and artificial trees to indoor and outdoor decorations and gifts. Developed in collaboration between our merchants, stores and dedicated customer experience design team, the holiday decor experience inspire customers to decorate, raise their awareness of the breadth of our holiday decor and gift offerings and provide the project solutions relevant to the holiday microseasons. The customer response is very positive, driving strong sales and attachments for the products included in the set. We're now transitioning this space back to our outdoor living experience in preparation for the critical spring selling season. 
Toward the end of the quarter, as Winter Storm Jonas approached, we're able to serve customers' needs as they worked to prepare for and clean up from the storm. Our supply chain demonstrated agility and flexibility, as we worked with inventories such as snow throwers, generators, ice melt and heaters to the areas in the path of the storm. We're proud of the way our supply chain teams and associates responded to the needs of our customers during Winter Storm Jonas. 
We also continue to strengthen our Pro business, driving comps above the company average by continuing to advance our product and service offering to meet their unique needs. Throughout the year, we strengthened our portfolio of Pro-focused brands with the addition of Goldblatt masonry tools, GAF roofing, Owens Corning insulation, Lennox A-sat [ph] and Masonite entry and interior doors, in addition to leveraging our long-standing partnerships with Hitachi, Stanley Bostitch, Bosch, Vaughan and Paslode to develop a broad Pro-relevant selection of tools and fasteners. We're also proud to introduce Cabot Stains, one of America's most recognized stain brands, rolling to our stores in the first quarter. 
We continue to incorporate feedback from the Pro customer and store employees into a better offering and experience by working closely with our field-based merchandising managers to identify local market opportunities and introduce products optimized to local norms to further increase our relevance with Pros. 
Along with strengthening our brand portfolio, we relaunched LowesForPros.com at the beginning of the second quarter, making it easy for Pros to manage multiple properties and easily purchase items for their locations nationwide. We're also actively serving the Pro through our account executive pro services, or AEPs. AEPs call our regional customers to help them order and replenish products across multiple stores. Our AEPs have been very effective in growing our business with larger Pro customers, especially maintenance, repair and operations, or MRO, customers. 
We currently have over 160 Pro outside sales representatives in the field and are very pleased with the program's results. Excluding the AEPs we added this year, we saw a double-digit growth in AEP sales, which contributed to solid Pro comp sales growth in the quarter. Building on this success, we plan to add an additional 35 AEPs in the first half of 2016.  
We're also reconnecting with Pros who have not recently purchased from Lowe's to show them what's changed in our stores and online, using targeted marketing as well as Pro-focused events to drive awareness and generate new business. For example, our Pro services team engaged with customers at the International Builders Show in Las Vegas, driving awareness of the platform and services we provide. We then extended the interaction to our stores for a first-time builder week, with special product and credit offers for the Pro. Our focus on strengthening our portfolio of brands, serving Pro customers through our Pro services team as well as our relaunch of LowesForPros.com are part of a broader commitment to put in a strong foundation with the Pro. 
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. Gross margin was flat year-over-year, as improvements driven by our line review process and inflation were offset by the impact of product mix and promotions. Once again, our stores effectively managed payroll hours on solid comp sales growth, driving 25 basis points of payroll expense leverage, but also driving strong customer satisfaction scores. 
We also continue to drive productivity in marketing by optimizing our media allocation, increasing our presence in targeted digital advertising, expanding our social media presence and reducing print advertising, thereby increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our media buy by improving our advertising spend, all while maintaining our customer reach and improving exposure. 
And we continue to identify and implement additional expense efficiencies by consolidating the procurement of some of the types of goods and services across our corporate and store functions. 
During the quarter, we demonstrated the flexibility and capabilities of our supply chain as our distribution teams worked efficiently to move inventory to meet customer needs, not only as they prepare for winter storms in the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, but also to meet the heightened demand in the Pacific Northwest. While inventory at quarter end was up 6% to last year, it reflects our commitment to being in stock for items that are most relevant to our customers, as well as timing of spring buys, including the impact of Chinese New Year's, and a higher level of inventory to support strong sales growth in categories such as appliances. 
As you can see, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results and the progress we continue to make on our initiatives to drive top line growth, productivity and profitability. We look forward to sharing further progress with you over the coming quarters. 
Thank you for interest in Lowe's. And I will now turn the call over to Bob."
180871,312256575,939609,"Lowe's Companies Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2016",2016-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Lowe's Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the fourth quarter were $13.2 billion, a 5.6% increase over last year's fourth quarter. Total transactions increased by 4% and total average ticket increased 1.5% to $67.15.

Sales for the fourth quarter were $13.2 billion, a 5.6% increase over last year's fourth quarter. Total transactions increased by 4% and total average ticket increased 1.5% to $67.15. Comp sales were 5.2% for the quarter. As you heard from Mike, solid execution drove balanced performance in the quarter. Comp transactions increased 3.6% and comp average ticket increased 1.6%. Looking at monthly trends, comps were 2.8% in November, 7.3% in December and 5.3% in January. 
For the year, total sales were $59.1 billion, an increase of 5.1%, driven by comp sales of 4.8% and new stores. For 2015, comp average ticket increased 2.5%, and comp transactions increased 2.2%. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 34.66% of sales, which is flat to last year. In the quarter, product cost deflation and value improvement aided gross margin, but were offset by pressure from the mix of products sold and promotions. For the year, gross margin of 34.82% of sales represented an increase of 3 basis points over 2014. 
In January, we made the decision to exit our joint venture in Australia. There is a process in the joint venture agreement for purposes of determining the value of our portion of the joint venture. We are working our way through that process and expect it to be completed in the next month or so. 
We recorded a $530 million non-cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter. The charge includes the cumulative impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar over the life of the investment. The valuation is based on our best estimate of our 1/3 interest in the joint venture. This valuation is subject to potential adjustment as additional information becomes available as we complete the process. For the quarter, the impairment charge impacted SG&A leverage and EBIT by 401 basis points and earnings per share by $0.58. For the year, the SG&A EBIT impact was 90 basis points, while the earnings per share reduction was $0.56. 
Finally, as a majority investor, we have been recognizing our share of the losses which were reflected in SG&A. In 2015, we recorded $11 million and $48 million for Q4 and the year respectively. As a result of our decision to exercise our put option, we are no longer required to make capital contributions or absorb future operating losses. 
My comments from this point will be focused on our operating performance and will exclude the impact of the joint venture impairment. Adjusted SG&A was 24.55% of sales, which leveraged 69 basis points. The leverage came from a number of areas. Mike mentioned 2: Store payroll and marketing, which leveraged 25 and 20 basis points, respectively. Utilities expense leveraged 12 basis points, primarily the result of warmer weather. Employee insurance leveraged 12 basis points in the quarter due to a reduction in both the number and severity of claims. Also, given the sales growth, we were able to leverage fixed costs. For the year, adjusted SG&A was 23% of sales and leveraged 62 basis points versus 2014. 
Depreciation expense was $369 million for the quarter, which is 2.79% of sales and leveraged 10 basis points. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes for the quarter were 7.32% to sales, which represented a 79 basis point increase. For the year, adjusted EBIT of 9.31% represented an increase of 78 basis points over 2014. Interest expense at $144 million for the quarter deleveraged 3 basis points as a percentage of sales. 
Regarding the reported tax rate. The impairment gives rise to a capital loss versus an operating loss and therefore is not immediately deductible. To the extent the company has future capital gains, we'll be able to offset this loss. 
Adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $541 million, which increased 20.2% versus last year. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 for the quarter were up 28.3% to last year. For 2015, adjusted earnings per share of $3.29 were up 21.4% versus 2014. 
Transitioning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $405 million. Inventory at $9.5 billion was up $547 million or 6.1% over last year. Roughly $200 million or 2.2% of the growth was driven by the timing of Chinese New Year, with the rest of the increase to support sales growth. Inventory turnover was 3.92, an increase of 7 basis points over last year. 
Moving on to liabilities. Accounts payable at $5.6 billion was up $509 million or 10% over last year. The increase relates to both higher inventory levels and a 2-day improvement in days payable outstanding. At the end of the fourth quarter, lease-adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 2.14. Return on invested capital increased 18 basis points to 14.1%. We estimate that the impairment charge negatively impacted ROIC by 238 basis points. 2015 was the third consecutive year that ROIC improved by more than 200 basis points. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Cash flow from operations was $4.8 billion, capital expenditures were $1.2 billion, resulting in free cash flow of $3.6 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased 7.6 billion (sic) [ 7.6 million ] shares for $562 million through the open market. For the year, we repurchased almost 54 million shares, which included $3.8 billion from the company's share repurchase program, as well as shares withheld from employees to satisfy statutory tax withholding liabilities, for a total of $3.9 billion. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. But first, I want to highlight that fiscal 2016 will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for a total of 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the year. Lowe's fiscal year ended on the Friday nearest the end of January; this means we have a 53-week year roughly every 5 years. Our last 53-week year was 2011. For 2016, we estimate that the 53rd week will aid total sales by approximately 1.5% and earnings per share by $0.05 to $0.06. Secondly, while we have reached agreement to acquire RONA, we have shareholder and regulatory approvals ahead of us. As a result, our outlook excludes the impact of the RONA transaction. 
Now let's get into the outlook. As Robert noted, the forecast for the home improvement industry remains positive. While we're optimistic about that forecast, we've taken a prudent approach to our 2016 outlook. 
For 2016, we expect total sales increase of approximately 6%, driven by a comp sales increase of 4%, the impact of the 53rd week and the opening of approximately 45 stores, which includes 20 Orchard locations and 12 stores in Canada, largely the result of the Target lease acquisition. For ease of modeling, the EBIT and EPS growth rates exclude the impact of the impairment charge. 
We are anticipating an EBIT increase of 80 to 90 basis points from a combination of gross margin, SG&A and depreciation. As you've heard from others, there is wage pressure in the marketplace. Our outlook for 2016 assumes roughly 7 basis points or $0.03 per share of pressure associated with above average wage inflation. For 2016, we expect 25 to 30 basis points of EBIT expansion per point of comp above 1%. While this is our expectation for the year, there will be some choppiness quarter-to-quarter. 
Similar to last year, 2000 -- EBIT expansion will be stronger in the second half of the year, primarily driven by gross margin, bonus and the impact of the 53rd week. As a result, we are forecasting EBIT expansion of 50 to 60 basis points for the first half and 115 to 125 basis points for the second half of the year. 
And looking at our guidance model relative to First Call, the mean estimate for the first half of the year appears to be heavy by about $0.02 per share in both Q1 and Q2, and the fourth quarter looks light, likely as a result of the 53rd week. 
The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. For the year, we expect earnings per share of approximately $4, which represents an increase of 21.6% over 2015 adjusted EPS. We are forecasting cash flow from operations to be approximately $5.4 billion. Our capital plan for 2016 is approximately $1.5 billion. This results in estimated free cash flow of $3.9 billion for 2016. We expect to issue incremental debt during the year as we manage to the 2.25 lease-adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR target. 
We had approximately $3.6 billion remaining under share repurchase authorization at the end of the fiscal year. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.5 billion in share repurchases for 2016. The share repurchase assumption of $3.5 billion is not expected to be affected by the RONA acquisition. 
Regina, we are now ready for questions."

And so why, I guess, isn't that the case? And then can you just put a little more color around a wide bonus in GM?

Gross margin really based on the mix of products, primarily, with a greater mix impact in the fourth quarter and the second half of the year than we did in the year as a whole, that's a primary difference, driving a little bit heavier gross margin expansion in the second half than the first half. For bonus, we came into the year expecting to leverage bonus roughly 10 basis points, ended up being flat as percent of sales for 2015 relative to 2014. A lot of that difference came in the fourth quarter on the strength of our sales performance. Our bonus programs are predicated on sales and earnings performance. And based on the strength of the sales results for the fourth quarter, we increased bonus accruals. As a result, we'll have the opportunity to leverage against that build in Q4 2015. Another smaller item, store environment, so just the timing of projects weighted more in the first half versus second half as we think about 2016 versus 2015. And the impact of the 53rd week, we have roughly $900 million of additional sales in the fourth quarter. That's going to drive roughly 15 basis points of higher EBIT in the second half of the year as a result of that. So those are the major factors giving rise to the difference in flow-through second half versus first quarter."

And on top of that, a lot of the other initiatives that we've put in place, such as LowesForPros.com, the incremental resources that we put in place after, that is resonating with the consumers.

And then also, with our continued focus on making sure that, both from a service standpoint and a value standpoint, that we remain relevant to the marketplace in what we're doing there. So they continue to respond well to the brands. The outside sales organization that Mike commented earlier of 160 people, adding another 35 into that organization, continues to perform extremely well and resonate with the customer, particularly on our large MRO accounts and our national accounts, as we continue to see those grow. And the -- our core programs, of our 5 Ways to Save for the Pro customer, continues to resonate really well.

And this has been an evolution that we've been on all the way back from when we were just single channel and everything, the incentive compensations were heavily focused to what took place in the 4 walls of that store, to really now today, being an omnichannel organization, where a store manager is not only compensated on what happens inside their store but also what happens in their market as well. So it's an evolution we're gone through as we're going from single channel to multichannel to now omnichannel. But that's part of what Rick and his team do every year, is look at the incentive compensation structure and make sure that it's appropriately aligned. We're very happy with the behaviors that it's driving, but it is something, as we continue to evolve, the other parts of our business become bigger parts of the total sales, it is something to look at to make sure that we're driving the right behavior of keeping the customer in the center and always focus on what's best for the customer.

Comparable sales grew 7.3% in the first quarter, exceeding our expectations, driven by comp transaction growth of 5.1% and a 2.2% increase in average ticket. I'd like to thank our employees for their continued efforts and serving customers which enabled our strong transaction growth. The team's project expertise and commitment to customers service allow us to capitalize on the strong improvement in demand in the quarter. Healthy macrofundamentals, favorable weather and our compelling offer drove demand resulting in strength in indoor as well as outdoor projects. In fact, we recorded positive comps in all 13 product categories with particular strength in lumber and building materials, millwork, paint, lawn and garden and tools and hardware. Our emphasis on providing better omni-channel experiences positioned us well, enabling us to connect with customers and provide the advice and assistance they count on when completing their home improvement projects whether they in the store, online, in their home or through our contact centers. We're also pleased with investments we've made to build deeper relationships with the Pro as our Pro business performed well above the company average. The work we've done to enhance our product and service offering is allowing us to better serve this important customer segment, and we will continue to deepen those relationships. 
From a geographic perspective, our U.S. Home Improvement business achieved 7.5% comps for the quarter with all 14 regions delivering positive comps, and we continued our strong performance in international markets, including double-digit comps in Canada in local currency. For the quarter, we generate 170 basis points of operating margin expansion. Included in the quarter's results is a $116 million unrealized gain on a foreign currency hedge entered into in advance of our pending RONA acquisition. Including this benefit, we delivered earnings per share of $0.98, a 40% increase over last year's first quarter. Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter we repurchased $1.2 billion of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $255 million in dividends. 
I'm also pleased with the progress of our previously announced acquisition of RONA. This transaction was approved by RONA's shareholders in March. And last week, we received authorization from the Canadian regulatory agencies clearing the way for closing of the transaction this Friday. The time is right to fortify our Canadian market presence to take advantage of the significant long-term potential we see. We expect to build on the recent progress our team in Canada has made and the positive results RONA has achieved over recent years as a result of their restructuring efforts. 
Turning to the economic landscape for the balance of the year. That look from the home improvement industry remains positive. Persistent gains in the job market as well as disposable income growth is expected to outpace growth in the economy should contribute to solid growth in consumer spending and housing remains a bright spot with home improvement and construction activity posting healthy gains this part of the year while home prices continued their steady upward trend. As a result, the home improvement industry should continue to benefit from the solid consumer housing backdrop even as a benefit of favorable weather at the start of the year normalizes. And as we survey the consumer, we're seeing similar things. Our most recent consumer sentiment survey revealed that favorable views around personal finances and home improvement spending are holding steady. Rising home prices  are motivating homeowners to invest in their homes. Admittedly, this trend will continue, as the survey reveal, a significant increase in future home value expectations. Likewise, we continuously home improvement spending outpace overall spending as well as positive home improvement project intentions. We will continue to focus on improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer and differentiating ourselves in better omnichannel customer experiences that make us the project authority in order to leverage the favorable home improvement backdrop. Our strategic framework, along with efforts to improve our productivity and profitability gives us confidence in our outlook in 2016. Thanks again for your interest.

We executed well in the first quarter, growing both average ticket and transactions. In addition to our success in Spring Black Friday events, we grow traffic through competitive offers designed to take advantage of early spring project demand, leveraging enhanced digital capabilities and improved marketing speed and flexibility to reach the spring customer earlier in the season. And as Robert shared with you, we delivered positive comps across all regions and product categories as we continue to capitalize on a favorable macro backdrop and consumers' increasing desires to invest in their homes. These favorable trends in home improvement, coupled with our compelling product offerings and strength in omnichannel retailing, contribute to a particularly strong performance in categories such as lumber and building materials, millwork, paint, lawn and garden and tools and hardware. We achieved double-digit comps in lumber and building materials, driven by a continued surge in outdoor construction projects coupled with stronger demand from the Pro customer. Millwork also benefited from this dynamic as outdoor projects drove strong performance than with those indoors. And as customers looked to improve and enjoy the outdoor living space, the outdoor experience we introduced in 2014 continued to pay dividends the wave enhanced advertising the comps in patio and outdoor fashions for yet another year. We also continue to see robust attachment of accessories as the showroom help customers in vision and great fear outdoor. Our targeted offers designed to capitalize on early spring drove demand high single-digit comps in lawn and garden category with particular strength in garden, live goods, sold and malts. Our experience was also a success, helping customers visualize their outdoor, lighting projects and making selection and installation easy while offering innovative technologies like LED. This project strip extended to inside the home as well as we also strong -- saw strong performance in interior project categories. 
Within fashion fixtures, we leverage our customer experience design capabilities to optimize our recent sets, showcasing and expanding collection of finishes and brands available both in-store and online, including the introduction of Kitchener and both home channel exclusives. Along with progress, we now offer the top 3 lighting brands in the industry, providing our customers with an exceptional array of options and styles. We combined our extended product offering with a simplified presentation, designs with the needs of the customers in mind. Proving lighting fixtures by style and collection to provide a cohesive decorating solution and simplified selection. Customers have responded well, driving double-digit comps in interior decor lining and chandeliers. And we're now of extending this approach to leverage our us up with as well as our private-label brand and sourcing capabilities. We saw mid-single-digit comps in appliances, flooring and kitchens, further demonstrating consumers' continued willingness to engage into new projects. Paint performed above the company average driven by strengths in both interior and exterior projects. Our paint lineup, which showcases Sherwin-Williams and PPG Olympic provides customers with the full suite of top brands they trust for the pains projects. Tools and hardware also benefited from increased project activity from both DIY and Pro customers. We were able to capitalize on this demand by improving our tool brand assortment with exclusives like Ptacek and -- the #1 and #2 brands in pneumatics and the extension of brands like Barnes along with our extensive private-label band of Kobalt tools. Whether working on indoor or outdoor projects, our omnichannel capabilities help customers achieve great results. Customers can engage with our associates in store for expert advice. Our content on those our contact center for ongoing support or for our project specialists will work in their homes. On Lowes.com, we have updated our online shopping experience with an enhanced private content and search functionality, improved additional tools such as 360-degree product views, improved video content and the continued expansion of click-to-check capabilities to better support the customers' digital experience. As a result, we continue to see positive response and very strong growth in our online channel. Our exterior and interior project specialists, dealing with customers in their homes to design, plan and complete their home improvement projects represent another critical element of our omnichannel strategy. Our exterior project specialists are available across all of U.S. home improvement stores and we're expanding our interior project specialist program reaching all U.S. stores by the end of this year. Our in-home sales program continues to outperform with above-average comp growth again this quarter. Our expertise in project inspiration, project design and project execution are setting us apart as the project authority in home improvement at a time where consumer continues to demonstrate a willingness to take home, home improvement projects. 
We continue to strengthen our Pro business, driving comps well above the company average by further advancing our product service offering to better serve the Pro customer. The only improvements in our tools offering we have also strengthened our portfolio 100 focus brand with the addition of roofing, Owens Corning insulation, Lennox, HVAC and interior builders. We continue to play feedback from Pro customers, our outside sales teams and store employees while working closely with our field-based merchandising managers to identify local market opportunities and brands to further optimize our offerings for the Pro. We have also advanced our omnichannel resources for the Pro. We continue to utilize feedback from our Pro customers and Pro services teams to enhance the features and functionally of our LowesForPros.com site for that we relaunched last year, making it easy for Pros to manage multiple properties and quickly purchase items nationwide. Thus far, we have been pleased with the program rollout given the positive customer response and early results which had exceeded our expectations. I know the critical element of our omnichannel offering for the Pro gives our account and Senator Pro services or AEP. AEPs work with larger regional customers to have them order and products across multiple geographies and locations. Our AEP's our key component of our strategy to grow our business with larger Pro customers. We currently have over 180 Pro outside representatives in the field and have experienced great success with the program with continued strong growth in AEP comp sales. Building on this success, we will continue to build the program, adding additional AEPs to continue capturing market opportunity with large Pro customers. We will also reach the Pro targeted marketing and special events such as credit events, both the states and spring appropriation days to drive awareness and generate new business. We have been pleased with these results in driving both incremental purchases with existing Pro customers and build new relationships with new customers. Our work to strengthen our portfolio of brands as well as expand our omni-channel offering through our growing Pro services team and our relaunch of LowesForPros.com are part of our broader commitment to build on a strong foundation of Pro. This foundation includes dedicated service in our stores, inventory debt aligned with the needs of the Pro including a 5% off everyday loyalty program for Pros using Lowe's --

Proprietary credit as well as reduced delivery rates. In addition to our efforts to drive topline growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. For the quarter, gross margin contracted as strong performance in lower margin category such as lumber and building materials led to a negative mix impact. And while we planned targeted promotions to capitalize on strong spring demand, the participation rate in those offers exceeded our expectations, which, together with markdowns associated with reset activity, led to a negative rate impact. Our stores once again effectively managed payroll hours on very strong comp sales growth, driving payroll experience leverage. They drove this leverage while achieving continued strong customer satisfaction scores. As you can see, we have a strong first quarter.

Looking at monthly trends, comps were 8.3% in February, 9.1% in March and 4.9% in April. Comps were stronger earlier in the quarter as we capitalized on favorable weather to drive above-plan comps. April sales were consistent with our plan coming into the quarter. Gross margin for the first quarter was 35.04% of sales, a decrease of 43 basis points from last year. The decrease in gross margin as a percent of sales was due to rate pressure as well as the mix of products sold. The rate pressure related to targeted promotions and markdowns associated with reset activity. SG&A was 22.28% of sales which leveraged 188 basis points. In anticipation of the RONA acquisition, we entered into a foreign currency hedge to lock in the purchase price in U.S. dollars. In the quarter, we recorded a $160 million unrealized gain, driving 105 basis points of expense leverage. Also, sold payroll leveraged 13 basis points as we continue to optimize our model. Utilities leveraged 11 basis points as a result of warmer weather relative to last year. Lastly, there were numerous other expenses that leverage between 5 and 10 basis points in Q1. Depreciation for the quarter was $357 million, which is 2.34% of sales and leveraged 25 basis points compared to last year's first quarter as a result of higher sales and assets becoming fully depreciated. Earnings before interest and taxes increased 170 basis points to 10.42% of sales. The unrealized gain on the FX hedged account for 105 basis points of the increase versus last year. Interest expense at $156 million recorder delevered 8 basis points to last year as total debt increased $4.1 billion versus the first quarter of 2015. We issued $3.3 billion of unsecured bonds in April. The transaction consisted of 3-, 10- and 30-year issuances with a weighted average interest rate of 2.72%. The proceeds will fund the RONA acquisition as well as refine current year maturities. Effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.2%. Earnings per share of $0.98 for the quarter represents a 40% increase over last year's $0.70. The $0.98 includes $0.11 related to the FX hedge gain. We exceeded our earnings plan for the quarter even without the gain. 
Now to a few items on the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $4.6 billion, the higher cash balance is a result of the April bond deal. Our inventory, the first quarter inventory balance of $11.1 billion increased $441 million or 4.2% over the same period last year. Inventory turn was 3.83x, an increase of 5 basis points over Q1 2015. 
Moving on to the liability section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable $8.8 billion increased $798 million or 10% over Q1 last year. The increase in accounts payable is due to the timing of purchases in the quarter versus last year and a 3-day improvement in days payable outstanding. At the end of the first quarter, adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.45x. The higher target leverage was result of the April bond deal. We expect to be back in line with our 2.25x target within 1 year of the RONA transaction closing. 
Return on invested capital increased 64 basis points for the quarter to 14.98%. The net impact of the noncash impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter related to the exit of our joint venture in Australia and FX hedge gain this quarter reduced ROIC by 145 basis points. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Operating cash flow was $3.2 billion. Capital expenditures were $208 million, resulting in free cash flow of $3 billion. Free cash flow was $766 million or 34.1% over the same period last year. In February, we entered into a $500 million in accelerated share repurchase agreement. We expect to receive approximately 6.8 billion shares, but the ultimate number of shares will be determined upon the completion of the program in the the second quarter. We also repurchased approximately 9.7 million shares for $700 million through the open market. In total, we repurchased $1.2 billion in the quarter. We have approximately $2.4 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. The remaining $53 million of share repurchases shared on the statement of cash flows related to shares withheld from employees to satisfy statutory tax before liabilities. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. First, as a reminder, fiscal 2016 will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for a total of 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the year. We estimated 53rd week would gain total sales by approximately 1.5% and earnings per share by $0.05 to $0.06. Second, while we have received shareholder approval and authorization from regulatory agencies, we have not closed on the RONA acquisition. As a result, our outlook excludes the impact of this transaction. Finally, while we did outperform our Q1 sales earnings plan, we continue to think about spring within the context of the first half of the year. We are confident in our plans and hope to sustain the momentum, but we're in the middle of the spring season and believe it is prudent to maintain our previously provided outlook. Now let's get into that outlook. As Robert noted, the forecast for home improvement industry remains positive. For 2016, we expect total sales increase for approximately 6%, driven by comp sales increase of 4%, the impact of the 53rd week and the opening of approximately 45 stores, which includes 20 locations and 12 stores in Canada. For ease of modeling, the EBIT growth rate excludes the impact of last year's Australian joint venture impairment charge and this year's FX hedge gain. We are anticipating an EBIT increase of 80 to 90 basis points. The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. For the year, on a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share of approximately $4.11 with the incremental $0.11 from our prior guide coming from the FX hedge gain. We are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5.4 billion. Our capital -- for 2016 is approximately $1.5 billion. This results in estimated free cash flow of $3.9 billion for 2016. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.5 billion share repurchases for 2016. The share repurchase assumption is not expected to be affected by the RONA acquisition. Regina, we are now ready for questions."

Comparable sales grew 7.3% in the first quarter, exceeding our expectations, driven by comp transaction growth of 5.1% and a 2.2% increase in average ticket. I'd like to thank our employees for their continued efforts in serving customers, which enabled our strong transaction growth. The team's project expertise and commitment to customer service allowed us to capitalize on the strong home improvement demand in the quarter. Healthy macro fundamentals, favorable weather and our compelling offers drove demand, resulting in strength in indoor as well as outdoor projects. In fact, we recorded positive comps in all 13 product categories, with particular strength in lumber and building materials, millwork, paint, lawn and garden and tools and hardware. Our emphasis on providing better omni-channel experiences positioned us well, enabling us to connect with customers and provide the advice and assistance they count on when completing their home improvement projects, whether they choose to connect in the store, online, in their home or through our contact centers. We're also pleased with the investments we've made to build deeper relationships with the Pro, as our Pro business performed well above the company average. The work we've done to enhance our product and service offering is allowing us to better serve this important customer segment, and we will continue to deepen those relationships. 
From a geographic perspective, our U.S. Home Improvement business achieved 7.5% comps for the quarter, with all 14 regions delivering positive comps, and we continued our strong performance in international markets, including double-digit comps in Canada in local currency. For the quarter, we generated 170 basis points of operating margin expansion. Included in the quarter's results is a $160 million unrealized gain on a foreign currency hedge entered into in advance of our pending RONA acquisition. Including this benefit, we delivered earnings per share of $0.98, a 40% increase over last year's first quarter. Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $1.2 billion of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $255 million in dividends. 
I'm also pleased with the progress of our previously announced acquisition of RONA. The transaction was approved by RONA's common shareholders in March. And last week, we received authorization from the Canadian regulatory agencies clearing the way for closing of the transaction this Friday. The time is right to fortify our Canadian market presence to take advantage of the significant long-term potential we see. We expect to build on the recent progress our team in Canada has made and the positive results RONA has achieved over recent years as a result of their restructuring efforts. 
Turning to the economic landscape for the balance of the year. The outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive. Persistent gains in the job market as well as disposable income growth is expected to outpace growth in the economy should contribute to solid growth in consumer spending, and housing remains a bright spot with home sales and construction activity posting healthy gains to start of the year, while home prices continued their steady upward trend. As a result, the home improvement industry should continue to benefit from the solid consumer housing backdrop even as the benefit of favorable weather at the start of the year normalizes. And as we survey the consumer, we're seeing similar things. Our most recent consumer sentiment survey revealed that favorable views around personal finances and home improvement spending are holding steady. Rising home prices are motivating homeowners to invest in their homes. Admittedly, that this trend will continue, as the survey reveal a significant increase in future home value expectations. Likewise, we continue to see home improvement spending outpace overall spending as well as positive home improvement project intentions. We will continue to focus on improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer and differentiate ourselves through better omni-channel customer experiences that make us the project authority in order to leverage the favorable home improvement backdrop. Our strategic framework, along with efforts to improve our productivity and profitability, give us confidence in our business outlook in 2016. Thanks, again, for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Rick."

We executed well in the first quarter, growing both average ticket and transactions. In addition to our successful Spring Black Friday events, we grow traffic through compelling offers designed to take advantage of early spring project demand, leveraging enhanced digital capabilities and improved marketing speed and flexibility to reach the spring customer earlier in the season. And as Robert shared with you, we delivered positive comps across all regions and product categories, as we continue to capitalize on a favorable macro backdrop and consumers' increasing desire to invest in their homes. These favorable trends in home improvement, coupled with our compelling product offering and strength in omni-channel retailing, contribute to a particularly strong performance in categories such as lumber and building materials, millwork, paint, lawn and garden and tools and hardware. We achieved double-digit comps in lumber and building materials, driven by a continued surge in outdoor construction projects coupled with stronger demand from the Pro customer. Millwork also benefited from this dynamic as outdoor projects drove strong performance in windows and doors. And as customers look to improve and enjoy their outdoor living space, the outdoor living experience we introduced in 2014 continued to pay dividends, deliver enhancing [indiscernible] comps in patio and outdoor fashions for yet another year. We also continue to see robust attachment of accessories as the showroom feel and created style help customers envision and create their outdoor space. Our targeted offers, in advance, designed to capitalize on early spring drove demand high single-digit comps in lawn and garden category with particular strength in garden pipelines, live goods, [indiscernible]. Our landscape lighting experience was also a success, helping customers visualize their outdoor living -- lighting projects and making selection and installation easy, while offering innovative technologies like LED. This project strip extended to inside the home as well as we also strong -- saw strong performance in interior project categories. 
Within fashion fixtures, we leveraged our customer experience design capabilities to optimize our recent lighting resets, showcasing an expanded collection of lighting styles, finishes and brands available both in-store and online, including the introduction of Kichler and [indiscernible] lighting, both home channel exclusives. Along with Progress Lighting, we now offer the top 3 lighting brands in the industry, providing our customers with an exceptional array of options and styles. We combined our extended product offering with a simplified presentation, designs with the needs of the customer in mind [indiscernible] lighting fixtures by style and collection to provide a cohesive decorating solution and simplify selection. Customers have responded well, driving double-digit comps in interior decor lighting and chandeliers. And we're now extending this approach to ceiling trends to leverage our relationship with Hunter Fans as well as our private-label brand and sourcing capabilities. We saw mid-single-digit comps in appliances, flooring and kitchens, further demonstrating the consumers' continued willingness to engage in interior projects. Paint performed above the company average, driven by strength in both interior and exterior projects. Our paint lineup, which showcases Valspar, Sherwin-Williams and PPG/Olympic, provides customers with a full suite of top brands they trust for the paint projects. Tools and hardware also benefited from the increased project activity from both DIY and Pro customers. We were able to capitalize on this demand by improving our tool brand assortment with exclusives like Hitachi and Bostitch, the #1 and #2 brands in pneumatics and the extension of brands like Bon [ph] along with our extensive private-label line of Kobalt tools. Whether working on indoor or outdoor projects, our omni-channel capabilities help customers achieve great results. Customers can engage with our associates in-store for expert advice, our content on lowe's.com for inspiration, our contact center for ongoing support, or project specialists who work with them in their homes. On lowes.com, we have upgraded our online shopping experience with enhanced product content and search functionality, improved additional tools such as 360-degree product views, improved video content and the continued expansion of click-to-check capabilities to better support the customers' digital experience. As a result, we continue to see positive customer response and very strong growth in our online channel. Our exterior and interior project specialists, dealing with customers in their homes to design, plan and complete their home improvement projects, represent another critical element of our omni-channel strategy. Our exterior project specialists are available across all of U.S. home improvement stores, and we're expanding our interior project specialist program reaching all U.S. stores by the end of this year. Our in-home sales program continues to outperform with above-average comp growth again this quarter. Our expertise in project inspiration, project design and project execution are setting us apart as the project authority in home improvement at a time when the consumer continues to demonstrate a willingness to take on home improvement projects. 
We continue to strengthen our Pro business, driving comps well above the company average by further advancing our product and service offering to better serve the Pro customer. Beyond improvements in our tools offering, we have also strengthened our portfolio of Pro focus brands with the addition of GAF roofing, Owens Corning insulation, Lennox HVAC and Masonite entry in their interior doors. We continue to play feedback from Pro customers, our outside sales teams and store employees, while working closely with our field-based merchandising managers to identify local market opportunities and brands to further optimize our offerings for the Pro. We have also advanced our omni-channel resources for the Pro. We continue to utilize feedback from our Pro customers and Pro services teams to enhance the features and functionally of our LowesForPros.com site that we relaunched last year, making it easy for Pros to manage multiple properties and quickly purchase items nationwide. Thus far, we have been pleased with the program rollout given the positive customer response and early results, which have exceeded our expectations. Another critical element of our omni-channel offering for the Pro customer is our account executive Pro services or AEPs. AEPs work with larger regional customers to help them order [indiscernible] products across multiple geographies and locations. Our AEPs are key component of our strategy to grow our business with larger Pro customers. We currently have over 180 Pro outside representatives in the field and have experienced great success with the program with continued strong growth in AEP comp sales. Building on this success, we will continue to grow the program, adding additional AEPs to continue capturing market opportunity with large Pro customers. We are also reaching out the Pro to targeted marketing and special events such as credit events, bonus states and spring appropriation days to drive awareness and generate new business. We have been pleased with these results in driving both incremental purchases with existing Pro customers and build new relationships with new customers. Our work to strengthen our portfolio of brands as well as expand our omni-channel offering through our growing Pro services team and our relaunch of LowesForPros.com are part of our broader commitment to build on a strong foundation with Pro. This foundation includes dedicated service in our stores, inventory debt aligned with the needs of the Pro, including a 5% off everyday loyalty program for Pros using Lowe's proprietary credit as well as reduced delivery rates. In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. For the quarter, gross margin contracted as strong performance in lower margin category, such as lumber and building materials, led to a negative mix impact. And while we plan targeted promotions to capitalize on strong spring demand, the participation rate in those offers exceeded our expectations, which, together with markdowns associated with reset activity, led to a negative rate impact. Our stores once again effectively managed payroll hours on very strong comp sales growth, driving payroll experienced leverage. They drove this leverage, while achieving continued strong customer satisfaction scores. As you can see, we have a strong first quarter. We continue to make progress on our initiatives to drive top line growth and are focused on improving productivity and profitability. We look forward to sharing further progress with you over the course of the year. Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob."

Total transaction count increased 5.5% and average ticket increased 2.2% to $68.08. Comp sales increased 7.3%, driven by comp trends -- transaction decreased 5.1% and average ticket growth of 2.2%. Looking at monthly trends, comps were 8.3% in February, 9.1% in March and 4.9% in April. Comps were stronger earlier in the quarter, as we capitalized on favorable weather to drive above-plan comps. April sales were consistent with our plan coming into the quarter. Gross margin for the first quarter was 35.04% of sales, a decrease of 43 basis points from last year. The decrease in gross margin as a percent of sales was due to rate pressure as well as the mix of products sold. The rate pressure related to targeted promotions and markdowns associated with reset activity. SG&A was 22.28% of sales, which leveraged 188 basis points. In anticipation of the RONA acquisition, we entered into a foreign currency hedge to lock in the purchase price in U.S. dollars. In the quarter, we recorded a $160 million unrealized gain, driving 105 basis points of expense leverage. Also, [indiscernible] payroll leveraged 13 basis points as we continue to optimize our staffing model. Utilities leveraged 11 basis points as a result of warmer weather relative to last year. Lastly, there were numerous other expenses that leveraged between 5 and 10 basis points in Q1. Depreciation for the quarter was $357 million, which is 2.34% of sales and leveraged 25 basis points compared to last year's first quarter as a result of higher sales and assets becoming fully depreciated. Earnings before interest and taxes increased 170 basis points to 10.42% of sales. The unrealized gain on the FX hedge accounts for 105 basis points of the increase versus last year. Interest expense at $156 million for the quarter delevered 8 basis points to last year as total debt increased $4.1 billion versus the first quarter of 2015. We issued $3.3 billion of unsecured bonds in April. The transaction consisted of 3-, 10- and 30-year issuances with a weighted average interest rate of 2.72%. The proceeds will fund the RONA acquisition as well as refines current year maturities. Effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.2%. Earnings per share of $0.98 for the quarter represents a 40% increase over last year's $0.70. The $0.98 includes $0.11 related to the FX hedge gain. We exceeded our earnings plan for the quarter even without the gain. 
Now to a few items on the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $4.6 billion. The higher cash balance is a result of the April bond deal. Our inventory -- first quarter inventory balance of $11.1 billion, increased $441 million, or 4.2% over the same period last year. Inventory turnover was 3.83x, an increase of 5 basis points over Q1 2015. 
Moving on to the liability section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable $8.8 billion, increased $798 million, or 10% over Q1 last year. The increase in accounts payable is due to the timing of purchases in the quarter versus last year and a 3-day improvement in days payable outstanding. At the end of the first quarter, lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.45x. The higher target leverage was result of the April bond deal. We expect to be back in line with our 2.25x target within 1 year of the RONA transaction closing. 
Return on invested capital increased 64 basis points for the quarter to 14.98%. The net impact of the non-cash impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter related to the exit of our joint venture in Australia and FX hedge gain this quarter reduced ROIC by 145 basis points. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Operating cash flow was $3.2 billion. Capital expenditures were $208 million, resulting in free cash flow of $3 billion. Free cash flow was $766 million, or 34.1% over the same period last year. In February, we entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. We expect to receive approximately 6.8 billion shares, but the ultimate number of shares will be determined upon the completion of the program in the second quarter. We also repurchased approximately 9.7 million shares for $700 million through the open market. In total, we repurchased $1.2 billion in the quarter. We have approximately $2.4 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. The remaining $53 million of share repurchases showed on the statement of cash flows relates to the shares withheld from employees to satisfy statutory tax withholding liabilities. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. First, as a reminder, fiscal 2016 will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for a total of 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the year. We estimate that 53rd week would aid total sales by approximately 1.5% and earnings per share by $0.05 to $0.06. Second, while we have received shareholder approval and authorization from regulatory agencies, we have not closed on the RONA acquisition. As a result, our outlook excludes the impact of this transaction. Finally, while we did outperform our Q1 sales earnings plan, we continue to think about spring within the context of the first half of the year. We are confident in our plans and hope to sustain the momentum, but we're in the middle of the spring season and believe it's prudent to maintain our previously provided outlook. Now let's get into that outlook. As Robert noted, the forecast for home improvement industry remains positive. For 2016, we expect total sales increase of approximately 6%, driven by comp sales increase of 4%, the impact of the 53rd week and the opening of approximately 45 stores, which includes 20 offshore locations and 12 stores in Canada. For ease of modeling, the EBIT growth rate excludes the impact of last year's Australian joint venture impairment charge and this year's FX hedge gain. We are anticipating an EBIT increase of 80 to 90 basis points. The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. For the year, on a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share of approximately $4.11 with the incremental $0.11 from our prior guide coming from the FX hedge gain. We are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5.4 billion. Our capital expenditure for 2016 is approximately $1.5 billion. This results in estimated free cash flow of $3.9 billion for 2016. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.5 billion in share repurchases for 2016. The share repurchase assumption is not expected to be affected by the RONA acquisition. Regina, we are now ready for questions."

So I was looking for more color on that, but okay, understood. Another question, you did keep the 80 to 90 basis point guidance for the year on the margins, which means for every comp point above 1%, you're going to look for between 27 and 30 basis points improvement. You're obviously below that here. So is the reason that you didn't change that is it what you said earlier about not changing the comp was it just too early in the year? Or are there specific reasons to believe the flow-through will be not only better than it was in the first quarter, but better than that 27 to 30, typical rule of thumb?"

We talked about some gross margin pressure in the first quarter that will continue. So we certainly take that into account. However, we do feel even better we did 90 days ago about our ability to continue to drive expensive productivity and leverage, which gives us confidence in the outlook to the extent sales are better and so that's driven by lumber and building materials categories that flow-through might be closer to 25 basis points.

So we continue to turn not to pull leverage to maximize the effectiveness there. Taking a step back, Eric, as we think about gross margin, we do expect some modest gross margin improvement annually. As we think about gross margin, it's probably not going to be 2017 to actually eclipse the gross margin rate we had in 2010. So it's not like we're forming new ground and looking for gross margin peaks that have never occurred before.

We continue to drive labor efficiency in the supply chains through utilization of Lean Six Sigma practices and processes and making sure that we are able to get the effective use of tubing out the trailers and the trucks to move forward.

Comparable sales grew 7.3% in the first quarter, exceeding our expectations, driven by comp transaction growth of 5.1% and a 2.2% increase in average ticket. I'd like to thank our employees for their continued efforts in serving customers, which enabled our strong transaction growth. The team's project expertise and commitment to customer service allowed us to capitalize on the strong home improvement demand in the quarter. Healthy macro fundamentals, favorable weather and our compelling offers drove demand, resulting in strength in indoor as well as outdoor projects. In fact, we recorded positive comps in all 13 product categories, with particular strength in lumber and building materials, millwork, paint, lawn and garden and tools and hardware. Our emphasis on providing better omni-channel experiences positioned us well, enabling us to connect with customers and provide the advice and assistance they count on when completing their home improvement projects, whether they choose to connect in the store, online, in their home or through our contact centers. We're also pleased with the investments we've made to build deeper relationships with the Pro, as our Pro business performed well above the company average. The work we've done to enhance our product and service offering is allowing us to better serve this important customer segment, and we will continue to deepen those relationships. 
From a geographic perspective, our U.S. Home Improvement business achieved 7.5% comps for the quarter, with all 14 regions delivering positive comps, and we continued our strong performance in international markets, including double-digit comps in Canada in local currency. For the quarter, we generated 170 basis points of operating margin expansion. Included in the quarter's results is a $160 million unrealized gain on a foreign currency hedge entered into in advance of our pending RONA acquisition. Including this benefit, we delivered earnings per share of $0.98, a 40% increase over last year's first quarter. Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $1.2 billion of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $255 million in dividends. 
I'm also pleased with the progress of our previously announced acquisition of RONA. The transaction was approved by RONA's common shareholders in March. And last week, we received authorization from the Canadian regulatory agencies clearing the way for closing on the transaction this Friday. The time is right to fortify our Canadian market presence to take advantage of the significant long-term potential we see. We expect to build on the recent progress our team in Canada has made and the positive results RONA has achieved over recent years as a result of their restructuring efforts. 
Turning to the economic landscape for the balance of the year. The outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive. Persistent gains in the job market as well as disposable income growth is expected to outpace growth in the economy, should contribute to solid growth in consumer spending, and housing remains a bright spot with home sales and construction activity posting healthy gains to start the year, while home prices continue their steady upward trend. As a result, the home improvement industry should continue to benefit from the solid consumer housing backdrop even as the benefit of favorable weather at the start of the year normalizes. And as we survey the consumer, we're seeing similar things. Our most recent consumer sentiment survey revealed that favorable views around personal finances and home improvement spending are holding steady. Rising home prices are motivating homeowners to invest in their homes. Admittedly, that this trend will continue, as the survey reveal a significant increase in future home value expectations. Likewise, we continue to see home improvement spending outpace overall spending as well as positive home improvement project intentions. We will continue to focus on improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer and differentiate ourselves through better omni-channel customer experiences that make us the project authority in order to leverage the favorable home improvement backdrop. Our strategic framework, along with efforts to improve our productivity and profitability, give us confidence in our business outlook for 2016. Thanks again for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Rick."

We executed well in the first quarter, growing both average ticket and transactions.

We executed well in the first quarter, growing both average ticket and transactions. In addition to our successful Spring Black Friday events, we grow traffic through compelling offers designed to take advantage of early spring project demand, leveraging enhanced digital capabilities and improved marketing speed and flexibility to reach the spring customer earlier in the season. And as Robert shared with you, we delivered positive comps across all regions and product categories, as we continue to capitalize on a favorable macro backdrop and consumers' increasing desire to invest in their homes. These favorable trends in home improvement, coupled with our compelling product offering and strength in omni-channel retailing, contribute to a particularly strong performance in categories such as lumber and building materials, millwork, paint, lawn and garden and tools and hardware. We achieved double-digit comps in lumber and building materials, driven by a continued surge in outdoor construction projects coupled with stronger demand from the Pro customer. Millwork also benefited from this dynamic as outdoor projects drove strong performance in windows and doors. And as customers look to improve and enjoy their outdoor living space, the outdoor living experience we introduced in 2014 continued to pay dividends, deliver high single-digit comps in patio and outdoor fashions for yet another year. We also continue to see robust attachment of accessories as the showroom feel and created style help customers envision and create their outdoor space. Our targeted offers, in advance, designed to capitalize on early spring drove demand high single-digit comps in lawn and garden category with particular strength in garden pipelines, live goods, soil and mulch. Our landscape lighting experience was also a success, helping customers visualize their outdoor living -- lighting projects and making selection and installation easy, while offering innovative technologies like LED. This project strip extended to inside the home as well as we also strong -- saw strong performance in interior project categories. 
Within fashion fixtures, we leveraged our customer experience design capabilities to optimize our recent lighting resets, showcasing an expanded collection of lighting styles, finishes and brands available both in-store and online, including the introduction of Kichler and Koesell [ph] lighting, both Home Channel exclusives. Along with Progress Lighting, we now offer the top 3 lighting brands in the industry, providing our customers with an exceptional array of options and styles. We combined our extended product offering with a simplified presentation, designs with the needs of the customer in mind, grouping lighting fixtures by style and collection to provide a cohesive decorating solution and simplify selection. Customers have responded well, driving double-digit comps in interior decor lighting and chandeliers. And we're now extending this approach to ceiling trends to leverage our relationship with Hunter Fans as well as our private-label brand and sourcing capabilities. We saw mid-single-digit comps in appliances, flooring and kitchens, further demonstrating the consumers' continued willingness to engage in interior projects. Paint performed above the company average, driven by strength in both interior and exterior projects. Our paint lineup, which showcases Valspar, Sherwin-Williams and PPG/Olympic, provides customers with a full suite of top brands they trust for the paint projects. Tools and hardware also benefited from the increased project activity from both DIY and Pro customers. We were able to capitalize on this demand by improving our tool brand assortment with exclusives like Hitachi and Bostitch, the #1 and #2 brands in pneumatics and the extension of brands like Bon [ph] along with our extensive private-label line of Kobalt tools. Whether working on indoor or outdoor projects, our omni-channel capabilities help customers achieve great results. Customers can engage with our associates in-store for expert advice, our content on lowe's.com for inspiration, our contact center for ongoing support, or our project specialists who work with them in their homes. On lowes.com, we have upgraded our online shopping experience with enhanced product content and search functionality, improved additional tools such as 360-degree product views, improved video content and the continued expansion of click-to-check capabilities to better support the customers' digital experience. As a result, we continue to see positive customer response and very strong growth in our online channel. Our exterior and interior project specialists, dealing with customers in their homes to design, plan and complete their home improvement projects, represent another critical element of our omni-channel strategy. Our exterior project specialists are available across all of U.S. home improvement stores, and we're expanding our interior project specialist program reaching all U.S. stores by the end of this year. Our in-home sales program continues to outperform with above-average comp growth again this quarter. Our expertise in project inspiration, project design and project execution are setting us apart as the project authority in home improvement at a time when the consumer continues to demonstrate a willingness to take on home improvement projects. 
We continue to strengthen our Pro business, driving comps well above the company average by further advancing our product and service offering to better serve the Pro customer. Beyond improvements in our tools offering, we have also strengthened our portfolio of Pro focus brands with the addition of GAF roofing, Owens Corning insulation, LENOX HVAC and Masonite entry and their interior doors. We continue to play feedback from Pro customers, our outside sales team and store employees, while working closely with our field-based merchandising managers to identify local market opportunities and brands to further optimize our offering for the Pro. We have also advanced our omni-channel resources for the Pro. We continue to utilize feedback from our Pro customers and Pro services team to enhance the features and functionality of our LowesForPros.com site that we relaunched last year, making it easy for Pros to manage multiple properties and quickly purchase items nationwide. Thus far, we have been pleased with the program rollout given the positive customer response and early results, which have exceeded our expectations. Another critical element of our omni-channel offering for the Pro customer is our account executive Pro services or AEPs. AEPs work with larger regional customers to help them order and replenish products across multiple geographies and locations. Our AEPs are a key component of our strategy to grow our business with larger Pro customers. We currently have over 180 Pro outside representatives in the field and have experienced great success with the program with continued strong growth in AEP comp sales. Building on this success, we will continue to grow the program, adding additional AEPs to continue capturing market opportunity with large Pro customers. We are also reaching out to the Pros through targeted marketing and special events such as credit events, bonus days and Spring Pro Appreciation days to drive awareness and generate new business. We have been pleased with these results in driving both incremental purchases with existing Pro customers and building relationships with new customers. Our work to strengthen our portfolio of brands as well as expand our omni-channel offering through our growing Pro services team and our relaunch of LowesForPros.com are part of our broader commitment to build on a strong foundation with the Pro. This foundation includes dedicated service in our stores, inventory depth aligned with the needs of the Pro, including a 5% off everyday loyalty program for Pros using Lowe's proprietary credit as well as reduced delivery rates. In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. For the quarter, gross margin contracted as strong performance in lower margin category, such as lumber and building materials, led to a negative mix impact. And while we plan targeted promotions to capitalize on strong spring demand, the participation rate in those offers exceeded our expectations, which, together with markdowns associated with reset activity, led to a negative rate impact. Our stores once again effectively managed payroll hours on very strong comp sales growth, driving payroll expense leverage. They drove this leverage while achieving continued strong customer satisfaction scores. As you can see, we had a strong first quarter. We continue to make progress on our initiatives to drive top line growth and are focused on improving productivity and profitability. We look forward to sharing further progress with you over the course of the year. Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob."

Total transaction count increased 5.5% and average ticket increased 2.2% to $68.08. Comp sales increased 7.3%, driven by comp trends -- transaction decreased 5.1% and average ticket growth of 2.2%. Looking at monthly trends, comps were 8.3% in February, 9.1% in March and 4.9% in April. Comps were stronger earlier in the quarter, as we capitalized on favorable weather to drive above-plan comps. April sales were consistent with our plan coming into the quarter. Gross margin for the first quarter was 35.04% of sales, a decrease of 43 basis points from last year. The decrease in gross margin as a percent of sales was due to rate pressure as well as the mix of products sold. The rate pressure related to targeted promotions and markdowns associated with reset activity. SG&A was 22.28% of sales, which leveraged 188 basis points. In anticipation of the RONA acquisition, we entered into a foreign currency hedge to lock in the purchase price in U.S. dollars. In the quarter, we recorded a $160 million unrealized gain, driving 105 basis points of expense leverage. Also, store payroll leveraged 13 basis points as we continue to optimize our staffing model. Utilities leveraged 11 basis points as a result of warmer weather relative to last year. Lastly, there were numerous other expenses that leveraged between 5 and 10 basis points in Q1. Depreciation for the quarter was $357 million, which is 2.34% of sales and leveraged 25 basis points compared to last year's first quarter as a result of higher sales and assets becoming fully depreciated. Earnings before interest and taxes increased 170 basis points to 10.42% of sales. The unrealized gain on the FX hedge accounts for 105 basis points of the increase versus last year. Interest expense at $156 million for the quarter delevered 8 basis points to last year as total debt increased $4.1 billion versus the first quarter of 2015. We issued $3.3 billion of unsecured bonds in April. The transaction consisted of 3-, 10- and 30-year issuances with a weighted average interest rate of 2.72%. The proceeds will fund the RONA acquisition as well as refines current year maturities. Effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.2%. Earnings per share of $0.98 for the quarter represents a 40% increase over last year's $0.70. The $0.98 includes $0.11 related to the FX hedge gain. We exceeded our earnings plan for the quarter even without the gain. 
Now to a few items on the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $4.6 billion. The higher cash balance is a result of the April bond deal. Our inventory -- first quarter inventory balance of $11.1 billion, increased $441 million, or 4.2% over the same period last year. Inventory turnover was 3.83x, an increase of 5 basis points over Q1 2015. 
Moving on to the liability section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable, $8.8 billion, increased $798 million, or 10% over Q1 last year. The increase in accounts payable is due to the timing of purchases in the quarter versus last year and a 3-day improvement in days payable outstanding. At the end of the first quarter, lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.45x. The higher target leverage was the result of the April bond deal. We expect to be back in line with our 2.25x target within 1 year of the RONA transaction closing. 
Return on invested capital increased 64 basis points for the quarter to 14.98%. The net impact of the non-cash impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter related to the exit of our joint venture in Australia and FX hedge gain this quarter reduced ROIC by 145 basis points. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Operating cash flow was $3.2 billion. Capital expenditures were $208 million, resulting in free cash flow of $3 billion. Free cash flow was $766 million, or 34.1% over the same period last year. In February, we entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. We expect to receive approximately 6.8 billion shares, but the ultimate number of shares will be determined upon the completion of the program in the second quarter. We also repurchased approximately 9.7 million shares for $700 million through the open market. In total, we repurchased $1.2 billion in the quarter. We have approximately $2.4 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. The remaining $53 million of share repurchases showed on the statement of cash flows relates to the shares withheld from employees to satisfy statutory tax withholding liabilities. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. First, as a reminder, fiscal 2016 will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for a total of 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the year. We estimate that the 53rd week will aid total sales by approximately 1.5% and earnings per share by $0.05 to $0.06. Second, while we have received shareholder approval and authorization from regulatory agencies, we have not closed on the RONA acquisition. As a result, our outlook excludes the impact of this transaction. Finally, while we did outperform our Q1 sales and earnings plan, we continue to think about spring within the context of the first half of the year. We are confident in our plans and hope to sustain a momentum, but we are in the middle of the spring season and believe it's prudent to maintain our previously provided outlook. Now let's get into that outlook. As Robert noted, the forecast for home improvement industry remains positive. For 2016, we expect total sales to increase of approximately 6%, driven by a comp sales increase of 4%, the impact of the 53rd week and the opening of approximately 45 stores, which includes 20 offshore locations and 12 stores in Canada. For ease of modeling, the EBIT growth rate excludes the impact of last year's Australian joint venture impairment charge and this year's FX hedge gain. We are anticipating an EBIT increase of 80 to 90 basis points. The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. For the year, on a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share of approximately $4.11 with the incremental $0.11 from our prior guide coming from the FX hedge gain. We are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5.4 billion. Our capital plans for 2016 is approximately $1.5 billion. This results in estimated free cash flow of $3.9 billion for 2016. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.5 billion in share repurchases for 2016. The share repurchase assumption is not expected to be affected by the RONA acquisition. Regina, we are now ready for questions."

The customers' activity was stronger than we anticipated, which is certainly a good thing and kudos to the team for identifying the items that resonate with customers. Second, we expected the impact from the reset to be able to more balance Q1 and Q2. We had good sell-through on the recent activity, therefore the impact was more pronounced in the first quarter. As I mentioned, that kind of clears the deck Q2 going forward. And then lastly, the mix pressure was little higher than we anticipated based on the strong demand in lumber and building materials. As it relates to the flow-through, so the lower-than-anticipated flow-through is almost entirely attributable to the declining gross margin versus plan again based on the factors I just described."

As I outlined in my comments, as we've seen the consumers, we look through our consumer sentiment survey, what their intentions are around spending, what their intentions are around investing in the home, as we're seeing continual improvement in the job market, we're seeing continuing improvement in wages. We're seeing continued improvement in home values is driving continued improvements in their intentions for discretionary spending, which I think the best evidence of that is in the top 1% increase that we saw in top transactions during the quarter. And nothing that we've seen in our segment surveys has led us to believe that the consumer, when we ask them how do you feel 6 months out with regard to purchases, nothing shows any change in their intentions as we survey them today. So that, I think, is why as Bob took you through strong first quarter, we are aware of what others are saying out there with regard to the consumer. But when we take our strong first quarter performance and what we're hearing from the consumer home survey, gives us confidence in reiterating our guidance for the year that Bob has taken you through."

First, let me just talk about where we focused our promotions and a little bit about how we went about it first quarter. We are more focused on lawn and garden seasonal living, tools and hardware, major appliances and interior projects, because we thought those would be the types of products and projects the consumers' mindset will be geared towards. So we leveraged our sales and operation planning process. And what's important about this process is it allows us to have a better sense on the micro seasons that apply to the consumers' mindset, so that we hit the consumer with the right promotion at the right time. We're much faster in being able to flex our promotions in our digital assets because it's one of the investments that we made in our digital capabilities and what we saw was a higher take rate. And as Bob said earlier, that's certainly a good thing. Our flexible supply chain allows us to make adjustments to where the consumer is making purchases and ensure that we don't disappoint them by not having product. But I wouldn't say that the intensity and depth of promotion was greater. What I would say is that our execution around promotions continues to get better.

When we look at Q1, we saw significant growth in new registered Pros on the site as well as conversion in growth as a percent of total dot-com business. So we feel great about what we're seeing. We continue to improve the functionality of the site through feedback from our customers and our sales teams to make it more conducive and easier for the customers to navigate. The other thing I would say as we continue to look at the site is to keep in mind the functionalities that it did provide that we did not have the capabilities of before. So the Pros, for example, we're not capable of using their in-house credit. They can now. Pros did not receive their 5% val prop usage on prior lowes.com, they can today. Tax-exempt accounts weren't available to them prior usage, but they are today. So all of those things are resonating extremely well, and we continue to work on making the site more effective, more efficient. But to date, we've been extremely pleased with what we've seen both from a risk reducer content as well as sales performance."

The aspect of the supply chain has been a significant advantage for us for years, as we talk about how we build out supply chain and the avenues that we have. I think as we look at the omni-channel environment over the last several years, we've enabled several new functions to the supply chain to allow us to continue to meet that demand, flexible fulfillment, which allows us to shift from a store group as well as our RDC. So we're able to meet 94% of our customer demand with next-day shipping rates by utilizing that flexibility within the system. We continue to maximize the productivity of the supply chain through new initiatives, such as project rhythm, which we work with vendors in smoothing out orders and order flow to make sure that we are as effective as possible. We continue to drive labor efficiency in the supply chain through utilization of Lean Six Sigma practices and processes and making sure that we are able to get the effective use of tubing out to trailers and the trucks to move forward. Fleet and fuel costs continues to be an advantage in the tailwind currently. So we continue to see those avenues play-in significant dividends for us over the next several months, and quite frankly, the next couple of years. As we look into the construction of possibly the Internet Fulfillment Center, or DFC, Direct-to-Customer Fulfillment Center, which we have currently plans underway and being built out for -- by forecasted opening in the 2018 time horizon."

Comparable sales grew 7.3% in the first quarter, exceeding our expectations, driven by comp transaction growth of 5.1% and a 2.2% increase in average ticket. I'd like to thank our employees for their continued efforts in serving customers, which enabled our strong transaction growth. The team's project expertise and commitment to customer service allowed us to capitalize on the strong home improvement demand in the quarter. Healthy macro fundamentals, favorable weather and our compelling offers drove demand, resulting in strength in indoor as well as outdoor projects. In fact, we recorded positive comps in all 13 product categories, with particular strength in lumber and building materials, millwork, paint, lawn and garden and tools and hardware. Our emphasis on providing better omni-channel experiences positioned us well, enabling us to connect with customers and provide the advice and assistance they count on when completing their home improvement projects, whether they choose to connect in the store, online, in their home or through our contact centers. We're also pleased with the investments we've made to build deeper relationships with the Pro, as our Pro business performed well above the company average. The work we've done to enhance our product and service offering is allowing us to better serve this important customer segment, and we will continue to deepen those relationships. 
From a geographic perspective, our U.S. Home Improvement business achieved 7.5% comps for the quarter, with all 14 regions delivering positive comps, and we continued our strong performance in international markets, including double-digit comps in Canada in local currency. For the quarter, we generated 170 basis points of operating margin expansion. Included in the quarter's results is a $160 million unrealized gain on a foreign currency hedge entered into in advance of our pending RONA acquisition. Including this benefit, we delivered earnings per share of $0.98, a 40% increase over last year's first quarter. Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $1.2 billion of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $255 million in dividends. 
I'm also pleased with the progress of our previously announced acquisition of RONA. The transaction was approved by RONA's common shareholders in March. And last week, we received authorization from the Canadian regulatory agencies clearing the way for closing on the transaction this Friday. The time is right to fortify our Canadian market presence to take advantage of the significant long-term potential we see. We expect to build on the recent progress our team in Canada has made and the positive results RONA has achieved over recent years as a result of their restructuring efforts. 
Turning to the economic landscape for the balance of the year. The outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive. Persistent gains in the job market as well as disposable income growth is expected to outpace growth in the economy, should contribute to solid growth in consumer spending, and housing remains a bright spot with home sales and construction activity posting healthy gains to start the year, while home prices continue their steady upward trend. As a result, the home improvement industry should continue to benefit from the solid consumer housing backdrop even as the benefit of favorable weather at the start of the year normalizes. And as we survey the consumer, we're seeing similar things. Our most recent consumer sentiment survey revealed that favorable views around personal finances and home improvement spending are holding steady. Rising home prices are motivating homeowners to invest in their homes. Admittedly, that this trend will continue, as the survey reveal a significant increase in future home value expectations. Likewise, we continue to see home improvement spending outpace overall spending as well as positive home improvement project intentions. We will continue to focus on improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer and differentiate ourselves through better omni-channel customer experiences that make us the project authority in order to leverage the favorable home improvement backdrop. Our strategic framework, along with efforts to improve our productivity and profitability, give us confidence in our business outlook for 2016. Thanks again for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Rick."

We executed well in the first quarter, growing both average ticket and transactions. In addition to our successful Spring Black Friday events, we grow traffic through compelling offers designed to take advantage of early spring project demand, leveraging enhanced digital capabilities and improved marketing speed and flexibility to reach the spring customer earlier in the season. And as Robert shared with you, we delivered positive comps across all regions and product categories, as we continue to capitalize on a favorable macro backdrop and consumers' increasing desire to invest in their homes. These favorable trends in home improvement, coupled with our compelling product offering and strength in omni-channel retailing, contribute to a particularly strong performance in categories such as lumber and building materials, millwork, paint, lawn and garden and tools and hardware. We achieved double-digit comps in lumber and building materials, driven by a continued surge in outdoor construction projects coupled with stronger demand from the Pro customer. Millwork also benefited from this dynamic as outdoor projects drove strong performance in windows and doors. And as customers look to improve and enjoy their outdoor living space, the outdoor living experience we introduced in 2014 continued to pay dividends, deliver high single-digit comps in patio and outdoor fashions for yet another year. We also continue to see robust attachment of accessories as the showroom feel and created style help customers envision and create their outdoor space. Our targeted offers, in advance, designed to capitalize on early spring drove demand high single-digit comps in lawn and garden category with particular strength in garden pipelines, live goods, soil and mulch. Our landscape lighting experience was also a success, helping customers visualize their outdoor living -- lighting projects and making selection and installation easy, while offering innovative technologies like LED. This project strip extended to inside the home as well as we also strong -- saw strong performance in interior project categories. 
Within fashion fixtures, we leveraged our customer experience design capabilities to optimize our recent lighting resets, showcasing an expanded collection of lighting styles, finishes and brands available both in-store and online, including the introduction of Kichler and Koesell [ph] lighting, both Home Channel exclusives. Along with Progress Lighting, we now offer the top 3 lighting brands in the industry, providing our customers with an exceptional array of options and styles. We combined our extended product offering with a simplified presentation, designs with the needs of the customer in mind, grouping lighting fixtures by style and collection to provide a cohesive decorating solution and simplify selection. Customers have responded well, driving double-digit comps in interior decor lighting and chandeliers. And we're now extending this approach to ceiling trends to leverage our relationship with Hunter Fans as well as our private-label brand and sourcing capabilities. We saw mid-single-digit comps in appliances, flooring and kitchens, further demonstrating the consumers' continued willingness to engage in interior projects. Paint performed above the company average, driven by strength in both interior and exterior projects. Our paint lineup, which showcases Valspar, Sherwin-Williams and PPG/Olympic, provides customers with a full suite of top brands they trust for the paint projects. Tools and hardware also benefited from the increased project activity from both DIY and Pro customers. We were able to capitalize on this demand by improving our tool brand assortment with exclusives like Hitachi and Bostitch, the #1 and #2 brands in pneumatics and the extension of brands like Bon [ph] along with our extensive private-label line of Kobalt tools. Whether working on indoor or outdoor projects, our omni-channel capabilities help customers achieve great results. Customers can engage with our associates in-store for expert advice, our content on lowe's.com for inspiration, our contact center for ongoing support, or our project specialists who work with them in their homes. On lowes.com, we have upgraded our online shopping experience with enhanced product content and search functionality, improved additional tools such as 360-degree product views, improved video content and the continued expansion of click-to-check capabilities to better support the customers' digital experience. As a result, we continue to see positive customer response and very strong growth in our online channel. Our exterior and interior project specialists, dealing with customers in their homes to design, plan and complete their home improvement projects, represent another critical element of our omni-channel strategy. Our exterior project specialists are available across all of U.S. home improvement stores, and we're expanding our interior project specialist program reaching all U.S. stores by the end of this year. Our in-home sales program continues to outperform with above-average comp growth again this quarter. Our expertise in project inspiration, project design and project execution are setting us apart as the project authority in home improvement at a time when the consumer continues to demonstrate a willingness to take on home improvement projects. 
We continue to strengthen our Pro business, driving comps well above the company average by further advancing our product and service offering to better serve the Pro customer. Beyond improvements in our tools offering, we have also strengthened our portfolio of Pro focus brands with the addition of GAF roofing, Owens Corning insulation, LENOX HVAC and Masonite entry and their interior doors. We continue to play feedback from Pro customers, our outside sales team and store employees, while working closely with our field-based merchandising managers to identify local market opportunities and brands to further optimize our offering for the Pro. We have also advanced our omni-channel resources for the Pro. We continue to utilize feedback from our Pro customers and Pro services team to enhance the features and functionality of our LowesForPros.com site that we relaunched last year, making it easy for Pros to manage multiple properties and quickly purchase items nationwide. Thus far, we have been pleased with the program rollout given the positive customer response and early results, which have exceeded our expectations. Another critical element of our omni-channel offering for the Pro customer is our account executive Pro services or AEPs. AEPs work with larger regional customers to help them order and replenish products across multiple geographies and locations. Our AEPs are a key component of our strategy to grow our business with larger Pro customers. We currently have over 180 Pro outside representatives in the field and have experienced great success with the program with continued strong growth in AEP comp sales. Building on this success, we will continue to grow the program, adding additional AEPs to continue capturing market opportunity with large Pro customers. We are also reaching out to the Pros through targeted marketing and special events such as credit events, bonus days and Spring Pro Appreciation days to drive awareness and generate new business. We have been pleased with these results in driving both incremental purchases with existing Pro customers and building relationships with new customers. Our work to strengthen our portfolio of brands as well as expand our omni-channel offering through our growing Pro services team and our relaunch of LowesForPros.com are part of our broader commitment to build on a strong foundation with the Pro. This foundation includes dedicated service in our stores, inventory depth aligned with the needs of the Pro, including a 5% off everyday loyalty program for Pros using Lowe's proprietary credit as well as reduced delivery rates. In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. For the quarter, gross margin contracted as strong performance in lower margin category, such as lumber and building materials, led to a negative mix impact. And while we plan targeted promotions to capitalize on strong spring demand, the participation rate in those offers exceeded our expectations, which, together with markdowns associated with reset activity, led to a negative rate impact. Our stores once again effectively managed payroll hours on very strong comp sales growth, driving payroll expense leverage. They drove this leverage while achieving continued strong customer satisfaction scores. As you can see, we had a strong first quarter. We continue to make progress on our initiatives to drive top line growth and are focused on improving productivity and profitability. We look forward to sharing further progress with you over the course of the year. Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob."

Total transaction count increased 5.5% and average ticket increased 2.2% to $68.08. Comp sales increased 7.3%, driven by comp trends -- transaction decreased 5.1% and average ticket growth of 2.2%. Looking at monthly trends, comps were 8.3% in February, 9.1% in March and 4.9% in April. Comps were stronger earlier in the quarter, as we capitalized on favorable weather to drive above-plan comps. April sales were consistent with our plan coming into the quarter. Gross margin for the first quarter was 35.04% of sales, a decrease of 43 basis points from last year. The decrease in gross margin as a percent of sales was due to rate pressure as well as the mix of products sold. The rate pressure related to targeted promotions and markdowns associated with reset activity. SG&A was 22.28% of sales, which leveraged 188 basis points. In anticipation of the RONA acquisition, we entered into a foreign currency hedge to lock in the purchase price in U.S. dollars. In the quarter, we recorded a $160 million unrealized gain, driving 105 basis points of expense leverage. Also, store payroll leveraged 13 basis points as we continue to optimize our staffing model. Utilities leveraged 11 basis points as a result of warmer weather relative to last year. Lastly, there were numerous other expenses that leveraged between 5 and 10 basis points in Q1. Depreciation for the quarter was $357 million, which is 2.34% of sales and leveraged 25 basis points compared to last year's first quarter as a result of higher sales and assets becoming fully depreciated. Earnings before interest and taxes increased 170 basis points to 10.42% of sales. The unrealized gain on the FX hedge accounts for 105 basis points of the increase versus last year. Interest expense at $156 million for the quarter delevered 8 basis points to last year as total debt increased $4.1 billion versus the first quarter of 2015. We issued $3.3 billion of unsecured bonds in April. The transaction consisted of 3-, 10- and 30-year issuances with a weighted average interest rate of 2.72%. The proceeds will fund the RONA acquisition as well as refines current year maturities. Effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.2%. Earnings per share of $0.98 for the quarter represents a 40% increase over last year's $0.70. The $0.98 includes $0.11 related to the FX hedge gain. We exceeded our earnings plan for the quarter even without the gain. 
Now to a few items on the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $4.6 billion. The higher cash balance is a result of the April bond deal. Our inventory -- first quarter inventory balance of $11.1 billion, increased $441 million, or 4.2% over the same period last year. Inventory turnover was 3.83x, an increase of 5 basis points over Q1 2015. 
Moving on to the liability section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable, $8.8 billion, increased $798 million, or 10% over Q1 last year. The increase in accounts payable is due to the timing of purchases in the quarter versus last year and a 3-day improvement in days payable outstanding. At the end of the first quarter, lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.45x. The higher target leverage was the result of the April bond deal. We expect to be back in line with our 2.25x target within 1 year of the RONA transaction closing. 
Return on invested capital increased 64 basis points for the quarter to 14.98%. The net impact of the non-cash impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter related to the exit of our joint venture in Australia and FX hedge gain this quarter reduced ROIC by 145 basis points. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Operating cash flow was $3.2 billion. Capital expenditures were $208 million, resulting in free cash flow of $3 billion. Free cash flow was $766 million, or 34.1% over the same period last year. In February, we entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. We expect to receive approximately 6.8 billion shares, but the ultimate number of shares will be determined upon the completion of the program in the second quarter. We also repurchased approximately 9.7 million shares for $700 million through the open market. In total, we repurchased $1.2 billion in the quarter. We have approximately $2.4 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. The remaining $53 million of share repurchases showed on the statement of cash flows relates to the shares withheld from employees to satisfy statutory tax withholding liabilities. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. First, as a reminder, fiscal 2016 will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for a total of 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the year. We estimate that the 53rd week will aid total sales by approximately 1.5% and earnings per share by $0.05 to $0.06. Second, while we have received shareholder approval and authorization from regulatory agencies, we have not closed on the RONA acquisition. As a result, our outlook excludes the impact of this transaction. Finally, while we did outperform our Q1 sales and earnings plan, we continue to think about spring within the context of the first half of the year. We are confident in our plans and hope to sustain a momentum, but we are in the middle of the spring season and believe it's prudent to maintain our previously provided outlook. Now let's get into that outlook. As Robert noted, the forecast for home improvement industry remains positive. For 2016, we expect total sales to increase of approximately 6%, driven by a comp sales increase of 4%, the impact of the 53rd week and the opening of approximately 45 stores, which includes 20 offshore locations and 12 stores in Canada. For ease of modeling, the EBIT growth rate excludes the impact of last year's Australian joint venture impairment charge and this year's FX hedge gain. We are anticipating an EBIT increase of 80 to 90 basis points. The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. For the year, on a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share of approximately $4.11 with the incremental $0.11 from our prior guide coming from the FX hedge gain. We are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5.4 billion. Our capital plans for 2016 is approximately $1.5 billion. This results in estimated free cash flow of $3.9 billion for 2016. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.5 billion in share repurchases for 2016. The share repurchase assumption is not expected to be affected by the RONA acquisition. Regina, we are now ready for questions."

As I outlined in my comments, as we've seen the consumers, we look through our consumer sentiment survey, what their intentions are around spending, what their intentions are around investing in the home, as we're seeing continual improvement in the job market, we're seeing continuing improvement in wages. We're seeing continued improvement in home values is driving continued improvements in their intentions for discretionary spending, which I think the best evidence of that is in the top 1% increase that we saw in top transactions during the quarter. And nothing that we've seen in our segment surveys has led us to believe that the consumer, when we ask them how do you feel 6 months out with regard to purchases, nothing shows any change in their intentions as we survey them today.

We are more focused on lawn and garden seasonal living, tools and hardware, major appliances and interior projects, because we thought those would be the types of products and projects the consumers' mindset will be geared towards.

LowesForPros, from an e-commerce perspective, is performing extremely well, as we said, exceeding our expectations, and we're extremely pleased with what we were hearing and the feedback we're getting from consumers as well as our AEPs in the field about the usability of the site. The functions of the site enables to make the ability for the Pro to shop much more easily with us. So we're really proud of those 2 things as we continue to move forward. We had not seen a shift in the mix of business regarding the in-store pickup. We still see that as roughly 60% of all e-commerce transactions that have picked up.

This year, the season began with robust demand for outdoor projects. Customers took advantage of favorable weather conditions in the first quarter to complete those projects. In the second quarter, we saw more strength in indoor project demand, leading to strong performance in lumber building materials, kitchens, tools and hardware and fashion fixtures. 
Our seasonal business also performed well in the second quarter, driven predominantly by air-conditioner and patio furniture sales. Healthy macro fundamentals, our project inspiration expertise, targeted promotions continue to drive demand, resulting in positive comps in 10 of 13

store, solid inventory depth, field-based account executives and a national accounts team. Our LowesForPros.com website, relaunched in the second quarter of last year, continues to gain traction. And we will continue to build on this strong foundation by incorporating the feedback we've received from Pros and our ProServices teams to constantly improve the customer experience and deepen our relationships with this important customer segment. 
From a geographic perspective, our U.S. home improvement business achieved 1.9% comps for the quarter, with all regions of the south and the west comping positive. Our northern regions were challenged by an abbreviated spring, which hindered outdoor activity. 
We continued our strong performance in international markets, including double-digit comps in Canada and Mexico in local currency. We closed the RONA acquisition on May 20, and I'm pleased with the progress of our integration. By bringing together Lowe's' global scale and resources with RONA's local expertise, we can enhance relevance and expand customer reach, ultimately enhancing our competitiveness and profitability in Canada, establishing a strong presence in Québec and positioning us to capitalize on the significant long-term potential of the market. We welcome RONA's talented team into the Lowe's family.
For the quarter, operating margin contracted 13 basis points, and we delivered earnings per share of $1.31, a 9% increase over last year's second quarter. These results include an $84 million loss in the foreign currency hedge entered into in advance of the RONA acquisition. This loss had a $0.06 impact on earnings per share for the quarter.

Looking ahead to the second half of 2016. The outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive. Persisting gains in the job market and disposable income growth that continues to outpace the economy should further contribute to solid growth in consumer spending. And the outlook for housing remains bright, with strong home sales and construction in the first half of the year poised to benefit growth in the second half of the year. With home value appreciation expected to persist and incomes continuing to rise, we expect homeowners to be motivated to spend on their homes. Overall, strong consumer housing fundamentals should continue to benefit the home improvement industry. 
Our second quarter Consumer Sentiment Survey showed similar trends. Consumers continue to view their personal finances and home values favorably, with half of homeowners believing the value of their home is increasing. We believe this positive sentiment around home values is driving home improvement spending. Consequently, we continue to see home improvement spending outpace overall consumer spending as well as positive home improvement project intentions, including strong engagement in big-ticket discretionary projects. 
Our key priorities in 2016 are focused on leveraging this favorable home improvement backdrop. We are pursuing further top line growth by differentiating ourselves in better omnichannel customer experiences that make us the project authority and continue to focus on improving our product and service offering to the Pro customer. At the same time, we'll continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. 
The execution of our strategic priorities, along with a solid macroeconomic backdrop, gives us confidence in our business outlook for 2016. 
Before I close, I would like to express my appreciation for our employees' unwavering commitment to serving customers. In particular, I would like to thank those Lowe's team members who worked diligently to assist our neighbors that were impacted by the historic flooding in West Virginia and those that are now assisting our neighbors in Louisiana. In circumstances like these, we ship truckloads of critically needed supplies to affected areas, and many of our employees pledge their time to help individuals in need. Lowe's has also donated a total of $750,000 to the American Red Cross to assist with the relief efforts. 
Thanks again for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Mike."

In the second quarter, we achieved positive comps in 10 of 14 regions, with all regions in the south and west comping positively. This strength was offset by weakness in our northern regions. We also posted positive comps in 10 of 13 product categories. While comps were below expectation for the second quarter, we delivered a solid first half of the year, in line with our plan. 
As Robert mentioned, the season kicked off with stronger-than-expected outdoor project demand as customers took advantage of favorable weather, bolstered by a strong macroeconomic backdrop. We drove traffic in Q1 through compelling offers designed to take advantage of the early spring project demand, leveraging enhanced digital capabilities to reach the spring customer earlier in the season.
As we moved into Q2, we saw softer comps in May stemming both from Q1 project pull-forward and unfavorable weather. Temperatures below normal in our northern regions prevented customers from enjoying outdoor projects. As we moved into June and July, traffic rebounded and we capitalized on stronger demand for indoor projects and customers' continued to desire to invest in their homes with our project inspiration and expertise and targeted promotions. This contributed to stronger performance in interior categories such as kitchens and fashion fixtures. 
We also drove solid comps in appliances. And for the eighth time in the last 9 years, JD Power and Associates ranked Lowe's highest in customer satisfaction among the client retailers based on the knowledge of sales specialists, breadth of assortment, competitive pricing and delivery.
To take advantage of increasing demand for kitchen projects and to ensure we provide a more holistic solution to a simple kitchen refresh or a full remodel, we display our kitchen solutions, including cabinets and countertops, immediately adjacent to our appliance offering so customers can both envision and design their dream kitchens. 
This quarter, we drove above-average comps in kitchens through a combination of project inspiration and expertise, our investment in project specialists who meet the customers in their homes and targeted promotions. 
Within fashion fixtures, we leverage our customer experience design capabilities to optimize our lighting reset featuring an expanded collection of line styles, finishes and brands, including the expansion of Kitchen Lighting [ph], the largest lighting showroom brand in the industry, along with Progress Lighting and Console Lighting [ph]. Adding to our attractive product offering, we also simplified the presentation, looping lighted fixtures by style and collection to provide a cohesive decorating solution and make selection easier.
Customers have responded well, driving strong comps in fashion fixtures. We've also expanded this enhanced display approach to ceiling fans. 
Our shower door reset also leverages our customer experience design capabilities, enhancing our shower door offering by designing a complete solution for customer needs, providing a great line design, offering innovation and expand selection and product delivery and installation services. In doing so, we're differentiating ourselves as the retail destination for bathroom refresh as well as the thought being a best-in-class in-store customer experiences that can also serve as a selling center for Pros and our project specialist teams. We're also officially leveraging our network of regional distribution centers to offer customers private when and where they want it. 
Our seasonal living business also performed well in Q2, driven by robust air-conditioner sales due to warmer-than-average temperatures and patio furniture and fashions. We also saw continued strong demand from the Pro customer, with comps well above the company average. Once again, productivity drove solid comps in lumber and build materials. 
Tools and hardware also benefited from increased project activity from both DIY and Pro customers. We're able to capitalize on this demand by improving our tool brand assortment with exclusives like Hitachi and Bostick, the #1 and #2 brands in pneumatics; the extension of brands like Bond; along with our extensive private label line of Kobalt tools. And we're proud to announce the return of yet another destination tool brand to Lowe's, Marshalltown, a trusted Pro brand and the leading supplier of cement masonry tools, which will roll out to our stores in the upcoming weeks. 
We also continue to focus on the strategic priorities, leveraging our omni-channel capabilities to help customers achieve great project results. Customers can engage with our associates in-store for extra buys, our content on Lowes.com for inspiration, our contact center for ongoing support or our project specialists who work with them in their homes. 
This quarter, we launched our new Lowes.com site, advancing our online shopping experience with optimized functionality and display for touch screen devices to support a better mobile experience, improved product and content recommendations, refined search algorithms, improved click-to-chat capabilities, larger project images and expanded product views, including video content. As anticipated, following the launch, we had a brief period of disruption as customers increased their familiarity with the redesigned site. We are now seeing improved performance and have received great customer feedback on the new site. Our interior and exterior project specialists are now the critical element of our omni-channel strategy and a differentiated capability in capturing and serving project demand. They meet with customers in their homes to design, plan and manage their home improvement projects. Our exterior project specialists are currently available across all U.S. home improvement stores, and we're expanding our interior project specialist program, reaching all U.S. stores by the end of this year. We are very pleased with our in-home sales program performance, with above-average comp growth again this quarter.
Our expertise in project inspiration, design, advice and execution are setting us apart as the project authority in home improvement at a time when consumers continue to demonstrate a desire to invest in their homes. 
We continue to advance our Pro business, driving comps well above the company average by continuing to optimize our product and service offering to better serve the Pro customer. Beyond improvements in our tools offering, we have also strengthened our portfolio of Pro-focused brands with the addition of GAF roofing, [indiscernible] Installation, Lennox HVAC, Masonite entry and interior doors and Hubbell residential wiring devices. We are also working closely with our field-based merchandising team to identify local market opportunities and brands to further optimize our offering for the Pro customer. And with the relaunch of LowesForPros.com last year, we've also made it easy for Pros to manage multiple properties and quickly and easily purchase items nationwide. Thus far, we've been pleased with the program rollout, given them positive customer response and results, which have exceeded our expectations. 
We're also serving the Pro customer through our Account Executive ProServices, AEPs. AEPs work with larger regional customers to help them order and replenish products across both the geographies and locations. Our AEPs have been very effective in growing our business with larger Pro customers. We currently have over 200 Pro outside sales representatives in the field and continue to be very pleased with the program's results. Excluding the AEPs we added this year, we saw double-digit growth in AEPs sales, which contributed to the strong Pro comp growth in the quarter. Building on this success, we continue to grow the program, adding additional AEPs to continue capturing market opportunity with large Pro customers. 
Our further -- our focus on further strengthening our portfolio of brands continued to build our omni-channel offering through our growing Pro services them, and our relaunch of LowesForPros.com are all a part of a broader commitment to build on a strong foundation with the Pro. 
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. For the quarter, gross margin declined 3 basis points. Our operating performance drove 17 basis points of improvement with the result of our ongoing [indiscernible] process. 
The transaction negatively impacted gross margin by 20 basis points, but I will provide the details in a moment. 
As you can see, we had a solid first half of the year. As we look forward to the second half of 2016, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the favorable macroeconomic backdrop for the home improvement industry, and we continue to execute our strategic priorities and make progress on initiatives to drive top line growth, improve productivity and profitability. 
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I'll now turn the call over to Bob."
180871,326105491,1036336,"Lowe's Companies, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2016",2016-08-17,"Earnings Calls","Lowe's Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. This is the first quarter that we're including RONA in our financial results. While we closed the acquisition May 20, our second quarter includes only 5 weeks of RONA results, as they are consolidated on a 1-month lag",1509,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. This is the first quarter that we're including RONA in our financial results. While we closed the acquisition May 20, our second quarter includes only 5 weeks of RONA results, as they are consolidated on a 1-month lag. In conjunction with the transaction, RONA's operating results are adjusted to reflect purchase accounting as well as to align their accounting policies with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, regarding RONA, they will be included in our comp sales calculation after we anniversary the transaction in the second quarter of 2017. 
Now on to our Q2 results. Sales for the second quarter were $18.3 billion, an increase of 5.3%. Total costs for transactions grew 3.7%, with RONA accounting for about 75% of the increase, and total average ticket increased 1.6% to $68.91. The sales increase was driven by the addition of RONA and increasing comp sales and new stores. For Q2, $461 million or 2.7% of the sales growth came from RONA. New stores contributed approximately 60 basis points of the sales growth.
Comp sales were 2%, driven by comp average ticket increase of 1.7% and comp transaction growth of 3 tenths of 1% [ph]. 
Looking at monthly trends, comps were negative 2.8% in May, positive 5% in June and positive 3.8% in July. The timing of Memorial Day and July 4th versus last year had fairly significant impacts on the monthly comps. We estimate that normalizing for these -- for the timing of the holidays, comps would have been positive all 3 months, with comps of 1.7% in May, 2% in June and 2.3% in July. We estimate that weather negatively impacted comps sales in the quarter by 110 basis points. 
Year-to-date sales of $33.5 billion were up 6.4% versus the first half of 2015, driven by a 4.4% increase in comp sales, 1.5% for RONA and 5 tenths of 1% [ph] from new stores. 
Gross margin for the second quarter was 34.44% of sales, which decreased 3 basis points from Q2 last year. Gross margin was negatively impacted by the RONA transaction due to both purchase accounting adjustments and mix. 
The purchase accounting adjustments were required to write the opening inventory balance up to fair value as this product is sold to higher cost of goods for gross margin. The mix impact was a function of RONA's lower gross margin rate. In the quarter, these items negatively impacted gross margin by 20 basis points, which more than offset 15 basis points of benefit from value improvement. 
Year-to-date gross margin was 34.71% of sales, a decrease of 21 basis points from the first half of 2015. SG&A for Q2 was 21.2% of sales, which deleveraged 26 basis points. The deleverage was primarily driven by a foreign currency transaction loss and store payroll. 
As mentioned on our first quarter call, in anticipation of the RONA acquisition, we entered into a foreign currency hedge to lock in the purchase price in U.S. dollars. In the first quarter, we recorded a $160 million unrealized gain. However, in the second quarter, the Canadian dollar strengthened, resulting in an $84 million loss. This item negatively impacted Q2 SG&A by 45 basis points. In the quarter, store payroll deleveraged 30 basis points, driven by wage pressure as well as lower-than-planned sales. These items were partially offset by 24 basis points of leverage in bonus and 16 [ph] basis points of leverage and employee insurance. 
Year-to-date SG&A was 21.69% of sales, which leveraged 70 basis points versus the first half of 2015. Depreciation for the quarter was $366 million, which was 2% of sales and leveraged 16 basis points. In Q2, earnings before interest and taxes were even -- decreased 13 basis points to 11.24% of sales. The RONA impacts the gross margin and the foreign currency hedge negatively impacted EBIT by 65 basis points in the quarter. For the first half of 2016, EBIT was 10.86% of sales, which was 68 basis points higher than the same period last year. 
For the quarter, interest expense was $166 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.1%. Earnings per share was $1.31 for the second quarter, an increase of 9.2% over last year. The foreign currency hedge negatively impacted earnings by $0.06 per share. For the first 6 months of 2016, earnings per share were $2.29, representing a 20.5% increase over the first half of 2015. The foreign currency hedge aided earnings per share by $0.05 in the first half of the year. 
Now to a few items in the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was $2 billion. Inventory at $10.6 billion increased $900 million or 9.3% versus Q2 last year. Approximately 85% of the increase relates the addition of RONA. Inventory turnover was 3.89x, essentially flat to last year. Asset turnover increased 4 basis points to 1.78. 
Moving on to Liabilities section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable of $7.7 billion represented an 8% increase over Q2 last year due to the timing of purchases year-over-year, terms improvement as well as the addition of RONA. At the end of the second quarter, lease adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 2.45x. Return on invested capital is 15%. The net impact of last year's noncash impairment charge related to our Australian joint venture, and this year's foreign currency hedge gain curved ROIC by 194 basis points. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Year-to-date operating cash flow is $4.6 billion. Capital expenditures were $490 million, resulting in free cash flow of just over $4.1 billion, which is up 15% to last year. In May, we entered into a $500 million share repurchase agreement. At this point, we expect to receive approximately 6.3 million shares. The open number of shares will be determined upon completion of the program in the third quarter. We also repurchased approximately 8.9 million shares for $700 million to the open-market. In total, we repurchased $1.2 billion of stock in the quarter. We have approximately $1.2 billion remaining on the share repurchase authorization. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several details and Lowe's business outlook. First, a reminder, fiscal 2016 will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for a total of 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the year. Second, since we've closed the RONA acquisition, our outlook now includes the impact of the transaction as well as their operating performance. Finally, the first half of 2016 came in essentially unplanned. We are confident in our ability to achieve our goals for the year. As a result, the only changes to our outlook are related to RONA. 
Now let's get into the outlook. As Robert noted, the forecast for home improvement industry remains positive. For 2016, we expect a total sales increase of approximately 10%, driven by a variety of factors. First, we are forecasting a comp sales increase of 4%. Second, we expect RONA to contribute 4% to sales growth. Next, we estimate that the 53rd week will aid total sales by 1.5%. Lastly, we plan to open approximately 45 stores, which adds 5 tenths of 1% [ph]. 
For the EBIT growth rate, we are excluding the impact of last year's Australian joint venture impairment charge and this year's net FX hedge gain. We believe excluding these large onetime items is a better representation of our operating performance. We're anticipating an EBIT increase of approximately 50 basis points. While the acquisition of RONA adds EBIT dollars, there's a negative impact to the percent of sales. There are 2 factors causing this. First, RONA's EBIT is lower as a percent of sales. As part of our synergy case, we expect RONA's EBIT will improve over time. Second are the impacts of purchase accounting I noted a moment ago. This primarily hurts 2016 with minimal impact in 2017 and beyond. Combined, these items pressure EBIT by 35 basis points for the year. The negative impacts to Q3 and Q4 are estimated to be 60 and 50 basis points, respectively. For the year, we expect EBIT dollars to grow by approximately 16%. The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. For the year, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share of approximately $4.06. We are on target to hit our original 2016 operating plan. 
I'd like to walk you through our EPS outlook, starting with the $4 per share we communicated on the Q4 call in February.
From here, we add a net gain from the foreign currency hedge of $0.05. Lastly, we had $0.01 as we expect RONA's operating results to more than offset the acquisition and integration costs. As a result, we do expect the RONA transaction will be modestly accretive for the year. We are forecasting cash flow from operations to be approximately $5.6 billion. Our forecast for capital expenditures is approximately $1.5 billion. This results in an estimated free cash flow of $4.1 billion for 2016. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.5 billion in share repurchases for 2016.

This is about revenue and cost synergies as you go about competing in the Canadian market with better customer relevance by leveraging our strengths and omni-channel and our approach to be able to bring all of our channels together to serve customers; our expanded customer reach through our strengths and expertise in key product categories, including introducing appliances into the RONA stores across the country; and then increased profitability. We do believe that the combined scale of our 2 organizations, both in our direct purchasing and our indirect purchasing as well as eliminating key things like public company costs, will allow us the opportunity to possibly double profitability within the first 5 years.

We delivered a solid first half of the year and made continued progress against our key strategic priorities, providing better omni-channel experiences to more closely connect with customers, deepening our relationship with the Pro customer and driving productivity and profitability.
We continue to generate strong cash flows, enabling us to strategically invest in the business while returning capital to our shareholders.
In the first six months of 2016, we delivered comparable sales growth of 4.4%, in line with our plan. In the second quarter, comparable sales grew 2%. [indiscernible] 1.7% increase in average ticket. 
As we've mentioned before, the timing of spring impacts the first half of the year. This year, the season began with robust demand for outdoor projects. Customers took advantage of favorable weather conditions in the first quarter to complete those projects. In the second quarter, we saw more strength in indoor project demand, leading to strong performance in lumber building materials, kitchens, tools and hardware and fashion fixtures. 
Our seasonal loading business also performed well in the second quarter, driven predominantly by air conditioner and patio furniture sales. Healthy macro fundamentals, our project inspiration expertise and targeted promotions continue to drive demand, resulting in positive comps in 10 of 13 product categories. We were also pleased with the work we've done to further advance our product and service offerings to the Pro customer.
The strategic investments we've made to build deeper relationships with the Pro are allowing us to capitalize on strong Pro demand through [ph] a favorable macro backdrop. As our Pro business continue to perform well above the company average. 
Today, we have a strong foundation for the Pro customer including dedicated service in store, solid inventory depth, field-based Pro account executives and a national accounts team. Our LowesForPros.com 
website, relaunched in the second quarter of last year, continues to gain traction.
And we will continue to build on this strong foundation by incorporating the feedback we've received from Pros and our ProServices team to constantly improve the customer experience and deepen our relationships with this important customer segment. 
From a geographic perspective, our U.S. home improvement business achieved 1.9% comps for the quarter, with all regions of the south and the west comping positive. Our northern regions were challenged by an abbreviated spring, which hindered outdoor activity. 
We continued our strong performance in international markets, including double-digit comps in Canada and Mexico in local currency. We closed the RONA acquisition on May 20, and I'm pleased with the progress of our integration. By bringing together Lowe's global scale and resources with RONA's local expertise, we can enhance relevance and expand customer reach ultimately enhancing our competitiveness and profitability in Canada, establishing a strong presence in Québec and positioning us to capitalize on the significant long-term potential of the market. We welcome RONA's talented team into the Lowe's family.
For the quarter, operating margin contracted 13 basis points, and we delivered earnings per share of $1.31, a 9% increase over last year second quarter. These results include an $84 million loss in the foreign currency hedge entered into in advance of the RONA acquisition. This loss had a $0.06 impact on earnings per share for the quarter. 
Delivering our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter we repurchased
$1.2 billion of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $251 million in dividends.  
Looking ahead to the second half of 2016, the outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive. Persisting gains in the job market and disposable income growth that continues to outpace the economy should further contribute to solid growth in consumer spending. And the outlook for housing remains bright, with strong home sales and construction in the first half of the year poised to benefit growth in the second half of the year. With home value appreciation expected to persist and incomes continuing to rise, we expect homeowners to be motivated to spend on their homes. Overall, strong consumer housing fundamentals should continue to benefit the home improvement industry. 
Our second quarter Consumer Sentiment Survey showed similar trends. Consumers continue to view their personal finances and home values favorably, with half of homeowners believing the value of their home is increasing. We believe this positive sentiment around home values is driving home improvement spending. Consequently, we continue to see home improvement spending outpace overall consumer spending as well as positive home improvement project intentions, including strong engagement in big-ticket discretionary projects. 
Our key priorities in 2016 are focused on leveraging this favorable home improvement backdrop. We are pursuing further top line growth by differentiating ourselves in better omni-channel customer experiences that make us the project authority and continue to focus on improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer. At the same time, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability.  
The execution of our strategic priorities, along with a solid macroeconomic backdrop, gives us confidence in our business outlook for 2016. 
Before I close, I would like to express my appreciation for our employees' unwavering commitment to serving customers. In particular, I would like to thank those Lowe's team members who worked diligently to assist our neighbors that were impacted by the historic flooding in West Virginia and those that are now assisting our neighbors in Louisiana. In circumstances like these, we ship truckloads of critically needed supplies to affected areas, and many of our employees pledge their time to help individuals in need. Lowe's has also donated a total of $750,000 to the American Red Cross to assist with the relief efforts. 
Thanks again for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Mike."

In the second quarter, we achieved positive comps in 10 of 14 regions, with all regions in the south and west comping positively. This strength was offset by weakness in our northern regions. We also posted positive",1388,"Thanks, Robert. Good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we achieved positive comps in 10 of 14 regions, with all regions in the south and west comping positively. This strength was offset by weakness in our northern regions. We also posted positive comps in 10 of 13 product categories. While comps were below expectation for the second quarter, we delivered a solid first half of the year, in line with our plan. 
As Robert mentioned, the season kicked off with stronger-than-expected outdoor project demand as customers took advantage of favorable weather, bolstered by a strong macroeconomic backdrop. We drove traffic in Q1 through compelling offers designed to take advantage of the early spring project demand, leveraging enhanced digital capabilities to reach the spring customer earlier in the season.
As we moved into Q2, we saw softer comps in May stemming both from Q1 project pull-forward and unfavorable weather. Temperatures below normal in our northern regions prevented customers from enjoying outdoor projects. As we moved into June and July, traffic rebounded and we capitalized on stronger demand for indoor projects and customers' continued desire to invest in their homes with our project inspiration and expertise and targeted promotions. This contributed to stronger performance in interior categories, such as kitchens and fashion fixtures. 
We also drove solid comps in appliances. And for the eighth time in the last 9 years, J.D. Power and Associates ranked Lowe's highest in customer satisfaction among appliance retailers based on the knowledge of sales specialists, breadth of assortment, competitive pricing and delivery.
To take advantage of increasing demand for kitchen projects and to ensure we provide a more holistic solution to a simple kitchen refresh or a full remodel, we display our kitchen solutions, including cabinets and countertops, immediately adjacent to our appliance offering so customers can both envision and design their dream kitchens. 
This quarter, we drove above-average comps in kitchens through a combination of project inspiration and expertise; our investment in project specialists, who meet the customers in their homes; and targeted promotions. 
Within fashion fixtures, we leverage our customer experience design capabilities to optimize our lighting reset, featuring an expanded collection of lighting styles, finishes and brands, including the expansion of Kichler Lighting, the largest lighting showroom brand in the industry, along with Progress Lighting and Quoizel Lighting. Adding to our attractive product offering, we also simplified the presentation, looping lighted fixtures by style and collection to provide a cohesive decorating solution and make selection easier. Customers have responded well, driving strong comps in fashion fixtures. We've also expanded this enhanced display approach to ceiling fans. 
Our shower door reset also leverages our customer experience design capabilities, enhancing our shower door offering by designing a complete solution for customer needs, providing a great line design, offering innovation and expanded selection and product delivery and installation services. In doing so, we are differentiating ourselves as the retail destination for bathroom refresh as well as the thought of being a best-in-class in-store customer experiences that can also serve as a selling center for Pros and our project specialist teams. We're also officially leveraging our network of regional distribution centers to offer customers product when and where they want it. 
Our seasonal living business also performed well in Q2, driven by robust air conditioner sales due to warmer-than-average temperatures and patio furniture and fashions. We also saw continued strong demand from the Pro customer, with comps well above the company average. Once again, productivity drove solid comps in lumber and building materials. 
Tools and hardware also benefited from increased project activity from both DIY and Pro customers. We're able to capitalize on this demand by improving our tool brand assortment with exclusives like Hitachi and Bostitch, the #1 and #2 brands in pneumatics; and the extension of brands like Vaughan; along with our extensive private label line of Kobalt tools. And we're proud to announce the return of yet another destination tool brand to Lowe's, Marshalltown, a trusted Pro brand and the leading supplier of cement masonry tools, which will roll out to our stores in the upcoming weeks. 
We also continue to focus on the strategic priorities, leveraging our omni-channel capabilities to help customers achieve great project results. Customers can engage with our associates in-store for extra buys, our content on Lowes.com for inspiration, our contact center for ongoing support or our project specialists, who work with them in their homes. 
This quarter, we launched our new Lowes.com site, advancing our online shopping experience with optimized functionality and display for touch screen devices to support a better mobile experience; improved product and content recommendations; refined search algorithms; improved click-to-chat capabilities; larger project images; and expanded product views, including video content. As anticipated, following the launch, we had a brief period of disruption as customers increase their familiarity with the redesigned site. We are now seeing improved performance and have received great customer feedback on the new site. Our interior and exterior project specialists are now the critical element of our omni-channel strategy and a differentiated capability in capturing and serving project demand. They meet with customers in their homes to design, plan and manage their home improvement projects. Our exterior project specialists are currently available across all U.S. home improvement stores and we're expanding our interior project specialist program, reaching all U.S. stores by the end of this year. We are very pleased with our in-home sales program performance, with above-average comp growth again this quarter.
Our expertise in project inspiration, design, advice and execution are setting us apart as the project authority in home improvement at a time when consumers continue to demonstrate a desire to invest in their homes. 
We continue to advance our Pro business, driving comps well above the company average by continuing to optimize our product and service offering to better serve the Pro customer. Beyond improvements in our tools offering, we have also strengthened our portfolio of Pro-focused brands with the addition of GAF roofing, Owens Corning Installation, Lennox HVAC, Masonite entry and interior doors and Hubbell residential wiring devices. We are also working closely with our field-based merchandising team to identify local market opportunities and brands to further optimize our offering for the Pro customer. And with the relaunch of LowesForPros.com last year, we've also made it easy for Pros to manage multiple properties and quickly and easily purchase items nationwide. Thus far, we've been pleased with our program rollout, given positive customer response and results, which have exceeded our expectations. 
We're also serving the Pro customer through our Account Executive ProServices or AEPs. AEPs work with larger regional customers to help them order and replenish products across both geographies and locations. Our AEPs have been very effective in growing our business with larger Pro customers. We currently have over 200 Pro outside sales representatives in the field and continue to be very pleased with the program's results. Excluding the AEPs we added this year, we saw double-digit growth in AEPs sales, which contributed to the strong Pro comp growth in the quarter. Building on this success, we continue to grow the program, adding additional AEPs to continue capturing market opportunity with large Pro customers. 
Our further -- our focus on further strengthening our portfolio of brands continue to build our omni-channel offering through our growing Pro services team, and our relaunch of LowesForPros.com are all a part of a broader commitment to build on a strong foundation with the Pro. 
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. For the quarter, gross margin declined 3 basis points. Our operating performance drove 17 basis points of improvement with the result of our ongoing line of view [ph] process. 
The RONA transaction negatively impacted gross margin by 20 basis points, Bob will provide the details in a moment. 
As you can see, we had a solid first half of the year. As we look forward to the second half of 2016, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the favorable macroeconomic backdrop for the home improvement industry, and we continue to execute our strategic priorities and make progress on initiatives to drive top line growth, improve productivity and profitability. 
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I'll now turn the call over to Bob."
180871,326105491,1036467,"Lowe's Companies, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2016",2016-08-17,"Earnings Calls","Lowe's Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. This is the first quarter that we're including RONA in our financial results. While we closed the acquisition May 20, our second quarter includes only 5 weeks of RONA results, as they are consolidated on a 1-month",1503,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. This is the first quarter that we're including RONA in our financial results. While we closed the acquisition May 20, our second quarter includes only 5 weeks of RONA results, as they are consolidated on a 1-month lag. In conjunction with the transaction, RONA's operating results are adjusted to reflect purchase accounting as well as to align their accounting policies with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also regarding RONA, they will be included in our comp sales calculation after we anniversary the transaction in the second quarter of 2017. 
Now on to our Q2 results. Sales for the second quarter were $18.3 billion, an increase of 5.3%. Total costs for transactions grew 3.7%, with RONA accounting for about 75% of the increase, and total average ticket increased 1.6% to $68.91. The sales increase was driven by the addition of RONA and increasing comp sales and new stores. For Q2, $461 million or 2.7% of the sales growth came from RONA. New stores contributed approximately 60 basis points of the sales growth.
Comp sales were 2%, driven by comp average ticket increase of 1.7% and comp transaction growth of 0.3%.
Looking at monthly trends, comps were negative 2.8% in May, positive 5% in June and positive 3.8% in July. The timing of Memorial Day and July 4th versus last year had fairly significant impacts on the monthly comps. We estimate that normalizing for these -- for the timing of the holidays, comps would have been positive all 3 months, with comps of 1.7% in May; 2% in June; and 2.3% in July. We estimate that weather negatively impacted comps sales in the quarter by 110 basis points. 
Year-to-date sales of $33.5 billion were up 6.4% versus the first half of 2015, driven by: a 4.4% increase in comp sales; 1.5% for RONA; and 0.5% from new stores. 
Gross margin for the second quarter was 34.44% of sales, which decreased 3 basis points from Q2 last year. Gross margin was negatively impacted by the RONA transaction due to both purchase accounting adjustments and mix. 
The purchase accounting adjustments were required to write the opening inventory balance up to fair value as this product is sold to higher cost of goods for gross margin. The mix impact was a function of RONA's lower gross margin rate. In the quarter, these items negatively impacted gross margin by 20 basis points, which more than offset 15 basis points of benefit from value improvement. 
Year-to-date gross margin was 34.71% of sales, a decrease of 21 basis points from the first half of 2015. SG&A for Q2 was 21.2% of sales, which deleveraged 26 basis points. The deleverage was primarily driven by a foreign currency transaction loss and store payroll. 
As mentioned on our first quarter call, in anticipation of the RONA acquisition, we entered into a foreign currency hedge to lock in the purchase price in U.S. dollars. In the first quarter, we recorded a $160 million unrealized gain. However, in the second quarter, the Canadian dollar strengthened, resulting in an $84 million loss. This item negatively impacted Q2 SG&A by 45 basis points. In the quarter, store payroll deleveraged 30 basis points, driven by wage pressure as well as lower-than-planned sales. These items were partially offset by 24 basis points of leverage in bonus and 16 basis points of leverage and employee insurance. 
Year-to-date SG&A was 21.69% of sales, which leveraged 70 basis points versus the first half of 2015. Depreciation for the quarter was $366 million, which was 2% of sales and leveraged 16 basis points. In Q2, earnings before interest and taxes were even -- decreased 13 basis points to 11.24% of sales. The RONA impacts the gross margin and the foreign currency hedge negatively impacted EBIT by 65 basis points in the quarter. For the first half of 2016, EBIT was 10.86% of sales, which was 68 basis points higher than the same period last year. 
For the quarter, interest expense was $166 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.1%. Earnings per share was $1.31 for the second quarter, an increase of 9.2% over last year. The foreign currency hedge negatively impacted earnings by $0.06 per share. For the first 6 months of 2016, earnings per share were $2.29, representing a 20.5% increase over the first half of 2015. The foreign currency hedge aided earnings per share by $0.05 in the first half of the year. 
Now to a few items in the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was $2 billion. Inventory at $10.6 billion increased $900 million or 9.3% versus Q2 last year. Approximately 85% of the increase relates to the addition of RONA. Inventory turnover was 3.89x, essentially flat to last year. Asset turnover increased 4 basis points to 1.78. 
Moving on to the liabilities section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable of $7.7 billion represented an 8% increase over Q2 last year due to the timing of purchases year-over-year, terms improvement as well as the addition of RONA. At the end of the second quarter, lease adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 2.45x. Return on invested capital was 15%. The net impact of last year's noncash impairment charge related to our Australian joint venture and this year's foreign currency hedge gain hurt ROIC by 194 basis points. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Year-to-date operating cash flow is $4.6 billion. Capital expenditures were $490 million, resulting in free cash flow of just over $4.1 billion, which is up 15% to last year. In May, we entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. At this point, we expect to receive approximately 6.3 million shares, but the open number of shares will be determined upon completion of the program in the third quarter. We also repurchased approximately 8.9 million shares for $700 million to the open market. In total, we repurchased $1.2 billion of stock in the quarter. We have approximately $1.2 billion remaining on the share repurchase authorization. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several itemized detail and Lowe's business outlook. First, a reminder, fiscal 2016 will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for a total of 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the year. Second, since we've closed the RONA acquisition, our outlook now includes the impact of the transaction as well as their operating performance. Finally, the first half of 2016 came in essentially unplanned. We are confident in our ability to achieve our goals for the year. As a result, the only changes to our outlook are related to RONA. 
Now let's get into the outlook. As Robert noted, the forecast for home improvement industry remains positive. For 2016, we expect a total sales increase of approximately 10%, driven by a variety of factors. First, we are forecasting a comp sales increase of 4%. Second, we expect RONA to contribute 4% to sales growth. Next, we estimate that the 53rd week will aid total sales by 1.5%. Lastly, we plan to open approximately 45 stores, which adds 0.5%. 
For the EBIT growth rate, we are excluding the impact of last year's Australian joint venture impairment charge and this year's net FX hedge gain. We believe excluding these large onetime items is a better representation of our operating performance. We're anticipating an EBIT increase of approximately 50 basis points. While the acquisition of RONA adds EBIT dollars, there's a negative impact to the percent of sales. There are 2 factors causing this. First, RONA's EBIT is lower as a percent of sales. As part of our synergy case, we expect RONA's EBIT will improve over time. 
Second are the impacts of purchase accounting I noted a moment ago. This primarily hurts 2016 with minimal impact in 2017 and beyond. Combined, these items pressure EBIT by 35 basis points for the year. The negative impacts to Q3 and Q4 are estimated to be 60 and 50 basis points, respectively. For the year, we expect EBIT dollars to grow by approximately 16%. The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. For the year, on a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share of approximately $4.06. We are on target to hit our original 2016 operating plan. 
I'd like to walk you through our EPS outlook, starting with the $4 per share we communicated on the Q4 call in February.
From here, we add a net gain from the foreign currency hedge of $0.05. Lastly, we had $0.01 as we expect RONA's operating results to more than offset the acquisition and integration costs. As a result, we do expect the RONA transaction will be modestly accretive for the year. 
We are forecasting cash flow from operations to be approximately $5.6 billion. Our forecast for capital expenditures is approximately $1.5 billion. This results in an estimated free cash flow of $4.1 billion for 2016. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.5 billion in share repurchases for 2016. 
Regina, we are now ready for questions."

We think about the impact that the weather had, the rain impact that we had in May, and then obviously, the late spring, which impacted the north and the extreme heat that we ran into later in the quarter. We still saw sequential improvement when we look at everything from talking to our Consumer Sentiment Survey, everything we heard from the consumer, they are still highly engaged in discretionary spending around the home driven by how they build out the overall housing market and value of their homes continuing to increase. So we look at the macroeconomic environment and look at the impacts that weather had on our particular business in the quarter still sets us up incredibly well.

I spoke earlier about the investment that we've made in digital. I like how we're positioned from a product perspective with our strength in appliances. Our full vignettes or delivery, all brands and installation. I like how we're positioned in fashion lighting. With our 3-brand strategy around [indiscernible], our foreign lineup is second to none, with Pergo laminate carry bamboo on our STAINMASTER brand. We like our position in paint. We'll talk a lot about our Sherwin-Williams for our PPG/Olympic, the exclusives that we have there. We've done a lot of work for round stain, bringing back Cabot and expanding our Minwax. And if you think about the Pro business, we continue to be more relevant with Pro with return of brands like Marshalltown on top of those other brands that we took back and spoke to earlier in the year. So we think we're well positioned going into the second quarter -- excuse me, the second half.

However, with some of our interior mower categories, we actually saw very robust sales. And in paints, we had a soft sales in exterior coatings, but positive comps in interior coatings. So another way to think about it, right, if I think about big-ticket strength, as an example, in the second quarter, kitchen cabinets actually showed strength. Chandeliers and vanity lightings were up double digit. Wooden vinyl flooring was up double-digit. Bath vanities were up double digit. We had some external projects that were up quite strong as well. Shingles were up double digits. Wordings were up double digits. Fencing was up high single digit. But where we did we see a little softness was in exterior projects, and we tipped and tied that DIY customers would take on. So the macroeconomics feel pretty good.

And then you look at the investments in our inventory depth as well as our AEP networks, international sales teams, I think, all combined to help us continue to drive that performance.

We delivered a solid first half of the year and made continued progress against our key strategic priorities, providing better omni-channel experiences to more closely connect with customers, deepening",957,"Good morning, and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. We delivered a solid first half of the year and made continued progress against our key strategic priorities, providing better omni-channel experiences to more closely connect with customers, deepening our relationship with the Pro customer and driving productivity and profitability.
We continue to generate strong cash flows, enabling us to strategically invest in the business while returning capital to our shareholders.
In the first six months of 2016, we delivered comparable sales growth of 4.4%, in line with our plan. In the second quarter, comparable sales grew 2,%, driven primarily by a 1.7% increase in average ticket. 
As we've mentioned before, the timing of spring impacts the first half of the year. This year, the season began with robust demand for outdoor projects. Customers took advantage of favorable weather conditions in the first quarter to complete those projects. In the second quarter, we saw more strength in indoor project demand, leading to strong performance in lumber building materials, kitchens, tools and hardware and fashion fixtures. 
Our seasonal living business also performed well in the second quarter, driven predominantly by air conditioner and patio furniture sales. Healthy macro fundamentals, our project inspiration expertise and targeted promotions continue to drive demand, resulting in positive comps in 10 of 13 product categories. We were also pleased with the work we've done to further advance our product and service offerings to the Pro customer.
The strategic investments we've made to build deeper relationships with the Pro are allowing us to capitalize on strong Pro demand driven by a favorable macro backdrop, as our Pro business continued to perform well above the company average. 
Today, we have a strong foundation for the Pro customer including dedicated service in store, solid inventory depth, field-based Pro account executives and a national accounts team. Our LowesForPros.com 
website relaunched in the second quarter of last year continues to gain traction.
And we will continue to build on this strong foundation by incorporating the feedback we received from Pros and our ProServices team to constantly improve the customer experience and deepen our relationships with this important customer segment. 
From a geographic perspective, our U.S. home improvement business achieved 1.9% comps for the quarter, with all regions of the south and the west comping positively. Our northern regions were challenged by an abbreviated spring, which hindered outdoor activity. 
We continued our strong performance in international markets, including double-digit comps in Canada and Mexico in local currency. We closed the RONA acquisition on May 20, and I'm pleased with the progress of our integration. By bringing together Lowe's global scale and resources with RONA's local expertise, we can enhance relevance and expand customer reach ultimately enhancing our competitiveness and profitability in Canada, establishing a strong presence in Québec and positioning us to capitalize on the significant long-term potential of the market. We welcome RONA's talented team into the Lowe's family.
For the quarter, operating margin contracted 13 basis points, and we delivered earnings per share of $1.31, a 9% increase over last year's second quarter. These results include an $84 million loss in the foreign currency hedge entered into in advance of the RONA acquisition. This loss had a $0.06 impact on earnings per share for the quarter. 
Delivering our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter we repurchased
$1.2 billion of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $251 million in dividends.  
Looking ahead to the second half of 2016, the outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive. Persisting gains in the job market and disposable income growth that continues to outpace the economy should further contribute to solid growth in consumer spending. And the outlook for housing remains bright, with strong home sales and construction in the first half of the year poised to benefit growth in the second half of the year. With home value appreciation expected to persist and incomes continuing to rise, we expect homeowners to be motivated to spend on their homes. Overall, strong consumer housing fundamentals should continue to benefit the home improvement industry. 
Our second quarter Consumer Sentiment Survey showed similar trends. Consumers continue to view their personal finances and home values favorably, with half of homeowners believing the value of their home is increasing. We believe this positive sentiment around home values is driving home improvement spending. Consequently, we continue to see home improvement spending outpace overall consumer spending as well as positive home improvement project intentions, including strong engagement in big-ticket discretionary projects. 
Our key priorities in 2016 are focused on leveraging this favorable home improvement backdrop. We are pursuing further top line growth by differentiating ourselves in better omni-channel customer experiences that make us the project authority and continue to focus on improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer. At the same time, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability.  
The execution of our strategic priorities, along with a solid macroeconomic backdrop, gives us confidence in our business outlook for 2016. 
Before I close, I would like to express my appreciation for our employees' unwavering commitment to serving customers. In particular, I would like to thank those Lowe's team members who worked diligently to assist our neighbors that were impacted by the historic flooding in West Virginia and those that are now assisting our neighbors in Louisiana. In circumstances like these, we ship truckloads of critically needed supplies to affected areas, and many of our employees pledge their time to help individuals in need. Lowe's has also donated a total of $750,000 to the American Red Cross to assist with the relief efforts. 
Thanks again for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Mike."

In the second quarter, we achieved positive comps in 10 of 14 regions, with all regions in the south and west comping positively. This strength was offset by weakness in our northern regions. We also posted positive comps in 10 of 13 product categories. While comps were below expectation for the second quarter, we delivered a solid first half of the year, in line with our plan. 
As Robert mentioned, the season kicked off with stronger-than-expected outdoor project demand as customers took advantage of favorable weather, bolstered by a strong macroeconomic backdrop. We drove traffic in Q1 through compelling offers designed to take advantage of the early spring project demand, leveraging enhanced digital capabilities to reach the spring customer earlier in the season.
As we moved into Q2, we saw softer comps in May stemming both from Q1 project pull-forward and unfavorable weather. Temperatures below normal in our northern regions prevented customers from enjoying outdoor projects. As we moved into June and July, traffic rebounded and we capitalized on stronger demand for indoor projects and customers' continued desire to invest in their homes with our project inspiration and expertise and targeted promotions. This contributed to stronger performance in interior categories, such as kitchens and fashion fixtures. 
We also drove solid comps in appliances. And for the eighth time in the last 9 years, J.D. Power and Associates ranked Lowe's highest in customer satisfaction among appliance retailers based on the knowledge of sales specialists, breadth of assortment, competitive pricing and delivery.
To take advantage of increasing demand for kitchen projects and to ensure we provide a more holistic solution to a simple kitchen refresh or a full remodel, we display our kitchen solutions, including cabinets and countertops, immediately adjacent to our appliance offering so customers can both envision and design their dream kitchens. 
This quarter, we drove above-average comps in kitchens through a combination of project inspiration and expertise; our investment in project specialists, who meet the customers in their homes; and targeted promotions. 
Within fashion fixtures, we leverage our customer experience design capabilities to optimize our lighting reset, featuring an expanded collection of lighting styles, finishes and brands, including the expansion of Kichler Lighting, the largest lighting showroom brand in the industry, along with Progress Lighting and Quoizel Lighting. Adding to our attractive product offering, we also simplified the presentation, looping lighted fixtures by style and collection to provide a cohesive decorating solution and make selection easier. Customers have responded well, driving strong comps in fashion fixtures. We've also expanded this enhanced display approach to ceiling fans. 
Our shower door reset also leverages our customer experience design capabilities, enhancing our shower door offering by designing a complete solution for customer needs, providing a great line design, offering innovation and expanded selection and product delivery and installation services. In doing so, we are differentiating ourselves as the retail destination for bathroom refresh as well as the thought of being a best-in-class in-store customer experiences that can also serve as a selling center for Pros and our project specialist teams. We're also officially leveraging our network of regional distribution centers to offer customers product when and where they want it. 
Our seasonal living business also performed well in Q2, driven by robust air conditioner sales due to warmer-than-average temperatures and patio furniture and fashions. We also saw continued strong demand from the Pro customer, with comps well above the company average. Once again, productivity drove solid comps in lumber and building materials. 
Tools and hardware also benefited from increased project activity from both DIY and Pro customers. We're able to capitalize on this demand by improving our tool brand assortment with exclusives like Hitachi and Bostitch, the #1 and #2 brands in pneumatics; and the extension of brands like Vaughan; along with our extensive private label line of Kobalt tools. And we're proud to announce the return of yet another destination tool brand to Lowe's, Marshalltown, a trusted Pro brand and the leading supplier of cement masonry tools, which will roll out to our stores in the upcoming weeks. 
We also continue to focus on our strategic priorities, leveraging our omni-channel capabilities to help customers achieve great project results. Customers can engage with our associates in-store for extra advice, our content on Lowes.com for inspiration, our contact center for ongoing support or our project specialists who work with them in their homes. 
This quarter, we launched our new Lowes.com site, advancing our online shopping experience with optimized functionality and display for touch screen devices to support a better mobile experience; improved product and content recommendations; refined search algorithms; improved click-to-chat capabilities; larger project images; and expanded product views, including video content. As anticipated, following the launch, we had a brief period of disruption as customers increase their familiarity with the redesigned site. We are now seeing improved performance and have received great customer feedback on the new site. Our interior and exterior project specialists are now the critical element of our omni-channel strategy and a differentiated capability in capturing and serving project demand. They meet with customers in their homes to design, plan and manage their home improvement projects. Our exterior project specialists are currently available across all U.S. home improvement stores and we're expanding our interior project specialist program, reaching all U.S. stores by the end of this year. We are very pleased with our in-home sales program performance, with above-average comp growth again this quarter.
Our expertise in project inspiration, design, advice and execution are setting us apart as the project authority in home improvement at a time when consumers continue to demonstrate a desire to invest in their homes. 
We continue to advance our Pro business, driving comps well above the company average by continuing to optimize our product and service offering to better serve the Pro customer. Beyond improvements in our tools offering, we have also strengthened our portfolio of Pro-focused brands with the addition of GAF roofing, Owens Corning Installation, Lennox HVAC, Masonite entry and interior doors and Hubbell residential wiring devices. We are also working closely with our field-based merchandising team to identify local market opportunities and brands to further optimize our offering for the Pro customer. And with the relaunch of LowesForPros.com last year, we've also made it easy for Pros to manage multiple properties and quickly and easily purchase items nationwide. Thus far, we've been pleased with our program rollout, given positive customer response and results, which have exceeded our expectations. 
We're also serving the Pro customer through our Account Executive ProServices or AEPs. AEPs work with larger regional customers to help them order and replenish products across both geographies and locations. Our AEPs have been very effective in growing our business with larger Pro customers. We currently have over 200 Pro outside sales representatives in the field and continue to be very pleased with the program's results. Excluding the AEPs we added this year, we saw double-digit growth in AEP sales, which contributed to the strong Pro comp growth in the quarter. Building on this success, we continue to grow the program, adding additional AEPs to continue capturing market opportunity with large Pro customers. 
Our further -- our focus on further strengthening our portfolio of brands continue to build our omni-channel offering through our growing Pro services team, and our relaunch of LowesForPros.com are all a part of a broader commitment to build on a strong foundation with the Pro. 
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. For the quarter, gross margin declined 3 basis points. Our operating performance drove 17 basis points of improvement with the result of our ongoing line review process. 
The RONA transaction negatively impacted gross margin by 20 basis points, Bob will provide the details in a moment. 
As you can see, we had a solid first half of the year. As we look forward to the second half of 2016, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the favorable macroeconomic backdrop for the home improvement industry, and we continue to execute our strategic priorities and make progress on initiatives to drive top line growth, improve productivity and profitability. 
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I'll now turn the call over to Bob."

This is the first quarter that we're including RONA in our financial results.

This is the first quarter that we're including RONA in our financial results. While we closed the acquisition May 20, our second quarter includes only 5 weeks of RONA results, as they are consolidated on a 1-month lag. In conjunction with the transaction, RONA's operating results are adjusted to reflect purchase accounting as well as to align their accounting policies with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also regarding RONA, they will be included in our comp sales calculation after we anniversary the transaction in the second quarter of 2017. 
Now on to our Q2 results. Sales for the second quarter were $18.3 billion, an increase of 5.3%. Total customer transactions grew 3.7%, with RONA accounting for about 75% of the increase, and total average ticket increased 1.6% to $68.91. The sales increase was driven by the addition of RONA and increasing comp sales and new stores. For Q2, $461 million or 2.7% of the sales growth came from RONA. New stores contributed approximately 60 basis points of the sales growth.
Comp sales were 2%, driven by comp average ticket increase of 1.7% and comp transaction growth of 0.3%.
Looking at monthly trends, comps were negative 2.8% in May, positive 5% in June and positive 3.8% in July. The timing of Memorial Day and July 4th versus last year had fairly significant impacts on the monthly comps. We estimate that normalizing for these -- for the timing of the holidays, comps would have been positive all 3 months, with comps of 1.7% in May; 2% in June; and 2.3% in July. We estimate that weather negatively impacted comps sales in the quarter by 110 basis points. 
Year-to-date sales of $33.5 billion were up 6.4% versus the first half of 2015, driven by: a 4.4% increase in comp sales; 1.5% from RONA; and 0.5% from new stores. 
Gross margin for the second quarter was 34.44% of sales, which decreased 3 basis points from Q2 last year. Gross margin was negatively impacted by the RONA transaction due to both purchase accounting adjustments and mix. 
The purchase accounting adjustments were required to write the opening inventory balance up to fair value, as this product is sold, the higher cost of goods per gross margin. The mix impact was a function of RONA's lower gross margin rate. In the quarter, these items negatively impacted gross margin by 20 basis points, which more than offset 15 basis points of benefit from value improvement. 
Year-to-date gross margin was 34.71% of sales, a decrease of 21 basis points from the first half of 2015. SG&A for Q2 was 21.2% of sales, which deleveraged 26 basis points. The deleverage was primarily driven by a foreign currency transaction loss and store payroll. 
As mentioned on our first quarter call, in anticipation of the RONA acquisition, we entered into a foreign currency hedge to lock in the purchase price in U.S. dollars. In the first quarter, we recorded a $160 million unrealized gain. However, in the second quarter, the Canadian dollar strengthened, resulting in an $84 million loss. This item negatively impacted Q2 SG&A by 45 basis points. In the quarter, store payroll deleveraged 30 basis points, driven by wage pressure as well as lower-than-planned sales. These items were partially offset by 24 basis points of leverage in bonus and 16 basis points of leverage and employee insurance. 
Year-to-date SG&A was 21.69% of sales, which leveraged 70 basis points versus the first half of 2015. Depreciation for the quarter was $366 million, which was 2% of sales and leveraged 16 basis points. In Q2, earnings before interest and taxes were even -- decreased 13 basis points to 11.24% of sales. The RONA impacts to gross margin and the foreign currency hedge negatively impacted EBIT by 65 basis points in the quarter. For the first half of 2016, EBIT was 10.86% of sales, which was 68 basis points higher than the same period last year. 
For the quarter, interest expense was $166 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.1%. Earnings per share was $1.31 for the second quarter, an increase of 9.2% over last year. The foreign currency hedge negatively impacted earnings by $0.06 per share. For the first 6 months of 2016, earnings per share were $2.29, representing a 20.5% increase over the first half of 2015. The foreign currency hedge aided earnings per share by $0.05 in the first half of the year. 
Now to a few items in the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was $2 billion. Inventory at $10.6 billion increased $900 million or 9.3% versus Q2 last year. Approximately 85% of the increase relates to the addition of RONA. Inventory turnover was 3.89x, essentially flat to last year. Asset turnover increased 4 basis points to 1.78. 
Moving on to the liabilities section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable of $7.7 billion represented an 8% increase over Q2 last year due to the timing of purchases year-over-year, terms improvement as well as the addition of RONA. At the end of the second quarter, lease adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 2.45x. Return on invested capital was 15%. The net impact of last year's noncash impairment charge related to our Australian joint venture and this year's foreign currency hedge gain hurt ROIC by 194 basis points. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Year-to-date operating cash flow is $4.6 billion. Capital expenditures were $490 million, resulting in free cash flow of just over $4.1 billion, which is up 15% to last year. In May, we entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. At this point, we expect to receive approximately 6.3 million shares, but the open number of shares will be determined upon completion of the program in the third quarter. We also repurchased approximately 8.9 million shares for $700 million through the open market. In total, we repurchased $1.2 billion of stock in the quarter. We have approximately $1.2 billion remaining on the share repurchase authorization. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several items detailed and Lowe's business outlook. First, a reminder, fiscal 2016 will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for a total of 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the year. Second, since we've closed the RONA acquisition, our outlook now includes the impact of the transaction as well as their operating performance. Finally, the first half of 2016 came in essentially unplanned. We are confident in our ability to achieve our goals for the year. As a result, the only changes to our outlook are related to RONA. 
Now let's get into the outlook. As Robert noted, the forecast for home improvement industry remains positive. For 2016, we expect a total sales increase of approximately 10%, driven by a variety of factors. First, we are forecasting a comp sales increase of 4%. Second, we expect RONA to contribute 4% to sales growth. Next, we estimate that the 53rd week will aid total sales by 1.5%. Lastly, we plan to open approximately 45 stores, which adds 0.5%. 
For the EBIT growth rate, we are excluding the impact of last year's Australian joint venture impairment charge and this year's net FX hedge gain. We believe excluding these large onetime items is a better representation of our operating performance. We're anticipating an EBIT increase of approximately 50 basis points. While the acquisition of RONA adds EBIT dollars, there's a negative impact to the percent of sales. There are 2 factors causing this. First, RONA's EBIT is lower as a percent of sales. As part of our synergy case, we expect RONA's EBIT will improve over time. 
Second are the impacts of purchase accounting I noted a moment ago. This primarily hurts 2016 with minimal impact in 2017 and beyond. Combined, these items pressure EBIT by 35 basis points for the year. The negative impacts to Q3 and Q4 are estimated to be 60 and 50 basis points, respectively. For the year, we expect EBIT dollars to grow by approximately 16%. The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. For the year, on a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share of approximately $4.06. We are on target to hit our original 2016 operating plan. 
I'd like to walk you through our EPS outlook, starting with the $4 per share we communicated on the Q4 call in February.
From here, we add the net gain from the foreign currency hedge of $0.05. Lastly, we add $0.01 as we expect RONA's operating results to more than offset the acquisition and integration costs. As a result, we do expect the RONA transaction will be modestly accretive for the year. 
We are forecasting cash flow from operations to be approximately $5.6 billion. Our forecast for capital expenditures is approximately $1.5 billion. This results in an estimated free cash flow of $4.1 billion for 2016. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.5 billion in share repurchases for 2016.

We think about the impact that the weather had, the rain impact that we had in May, and then obviously, the late spring, which impacted the north and the extreme heat that we ran into later in the quarter. We still saw sequential improvement when we look at everything from talking to our Consumer Sentiment Survey, everything we heard from the consumer, they're still highly engaged in discretionary spending around the home driven by how they build out the overall housing market and the value of their home continuing to increase. So when we look at the macroeconomic environment and look at the impacts that weather had on our particular business in the quarter, it still sets us up incredibly well. Now I'll get Mike to jump in on some of the things that he thinks is going to drive the excitement for us on our outlook for the back half of the year and what we're focused on."

We're positioned to take advantage on some of the strong demand in the back half with expected interior projects. We've spoken about our project specialist program being expanded to all stores. I spoke earlier about the investment that we've made in digital. I like how we're positioned from a product perspective with our strength in appliances. Our full vignettes, our delivery, all brands and installation. I like how we're positioned in fashion lighting. With our 3-brand strategy around Kichler, Progress and Quoizel, our foreign lineup is second to none, with Pergo laminate, Cali Bamboo and our STAINMASTER brand. We like our position in paint. We've talked a lot about Sherwin-Williams, Valspar and PPG/Olympic, the exclusives that we have there. We've done a lot of work around stain, bringing back Cabot and expanding our Minwax. And if you think about the Pro business, we continue to be more relevant with Pro with return of brands like Marshalltown on top of those other brands that we took back and spoke to earlier in the year.

We continue to utilize media mix modeling so that we can optimize every dollar spent against the best return. We continue to migrate from print advertising and analog into digital. We're not seeing a fundamental shift in promotional cadence or promotional depth. So the market remains very rational in terms of promotions. But what we are seeing are new and enhanced techniques on getting our promotions in front of our customers. So as an example, we have a very strong social media footprint on Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram. In the second quarter, we drove 27 million impressions on social media alone, and that's on top of 32 million impressions in the first quarter. So with our digital capabilities and our ability to continue to flex promotions, we're finally getting the right promotion from the customer at the right time. So we're learning a lot.

However, with some of our interior lower categories, we actually saw very robust sales. And in paint, we had soft sales in exterior coatings, but positive comps in interior coatings. So another way to think about it, right, if I think about big-ticket strength, as an example, in the second quarter, kitchen cabinets actually showed strength. Chandeliers and vanity lightings were up double digit. Wooden vinyl flooring was up double-digit. Bath vanities were up double digit. We had some exterior projects that were up quite strong as well. Shingles were up double digits. Warding's [ph] up double digits. Fencing was up high single digits. But where we did we see a little softness was in exterior projects, and we tipped and typed that DIY customers would take on. So the macroeconomics feel pretty good.

As we said when we're putting the deal together, we have 3 core fundamental tenets of what we're doing with our integration and our plan. This is about revenue and cost synergies as we go about competing in the Canadian market with better customer relevance by leveraging our strengths and omni-channel and our approach to be able to bring all of our channels together to serve customers; our expanded customer reach through our strengths and expertise in key product categories, including introducing appliances into the RONA stores across the country; and then increased profitability. We do believe that the combined scale of our 2 organizations, both in our direct purchasing and our indirect purchasing as well as eliminating key things like public company cost will allow us the opportunity to possibly double profitability within the first 5 years.

We delivered a solid first half of the year and made continued progress against our key strategic priorities, providing better omni-channel experiences to more closely connect with customers, deepening",957,"Good morning, and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. We delivered a solid first half of the year and made continued progress against our key strategic priorities, providing better omni-channel experiences to more closely connect with customers, deepening our relationship with the Pro customer and driving productivity and profitability.
We continue to generate strong cash flows, enabling us to strategically invest in the business while returning capital to our shareholders.
In the first six months of 2016, we delivered comparable sales growth of 4.4%, in line with our plan. In the second quarter, comparable sales grew 2,%, driven primarily by a 1.7% increase in average ticket. 
As we've mentioned before, the timing of spring impacts the first half of the year. This year, the season began with robust demand for outdoor projects. Customers took advantage of favorable weather conditions in the first quarter to complete those projects. In the second quarter, we saw more strength in indoor project demand, leading to strong performance in lumber building materials, kitchens, tools and hardware and fashion fixtures. 
Our seasonal living business also performed well in the second quarter, driven predominantly by air conditioner and patio furniture sales. Healthy macro fundamentals, our project inspiration expertise and targeted promotions continue to drive demand, resulting in positive comps in 10 of 13 product categories. We were also pleased with the work we've done to further advance our product and service offerings to the Pro customer.
The strategic investments we've made to build deeper relationships with the Pro are allowing us to capitalize on strong Pro demand driven by a favorable macro backdrop, as our Pro business continued to perform well above the company average. 
Today, we have a strong foundation for the Pro customer including dedicated service in store, solid inventory depth, field-based Pro account executives and a national accounts team. Our LowesForPros.com 
website relaunched in the second quarter of last year continues to gain traction.
And we will continue to build on this strong foundation by incorporating the feedback we received from Pros and our ProServices team to constantly improve the customer experience and deepen our relationships with this important customer segment. 
From a geographic perspective, our U.S. home improvement business achieved 1.9% comps for the quarter, with all regions of the south and the west comping positively. Our northern regions were challenged by an abbreviated spring, which hindered outdoor activity. 
We continued our strong performance in international markets, including double-digit comps in Canada and Mexico in local currency. We closed the RONA acquisition on May 20, and I'm pleased with the progress of our integration. By bringing together Lowe's global scale and resources with RONA's local expertise, we can enhance relevance and expand customer reach ultimately enhancing our competitiveness and profitability in Canada, establishing a strong presence in Québec and positioning us to capitalize on the significant long-term potential of the market. We welcome RONA's talented team into the Lowe's family.
For the quarter, operating margin contracted 13 basis points, and we delivered earnings per share of $1.31, a 9% increase over last year's second quarter. These results include an $84 million loss in the foreign currency hedge entered into in advance of the RONA acquisition. This loss had a $0.06 impact on earnings per share for the quarter. 
Delivering our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter we repurchased
$1.2 billion of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $251 million in dividends.  
Looking ahead to the second half of 2016, the outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive. Persisting gains in the job market and disposable income growth that continues to outpace the economy should further contribute to solid growth in consumer spending. And the outlook for housing remains bright, with strong home sales and construction in the first half of the year poised to benefit growth in the second half of the year. With home value appreciation expected to persist and incomes continuing to rise, we expect homeowners to be motivated to spend on their homes. Overall, strong consumer housing fundamentals should continue to benefit the home improvement industry. 
Our second quarter Consumer Sentiment Survey showed similar trends. Consumers continue to view their personal finances and home values favorably, with half of homeowners believing the value of their home is increasing. We believe this positive sentiment around home values is driving home improvement spending. Consequently, we continue to see home improvement spending outpace overall consumer spending as well as positive home improvement project intentions, including strong engagement in big-ticket discretionary projects. 
Our key priorities in 2016 are focused on leveraging this favorable home improvement backdrop. We are pursuing further top line growth by differentiating ourselves in better omni-channel customer experiences that make us the project authority and continue to focus on improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer. At the same time, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability.  
The execution of our strategic priorities, along with a solid macroeconomic backdrop, gives us confidence in our business outlook for 2016. 
Before I close, I would like to express my appreciation for our employees' unwavering commitment to serving customers. In particular, I would like to thank those Lowe's team members who worked diligently to assist our neighbors that were impacted by the historic flooding in West Virginia and those that are now assisting our neighbors in Louisiana. In circumstances like these, we ship truckloads of critically needed supplies to affected areas, and many of our employees pledge their time to help individuals in need. Lowe's has also donated a total of $750,000 to the American Red Cross to assist with the relief efforts. 
Thanks again for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Mike."

In the second quarter, we achieved positive comps in 10 of 14 regions, with all regions in the south and west comping positively. This strength was offset by weakness in our northern regions. We also posted positive comps in 10 of 13 product categories. While comps were below expectation for the second quarter, we delivered a solid first half of the year, in line with our plan. 
As Robert mentioned, the season kicked off with stronger-than-expected outdoor project demand as customers took advantage of favorable weather, bolstered by a strong macroeconomic backdrop. We drove traffic in Q1 through compelling offers designed to take advantage of the early spring project demand, leveraging enhanced digital capabilities to reach the spring customer earlier in the season.
As we moved into Q2, we saw softer comps in May stemming both from Q1 project pull-forward and unfavorable weather. Temperatures below normal in our northern regions prevented customers from enjoying outdoor projects. As we moved into June and July, traffic rebounded and we capitalized on stronger demand for indoor projects and customers' continued desire to invest in their homes with our project inspiration and expertise and targeted promotions. This contributed to stronger performance in interior categories, such as kitchens and fashion fixtures. 
We also drove solid comps in appliances. And for the eighth time in the last 9 years, J.D. Power and Associates ranked Lowe's highest in customer satisfaction among appliance retailers based on the knowledge of sales specialists, breadth of assortment, competitive pricing and delivery.
To take advantage of increasing demand for kitchen projects and to ensure we provide a more holistic solution to a simple kitchen refresh or a full remodel, we display our kitchen solutions, including cabinets and countertops, immediately adjacent to our appliance offering so customers can both envision and design their dream kitchens. 
This quarter, we drove above-average comps in kitchens through a combination of project inspiration and expertise; our investment in project specialists, who meet the customers in their homes; and targeted promotions. 
Within fashion fixtures, we leverage our customer experience design capabilities to optimize our lighting reset, featuring an expanded collection of lighting styles, finishes and brands, including the expansion of Kichler Lighting, the largest lighting showroom brand in the industry, along with Progress Lighting and Quoizel Lighting. Adding to our attractive product offering, we also simplified the presentation, looping lighted fixtures by style and collection to provide a cohesive decorating solution and make selection easier. Customers have responded well, driving strong comps in fashion fixtures. We've also expanded this enhanced display approach to ceiling fans. 
Our shower door reset also leverages our customer experience design capabilities, enhancing our shower door offering by designing a complete solution for customer needs, providing a great line design, offering innovation and expanded selection and product delivery and installation services. In doing so, we are differentiating ourselves as the retail destination for bathroom refresh as well as the thought of being a best-in-class in-store customer experiences that can also serve as a selling center for Pros and our project specialist teams. We're also officially leveraging our network of regional distribution centers to offer customers product when and where they want it. 
Our seasonal living business also performed well in Q2, driven by robust air conditioner sales due to warmer-than-average temperatures and patio furniture and fashions. We also saw continued strong demand from the Pro customer, with comps well above the company average. Once again, productivity drove solid comps in lumber and building materials. 
Tools and hardware also benefited from increased project activity from both DIY and Pro customers. We're able to capitalize on this demand by improving our tool brand assortment with exclusives like Hitachi and Bostitch, the #1 and #2 brands in pneumatics; and the extension of brands like Vaughan; along with our extensive private label line of Kobalt tools. And we're proud to announce the return of yet another destination tool brand to Lowe's, Marshalltown, a trusted Pro brand and the leading supplier of cement masonry tools, which will roll out to our stores in the upcoming weeks. 
We also continue to focus on our strategic priorities, leveraging our omni-channel capabilities to help customers achieve great project results. Customers can engage with our associates in-store for extra advice, our content on Lowes.com for inspiration, our contact center for ongoing support or our project specialists who work with them in their homes. 
This quarter, we launched our new Lowes.com site, advancing our online shopping experience with optimized functionality and display for touch screen devices to support a better mobile experience; improved product and content recommendations; refined search algorithms; improved click-to-chat capabilities; larger project images; and expanded product views, including video content. As anticipated, following the launch, we had a brief period of disruption as customers increase their familiarity with the redesigned site. We are now seeing improved performance and have received great customer feedback on the new site. Our interior and exterior project specialists are now the critical element of our omni-channel strategy and a differentiated capability in capturing and serving project demand. They meet with customers in their homes to design, plan and manage their home improvement projects. Our exterior project specialists are currently available across all U.S. home improvement stores and we're expanding our interior project specialist program, reaching all U.S. stores by the end of this year. We are very pleased with our in-home sales program performance, with above-average comp growth again this quarter.
Our expertise in project inspiration, design, advice and execution are setting us apart as the project authority in home improvement at a time when consumers continue to demonstrate a desire to invest in their homes. 
We continue to advance our Pro business, driving comps well above the company average by continuing to optimize our product and service offering to better serve the Pro customer. Beyond improvements in our tools offering, we have also strengthened our portfolio of Pro-focused brands with the addition of GAF roofing, Owens Corning Installation, Lennox HVAC, Masonite entry and interior doors and Hubbell residential wiring devices. We are also working closely with our field-based merchandising team to identify local market opportunities and brands to further optimize our offering for the Pro customer. And with the relaunch of LowesForPros.com last year, we've also made it easy for Pros to manage multiple properties and quickly and easily purchase items nationwide. Thus far, we've been pleased with our program rollout, given positive customer response and results, which have exceeded our expectations. 
We're also serving the Pro customer through our Account Executive ProServices or AEPs. AEPs work with larger regional customers to help them order and replenish products across both geographies and locations. Our AEPs have been very effective in growing our business with larger Pro customers. We currently have over 200 Pro outside sales representatives in the field and continue to be very pleased with the program's results. Excluding the AEPs we added this year, we saw double-digit growth in AEP sales, which contributed to the strong Pro comp growth in the quarter. Building on this success, we continue to grow the program, adding additional AEPs to continue capturing market opportunity with large Pro customers. 
Our further -- our focus on further strengthening our portfolio of brands continue to build our omni-channel offering through our growing Pro services team, and our relaunch of LowesForPros.com are all a part of a broader commitment to build on a strong foundation with the Pro. 
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. For the quarter, gross margin declined 3 basis points. Our operating performance drove 17 basis points of improvement with the result of our ongoing line review process. 
The RONA transaction negatively impacted gross margin by 20 basis points, Bob will provide the details in a moment. 
As you can see, we had a solid first half of the year. As we look forward to the second half of 2016, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the favorable macroeconomic backdrop for the home improvement industry, and we continue to execute our strategic priorities and make progress on initiatives to drive top line growth, improve productivity and profitability. 
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I'll now turn the call over to Bob."

This is the first quarter that we're including RONA in our financial results. While we closed the acquisition May 20, our second quarter includes only 5 weeks of RONA results, as they are consolidated on a 1-month",1502,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. This is the first quarter that we're including RONA in our financial results. While we closed the acquisition May 20, our second quarter includes only 5 weeks of RONA results, as they are consolidated on a 1-month lag. In conjunction with the transaction, RONA's operating results are adjusted to reflect purchase accounting as well as to align their accounting policies with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also regarding RONA, they will be included in our comp sales calculation after we anniversary the transaction in the second quarter of 2017. 
Now on to our Q2 results. Sales for the second quarter were $18.3 billion, an increase of 5.3%. Total customer transactions grew 3.7%, with RONA accounting for about 75% of the increase, and total average ticket increased 1.6% to $68.91. The sales increase was driven by the addition of RONA and increasing comp sales and new stores. For Q2, $461 million or 2.7% of the sales growth came from RONA. New stores contributed approximately 60 basis points of the sales growth.
Comp sales were 2%, driven by comp average ticket increase of 1.7% and comp transaction growth of 0.3%.
Looking at monthly trends, comps were negative 2.8% in May, positive 5% in June and positive 3.8% in July. The timing of Memorial Day and July 4th versus last year had fairly significant impacts on the monthly comps. We estimate that normalizing for these -- for the timing of the holidays, comps would have been positive all 3 months, with comps of 1.7% in May; 2% in June; and 2.3% in July. We estimate that weather negatively impacted comps sales in the quarter by 110 basis points. 
Year-to-date sales of $33.5 billion were up 6.4% versus the first half of 2015, driven by: a 4.4% increase in comp sales; 1.5% from RONA; and 0.5% from new stores. 
Gross margin for the second quarter was 34.44% of sales, which decreased 3 basis points from Q2 last year. Gross margin was negatively impacted by the RONA transaction due to both purchase accounting adjustments and mix. 
The purchase accounting adjustments were required to write the opening inventory balance up to fair value, as this product is sold, the higher cost of goods per gross margin. The mix impact was a function of RONA's lower gross margin rate. In the quarter, these items negatively impacted gross margin by 20 basis points, which more than offset 15 basis points of benefit from value improvement. 
Year-to-date gross margin was 34.71% of sales, a decrease of 21 basis points from the first half of 2015. SG&A for Q2 was 21.2% of sales, which deleveraged 26 basis points. The deleverage was primarily driven by a foreign currency transaction loss and store payroll. 
As mentioned on our first quarter call, in anticipation of the RONA acquisition, we entered into a foreign currency hedge to lock in the purchase price in U.S. dollars. In the first quarter, we recorded a $160 million unrealized gain. However, in the second quarter, the Canadian dollar strengthened, resulting in an $84 million loss. This item negatively impacted Q2 SG&A by 45 basis points. In the quarter, store payroll deleveraged 30 basis points, driven by wage pressure as well as lower-than-planned sales. These items were partially offset by 24 basis points of leverage in bonus and 16 basis points of leverage and employee insurance. 
Year-to-date SG&A was 21.69% of sales, which leveraged 70 basis points versus the first half of 2015. Depreciation for the quarter was $366 million, which was 2% of sales and leveraged 16 basis points. In Q2, earnings before interest and taxes were even -- decreased 13 basis points to 11.24% of sales. The RONA impacts to gross margin and the foreign currency hedge negatively impacted EBIT by 65 basis points in the quarter. For the first half of 2016, EBIT was 10.86% of sales, which was 68 basis points higher than the same period last year. 
For the quarter, interest expense was $166 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.1%. Earnings per share was $1.31 for the second quarter, an increase of 9.2% over last year. The foreign currency hedge negatively impacted earnings by $0.06 per share. For the first 6 months of 2016, earnings per share were $2.29, representing a 20.5% increase over the first half of 2015. The foreign currency hedge aided earnings per share by $0.05 in the first half of the year. 
Now to a few items in the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was $2 billion. Inventory at $10.6 billion increased $900 million or 9.3% versus Q2 last year. Approximately 85% of the increase relates to the addition of RONA. Inventory turnover was 3.89x, essentially flat to last year. Asset turnover increased 4 basis points to 1.78. 
Moving on to the liabilities section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable of $7.7 billion represented an 8% increase over Q2 last year due to the timing of purchases year-over-year, terms improvement as well as the addition of RONA. At the end of the second quarter, lease adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 2.45x. Return on invested capital was 15%. The net impact of last year's noncash impairment charge related to our Australian joint venture and this year's foreign currency hedge gain hurt ROIC by 194 basis points. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Year-to-date operating cash flow is $4.6 billion. Capital expenditures were $490 million, resulting in free cash flow of just over $4.1 billion, which is up 15% to last year. In May, we entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. At this point, we expect to receive approximately 6.3 million shares, but the open number of shares will be determined upon completion of the program in the third quarter. We also repurchased approximately 8.9 million shares for $700 million through the open market. In total, we repurchased $1.2 billion of stock in the quarter. We have approximately $1.2 billion remaining on the share repurchase authorization. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several items detailed and Lowe's business outlook. First, a reminder, fiscal 2016 will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for a total of 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the year. Second, since we've closed the RONA acquisition, our outlook now includes the impact of the transaction as well as their operating performance. Finally, the first half of 2016 came in essentially unplanned. We are confident in our ability to achieve our goals for the year. As a result, the only changes to our outlook are related to RONA. 
Now let's get into the outlook. As Robert noted, the forecast for home improvement industry remains positive. For 2016, we expect a total sales increase of approximately 10%, driven by a variety of factors. First, we are forecasting a comp sales increase of 4%. Second, we expect RONA to contribute 4% to sales growth. Next, we estimate that the 53rd week will aid total sales by 1.5%. Lastly, we plan to open approximately 45 stores, which adds 0.5%. 
For the EBIT growth rate, we are excluding the impact of last year's Australian joint venture impairment charge and this year's net FX hedge gain. We believe excluding these large onetime items is a better representation of our operating performance. We're anticipating an EBIT increase of approximately 50 basis points. While the acquisition of RONA adds EBIT dollars, there's a negative impact to the percent of sales. There are 2 factors causing this. First, RONA's EBIT is lower as a percent of sales. As part of our synergy case, we expect RONA's EBIT will improve over time. 
Second are the impacts of purchase accounting I noted a moment ago. This primarily hurts 2016 with minimal impact in 2017 and beyond. Combined, these items pressure EBIT by 35 basis points for the year. The negative impacts to Q3 and Q4 are estimated to be 60 and 50 basis points, respectively. For the year, we expect EBIT dollars to grow by approximately 16%. The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. For the year, on a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share of approximately $4.06. We are on target to hit our original 2016 operating plan. 
I'd like to walk you through our EPS outlook, starting with the $4 per share we communicated on the Q4 call in February.
From here, we add the net gain from the foreign currency hedge of $0.05. Lastly, we add $0.01 as we expect RONA's operating results to more than offset the acquisition and integration costs. As a result, we do expect the RONA transaction will be modestly accretive for the year. 
We are forecasting cash flow from operations to be approximately $5.6 billion. Our forecast for capital expenditures is approximately $1.5 billion. This results in an estimated free cash flow of $4.1 billion for 2016. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.5 billion in share repurchases for 2016.

As you get into the back half, you start to lean more towards interior projects. Certainly less weather impact on interior projects. We're positioned to take advantage on some of the strong demand in the back half with expected interior projects. We've spoken about our project specialist program being expanded to all stores. I spoke earlier about the investment that we've made in digital. I like how we're positioned from a product perspective with our strength in appliances. Our full vignettes, our delivery, all brands and installation. I like how we're positioned in fashion lighting. With our 3-brand strategy around Kichler, Progress and Quoizel, our foreign lineup is second to none, with Pergo laminate, Cali Bamboo and our STAINMASTER brand. We like our position in paint. We've talked a lot about Sherwin-Williams, Valspar and PPG/Olympic, the exclusives that we have there. We've done a lot of work around stain, bringing back Cabot and expanding our Minwax. And if you think about the Pro business, we continue to be more relevant with Pro with return of brands like Marshalltown on top of those other brands that we took back and spoke to earlier in the year. So we think we're well positioned going into the second quarter -- excuse me, the second half. And we think the macro is going to play to avail a lot of investments, in particular on the interior strength and some of that demand."

It's  -- both the promotional landscape as well as marketing -- Digital Marketing, continue to evolve. We continue to utilize media mix modeling so that we can optimize every dollar spent against the best return. We continue to migrate from print advertising and analog into digital. We're not seeing a fundamental shift in promotional cadence or promotional depth. So the market remains very rational in terms of promotions. But what we are seeing are new and enhanced techniques on getting our promotions in front of our customers. So as an example, we have a very strong social media footprint on Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram. In the second quarter, we drove 27 million impressions on social media alone, and that's on top of 32 million impressions in the first quarter. So with our digital capabilities and our ability to continue to flex promotions, we're finally getting the right promotion from the customer at the right time. So we're learning a lot. We continue to evolve it, and it's an evolving space."

However, with some of our interior lower categories, we actually saw very robust sales. And in paint, we had soft sales in exterior coatings, but positive comps in interior coatings. So another way to think about it, right, if I think about big-ticket strength, as an example, in the second quarter, kitchen cabinets actually showed strength. Chandeliers and vanity lightings were up double digit. Wooden vinyl flooring was up double-digit. Bath vanities were up double digit. We had some exterior projects that were up quite strong as well. Shingles were up double digits. Warding's [ph] up double digits. Fencing was up high single digits. But where we did we see a little softness was in exterior projects, and we tipped and typed that DIY customers would take on. So the macroeconomics feel pretty good.

As we think about our gross margin performance, absent the RONA impact, up 17 basis points in the second quarter. Bob can take you through the array of options we have for promotions. But we do think about the tools and capabilities we have to align the promotional tactics around the categories and the timing to stimulate the demand and build baskets."

Our initial focus has been very much on placing the right leaders and the right structure in order to be able to manage the integration and to be able to manage the joint planning of the 2 organizations that we shape a new culture to compete in Canada. As we said when we're putting the deal together, we have 3 core fundamental tenets of what we're doing with our integration and our plan. This is about revenue and cost synergies as we go about competing in the Canadian market with better customer relevance by leveraging our strengths and omni-channel and our approach to be able to bring all of our channels together to serve customers; our expanded customer reach through our strengths and expertise in key product categories, including introducing appliances into the RONA stores across the country; and then increased profitability. We do believe that the combined scale of our 2 organizations, both in our direct purchasing and our indirect purchasing as well as eliminating key things like public company cost will allow us the opportunity to possibly double profitability within the first 5 years. All indications to date are that we're well on track for that and we're quite encouraged by what we see."

Our third quarter operating results were below our expectations due to slower sales in the first 2 months of the quarter. While we expected moderation in the second half of the year, as reflected in",984,"Good morning, and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. Our third quarter operating results were below our expectations due to slower sales in the first 2 months of the quarter. 
While we expected moderation in the second half of the year, as reflected in our guidance, traffic slowed more than we anticipated in August and September before improving in October, which put pressure on our profitability. Our third quarter comparable sales grew 2.7%, which was driven by a 0.5% increase in transactions and a 2.2% increase in average ticket. Our U.S. home improvement comp was 2.6%. The comps for our South and West divisions were in line with our expectations. In contrast, we experienced continued softness in our North division throughout the quarter. We posted positive comps in 11 of our 15 regions. Overall, we drove positive comps in 10 of our 13 product categories, while one category was also flat.
We saw relative strength in big-ticket purchases driven by outdoor power equipment and appliances. Continued strong demand from Pro customers was evident in lumber building materials as well as tools and hardware. And lawn guard also performed well as we helped customers tackle exterior maintenance and prepare their lawns for winter. 
We continue to be pleased with the performance of our Pro business as the strong foundation we built with this important customer drove comps well above the company average. And we remain focused on providing best-in-class omnichannel customer experiences that will make Lowe's the project authority. We continue to see strength in our Project Specialist Interiors program, with strong growth in both leads and comps again this quarter. And we posted 20% comp growth on Lowes.com, driven by robust growth in both transactions and ticket following our website redesign in Q2.
Our Orchard Supply Hardware business drove mid-single-digit comps for the quarter. And internationally, we continued our strong performance, including double-digit comps in Mexico and mid-single-digit comps in Canada in local currency. We also made continued progress on the integration of RONA, which remains on track. With RONA, we have fortified our Canadian market position, particularly in Québec. We are now well positioned to capitalize on the market's strong long-term fundamentals.
We reported earnings per share of $0.43 for the quarter, which included several noncash charges. First, we recorded further impairment on our investment in the Masters joint venture. Second, we wrote off products that were canceled as part of an ongoing review of our strategic initiatives in an effort to focus on critical projects that will drive our desired outcomes. And finally, we recorded goodwill and long-lived asset impairments associated with our Orchard Supply Hardware operations as part of our strategic reassessment of the business during the quarter. Bob will discuss these items in greater detail in his comments. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.88, an increase of 10% over the prior year. Delivering our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $550 million of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $309 million in dividends. As we look ahead, we are laser-focused on improving productivity across the organization. Our immediate focus is continuing to optimize associate hours to better match customer demand. And while we've made progress in driving productivity in recent years, we are in the process of evaluating meaningful incremental opportunities to drive shareholder value while continuing to meet customers' needs in an omnichannel environment. We look forward to discussing these opportunities with you at our upcoming Analyst and Investor Conference on December 7.
Turning to the economic landscape. We have a continued opportunity to benefit from a fundamentally solid but moderating home improvement market. Home improvement growth has continued to outpace overall retail sales thus far in the second half of the year. The industry will continue to benefit from several factors, including a solid consumer backdrop, lighting benefits from existing home sales and rising home prices that encourage the customer to engage in discretionary remodels and upgrades on top of routine maintenance. We believe that strengthening demand for revolving credit will also continue to support big-ticket spending, while moderating gains in the job market and incremental income growth should contribute to solid growth and overall consumer spending.
We expect that housing will continue to be a bright spot in the economy. Home sales started out quite strong in 2016 and are now moderating to a sustainable pace. Home price appreciation should persist, which, along with stronger incomes, should motivate more homeowners to spend on home improvements. We are also encouraged by growth in first-time homebuyer activity, which is expected to continue through 2017.
Our third quarter Consumer Sentiment Survey shows a similar trend, with consumers' favorable views around their personal finances holding steady. We continue to see supportive trends for the home improvement industry. Specifically, we found that over half of homeowners believe the value of their home is increasing. And home improvement spending intentions held steady, continuing to outpace overall spending intentions. 
While this was no doubt a challenging quarter, we will continue to better match leverage to [ph] demand and drive productivity. Importantly, our fundamental strategy remains intact. We will continue to focus on providing customers with the best omnichannel experiences to assist with their home improvement projects, whether they choose to connect in the store, online, in their home or through most contact centers. At the same time, Pro continues to outperform, and we will remain focused on deepening our relationship with this important customer. 
Before I close, I'd like to thank our employees for their incredible commitment to serving customers. Their dedication was certainly evident during times of need, including Hurricane Matthew and the extreme flooding in Louisiana. As true members of the community, the team helps customers prepare for and rebuild after these disasters.
Thank you again for your interest in Lowe's. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Rick."

As Robert mentioned, traffic slowed more than expected in the first 2 months of the quarter before improving in October.

As Robert mentioned, traffic slowed more than expected in the first 2 months of the quarter before improving in October. Our Labor Day and Columbus Day events drove sequential comp improvement in the South and the West, resulting in third quarter comps for those divisions that were in line with our expectations. However, we saw continued softness in our North division throughout the quarter. 
We posted positive comps in 10 of 13 product categories, while one category was flat. Both outdoor power equipment and lawn and garden performed well, given the focus on exterior maintenance and winter lawn preparation as well as opportunities from an extended planting and lawn cutting season. Once again, we drove above-average comps in appliances by leveraging our leading brands and service advantages as well as our investments in the customer experience, both in-store and online.
Within seasonal living, grills posted double-digit comps, bolstered by our Weber and Char-Broil brand partnerships. Additionally, our customer experience design capabilities continued to pay dividends. Leveraging our largest store format in a space that was initially planned for outdoor living experience, we created a seasonal stage to anticipate customers' needs for the season, showcasing an experience that helped drive a 65% comp in Halloween products and addressing power preparation needs like lawn care and seasonal maintenance. 
We have now transitioned this space to our holiday decor experience in preparation for the upcoming selling season. Once again, leveraging the seasonal stage, we intend to help customers refresh their homes for guests, decorate and organize their homes after the holidays.
We saw continued strong demand from the Pro customer with comps well above the company average. Pro activity drove solid comps in lumber and build materials and tools and hardware. We were able to capitalize on this demand by improving our total assortment with destination brands like Marshalltown, a trusted Pro brand and the leading supplier of cement masonry tools, which rolled out to stores this quarter. This adds to our impressive portfolio of Pro-focused tool brands, including exclusives like Hitachi and Bostitch, the #1 and #2 brands in pneumatics; Vaughan, a leader in the hammer category; and our extensive private-label line of Kobalt tools. 
The Louisiana floods and Hurricane Matthew drove broad-based demand across product categories. Our merchant, vendor, logistics and store teams worked closely together to identify the products needed before and after the storms and efficiently moved inventory to the areas of greatest need. Historically, most major storms have 4 distinct phases: first, preparation in advance of the storm; second, impact, when the storm actually causes damage; third, cleanup; and fourth, recovery, when customers begin to make repairs and replace damaged items.  In the third quarter, we experienced preparation, impact and some initial cleanup from Hurricane Matthew, and we entered the recovery phase from the Louisiana floods. We expect hurricane recovery to begin in the fourth quarter and extend into 2017. Bob will share further details about the impacts of these events in his comments. 
We continue to focus on our strategic priorities, one of which is leveraging our omnichannel capabilities to help customers achieve great project results. Customers can engage with our associates in-store for expert advice; our content on Lowes.com for inspiration; our contact centers for ongoing support; and our project specialists, who work with them in their homes to design, plan and manage their home improvement projects.
In the second quarter, we relaunched our Lowes.com site, providing an upgraded online shopping experience with optimized functionality and display for touch screen devices; improved product and content recommendations; refined search algorithms; larger product images; and expanded product views, including video content. We've seen a great response to the new website this quarter, which, along with our flexible fulfillment options of buy online, pickup in-store and buy online, deliver from store, combine to drive Lowes.com comp growth up 20%. 
Furthering our omnichannel capabilities, this quarter, we completed the national rollout of our interior project specialists. Both interior and exterior project specialists are now available across all U.S. home improvement stores to meet with customers and their homes to design, plan and complete their home improvement projects. This in-home selling program represents another critical element of our omnichannel strategy with a differentiated capability in capturing and servicing project demand. Our in-home sales program continues to outperform, with double-digit sales growth again this quarter. 
Our Pro business continues to thrive with comps well above the company average, driven by a favorable macro backdrop as well as our continued efforts to optimize our product and service offering to better serve the Pro customer. Beyond improvements in our tools offering, we have also strengthened our overall portfolio of Pro-focused brands and make necessary investments into our inventory depth to optimally serve the customer. And we continue to incorporate feedback from Pro customers and store employees into a better offering and experience while working to identify local market opportunities and introduce products optimized to local preferences to further increase our relevance with Pros. 
Our ProServices team continues to advance a multilevel customer engagement strategy across the country through LowesForPros.com and our national sales team at the market level, with our account executive ProServices, or AEPs, and at the store level with our dedicated in-store ProServices teams. Last year's relaunch of LowesForPros.com made it easy for Pros to manage multiple properties and quickly purchase items nationwide. This full omnichannel experience allows Pros to easily order online and choose their preferred fulfillment option of parcel, store pickup or store delivery, saving them both time and money. Our AEPs work with larger regional customers to help them order and replenish products across multiple geographies and locations. Our AEPs have been very effective in growing our business with larger Pro customers, especially maintenance, repair and operations, or MRO, customers. We currently have over 200 Pro outside sales representatives in the field that continue to be very pleased with the program's results. And once again, we saw double-digit growth in AEP sales this quarter, which contributed to the strong Pro comp growth.  Our focus on further strengthening our portfolio of brands, improving our inventory depth and continuing to build upon our omnichannel offering through our relaunch of LowesForPros.com and our growing ProServices team are all part of a broader commitment to build on a strong foundation with the Pro.
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. As Robert said, we are focused on optimizing associate hours to better match labor to customer demand. When we experienced softer sales in the early part of the quarter, we worked to adjust labor accordingly. In fact, payroll leverage improved substantially from August to September following our staffing adjustments. In order to maximize our profitability, we will continue to optimize our mix of customer-facing to noncustomer-facing hours.
While this was a challenging quarter, we continue to focus on executing our strategic priorities and making progress on our initiatives to drive top line growth and improve productivity and profitability.
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob."
180871,326105516,1087549,"Lowe's Companies, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2016",2016-11-16,"Earnings Calls","Lowe's Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. First, let me remind you that Q3 includes a full quarter of RONA's financial results. In conjunction with the transaction, RONA's operating results were adjusted to reflect purchase accounting as well as to align",1491,"Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. First, let me remind you that Q3 includes a full quarter of RONA's financial results. In conjunction with the transaction, RONA's operating results were adjusted to reflect purchase accounting as well as to align their accounting policies with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. They will be included in our comp sales calculation after we anniversary the transaction in the second quarter of 2017.
Now on to our Q3 results. Sales for the third quarter were $15.7 billion, an increase of 9.6%. Total customer transactions grew 7.5%, with RONA accounting for about 85% of the increase, and total average ticket increased 2% to $68.68. The sales increase was driven by the addition of RONA and increasing comp sales and new stores. For Q3, approximately $900 million or 6.3% of the sales growth came from RONA. New stores contributed approximately 60 basis points of the sales growth. Comp sales were 2.7%, driven by an average ticket increase of 2.2% and transaction growth of 0.5%. 
Looking at monthly trends. Comps were 1% in August, 2.1% in September and 5.1% in October. We estimate that the net impact of weather positively impacted comp sales in the quarter by approximately 60 basis points. The benefits of serving customers in storm-impacted areas was somewhat offset by heavy rain in the middle of the country in August as well as extreme heat early in the quarter. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 34.35% of sales, which decreased 40 basis points from Q3 last year. Gross margin was negatively impacted by RONA due to both purchase accounting adjustment and the mix of business. In the quarter, these items negatively impacted gross margin by 46 basis points. 
SG&A for the quarter was 25.98% of sales, which deleveraged 309 basis points. As Robert noted, there were several noncash charges negatively impacting our results. Our 1/3 interest in the Australian joint venture is classified as a long-term investment on our balance sheet. For the terms of the joint venture agreement, our investment should be valued as a going concern as of January 18, 2016, the date we exercised our put option. However, [indiscernible], the majority partner, has commenced the wind-down process. Given this unilateral action, accounting rules require us to recognize an incremental $290 million charge has [ph] contributed 184 basis points to the deleverage.  Our claim related to the going concern value as of January 18, which is above and beyond the amounts expected to be received through the wind-down process, will be recognized as realized. This matter is currently in arbitration.
Also, as part of an ongoing review of our strategic initiatives in an effort to focus on critical projects that will drive our desired outcomes, we made the decision to cancel and rescope a number of projects, resulting in a write-off of $96 million, which caused 60 basis points of deleverage. A number of these projects were technology-enabled, and we were trying to customize a solution. With technology advancing so rapidly, off-the-shelf products became less costly in a faster deployment alternative.
Lastly, we recorded $76 million of goodwill and long-lived asset impairments related to our Orchard Supply Hardware operations, resulting in 48 basis points of deleverage. We invested in Orchard in 2013 to capitalize on opportunities to significantly increase our market share in California. Post-acquisition, we made critical investments to improve the infrastructure and remodel retail facilities that, prior to bankruptcy, had been neglected.
In addition, we launched several initiatives as we worked to reinvigorate the Orchard business model. Specifically, we tested a variety of things, including new store opening density, new market penetration approaches and atypical prototypes to allow for more metro market penetration. Over the past 2 years, our combination of some tests proved more difficult to achieve, and pressures from the historic drought conditions on the gardening and nursery [ph] business have caused the business to perform below our expectations. Learnings from these tests have shaped how we take the brand and market opportunity forward. In fact, we begun to see these learnings reflected in our results. As Robert noted, Orchard grew mid-single-digit comps in the quarter. 
Adjusting for the noncash charges, SG&A for the quarter was 23.05% of sales, which deleveraged 16 basis points. This deleverage was from the following items: risk insurance, which is driven by a favorable adjustment last year that didn't repeat this year; private-label credit cost due to an increase in loan losses; and store payroll as a result of slow sales trends early in the quarter. These items were partially offset by 27 basis points of leverage in bonus. 
Depreciation for the quarter was $378 million, which was 2.4% of sales and leveraged 21 basis points. Earnings before interest and taxes decreased 328 basis points to 5.97% of sales. Adjusted EBIT decreased 35 basis points to 8.9% of sales.
RONA impacts associated with purchase accounting adjustments, the mix of business and integration costs negatively impacted EBIT by 55 basis points in the quarter.
For the quarter, interest expense was $163 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 51.2%. The higher rate was driven by the joint venture noncash charge, which was a long-term capital loss. Future recoveries related to our claim will be capital gain and result in a reduction in the effective tax rate in the quarter they are realized. 
Earnings per share were $0.43 for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.88. Earnings from RONA's operating results offset purchase accounting adjustments and integration costs. 
Now to a few items on the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was $960 million. Inventory of nearly [ph] $11 billion increased $556 million or 5.3% versus Q3 last year. The increase relates to the addition of RONA.
Inventory turnover was 3.89, up 4 basis points to last year. Asset turnover increased 4 basis points to 1.79. 
Moving on to the liabilities section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable of $7.8 billion represented a 6.8% increase over Q3 last year due to the timing of purchases year-over-year, terms improvement as well as the addition of RONA. At the end of the third quarter, lease-adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.36x.
Return on invested capital was 13.6%. The net impact of last year's noncash impairment charge related to our Australian joint venture and this year's foreign currency hedge gain and noncash charges hurt ROIC by 318 basis points.
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Year-to-date operating cash flow was $5.3 billion. Capital expenditures were $820 million, resulting in free cash flow of over $4.4 billion, which was up 20% to last year.
In August, we entered into a $250 million accelerated share repurchase agreement, which settled in the quarter for 3.4 million shares. Also, we repurchased approximately 3.9 million shares for $300 million through the open market. In total, we repurchased $550 million of stock in the quarter, with approximately $630 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several items detailing [ph] Lowe's business outlook: First, a reminder that fiscal 2016 will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for a total of 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the year. Also, based on our year-to-date operating performance and updated expectations for the fourth quarter, we revised our fiscal 2016 business outlook. 
For 2016, we now expect total sales increase of 9% to 10%, driven by a variety of factors: first, we're forecasting a comp sales increase of 3% to 4%; second, we expect RONA to contribute 4% to sales growth; next, we anticipate the 53rd week will aid total sales by 1.5%; lastly, we plan to open 40 stores, which adds 5/10 of 1% [ph]. On a GAAP basis, we're anticipating an EBIT increase of approximately 65 basis points. While the acquisition of RONA adds EBIT dollars, there's a negative impact to the percent of sales due to both RONA's lower EBIT rate and the impacts of purchase accounting I noted a moment ago. Combining these items pressure EBIT by 35 basis points for the year. Negative impacts to Q4 are estimated to be 40 basis points.
For Q4, on a GAAP basis, we expect EBIT improvement of approximately 490 basis points. The impact of last year's joint venture charge is 400 basis points. The remaining 90 basis points of expected EBIT growth comes from primarily expense leverage, notably bonus and depreciation.
The effective tax rate is expected to be 40.1%. The higher-than-expected rate is driven by the joint venture of noncash charge.
For the year, on a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share of approximately $3.52. We're forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5.6 billion. Our forecast for capital expenditures is approximately $1.5 billion, which results in estimated free cash flow of $4.1 billion for 2016. 
Our guidance assumes approximately $3.5 billion of share repurchase for 2016.

Overall, from the consumer standpoint, their desire -- their feelings about the home, the value of their home increasing, their intentions to invest in the home have all continued to be strong during the year. From the beginning of the year, based on what we saw in the data, we said that we thought our home improvement would -- overall factor would moderate some as we went through the year. So for example, total housing turnover is expected to be annualized up [ph] 4.8% versus 7.3% last year. Home price depreciation this year is forecast as 4.9% versus 5.5%. So still strong numbers but moderating disposable income at 2.3 -- 2.6% annualized this year versus 3.5% last year. And part of that was driven by the decreased turnover that we saw a year ago. We knew that, that would moderate some. So we still expect to have very healthy environment we still think the #1 driver that's out there is continued appreciation in homes, but it has moderated some.

As we think about the recovery efforts, mostly as Rick said, given the stage for Louisiana flooding, which is about 2/3 of the benefit we're seeing from the recovery efforts, that would have helped September about 90 basis points and would have helped the October by roughly 150 basis points.

As we spoke about the several quarters, the proconsumer continues to outpace our DIY consumer across the business portfolio. And I think a lot of that still continues to focus on really a few things that we've done, say, to continue to grow that customer. The merchants first have done an outstanding job in working with the operators to bring in the brands that really drive relevance with the Pro. We've talked a lot about that, but we don't want to underestimate the impact that having the right brands in our stores that these customers really value as they help us drive that business. Second thing that I would highlight is the fact that we continue to leverage our organization from that multilevel design approach to really be able to service these customers in a different and unique way, leveraging our national accounts teams to really help them from that perspective, diving deep at the market level and really working with our larger MRO customers or larger accounts to drive incremental share and be more relevant from that perspective; leveraging our 5 Ways to Save programs where I think our Pro sees significant value in the -- our initiatives to drive incremental value for them; the relaunch of LowesForPros.com from -- in Q2 of last year, which is really an informational site into a e-commerce site and a transactional site has continued to help us drive significant growth; and then fourth, the investments we've made into inventory to continue to improve our breadth and our depth of products that are really critical for this customer. So we see this as a continued evolution of our Pro initiative. We are extremely pleased with the receptivity of the Pro to the actions that we're taking.

This will reduce that depreciation trajectory somewhat for 2017, but nothing material."

Our third quarter operating results were below our expectations due to slower sales in the first 2 months of the quarter. 
While we expected moderation in the second half of the year, as reflected in our guidance, traffic slowed more than we anticipated in August and September before improving in October, which put pressure on our profitability. Our third quarter comparable sales grew 2.7%, which was driven by a 0.5% increase in transactions and a 2.2% increase in average ticket. Our U.S. home improvement comp was 2.6%. The comps for our South and West divisions were in line with our expectations. In contrast, we experienced continued softness in our North division throughout the quarter. We posted positive comps in 11 of our 15 regions. Overall, we drove positive comps in 10 of our 13 product categories, while one category was also flat.
We saw relative strength in big-ticket purchases driven by outdoor power equipment and appliances. Continued strong demand from Pro customers was evident in lumber building materials as well as tools and hardware. And lawn guard also performed well as we helped customers tackle exterior maintenance and prepare their lawns for winter. 
We continue to be pleased with the performance of our Pro business as the strong foundation we built with this important customer drove comps well above the company average. And we remain focused on providing best-in-class omnichannel customer experiences that will make Lowe's the project authority. We continue to see strength in our Project Specialist Interiors program, with strong growth in both leads and comps again this quarter. And we posted 20% comp growth on Lowes.com, driven by robust growth in both transactions and ticket following our website redesign in Q2.
Our Orchard Supply Hardware business drove mid-single-digit comps for the quarter. And internationally, we continued our strong performance, including double-digit comps in Mexico and mid-single-digit comps in Canada in local currency. We also made continued progress on the integration of RONA, which remains on track. With RONA, we have fortified our Canadian market position, particularly in Québec. We are now well positioned to capitalize on the market's strong long-term fundamentals.
We reported earnings per share of $0.43 for the quarter, which included several noncash charges. First, we recorded further impairment on our investment in the Masters joint venture. Second, we wrote off products that were canceled as part of an ongoing review of our strategic initiatives in an effort to focus on critical projects that will drive our desired outcomes. And finally, we recorded goodwill and long-lived asset impairments associated with our Orchard Supply Hardware operations as part of our strategic reassessment of the business during the quarter. Bob will discuss these items in greater detail in his comments. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.88, an increase of 10% over the prior year. Delivering our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $550 million of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $309 million in dividends. As we look ahead, we are laser-focused on improving productivity across the organization. Our immediate focus is continuing to optimize associate hours to better match customer demand. And while we've made progress in driving productivity in recent years, we are in the process of evaluating meaningful incremental opportunities to drive shareholder value while continuing to meet customers' needs in an omnichannel environment. We look forward to discussing these opportunities with you at our upcoming Analyst and Investor Conference on December 7.
Turning to the economic landscape. We have a continued opportunity to benefit from a fundamentally solid but moderating home improvement market. Home improvement growth has continued to outpace overall retail sales thus far in the second half of the year. The industry will continue to benefit from several factors, including a solid consumer backdrop, lighting benefits from existing home sales and rising home prices that encourage the customer to engage in discretionary remodels and upgrades on top of routine maintenance. We believe that strengthening demand for revolving credit will also continue to support big-ticket spending, while moderating gains in the job market and incremental income growth should contribute to solid growth and overall consumer spending.
We expect that housing will continue to be a bright spot in the economy. Home sales started out quite strong in 2016 and are now moderating to a sustainable pace. Home price appreciation should persist, which, along with stronger incomes, should motivate more homeowners to spend on home improvements. We are also encouraged by growth in first-time homebuyer activity, which is expected to continue through 2017.
Our third quarter Consumer Sentiment Survey shows a similar trend, with consumers' favorable views around their personal finances holding steady. We continue to see supportive trends for the home improvement industry. Specifically, we found that over half of homeowners believe the value of their home is increasing. And home improvement spending intentions held steady, continuing to outpace overall spending intentions. 
While this was no doubt a challenging quarter, we will continue to better match leverage to demand and drive productivity. Importantly, our fundamental strategy remains intact. We will continue to focus on providing customers with the best omnichannel experiences to assist with their home improvement projects, whether they choose to connect in the store, online, in their home or through most contact centers. At the same time, Pro continues to outperform, and we will remain focused on deepening our relationship with this important customer. 
Before I close, I'd like to thank our employees for their incredible commitment to serving customers. Their dedication was certainly evident during times of need, including Hurricane Matthew and the extreme flooding in Louisiana. As true members of the community, the team helps customers prepare for and rebuild after these disasters.
Thank you again for your interest in Lowe's. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Rick."

As Robert mentioned, traffic slowed more than expected in the first 2 months of the quarter before improving in October. Our Labor Day and Columbus Day events drove sequential comp improvement in the South and the West, resulting in third quarter comps for those divisions that were in line with our expectations. However, we saw continued softness in our North division throughout the quarter. 
We posted positive comps in 10 of 13 product categories, while one category was flat. Both outdoor power equipment and lawn and garden performed well, given the focus on exterior maintenance and winter lawn preparation as well as opportunities from an extended planting and lawn cutting season. Once again, we drove above-average comps in appliances by leveraging our leading brands and service advantages as well as our investments in the customer experience, both in-store and online.
Within seasonal living, grills posted double-digit comps, bolstered by our Weber and Char-Broil brand partnerships. Additionally, our customer experience design capabilities continued to pay dividends. Leveraging our largest store format in a space that was initially planned for outdoor living experience, we created a seasonal stage to anticipate customers' needs for the season, showcasing an experience that helped drive a 65% comp in Halloween products and addressing power preparation needs like lawn care and seasonal maintenance. 
We have now transitioned this space to our holiday decor experience in preparation for the upcoming selling season. Once again, leveraging the seasonal stage, we intend to help customers refresh their homes for guests, decorate and organize their homes after the holidays.
We saw continued strong demand from the Pro customer with comps well above the company average. Pro activity drove solid comps in lumber and build materials and tools and hardware. We were able to capitalize on this demand by improving our total assortment with destination brands like Marshalltown, a trusted Pro brand and the leading supplier of cement masonry tools, which rolled out to stores this quarter. This adds to our impressive portfolio of Pro-focused tool brands, including exclusives like Hitachi and Bostitch, the #1 and #2 brands in pneumatics; Vaughan, a leader in the hammer category; and our extensive private-label line of Kobalt tools. 
The Louisiana floods and Hurricane Matthew drove broad-based demand across product categories. Our merchant, vendor, logistics and store teams worked closely together to identify the products needed before and after the storms and efficiently moved inventory to the areas of greatest need. Historically, most major storms have 4 distinct phases: first, preparation in advance of the storm; second, impact, when the storm actually causes damage; third, cleanup; and fourth, recovery, when customers begin to make repairs and replace damaged items. In the third quarter, we experienced preparation, impact and some initial cleanup from Hurricane Matthew, and we entered the recovery phase from the Louisiana floods. We expect hurricane recovery to begin in the fourth quarter and extend into 2017. Bob will share further details about the impacts of these events in his comments. 
We continue to focus on our strategic priorities, one of which is leveraging our omnichannel capabilities to help customers achieve great project results. Customers can engage with our associates in-store for expert advice; our content on Lowes.com for inspiration; our contact centers for ongoing support; and our project specialists, who work with them in their homes to design, plan and manage their home improvement projects.
In the second quarter, we relaunched our Lowes.com site, providing an upgraded online shopping experience with optimized functionality and display for touch screen devices; improved product and content recommendations; refined search algorithms; larger product images; and expanded product views, including video content. We've seen a great response to the new website this quarter, which, along with our flexible fulfillment options of buy online, pickup in-store and buy online, deliver from store, combine to drive Lowes.com comp growth up 20%. 
Furthering our omnichannel capabilities, this quarter, we completed the national rollout of our interior project specialists. Both interior and exterior project specialists are now available across all U.S. home improvement stores to meet with customers and their homes to design, plan and complete their home improvement projects. This in-home selling program represents another critical element of our omnichannel strategy with a differentiated capability in capturing and servicing project demand. Our in-home sales program continues to outperform, with double-digit sales growth again this quarter. 
Our Pro business continues to thrive with comps well above the company average, driven by a favorable macro backdrop as well as our continued efforts to optimize our product and service offering to better serve the Pro customer. Beyond improvements in our tools offering, we have also strengthened our overall portfolio of Pro-focused brands and make necessary investments into our inventory depth to optimally serve the customer. And we continue to incorporate feedback from Pro customers and store employees into a better offering and experience while working to identify local market opportunities and introduce products optimized to local preferences to further increase our relevance with Pros. 
Our ProServices team continues to advance a multilevel customer engagement strategy across the country through LowesForPros.com and our national sales team at the market level, with our account executive ProServices, or AEPs, and at the store level with our dedicated in-store ProServices teams. Last year's relaunch of LowesForPros.com made it easy for Pros to manage multiple properties and quickly purchase items nationwide. This full omnichannel experience allows Pros to easily order online and choose their preferred fulfillment option of parcel, store pickup or store delivery, saving them both time and money. Our AEPs work with larger regional customers to help them order and replenish products across multiple geographies and locations. Our AEPs have been very effective in growing our business with larger Pro customers, especially maintenance, repair and operations, or MRO, customers. We currently have over 200 Pro outside sales representatives in the field that continue to be very pleased with the program's results. And once again, we saw double-digit growth in AEP sales this quarter, which contributed to the strong Pro comp growth. Our focus on further strengthening our portfolio of brands, improving our inventory depth and continuing to build upon our omnichannel offering through our relaunch of LowesForPros.com and our growing ProServices team are all part of a broader commitment to build on a strong foundation with the Pro.
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. As Robert said, we are focused on optimizing associate hours to better match labor to customer demand. When we experienced softer sales in the early part of the quarter, we worked to adjust labor accordingly. In fact, payroll leverage improved substantially from August to September following our staffing adjustments. In order to maximize our profitability, we will continue to optimize our mix of customer-facing to noncustomer-facing hours.
While this was a challenging quarter, we continue to focus on executing our strategic priorities and making progress on our initiatives to drive top line growth and improve productivity and profitability.
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob."
180871,326105516,1087654,"Lowe's Companies, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2016",2016-11-16,"Earnings Calls","Lowe's Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. First, let me remind you that Q3 includes a full quarter of RONA's financial results. In conjunction with the transaction, RONA's operating results were adjusted to reflect purchase accounting as well as to align",1485,"Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. First, let me remind you that Q3 includes a full quarter of RONA's financial results. In conjunction with the transaction, RONA's operating results were adjusted to reflect purchase accounting as well as to align their accounting policies with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. They will be included in our comp sales calculation after we anniversary the transaction in the second quarter of 2017.
Now on to our Q3 results. Sales for the third quarter were $15.7 billion, an increase of 9.6%. Total customer transactions grew 7.5%, with RONA accounting for about 85% of the increase, and total average ticket increased 2% to $68.68. The sales increase was driven by the addition of RONA and increasing comp sales and new stores. For Q3, approximately $900 million or 6.3% of the sales growth came from RONA. New stores contributed approximately 60 basis points of the sales growth. Comp sales were 2.7%, driven by an average ticket increase of 2.2% and transaction growth of 0.5%. 
Looking at monthly trends. Comps were 1% in August, 2.1% in September and 5.1% in October. We estimate that the net impact of weather positively impacted comp sales in the quarter by approximately 60 basis points. The benefits of serving customers in storm-impacted areas was somewhat offset by heavy rain in the middle of the country in August as well as extreme heat early in the quarter. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 34.35% of sales, which decreased 40 basis points from Q3 last year. Gross margin was negatively impacted by RONA due to both purchase accounting adjustment and the mix of business. In the quarter, these items negatively impacted gross margin by 46 basis points. 
SG&A for the quarter was 25.98% of sales, which deleveraged 309 basis points. As Robert noted, there were several noncash charges negatively impacting our results. Our 1/3 interest in the Australian joint venture is classified as a long-term investment on our balance sheet. For the terms of the joint venture agreement, our investment should be valued as a going concern as of January 18, 2016, the date we exercised our put option. However, [indiscernible], the majority partner, has commenced the wind-down process. Given this unilateral action, accounting rules require us to recognize an incremental $290 million charge has contributed 184 basis points to the deleverage. Our claim related to the going concern value as of January 18, which is above and beyond the amounts expected to be received through the wind-down process, will be recognized as realized. This matter is currently in arbitration.
Also, as part of an ongoing review of our strategic initiatives in an effort to focus on critical projects that will drive our desired outcomes, we made the decision to cancel and rescope a number of projects, resulting in a write-off of $96 million, which caused 60 basis points of deleverage. A number of these projects were technology-enabled, and we were trying to customize a solution. With technology advancing so rapidly, off-the-shelf products became less costly in a faster deployment alternative.
Lastly, we recorded $76 million of goodwill and long-lived asset impairments related to our Orchard Supply Hardware operations, resulting in 48 basis points of deleverage. We invested in Orchard in 2013 to capitalize on opportunities to significantly increase our market share in California. Post-acquisition, we made critical investments to improve the infrastructure and remodel retail facilities that, prior to bankruptcy, had been neglected.
In addition, we launched several initiatives as we worked to reinvigorate the Orchard business model. Specifically, we tested a variety of things, including new store opening density, new market penetration approaches and atypical prototypes to allow for more metro market penetration. Over the past 2 years, our combination of some tests proved more difficult to achieve, and pressures from the historic drought conditions on the gardening and nursery business have caused the business to perform below our expectations. Learnings from these tests have shaped how we take the brand and market opportunity forward. In fact, we begun to see these learnings reflected in our results. As Robert noted, Orchard grew mid-single-digit comps in the quarter. 
Adjusting for the noncash charges, SG&A for the quarter was 23.05% of sales, which deleveraged 16 basis points. This deleverage was from the following items: risk insurance, which is driven by a favorable adjustment last year that didn't repeat this year; private-label credit cost due to an increase in loan losses; and store payroll as a result of slow sales trends early in the quarter. These items were partially offset by 27 basis points of leverage in bonus. 
Depreciation for the quarter was $378 million, which was 2.4% of sales and leveraged 21 basis points. Earnings before interest and taxes decreased 328 basis points to 5.97% of sales. Adjusted EBIT decreased 35 basis points to 8.9% of sales.
RONA impacts associated with purchase accounting adjustments, the mix of business and integration costs negatively impacted EBIT by 55 basis points in the quarter.
For the quarter, interest expense was $163 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 51.2%. The higher rate was driven by the joint venture noncash charge, which was a long-term capital loss. Future recoveries related to our claim will be capital gain and result in a reduction in the effective tax rate in the quarter they are realized. 
Earnings per share were $0.43 for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.88. Earnings from RONA's operating results offset purchase accounting adjustments and integration costs. 
Now to a few items on the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was $960 million. Inventory at nearly $11 billion increased $556 million or 5.3% versus Q3 last year. The increase relates to the addition of RONA.
Inventory turnover was 3.89, up 4 basis points to last year. Asset turnover increased 4 basis points to 1.79. 
Moving on to the liabilities section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable of $7.8 billion represented a 6.8% increase over Q3 last year due to the timing of purchases year-over-year, terms improvement as well as the addition of RONA. At the end of the third quarter, lease-adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.36x.
Return on invested capital was 13.6%. The net impact of last year's noncash impairment charge related to our Australian joint venture and this year's foreign currency hedge gain and noncash charges hurt ROIC by 318 basis points.
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Year-to-date operating cash flow was $5.3 billion. Capital expenditures were $820 million, resulting in free cash flow of over $4.4 billion, which was up 20% to last year.
In August, we entered into a $250 million accelerated share repurchase agreement, which settled in the quarter for 3.4 million shares. Also, we repurchased approximately 3.9 million shares for $300 million through the open market. In total, we repurchased $550 million of stock in the quarter, with approximately $630 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several items and details in Lowe's business outlook: First, a reminder that fiscal 2016 will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for a total of 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the year. Also, based on our year-to-date operating performance and updated expectations for the fourth quarter, we revised our fiscal 2016 business outlook. 
For 2016, we now expect total sales increase of 9% to 10%, driven by a variety of factors: first, we're forecasting a comp sales increase of 3% to 4%; second, we expect RONA to contribute 4% to sales growth; next, we anticipate the 53rd week will aid total sales by 1.5%; lastly, we plan to open 40 stores, which adds 0.5%. On a GAAP basis, we're anticipating an EBIT increase of approximately 65 basis points. While the acquisition of RONA adds EBIT dollars, there's a negative impact to the percent of sales due to both RONA's lower EBIT rate and the impacts of purchase accounting I noted a moment ago. Combining these items pressure EBIT by 35 basis points for the year. Negative impacts to Q4 are estimated to be 40 basis points.
For Q4, on a GAAP basis, we expect EBIT improvement of approximately 490 basis points. The impact of last year's joint venture charge is 400 basis points. The remaining 90 basis points of expected EBIT growth comes from primarily expense leverage, notably bonus and depreciation.
The effective tax rate is expected to be 40.1%. The higher-than-expected rate is driven by the joint venture noncash charge.
For the year, on a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share of approximately $3.52. We're forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5.6 billion. Our forecast for capital expenditures is approximately $1.5 billion, which results in estimated free cash flow of $4.1 billion for 2016. 
Our guidance assumes approximately $3.5 billion of share repurchase for 2016.

I'll -- glad to clarify that for you. Overall, from the consumer standpoint, their desire -- their feelings around the home, the value of their home increasing, their intentions to invest in the home have all continued to be strong during the year. From the beginning of the year, based on what we saw in the data, we said that we thought home improvement would -- the overall factors would moderate some as we went through the year. So for example, total housing turnover is expected to be annualized at 4.8% versus 7.3% last year. Home price depreciation this year forecast is 4.9% versus 5.5% last year. So still strong numbers, but moderating disposable income at 2.3 -- 2.6% annualized this year versus 3.5% last year. And part of that was driven by the decreased turnover that we saw a year ago. We knew that, that would moderate some. So we still expect to be in a very healthy environment. We still think the #1 driver that's out there is continued appreciation in homes, but it has moderated some. So still a very healthy industry, but not to the extent that we would have seen the numbers supporting a year ago."

So it is driving additional traffic to drive additional sales on the one hand. On the other hand, it is rationalizing our cost across the organization. So it really is a two-pronged approach. Specifically, with regard to Orchard that you mentioned, as Bob talked a little bit about in his comments, we bought it out of bankruptcy. The impact on the customer franchise from bankruptcy, the remodeling of the stores, the fact that we had to change the technology and platform out there and bring it up to speed, all of those things. The lifting was just a little heavier than we thought, but we're at a great point now as we're starting to see our great performance in the fundamental stores that are out, and we've kind of rationalized how we're going to use Orchard going forward. So we're still very optimistic about what we can -- what Orchard can do for us. Just getting to this point was a little bit more difficult than we had anticipated so..."

So the net impact was probably 80 basis points unfavorable in August. As we think about the recovery efforts, mostly, as Rick said, given the stage for Louisiana flooding, which is about 2/3 of the benefit we're seeing from the recovery efforts, that would have helped September about 90 basis points and would have helped the October by roughly 150 basis points.

As we've talked about over the past several quarters, the Pro consumer continues to outpace our DIY consumer across the business portfolio.

The merchants, first, have done an outstanding job in working with the operators to bring in the brands that really drive relevance with the Pro. We've talked a lot about that. But we don't want to underestimate the impact that having the right brands in our stores that these customers really value does help us drive that business. Second thing that I would highlight is the fact that we continue to leverage our organization from that multilevel design approach to really be able to service these customers in a different and unique way, leveraging our national accounts teams to really help them from that perspective, diving deep at the market level and really working with our larger MRO customers and the larger accounts to drive incremental share and be more relevant from that perspective; leveraging our 5 Ways to Save programs, where I think our Pro see significant value in the -- our initiatives to drive incremental value for them; the relaunch of LowesForPros.com from -- in Q2 of last year, which is really an informational site into a commerce site, and the transactional site has continued to help us drive significant growth; and then, fourth, the investments we'd made into inventory to continue to improve our breadth and our depth of products that are really critical for this customer. So we see this as a continued evolution of our Pro initiative. We are extremely pleased with the receptivity of the Pro to the actions that we're taking.

Our third quarter operating results were below our expectations due to slower sales in the first 2 months of the quarter. 
While we expected moderation in the second half of the year, as reflected in our guidance, traffic slowed more than we anticipated in August and September before improving in October, which put pressure on our profitability. Our third quarter comparable sales grew 2.7%, which was driven by a 0.5% increase in transactions and a 2.2% increase in average ticket. Our U.S. home improvement comp was 2.6%. The comps for our South and West divisions were in line with our expectations. In contrast, we experienced continued softness in our North division throughout the quarter. We posted positive comps in 11 of our 15 regions. Overall, we drove positive comps in 10 of our 13 product categories, while one category was also flat.
We saw relative strength in big-ticket purchases driven by outdoor power equipment and appliances. Continued strong demand from Pro customers was evident in lumber building materials as well as tools and hardware. And lawn guard also performed well as we helped customers tackle exterior maintenance and prepare their lawns for winter. 
We continue to be pleased with the performance of our Pro business as the strong foundation we built with this important customer drove comps well above the company average. And we remain focused on providing best-in-class omnichannel customer experiences that will make Lowe's the project authority. We continue to see strength in our Project Specialist Interiors program, with strong growth in both leads and comps again this quarter. And we posted 20% comp growth on Lowes.com, driven by robust growth in both transactions and ticket following our website redesign in Q2.
Our Orchard Supply Hardware business drove mid-single-digit comps for the quarter. And internationally, we continued our strong performance, including double-digit comps in Mexico and mid-single-digit comps in Canada in local currency. We also made continued progress on the integration of RONA, which remains on track. With RONA, we have fortified our Canadian market position, particularly in Québec. We are now well positioned to capitalize on the market's strong long-term fundamentals.
We reported earnings per share of $0.43 for the quarter, which included several noncash charges. First, we recorded further impairment on our investment in the Masters joint venture. Second, we wrote off projects that were canceled as part of an ongoing review of our strategic initiatives in an effort to focus on critical projects that will drive our desired outcomes. And finally, we recorded goodwill and long-lived asset impairments associated with our Orchard Supply Hardware operations as part of our strategic reassessment of the business during the quarter. Bob will discuss these items in greater detail in his comments. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.88, an increase of 10% over the prior year. Delivering our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $550 million of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $309 million in dividends. As we look ahead, we are laser-focused on improving productivity across the organization. Our immediate focus is continuing to optimize associate hours to better match customer demand. And while we've made progress in driving productivity in recent years, we are in the process of evaluating meaningful incremental opportunities to drive shareholder value while continuing to meet customers' needs in an omnichannel environment. We look forward to discussing these opportunities with you at our upcoming Analyst and Investor Conference on December 7.
Turning to the economic landscape. We have a continued opportunity to benefit from a fundamentally solid but moderating home improvement market. Home improvement growth has continued to outpace overall retail sales thus far in the second half of the year. The industry will continue to benefit from several factors, including a solid consumer backdrop, lighting benefits from existing home sales and rising home prices that encourage the customer to engage in discretionary remodels and upgrades on top of routine maintenance. We believe that strengthening demand for revolving credit will also continue to support big-ticket spending, while moderating gains in the job market and incremental income growth should contribute to solid growth and overall consumer spending.
We expect that housing will continue to be a bright spot in the economy. Home sales started out quite strong in 2016 and are now moderating to a sustainable pace. Home price appreciation should persist, which, along with stronger incomes, should motivate more homeowners to spend on home improvements. We are also encouraged by growth in first-time homebuyer activity, which is expected to continue through 2017.
Our third quarter Consumer Sentiment Survey shows a similar trend, with consumers' favorable views around their personal finances holding steady. We continue to see supportive trends for the home improvement industry. Specifically, we found that over half of homeowners believe the value of their home is increasing. And home improvement spending intentions held steady, continuing to outpace overall spending intentions. 
While this was no doubt a challenging quarter, we will continue to better match leverage to demand and drive productivity. Importantly, our fundamental strategy remains intact. We will continue to focus on providing customers with the best omnichannel experiences to assist with their home improvement projects, whether they choose to connect in the store, online, in their home or through most contact centers. At the same time, Pro continues to outperform, and we will remain focused on deepening our relationship with this important customer. 
Before I close, I'd like to thank our employees for their incredible commitment to serving customers. Their dedication was certainly evident during times of need, including Hurricane Matthew and the extreme flooding in Louisiana. As true members of the community, the team helped customers prepare for and rebuild after these disasters.
Thank you again for your interest in Lowe's. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Rick."

As Robert mentioned, traffic slowed more than expected in the first 2 months of the quarter before improving in October. Our Labor Day and Columbus Day events drove sequential comp improvement in the South and the West, resulting in third quarter comps for those divisions that were in line with our expectations. However, we saw continued softness in our North division throughout the quarter. 
We posted positive comps in 10 of 13 product categories, while one category was flat. Both outdoor power equipment and lawn and garden performed well, given the focus on exterior maintenance and winter lawn preparation as well as opportunities from an extended planting and lawn cutting season. Once again, we drove above-average comps in appliances by leveraging our leading brands and service advantages as well as our investments in the customer experience, both in-store and online.
Within seasonal living, grills posted double-digit comps, bolstered by our Weber and Char-Broil brand partnerships. Additionally, our customer experience design capabilities continued to pay dividends. Leveraging our largest store format in a space that was initially planned for outdoor living experience, we created a seasonal stage to anticipate customers' needs for the season, showcasing an experience that helped drive a 65% comp in Halloween products and addressing power preparation needs like lawn care and seasonal maintenance. 
We have now transitioned this space to our holiday decor experience in preparation for the upcoming selling season. Once again, leveraging the seasonal stage, we intend to help customers refresh their homes for guests, decorate and organize their homes after the holidays.
We saw continued strong demand from the Pro customer with comps well above the company average. Pro activity drove solid comps in lumber and build materials and tools and hardware. We were able to capitalize on this demand by improving our total assortment with destination brands like Marshalltown, a trusted Pro brand and the leading supplier of cement masonry tools, which rolled out to stores this quarter. This adds to our impressive portfolio of Pro-focused tool brands, including exclusives like Hitachi and Bostitch, the #1 and #2 brands in pneumatics; Vaughan, a leader in the hammer category; and our extensive private-label line of Kobalt tools. 
The Louisiana floods and Hurricane Matthew drove broad-based demand across product categories. Our merchant, vendor, logistics and store teams worked closely together to identify the products needed before and after the storms and efficiently moved inventory to the areas of greatest need. Historically, most major storms have 4 distinct phases: first, preparation in advance of the storm; second, impact, when the storm actually causes damage; third, cleanup; and fourth, recovery, when customers begin to make repairs and replace damaged items. In the third quarter, we experienced preparation, impact and some initial cleanup from Hurricane Matthew, and we're into the recovery phase from the Louisiana floods. We expect hurricane recovery to begin in the fourth quarter and extend into 2017. Bob will share further details about the impacts of these events in his comments. 
We continue to focus on our strategic priorities, one of which is leveraging our omnichannel capabilities to help customers achieve great project results. Customers can engage with our associates in-store for expert advice; our content on Lowes.com for inspiration; our contact centers for ongoing support; and our project specialists, who work with them in their homes to design, plan and manage their home improvement projects.
In the second quarter, we relaunched our Lowes.com site, providing an upgraded online shopping experience with optimized functionality and display for touch screen devices; improved product and content recommendations; refined search algorithms; larger product images; and expanded product views, including video content. We've seen a great response to the new website this quarter, which, along with our flexible fulfillment options of buy online, pickup in-store and buy online, deliver from store, combine to drive Lowes.com comp growth up 20%. 
Furthering our omnichannel capabilities, this quarter, we completed the national rollout of our interior project specialists. Both interior and exterior project specialists are now available across all U.S. home improvement stores to meet with customers and their homes to design, plan and complete their home improvement projects. This in-home selling program represents another critical element of our omnichannel strategy with a differentiated capability in capturing and servicing project demand. Our in-home sales program continues to outperform, with double-digit sales growth again this quarter. 
Our Pro business continues to thrive with comps well above the company average, driven by a favorable macro backdrop as well as our continued efforts to optimize our product and service offering to better serve the Pro customer. Beyond improvements in our tools offering, we have also strengthened our overall portfolio of Pro-focused brands and make necessary investments into our inventory depth to optimally serve the Pro customer. And we continue to incorporate feedback from Pro customers and store employees into a better offering and experience while working to identify local market opportunities and introduce products optimized to local preferences to further increase our relevance with Pros. 
Our ProServices team continues to advance a multilevel customer engagement strategy across the country through LowesForPros.com and our national sales team at the market level, with our account executive ProServices, or AEPs, and at the store level with our dedicated in-store ProServices teams. Last year's relaunch of LowesForPros.com made it easy for Pros to manage multiple properties and quickly purchase items nationwide. This full omnichannel experience allows Pros to easily order online and choose their preferred fulfillment option of parcel, store pickup or store delivery, saving them both time and money. Our AEPs work with larger regional customers to help them order and replenish products across multiple geographies and locations. Our AEPs have been very effective in growing our business with larger Pro customers, especially maintenance, repair and operations, or MRO, customers. We currently have over 200 Pro outside sales representatives in the field that continue to be very pleased with the program's results. And once again, we saw double-digit growth in AEP sales this quarter, which contributed to the strong Pro comp growth. Our focus on further strengthening our portfolio of brands, improving our inventory depth and continuing to build upon our omnichannel offering through our relaunch of LowesForPros.com and our growing ProServices team are all part of a broader commitment to build on a strong foundation with the Pro.
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. As Robert said, we are focused on optimizing associate hours to better match labor to customer demand. When we experienced softer sales in the early part of the quarter, we worked to adjust labor accordingly. In fact, payroll leverage improved substantially from August to September following our staffing adjustments. In order to maximize our profitability, we will continue to optimize our mix of customer-facing to noncustomer-facing hours.
While this was a challenging quarter, we continue to focus on executing our strategic priorities and making progress on our initiatives to drive top line growth and improve productivity and profitability.
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob."
180871,326105516,1088034,"Lowe's Companies, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2016",2016-11-16,"Earnings Calls","Lowe's Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. First, let me remind you that Q3 includes a full quarter of RONA's financial results. In conjunction with the transaction, RONA's operating results were adjusted to reflect purchase accounting as well as to align",1488,"Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. First, let me remind you that Q3 includes a full quarter of RONA's financial results. In conjunction with the transaction, RONA's operating results were adjusted to reflect purchase accounting as well as to align their accounting policies with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. They will be included in our comp sales calculation after we anniversary the transaction in the second quarter of 2017.
Now on to our Q3 results. Sales for the third quarter were $15.7 billion, an increase of 9.6%. Total customer transactions grew 7.5%, with RONA accounting for about 85% of the increase, and total average ticket increased 2% to $68.68. The sales increase was driven by the addition of RONA and increasing comp sales and new stores. For Q3, approximately $900 million or 6.3% of the sales growth came from RONA. New stores contributed approximately 60 basis points of the sales growth. Comp sales were 2.7%, driven by an average ticket increase of 2.2% and transaction growth of 0.5%. 
Looking at monthly trends. Comps were 1% in August, 2.1% in September and 5.1% in October. We estimate that the net impact of weather positively impacted comp sales in the quarter by approximately 60 basis points. The benefits of serving customers in storm-impacted areas was somewhat offset by heavy rain in the middle of the country in August as well as extreme heat early in the quarter. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 34.35% of sales, which decreased 40 basis points from Q3 last year. Gross margin was negatively impacted by RONA due to both purchase accounting adjustment and the mix of business. In the quarter, these items negatively impacted gross margin by 46 basis points. 
SG&A for the quarter was 25.98% of sales, which deleveraged 309 basis points. As Robert noted, there were several noncash charges negatively impacting our results. Our 1/3 interest in the Australian joint venture is classified as a long-term investment on our balance sheet. For the terms of the joint venture agreement, our investment should be valued as a going concern as of January 18, 2016, the date we exercised our put option. However, Woolworth's [indiscernible], the majority partner, has commenced the wind-down process. Given this unilateral action, accounting rules require us to recognize an incremental $290 million charge has contributed 184 basis points to the deleverage. Our claim related to the going concern value as of January 18, which is above and beyond the amounts expected to be received through the wind-down process, will be recognized as realized. This matter is currently in arbitration.
Also, as part of an ongoing review of our strategic initiatives in an effort to focus on critical projects that will drive our desired outcomes, we made the decision to cancel and rescope a number of projects, resulting in a write-off of $96 million, which caused 60 basis points of deleverage. A number of these projects were technology-enabled, and we were trying to customize a solution. With technology advancing so rapidly, off-the-shelf products became less costly in a faster deployment alternative.
Lastly, we recorded $76 million of goodwill and long-lived asset impairments related to our Orchard Supply Hardware operations, resulting in 48 basis points of deleverage. We invested in Orchard in 2013 to capitalize on opportunities to significantly increase our market share in California. Post-acquisition, we made critical investments to improve the infrastructure and remodel retail facilities that, prior to bankruptcy, had been neglected.
In addition, we launched several initiatives as we worked to reinvigorate the Orchard business model. Specifically, we tested a variety of things, including new store opening density, new market penetration approaches and atypical prototypes to allow for more metro market penetration. Over the past 2 years, our combination of some tests proved more difficult to achieve, and pressures from the historic drought conditions on the gardening and nursery business have caused the business to perform below our expectations. Learnings from these tests have shaped how we take the brand and market opportunity forward. In fact, we begun to see these learnings reflected in our results. As Robert noted, Orchard grew mid-single-digit comps in the quarter. 
Adjusting for the noncash charges, SG&A for the quarter was 23.05% of sales, which deleveraged 16 basis points. This deleverage was from the following items: risk insurance, which is driven by a favorable adjustment last year that didn't repeat this year; private-label credit cost due to an increase in loan losses; and store payroll as a result of slow sales trends early in the quarter. These items were partially offset by 27 basis points of leverage in bonus. 
Depreciation for the quarter was $378 million, which was 2.4% of sales and leveraged 21 basis points. Earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT decreased 328 basis points to 5.97% of sales. Adjusted EBIT decreased 35 basis points to 8.9% of sales.
RONA impacts associated with purchase accounting adjustments, the mix of business and integration costs negatively impacted EBIT by 55 basis points in the quarter.
For the quarter, interest expense was $163 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 51.2%. The higher rate was driven by the joint venture noncash charge, which was a long-term capital loss. Future recoveries related to our claim will be capital gain and result in a reduction in the effective tax rate in the quarter they are realized. 
Earnings per share were $0.43 for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.88. Earnings from RONA's operating results offset purchase accounting adjustments and integration costs. 
Now to a few items on the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was $960 million. Inventory at nearly $11 billion increased $556 million or 5.3% versus Q3 last year. The increase relates to the addition of RONA.
Inventory turnover was 3.89, up 4 basis points to last year. Asset turnover increased 4 basis points to 1.79. 
Moving on to the liabilities section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable of $7.8 billion represented a 6.8% increase over Q3 last year due to the timing of purchases year-over-year, terms improvement as well as the addition of RONA. At the end of the third quarter, lease-adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.36x.
Return on invested capital was 13.6%. The net impact of last year's noncash impairment charge related to our Australian joint venture and this year's foreign currency hedge gain and noncash charges hurt ROIC by 318 basis points.
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Year-to-date operating cash flow was $5.3 billion. Capital expenditures were $820 million, resulting in free cash flow of over $4.4 billion, which was up 20% to last year.
In August, we entered into a $250 million accelerated share repurchase agreement, which settled in the quarter for 3.4 million shares. Also, we repurchased approximately 3.9 million shares for $300 million through the open market. In total, we repurchased $550 million of stock in the quarter, with approximately $630 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several items and details in Lowe's business outlook: First, a reminder that fiscal 2016 will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for a total of 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the year. Also, based on our year-to-date operating performance and updated expectations for the fourth quarter, we revised our fiscal 2016 business outlook. 
For 2016, we now expect total sales increase of 9% to 10%, driven by a variety of factors: first, we're forecasting a comp sales increase of 3% to 4%; second, we expect RONA to contribute 4% to sales growth; next, we anticipate the 53rd week will aid total sales by 1.5%; lastly, we plan to open 40 stores, which adds 0.5%. On a GAAP basis, we're anticipating an EBIT increase of approximately 65 basis points. While the acquisition of RONA adds EBIT dollars, there's a negative impact to the percent of sales due to both RONA's lower EBIT rate and the impacts of purchase accounting I noted a moment ago. Combining these items pressure EBIT by 35 basis points for the year. Negative impacts to Q4 are estimated to be 40 basis points.
For Q4, on a GAAP basis, we expect EBIT improvement of approximately 490 basis points. The impact of last year's joint venture charge is 400 basis points. The remaining 90 basis points of expected EBIT growth comes from primarily expense leverage, notably bonus and depreciation.
The effective tax rate is expected to be 40.1%. The higher-than-expected rate is driven by the joint venture noncash charge.
For the year, on a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share of approximately $3.52. We're forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5.6 billion. Our forecast for capital expenditures is approximately $1.5 billion, which results in estimated free cash flow of $4.1 billion for 2016. 
Our guidance assumes approximately $3.5 billion of share repurchase for 2016.

So we know we have some opportunity to do that. When we look at the overall store base, we see our largest opportunities to be in the most urban markets where we have more significant competitive pressure either out-stored in -- by multiple locations to the competition and/or in most of our 3-way markets. So I would say, from a geographical standpoint and a store base standpoint, we still see most of the pressure coming from the heavy dense metro and urban market."

I'll be-- glad to clarify that for you. Overall, from the consumer standpoint, their desire -- their feelings around the home, the value of their home increasing, their intentions to invest in the home have all continued to be strong during the year. From the beginning of the year, based on what we saw in the data, we said that we thought home improvement would -- the overall factors would moderate some as we went through the year. So for example, total housing turnover is expected to be annualized at 4.8% versus 7.3% last year. Home price depreciation this year forecast is 4.9% versus 5.5% last year. So still strong numbers, but moderating disposable income at 2.3 -- 2.6% annualized this year versus 3.5% last year. And part of that was driven by the decreased turnover that we saw a year ago. We knew that, that would moderate some. So we still expect to be in a very healthy environment. We still think the #1 driver that's out there is continued appreciation in homes, but it has moderated some. So still a very healthy industry, but not to the extent that we would have seen the numbers supporting a year ago."

So it is driving additional traffic to drive additional sales on the one hand. On the other hand, it is rationalizing our cost across the organization. So it really is a two-pronged approach. Specifically, with regard to Orchard that you mentioned, as Bob talked a little bit about in his comments, we bought it out of bankruptcy. The impact on the customer franchise from bankruptcy, the remodeling of the stores, the fact that we had to change the technology and platform out there and bring it up to speed, all of those things. The lifting was just a little heavier than we thought, but we're at a great point now as we're starting to see our great performance in the fundamental stores that are out, and we've kind of rationalized how we're going to use Orchard going forward. So we're still very optimistic about what we can -- what Orchard can do for us. Just getting to this point was a little bit more difficult than we had anticipated so..."

So the net impact was probably 80 basis points unfavorable in August. As we think about the recovery efforts, mostly, as Rick said, given the stage for Louisiana flooding, which is about 2/3 of the benefit we're seeing from the recovery efforts, that would have helped September about 90 basis points and would have helped the October by roughly 150 basis points. If you exclude the benefit from serving customers in those impacted markets, we did see improving underlying trends in the month of October."

As we've talked about over the past several quarters, the Pro consumer continues to outpace our DIY consumer across the business portfolio. And I think a lot of that still continues to focus on really a few things that we've done, Seth, to continue to drive that customer. The merchants, first, have done an outstanding job in working with the operators to bring in the brands that really drive relevance with the Pro. We've talked a lot about that. But we don't want to underestimate the impact that having the right brands in our stores that these customers really value does help us drive that business. Second thing that I would highlight is the fact that we continue to leverage our organization from that multilevel design approach to really be able to service these customers in a different and unique way, leveraging our national accounts teams to really help them from that perspective, diving deep at the market level and really working with our larger MRO customers and the larger accounts to drive incremental share and be more relevant from that perspective; leveraging our 5 Ways to Save programs, where I think our Pro see significant value in the -- our initiatives to drive incremental value for them; the relaunch of LowesForPros.com from -- in Q2 of last year, which is really an informational site into a commerce site, and the transactional site has continued to help us drive significant growth; and then, fourth, the investments we'd made into inventory to continue to improve our breadth and our depth of products that are really critical for this customer. So we see this as a continued evolution of our Pro initiative. We are extremely pleased with the receptivity of the Pro to the actions that we're taking. And I think that shows in the numbers, especially this quarter and over last several quarters, as we continue to drive greater relevance with the customer."

We saw a little bit of elevated activity in the appliance business really related to additional competitors in the space; some elevated activity in flooring as the carpet industry, in general, is in decline; and grills really related to specific close out activity associated with Weber's relaunch of their Genesis line. Behavior's fairly typical across competitors as everybody's shifting promotional focus to engage the customer.

Our third quarter operating results were below our expectations due to slower sales in the first 2 months of the quarter. 
While we expected moderation in the second half of the year, as reflected in our guidance, traffic slowed more than we anticipated in August and September before improving in October, which put pressure on our profitability. Our third quarter comparable sales grew 2.7%, which was driven by a 0.5% increase in transactions and a 2.2% increase in average ticket. Our U.S. home improvement comp was 2.6%. The comps for our South and West divisions were in line with our expectations. In contrast, we experienced continued softness in our North division throughout the quarter. We posted positive comps in 11 of our 15 regions. Overall, we drove positive comps in 10 of our 13 product categories, while one category was also flat.
We saw relative strength in big-ticket purchases driven by outdoor power equipment and appliances. Continued strong demand from Pro customers was evident in lumber building materials as well as tools and hardware. And lawn guard also performed well as we helped customers tackle exterior maintenance and prepare their lawns for winter. 
We continue to be pleased with the performance of our Pro business as the strong foundation we built with this important customer drove comps well above the company average. And we remain focused on providing best-in-class omnichannel customer experiences that will make Lowe's the project authority. We continue to see strength in our Project Specialist Interiors program, with strong growth in both leads and comps again this quarter. And we posted 20% comp growth on Lowes.com, driven by robust growth in both transactions and ticket following our website redesign in Q2.
Our Orchard Supply Hardware business drove mid-single-digit comps for the quarter. And internationally, we continued our strong performance, including double-digit comps in Mexico and mid-single-digit comps in Canada in local currency. We also made continued progress on the integration of RONA, which remains on track. With RONA, we have fortified our Canadian market position, particularly in Québec. We are now well positioned to capitalize on the market's strong long-term fundamentals.
We reported earnings per share of $0.43 for the quarter, which included several noncash charges. First, we recorded further impairment on our investment in the Masters joint venture. Second, we wrote off projects that were canceled as part of an ongoing review of our strategic initiatives in an effort to focus on critical projects that will drive our desired outcomes. And finally, we recorded goodwill and long-lived asset impairments associated with our Orchard Supply Hardware operations as part of our strategic reassessment of the business during the quarter. Bob will discuss these items in greater detail in his comments. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.88, an increase of 10% over the prior year. Delivering our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $550 million of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $309 million in dividends. As we look ahead, we are laser-focused on improving productivity across the organization. Our immediate focus is continuing to optimize associate hours to better match customer demand. And while we've made progress in driving productivity in recent years, we are in the process of evaluating meaningful incremental opportunities to drive shareholder value while continuing to meet customers' needs in an omnichannel environment. We look forward to discussing these opportunities with you at our upcoming Analyst and Investor Conference on December 7.
Turning to the economic landscape. We have a continued opportunity to benefit from a fundamentally solid but moderating home improvement market. Home improvement growth has continued to outpace overall retail sales thus far in the second half of the year. The industry will continue to benefit from several factors, including a solid consumer backdrop, lighting benefits from existing home sales and rising home prices that encourage the customer to engage in discretionary remodels and upgrades on top of routine maintenance. We believe that strengthening demand for revolving credit will also continue to support big-ticket spending, while moderating gains in the job market and incremental income growth should contribute to solid growth and overall consumer spending.
We expect that housing will continue to be a bright spot in the economy. Home sales started out quite strong in 2016 and are now moderating to a sustainable pace. Home price appreciation should persist, which, along with stronger incomes, should motivate more homeowners to spend on home improvements. We are also encouraged by growth in first-time homebuyer activity, which is expected to continue through 2017.
Our third quarter Consumer Sentiment Survey shows a similar trend, with consumers' favorable views around their personal finances holding steady. We continue to see supportive trends for the home improvement industry. Specifically, we found that over half of homeowners believe the value of their home is increasing. And home improvement spending intentions held steady, continuing to outpace overall spending intentions. 
While this was no doubt a challenging quarter, we will continue to better match leverage to demand and drive productivity. Importantly, our fundamental strategy remains intact. We will continue to focus on providing customers with the best omnichannel experiences to assist with their home improvement projects, whether they choose to connect in the store, online, in their home or through most contact centers. At the same time, Pro continues to outperform, and we will remain focused on deepening our relationship with this important customer. 
Before I close, I'd like to thank our employees for their incredible commitment to serving customers. Their dedication was certainly evident during times of need, including Hurricane Matthew and the extreme flooding in Louisiana. As true members of the community, the team helped customers prepare for and rebuild after these disasters.
Thank you again for your interest in Lowe's. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Rick."

As Robert mentioned, traffic slowed more than expected in the first 2 months of the quarter before improving in October. Our Labor Day and Columbus Day events drove sequential comp improvement in the South and the West, resulting in third quarter comps for those divisions that were in line with our expectations. However, we saw continued softness in our North division throughout the quarter. 
We posted positive comps in 10 of 13 product categories, while one category was flat. Both outdoor power equipment and lawn and garden performed well, given the focus on exterior maintenance and winter lawn preparation as well as opportunities from an extended planting and lawn cutting season. Once again, we drove above-average comps in appliances by leveraging our leading brands and service advantages as well as our investments in the customer experience, both in-store and online.
Within seasonal living, grills posted double-digit comps, bolstered by our Weber and Char-Broil brand partnerships. Additionally, our customer experience design capabilities continued to pay dividends. Leveraging our largest store format in a space that was initially planned for outdoor living experience, we created a seasonal stage to anticipate customers' needs for the season, showcasing an experience that helped drive a 65% comp in Halloween products and addressing power preparation needs like lawn care and seasonal maintenance. 
We have now transitioned this space to our holiday decor experience in preparation for the upcoming selling season. Once again, leveraging the seasonal stage, we intend to help customers refresh their homes for guests, decorate and organize their homes after the holidays.
We saw continued strong demand from the Pro customer with comps well above the company average. Pro activity drove solid comps in lumber and build materials and tools and hardware. We were able to capitalize on this demand by improving our total assortment with destination brands like Marshalltown, a trusted Pro brand and the leading supplier of cement masonry tools, which rolled out to stores this quarter. This adds to our impressive portfolio of Pro-focused tool brands, including exclusives like Hitachi and Bostitch, the #1 and #2 brands in pneumatics; Vaughan, a leader in the hammer category; and our extensive private-label line of Kobalt tools. 
The Louisiana floods and Hurricane Matthew drove broad-based demand across product categories. Our merchant, vendor, logistics and store teams worked closely together to identify the products needed before and after the storms and efficiently moved inventory to the areas of greatest need. Historically, most major storms have 4 distinct phases: first, preparation in advance of the storm; second, impact, when the storm actually causes damage; third, cleanup; and fourth, recovery, when customers begin to make repairs and replace damaged items. In the third quarter, we experienced preparation, impact and some initial cleanup from Hurricane Matthew, and we're into the recovery phase from the Louisiana floods. We expect hurricane recovery to begin in the fourth quarter and extend into 2017. Bob will share further details about the impacts of these events in his comments. 
We continue to focus on our strategic priorities, one of which is leveraging our omnichannel capabilities to help customers achieve great project results. Customers can engage with our associates in-store for expert advice; our content on Lowes.com for inspiration; our contact centers for ongoing support; and our project specialists, who work with them in their homes to design, plan and manage their home improvement projects.
In the second quarter, we relaunched our Lowes.com site, providing an upgraded online shopping experience with optimized functionality and display for touch screen devices; improved product and content recommendations; refined search algorithms; larger product images; and expanded product views, including video content. We've seen a great response to the new website this quarter, which, along with our flexible fulfillment options of buy online, pickup in-store and buy online, deliver from store, combine to drive Lowes.com comp growth up 20%. 
Furthering our omnichannel capabilities, this quarter, we completed the national rollout of our interior project specialists. Both interior and exterior project specialists are now available across all U.S. home improvement stores to meet with customers and their homes to design, plan and complete their home improvement projects. This in-home selling program represents another critical element of our omnichannel strategy with a differentiated capability in capturing and servicing project demand. Our in-home sales program continues to outperform, with double-digit sales growth again this quarter. 
Our Pro business continues to thrive with comps well above the company average, driven by a favorable macro backdrop as well as our continued efforts to optimize our product and service offering to better serve the Pro customer. Beyond improvements in our tools offering, we have also strengthened our overall portfolio of Pro-focused brands and make necessary investments into our inventory depth to optimally serve the Pro customer. And we continue to incorporate feedback from Pro customers and store employees into a better offering and experience while working to identify local market opportunities and introduce products optimized to local preferences to further increase our relevance with Pros. 
Our ProServices team continues to advance a multilevel customer engagement strategy across the country through LowesForPros.com and our national sales team at the market level, with our account executive ProServices, or AEPs, and at the store level with our dedicated in-store ProServices teams. Last year's relaunch of LowesForPros.com made it easy for Pros to manage multiple properties and quickly purchase items nationwide. This full omnichannel experience allows Pros to easily order online and choose their preferred fulfillment option of parcel, store pickup or store delivery, saving them both time and money. Our AEPs work with larger regional customers to help them order and replenish products across multiple geographies and locations. Our AEPs have been very effective in growing our business with larger Pro customers, especially maintenance, repair and operations, or MRO, customers. We currently have over 200 Pro outside sales representatives in the field that continue to be very pleased with the program's results. And once again, we saw double-digit growth in AEP sales this quarter, which contributed to the strong Pro comp growth. Our focus on further strengthening our portfolio of brands, improving our inventory depth and continuing to build upon our omnichannel offering through our relaunch of LowesForPros.com and our growing ProServices team are all part of a broader commitment to build on a strong foundation with the Pro.
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. As Robert said, we are focused on optimizing associate hours to better match labor to customer demand. When we experienced softer sales in the early part of the quarter, we worked to adjust labor accordingly. In fact, payroll leverage improved substantially from August to September following our staffing adjustments. In order to maximize our profitability, we will continue to optimize our mix of customer-facing to noncustomer-facing hours.
While this was a challenging quarter, we continue to focus on executing our strategic priorities and making progress on our initiatives to drive top line growth and improve productivity and profitability.
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob."
180871,326105516,1088348,"Lowe's Companies, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2016",2016-11-16,"Earnings Calls","Lowe's Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. First, let me remind you that Q3 includes a full quarter of RONA's financial results.

First, let me remind you that Q3 includes a full quarter of RONA's financial results. In conjunction with the transaction, RONA's operating results were adjusted to reflect purchase accounting as well as to align their accounting policies with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. They will be included in our comp sales calculation after we anniversary the transaction in the second quarter of 2017.
Now on to our Q3 results. Sales for the third quarter were $15.7 billion, an increase of 9.6%. Total customer transactions grew 7.5%, with RONA accounting for about 85% of the increase, and total average ticket increased 2% to $68.68. The sales increase was driven by the addition of RONA and increasing comp sales and new stores. For Q3, approximately $900 million or 6.3% of the sales growth came from RONA. New stores contributed approximately 60 basis points of the sales growth. Comp sales were 2.7%, driven by an average ticket increase of 2.2% and transaction growth of 0.5%. 
Looking at monthly trends. Comps were 1% in August, 2.1% in September and 5.1% in October. We estimate that the net impact of weather positively impacted comp sales in the quarter by approximately 60 basis points. The benefits of serving customers in storm-impacted areas was somewhat offset by heavy rain in the middle of the country in August as well as extreme heat early in the quarter. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 34.35% of sales, which decreased 40 basis points from Q3 last year. Gross margin was negatively impacted by RONA due to both purchase accounting adjustment and the mix of business. In the quarter, these items negatively impacted gross margin by 46 basis points. 
SG&A for the quarter was 25.98% of sales, which deleveraged 309 basis points. As Robert noted, there were several noncash charges negatively impacting our results. Our 1/3 interest in the Australian joint venture is classified as a long-term investment on our balance sheet. For the terms of the joint venture agreement, our investment should be valued as a going concern as of January 18, 2016, the date we exercised our put option. However, Woolworth's [indiscernible], the majority partner, has commenced the wind-down process. Given this unilateral action, accounting rules require us to recognize an incremental $290 million charge has contributed 184 basis points to the deleverage. Our claim related to the going concern value as of January 18, which is above and beyond the amounts expected to be received through the wind-down process, will be recognized as realized. This matter is currently in arbitration.
Also, as part of an ongoing review of our strategic initiatives in an effort to focus on critical projects that will drive our desired outcomes, we made the decision to cancel and rescope a number of projects, resulting in a write-off of $96 million, which caused 60 basis points of deleverage. A number of these projects were technology-enabled, and we were trying to customize a solution. With technology advancing so rapidly, off-the-shelf products became less costly in a faster deployment alternative.
Lastly, we recorded $76 million of goodwill and long-lived asset impairments related to our Orchard Supply Hardware operations, resulting in 48 basis points of deleverage. We invested in Orchard in 2013 to capitalize on opportunities to significantly increase our market share in California. Post-acquisition, we made critical investments to improve the infrastructure and remodel retail facilities that, prior to bankruptcy, had been neglected.
In addition, we launched several initiatives as we worked to reinvigorate the Orchard business model. Specifically, we tested a variety of things, including new store opening density, new market penetration approaches and atypical prototypes to allow for more metro market penetration. Over the past 2 years, our combination of some tests proved more difficult to achieve, and pressures from the historic drought conditions on the gardening and nursery business have caused the business to perform below our expectations. Learnings from these tests have shaped how we take the brand and market opportunity forward. In fact, we begun to see these learnings reflected in our results. As Robert noted, Orchard grew mid-single-digit comps in the quarter. 
Adjusting for the noncash charges, SG&A for the quarter was 23.05% of sales, which deleveraged 16 basis points. This deleverage was from the following items: risk insurance, which is driven by a favorable adjustment last year that didn't repeat this year; private-label credit cost due to an increase in loan losses; and store payroll as a result of slow sales trends early in the quarter. These items were partially offset by 27 basis points of leverage in bonus. 
Depreciation for the quarter was $378 million, which was 2.4% of sales and leveraged 21 basis points. Earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT decreased 328 basis points to 5.97% of sales. Adjusted EBIT decreased 35 basis points to 8.9% of sales.
RONA impacts associated with purchase accounting adjustments, the mix of business and integration costs negatively impacted EBIT by 55 basis points in the quarter.
For the quarter, interest expense was $163 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 51.2%. The higher rate was driven by the joint venture noncash charge, which was a long-term capital loss. Future recoveries related to our claim will be capital gain and result in a reduction in the effective tax rate in the quarter they are realized. 
Earnings per share were $0.43 for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.88. Earnings from RONA's operating results offset purchase accounting adjustments and integration costs. 
Now to a few items on the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was $960 million. Inventory at nearly $11 billion increased $556 million or 5.3% versus Q3 last year. The increase relates to the addition of RONA.
Inventory turnover was 3.89, up 4 basis points to last year. Asset turnover increased 4 basis points to 1.79. 
Moving on to the liabilities section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable of $7.8 billion represented a 6.8% increase over Q3 last year due to the timing of purchases year-over-year, terms improvement as well as the addition of RONA. At the end of the third quarter, lease-adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.36x.
Return on invested capital was 13.6%. The net impact of last year's noncash impairment charge related to our Australian joint venture and this year's foreign currency hedge gain and noncash charges hurt ROIC by 318 basis points.
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Year-to-date operating cash flow was $5.3 billion. Capital expenditures were $820 million, resulting in free cash flow of over $4.4 billion, which was up 20% to last year.
In August, we entered into a $250 million accelerated share repurchase agreement, which settled in the quarter for 3.4 million shares. Also, we repurchased approximately 3.9 million shares for $300 million through the open market. In total, we repurchased $550 million of stock in the quarter, with approximately $630 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several items and details in Lowe's business outlook: First, a reminder that fiscal 2016 will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for a total of 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the year. Also, based on our year-to-date operating performance and updated expectations for the fourth quarter, we revised our fiscal 2016 business outlook. 
For 2016, we now expect total sales increase of 9% to 10%, driven by a variety of factors: first, we're forecasting a comp sales increase of 3% to 4%; second, we expect RONA to contribute 4% to sales growth; next, we anticipate the 53rd week will aid total sales by 1.5%; lastly, we plan to open 40 stores, which adds 0.5%. On a GAAP basis, we're anticipating an EBIT increase of approximately 65 basis points. While the acquisition of RONA adds EBIT dollars, there's a negative impact to the percent of sales due to both RONA's lower EBIT rate and the impacts of purchase accounting I noted a moment ago. Combining these items pressure EBIT by 35 basis points for the year. Negative impacts to Q4 are estimated to be 40 basis points.
For Q4, on a GAAP basis, we expect EBIT improvement of approximately 490 basis points. The impact of last year's joint venture charge is 400 basis points. The remaining 90 basis points of expected EBIT growth comes from primarily expense leverage, notably bonus and depreciation.
The effective tax rate is expected to be 40.1%. The higher-than-expected rate is driven by the joint venture noncash charge.
For the year, on a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share of approximately $3.52. We're forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5.6 billion. Our forecast for capital expenditures is approximately $1.5 billion, which results in estimated free cash flow of $4.1 billion for 2016. 
Our guidance assumes approximately $3.5 billion of share repurchase for 2016. 
Regina, we're now ready for questions."

I'll be-- glad to clarify that for you. Overall, from the consumer standpoint, their desire -- their feelings around the home, the value of their home increasing, their intentions to invest in the home have all continued to be strong during the year. From the beginning of the year, based on what we saw in the data, we said that we thought home improvement would -- the overall factors would moderate some as we went through the year. So for example, total housing turnover is expected to be annualized at 4.8% versus 7.3% last year. Home price depreciation this year forecast is 4.9% versus 5.5% last year. So still strong numbers, but moderating disposable income at 2.3 -- 2.6% annualized this year versus 3.5% last year. And part of that was driven by the decreased turnover that we saw a year ago. We knew that, that would moderate some. So we still expect to be in a very healthy environment. We still think the #1 driver that's out there is continued appreciation in homes, but it has moderated some. So still a very healthy industry, but not to the extent that we would have seen the numbers supporting a year ago."

So it is driving additional traffic to drive additional sales on the one hand. On the other hand, it is rationalizing our cost across the organization. So it really is a two-pronged approach. Specifically, with regard to Orchard that you mentioned, as Bob talked a little bit about in his comments, we bought it out of bankruptcy. The impact on the customer franchise from bankruptcy, the remodeling of the stores, the fact that we had to change the technology and platform out there and bring it up to speed, all of those things. The lifting was just a little heavier than we thought, but we're at a great point now as we're starting to see our great performance in the fundamental stores that are out, and we've kind of rationalized how we're going to use Orchard going forward. So we're still very optimistic about what we can -- what Orchard can do for us. Just getting to this point was a little bit more difficult than we had anticipated so..."

So the net impact was probably 80 basis points unfavorable in August. As we think about the recovery efforts, mostly, as Rick said, given the stage for Louisiana flooding, which is about 2/3 of the benefit we're seeing from the recovery efforts, that would have helped September about 90 basis points and would have helped the October by roughly 150 basis points.

As we've talked about over the past several quarters, the Pro consumer continues to outpace our DIY consumer across the business portfolio.

The merchants, first, have done an outstanding job in working with the operators to bring in the brands that really drive relevance with the Pro. We've talked a lot about that. But we don't want to underestimate the impact that having the right brands in our stores that these customers really value does help us drive that business. Second thing that I would highlight is the fact that we continue to leverage our organization from that multilevel design approach to really be able to service these customers in a different and unique way, leveraging our national accounts teams to really help them from that perspective, diving deep at the market level and really working with our larger MRO customers and the larger accounts to drive incremental share and be more relevant from that perspective; leveraging our 5 Ways to Save programs, where I think our Pro see significant value in the -- our initiatives to drive incremental value for them; the relaunch of LowesForPros.com from -- in Q2 of last year, which is really an informational site into a commerce site, and the transactional site has continued to help us drive significant growth; and then, fourth, the investments we'd made into inventory to continue to improve our breadth and our depth of products that are really critical for this customer. So we see this as a continued evolution of our Pro initiative. We are extremely pleased with the receptivity of the Pro to the actions that we're taking.
