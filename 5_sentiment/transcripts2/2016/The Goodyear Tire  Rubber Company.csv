275789,323469359,928940,"The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company","Executives","Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll provide a review of our fourth quarter and full year results and I'll then cover the highlights and provide context for each of our business units heading into 2016. I'll also provide so",2475,"Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll provide a review of our fourth quarter and full year results and I'll then cover the highlights and provide context for each of our business units heading into 2016. I'll also provide some thoughts that look beyond this year before I turn the call over to Laura to review the financials in detail and review our outlook. 
I'm extremely pleased with our outstanding results in 2015 as we delivered 18% growth in our full year segment operating income, exceeding $2 billion for the first time in our 117 year history. Excluding the impact of currency on our results, our segment operating income grew 27%, which is a clear indication of the strength of our underlying business. This is our third consecutive year of record segment operating income. What stands out as most gratifying, however, is that these results were achieved amidst a challenging global economic climate. This outstanding performance contributed to free cash flow from operations that reached $951 million for the year. And as pleased as I am to report these results, I believe it's more important to view this as evidence of the soundness of our strategy, our ability to execute against that strategy and outstanding performance by our teams across the globe who have consistently met our goals. Our consistent progress has resulted in steady segment operating income growth and positions us well for that growth to continue. As I've said many times, we're not measuring success by the quarter or the year but by continued progress toward our destination of creating sustainable economic value. That will not change. Evidence of our progress can be found in our stock-price performance as measured by our 3-year total shareholder return. Goodyear is in the 94th percentile of the S&P 500 Companies over that period. This is an outstanding achievement and demonstrates our focus on creating shareholder value. 
Our performance to date has enabled us to win with our customers in a competitive marketplace and execute on our 2014 to 2016 capital allocation plan. And today, we announced the $650 million increase to our share repurchase program. This announcement is very meaningful considering the position the company is in today versus where we were just 5 years ago. The consistent approach of executing against our strategy has allowed us to generate record earnings and strong cash flow. Not only have these results allowed us to continue to invest in our business for future growth, but they have allowed us to focus on strengthening our balance sheet while simultaneously returning capital to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. The ability to deliver on this plan further validates our strategy. 
Turning now to our business units, we had a record quarter in both North America and Asia Pacific. Our EMEA business showed a strong recovery versus the very weak fourth quarter last year, and our Latin American business continues to grapple with the weak economic environment in that region. Our global volumes grew nearly 7% in the quarter, partly because of our acquisition of Nippon Goodyear in Japan in October. Demand for our premium HVA products continued to be strong. We are confident that our brands and our value proposition will enable growth over the long term. Remember we're not pursuing volume for volume's sake. Our team remains disciplined in our approach as we pursue profitable volume growth. 2015 also marked a very strong year for our operational excellence initiatives and cost savings programs, which made an important contribution to our earnings growth by delivering cost savings in excess of inflation. In each region, we succeeded through steady execution of our strategy focused on increasing the value of the Goodyear brand for our customers and for Goodyear. 
Our North America business continued to deliver excellent results and has strong momentum as we move into 2016. North America's fourth quarter segment operating income was up 16%, continuing the trend of strong growth in 2015. This performance was a result of all aspects of our aligned business model working together. We expect moderate industry growth in North America in 2016, as many of the key economic indicators continue to be positive. Employment levels, miles driven and low gasoline prices all remain favorable and provide a productive platform for growth in 2016. We continue to expect strong demand in our OE and Replacement businesses. While OE growth expectations in the U.S. market have moderated considerably for the coming year, our OE selectivity strategy continues to pay dividends as we see strong ongoing pull through on first and second replacements. You recall that the sour recovery began in earnest in 2010 and since then we've seen 6 strong years of growth in OE. As first replacement is typically around the 3 to 4 year mark for a new vehicle, we can expect another several years of strong consumer replacement demand. This is the specific result our OE strategy was intended to have in the Replacement segment. It's working as we expected. And although OE growth may be moderating, overall increases in SUV and light truck are outpacing the industry. As you would expect, these platforms would depend on the performance characteristics of Goodyear's premium high-value-added tires such as the Goodyear Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure, the Wrangler DuroTrack and the new Wrangler Trail Runner 80, which we recently announced. These are the types of platforms we targeted in our OE strategy. In 2015, our products were on 75% of the 15 top-selling U.S. SUV and light truck platforms, including the best-selling Ford F150, underpinning our OE growth and driving a richer mix. 
Even with North America continuing to turn in record results each quarter, we still see many opportunities in the year ahead, including delivery of more premium HVA tires for our customers and consumers. To respond to the increasing demand, we delivered 1.1 million more consumer tires to our customers in 2015 and we're increasing our capability for 2016 and beyond. Some of that volume will come following investments we've made in our existing footprint and from units we're bringing in from our global facilities. Still more will be available with the start of production in our Americas plant in 2017. And though our North America e-commerce installer program is still in its early stages, I am extremely pleased with our thoughtful roll out and our very, very positive results. We're connecting online shoppers who come to us through goodyear.com to a preferred dealer who's part of our installer program. Our early data indicates that we're driving new business to our network of aligned dealers. Nearly 70% of consumers who bought on goodyear.com were new to the installing dealer.  At a recent Annual North America Dealer Conference, our customers made it clear to us that online sales are huge opportunity for our retailers to grow their businesses. Their positive comments about the platform, our products and especially Goodyear's total value proposition in consumer and in commercial and off-the-road as well, energized our team in a way that we've never seen. In a larger context, the response from our customers at the conference was overwhelmingly positive to exciting new product introductions, to our sales tools and training, to our marketing support and to our collaboration with them to execute our strategy and help them grow their businesses. Our team, and more importantly, our customers, came away from the meeting confident that Goodyear's total value proposition distinguishes us from competitors. Also, we believe that our customers left more aligned and more committed to Goodyear than ever before. We're clearly on the right path, and we expect our positive momentum to continue in 2016. 
In early December, we announced the consolidation of North America and Latin America into a new strategic business unit, the Americas, beginning this year. With this move, our customers and consumers will be served better by the combined business, and we will be stronger partner and supplier in both regions over the long term. These benefits will be achieved over time by integrating the businesses to improve product supply and customer service behind the proven leadership of Steve McClellan. All manufacturing plants in the combined region, including the new Americas plant, will be leveraged to serve all customers in Latin America and in North America. Though North America and Latin America approach their markets differently, there are increasing similarities including the growth of HVA tires, and we'll use the key learning from our North America turnaround and success to navigate the challenges in Latin America. In the near term, our Latin America business continues to be challenged by the political and economic environment. This includes the recession in Brazil, and ongoing challenges and Venezuela, which have led to its accounting deconsolidation this quarter. As such, we will continue to focus on our cost structure in the region as we anticipate the recessionary environment in Brazil to continue through 2016. Laura will have more on Venezuela in her remarks. 
In EMEA, our business made solid improvements in the fourth quarter with segment operating income of $100 million and segment operating margin above 8%. Winter volumes in the fourth quarter started strong but lost momentum as the weather in our key markets proved to be relatively mild as we expected. Winter weather has returned in some regions of Europe, but at this point, our dealers sell from existing inventories. Typically, late winter weather should support the 2016 selling season and inventories today are at more balanced levels versus last year. Even so, our optimism at this point must be tempered by dealer caution after several mild winters in a row. 
We feel confident about our competitive position in our product portfolio heading into the summer selling season. Over the course of the year, we expect consumer industry growth to be about 2.5% for both OE and Replacement. On the cost side, the team has made progress toward the closing of our EMEA facility and with some capacity actions announced and 2015 in the U.K. and Germany. EMEA is an excellent business for us and we remain positive about its future. However, we realize that the region faces several challenges, 3 are there at the top of my list is the potential further weakening of the euro, the continued influx of Asian imports and Eastern European countries and the fluctuations of our business due to the effect of weather on the winter tire market. Our competitive advantage in this market is our ability to design and manufacture outstanding products that are recognized through tire labeling and magazine test scores. European consumers value the technology and performance of Goodyear tires. That remains a strong foundation to build upon. That said, we also have to continue to look at our cost structure and work to strengthen our distribution network to further differentiate our value proposition. In short, we are positive on EMEA's long-term potential and we believe stronger margins are achievable in the competitive EMEA market. 
In Asia Pacific, we achieved record fourth quarter segment operating income of $96 million, an increase of more than 20% following strong volume growth of 38% in the quarter. Our unit volumes were up 12% excluding the impact of the new Japanese replacement business. We saw strong growth in our China and India consumer businesses, but again saw continued deterioration in Australia due to ongoing challenges in that country and a currency that depreciated 17% in 2015. China had a very strong fourth quarter with our volumes increasing 30% versus the prior year. That increase was primarily due to consumer OE, where sales surged 43% year-over-year, triggered by local tax incentives on small cars, as well as our success gaining new Chinese OE accounts. Consumer Replacement volume grew 10%, driven by strong execution of our sellthrough programs. While we expect continued volatility in the next few months, we remain confident in the long-term market outlook in China, with continued growth in the middle class, fueling growth in the automotive sector. We are well-positioned to benefit from this market growth, given our award-winning product lines and strong position in OE creating aftermarket pull. Most recently, our EfficientGrip Performance tire won China Auto News' Golden Wheels Award for 2015 as Tire of the Year For Comfort. With the acquisition of the Japanese business in the fourth quarter, I'm excited about the prospects for growth tied to this heavily weighted HVA market. We see significant opportunities to grow our Goodyear-branded products in this key market.  In summary, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities within our business in Asia Pacific. We'll continue driving new product introductions, OE pull through and expanding our retail network to support long-term growth in the region. 
As we look at 2015, I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. Achieving these outcomes, even amidst global economic challenges is perhaps the best indication of the strength of our strategy and the changes we have made to Goodyear's business over the past several years. In 2013, when we set out our 3-year plan, we established our target of 10% to 15% annual segment operating income growth, which would have pegged our earnings at around $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion in 2016. Since then, the macroeconomic crisis in Venezuela has dramatically worsened with the decline in the price of oil. With its deconsolidation, we are committed to grow 10% to 15% in our remaining businesses in 2016, and to that same initial level of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. Over the past few years, we've been transparent with our level of earnings and cash balance in Venezuela. From talking with our investors, we understand that many have been discounting that value for some time. We believe that's the right way to think about it. In the year ahead, we expect relative strength in our mature markets and, like this year, continued volatility in emerging markets. We are confident in our 2016 plan and remain committed to our strategy of pursuing profitable volume and sharing segments where the Goodyear brand is a differentiator. With a heightened concern about the state of the global economy today, we will continue to initiate adjustments to our cost base amidst changing markets. We also are working on plans for further actions on cost, including capacity actions later this year. 
Looking beyond 2016, we expect our growth will continue. We will share our next stage plan via an Investor Day later this year and we expect to provide more details on timing over the next few months. However, I can tell you much of the story will remain familiar. We are as focused as ever on being the industry's innovation leader, being first with customers, being the leader in targeted market segments, and as a result, being a company that continuously drive sustainable value. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Laura."
275789,323469359,928940,"The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company","Executives","Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will start with a review of our fourth quarter results, including points from each each of our 4 strategic business units. I'll then cover updates to our full year outlook for 2016, including t",2714,"Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will start with a review of our fourth quarter results, including points from each each of our 4 strategic business units. I'll then cover updates to our full year outlook for 2016, including the changes related to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan business before we open up the call for your questions.  Our fourth quarter results include the impact of the October 1 dissolution of our global alliance with SRI, which included several joint ventures. You'll recall the dissolution impact several areas across the businesses, and as shown in our June 5, 2015 investor presentation, the total net impact is expected to be accretive to net income and adjusted EPS. 
Turning to Slide 7, I'd like to highlight a few items on our income statement. In the quarter, we grew segment operating income by 33% to $476 million and our SOI margin increased 350 basis points to 11.7%. Unit volumes increased 2.6 million units or 7% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in Asia Pacific and a recovery in EMEA tire sales in this year's fourth quarter. The net impact of the dissolution of the joint ventures on total volume, with an increase of 1.2 million units with Asia Pacific's benefit more than offsetting North America's decrease in volume from the same overall transaction. The decline in our net sales for the quarter is more than explained by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was significantly lower than we expected. This was primarily the result of the recognition of $55 million in foreign tax credits and research and development tax credits, following U.S. legislative actions in December. Our reported earnings per share on a diluted basis was a net loss of $1.42. The results were impacted by certain significant items, including a charge for the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary on December 31, 2015. A summary of these items is listed in the appendix of today's presentation. After adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $0.93, up $0.34 from last year. 
Consistent with our approach in previous quarters, for year-over-year comparison purposes, we have provided a U.S. tax adjusted EPS. For the quarter, the adjusted EPS on that basis is $0.83, which includes the $55 million tax credit. As a reminder, although we are incurring tax expense in the U.S. today due to our significant U.S. deferred tax assets, we do not anticipate paying significant cash income taxes in the U.S. through 2020. 
The step chart on Slide 8 walks fourth quarter 2014 total segment operating income to fourth quarter 2015. Year-over-year, SOI increased $117 million. The net impact of volume growth in unabsorbed fixed cost was a benefit of $73 million. The benefits of lower raw material costs and improved price/mix, combine for a net benefit of $108 million during the quarter, with continued strong performance in North America. On a full year basis, our price/mix versus raw materials benefit was $356 million. Excluding Venezuela, it was $77 million. Our $80 million of cost savings was more than offset by the impact of inflation, driven by hyperinflation in Venezuela. I'll note that fourth quarter cost savings included a $30 million favorable adjustment to our general and product liability reserve. On a full year basis, or net cost savings were $29 million year-over-year. Excluding Venezuela, our net cost savings were $227 million, reflecting the continued momentum of our operational excellence initiatives. Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $21 million in the quarter, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the euro. Other, a negative $36 million, includes an $18 million impact from our other tire-related businesses for the quarter, including the divestiture of our U.S. motorcycle business as part of the joint venture dissolution. 
Turning to Slide 9, the balance sheet is presented on a pro forma basis, reflecting the redemption of our euro notes that occurred on January 14, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.2 billion and reflect the derecognition of $320 million in Venezuela. Our total debt of $5.5 billion is down $910 million from the end of 2014, driven by debt repayment and currency translation on our overseas debt balances. In December, we repaid $400 million on our second lean term loan, leaving a balance remaining of $600 million. Our global pension liability declined $72 million from last year's level, driven by contributions to our international plants. I'll also note that we continue to execute on our pension strategy. During 2015, we completed programs to offer lump sums to certain former employees in the U.S. As a result, we recognized a non-cash pretax pension settlement charge of $137 million, which is included as a significant item on Slide 21. This action had a small positive impact on our U.S. funded status, and it reduces our PBGC premiums and overall liability risk going forward. 
Slide 10 shows we generated $951 million of free cash flow from operations in 2015. Working capital was a use of $42 million and our CapEx spend was $983 million. We also repurchased $100 million worth of our common stock during the fourth quarter or about 3 million shares, bringing the total since the start of the program to $413 million. 
Moving now to the business units on Slide 11, I'll start with North America. North America continues to deliver strong results with another record quarter and segment operating income of $266 million. Operating margin for the quarter was about 14%, reflecting the seventh consecutive quarter of margin exceeding 10%. North America's $37 million improvement in year-over-year earnings was driven by strong price/mix net of raw material cost, reflecting the value of the Goodyear brand and our industry-leading products and services. North America benefited from improved factory utilization in the third quarter, as well as from cost savings, including favorable general and product liability costs, as I noted earlier, which more than offset higher marketing expense and the impact of the divestiture of our Dunlop-branded Japanese OE and U.S. motorcycle businesses. Excluding the impact of the joint venture dissolution, North America's consumer volume was essentially flat in the fourth quarter, when compared with last year's very strong fourth quarter. You recall that our third quarter of 2014 had weak shipments as a result of the tariffs prebuy, which then benefited shipments in the fourth quarter of 2014 as distributors and retailers rebalanced inventory levels. North America continues to be challenged to fully satisfy market demand for our premium high-value-added tires. We are working diligently to leverage our global manufacturing footprint and continue to invest in the Americas to meet this demand. In the commercial truck business, fourth quarter sales units declined 12% year-over-year. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in our commercial OE business and also reflects some increased pressure in replacement industry from an influx of low end imported units. For the full year of 2015, North America earned record segment operating income of $1.1 billion, a year-over-year improvement of $305 million. We believe these results are further evidence that our strategy is delivering sustainable value. Europe, Middle East and Africa generated segment operating income of $100 million in the quarter, which was $70 million higher than the prior year. The increase in SOI was primarily driven by volume improvement and our cost savings programs, which more than offset foreign currency translation and inflation headwinds. Despite another warm winter and continued pressure from Asian imports and Eastern Europe, our fourth quarter EMEA unit volumes increased about 11% year-over-year. The volume increase was driven by European winter tire industry sell-in, which grew 5% year-over-year, and our strong performance in consumer replacement, where year-over-year volumes increased by 13%. In commercial truck, we again saw strong performance in a stable industry environment. We saw double-digit volume gains in commercial OE and we continue to gain share in replacement. Asia Pacific generated segment operating income of $96 million during the fourth quarter. This sets a new record for the region and is $16 million above the same period the year before. The main driver was positive volume, which was partially offset by continuing currency headwinds due to the weakening Chinese RMB. Our segment operating margin in the region increased to 17.2%. Our volume grew 38% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of the Japanese replacement tire business, our volume growth was 12%. Outside of Japan, volume growth came from our 2 primary growth engines, China and India. Despite the slowing Chinese economy, we grew double digits in OE, as well as in our replacement business. In India, strong market conditions and our ability to increase share have especially benefited our replacement business. While we anticipate slower growth and continuing currency headwinds for the region in the short-term, we continue to view China and the rest of the region as a key long-term growth opportunity. We are investing in our teams, our products and our capabilities to drive that growth. 
We had a challenging quarter in Latin America due to the persistent weak economic environment in Brazil and continued volatility in Venezuela. In the quarter, our volume decreased 11% versus 2014. The decline in volume was driven by 3 factors. First, our consumer OE business declined 29% due to a continuing recessionary environment, driven by a 36% decline in the industry in Brazil. Second, our consumer replacement sales in the quarter were down 5%. This volume decline was influenced by some pull ahead of orders into the prior quarter due to announced price increases effective in October. And third, Commercial Replacement industry volumes declined 12% year-over-year, primarily in Brazil. Segment operating income in the fourth quarter was $14 million, which was down $6 million from the prior year. In the quarter, Latin America's results were negatively impacted by cost inflation and lower volume. For the quarter, operating income from our Venezuelan business was $22 million. This operating income excludes foreign currency exchange losses related to the Venezuelan bolivar, which was $5 million in the quarter. The economic environment in Venezuela continues to be extremely challenging. We were unable to exchange bolivars for U.S. dollars during the fourth quarter, which were required to purchase imported raw materials for operations. These conditions, combined with other Venezuelan regulations, have increasingly limited our ability to make and execute operational decisions at our Venezuelan subsidiary. As a result, we concluded we do not meet the accounting criteria for control and we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiary on December 31. Despite this change, we continue to maintain operations in Venezuela and serve our customers there. Our Latin America team is continuing to work proactively to mitigate our exposure and maximize market opportunities in an increasingly difficult environment. We continue to focus on cost, and we will work to leverage the Americas consolidation to improve capabilities, to improve processes and to reduce costs. 
Slide 12 shows our full year modeling assumptions for 2016. We have included our 2015 results, excluding Venezuela, on the left-hand side of the chart for comparison purposes. Full year SOI in Venezuela was $119 million. After adjusting for its deconsolidation, our 2015 SOI was $1.9 billion. We are committed to growing our SOI 10% to 15% year-over-year in our remaining operations, and are targeting SOI of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion in 2016. We see sales volume growth of approximately 3% for the year from our revised base of about 165 million units, which excludes Venezuela. This volume will come from increment growth in all of our regions and also includes the full year benefit from the acquisition of Nippon Goodyear. I'll note that similar to prior guidance, we expect a volume benefit of about $15 per tire in 2016. Our outlook for price/mix net of raw materials is a full year net benefit of approximately $75 million. For 2016, we expect raw materials to decrease about 5% year-over-year. This includes the negative impact of both the RMI index agreements with our OE customers in certain large commercial fleets, as well as an impact from currency on raw material transactions in our international businesses. Unabsorbed overhead for 2016 is expected to be a benefit of approximately $50 million, reflecting the benefit of higher overall volumes. We expect cost savings versus general inflation to be a benefit of about $135 million in 2016, as operational programs for our core business continued to deliver. In line with the timing of some of our operational excellence initiatives and our cadence in 2015, our cost savings benefits will ramp-up through the year. 
While we had outstanding performance of $227 million and net cost savings in 2015, excluding Venezuela, there are a few reasons for the change in 2016. Our 2015 full year cost savings included a $35 million benefit from general and product liability reserve adjustments, including the $30 million I mentioned during the Q4 SOI walk. In addition, as we have deployed a few central initiatives regionally, we will increase our allocation of these costs to the SBUs in 2016. This will show as a headwind to cost savings, with an offsetting reduction below SOI in other corporate costs, with no impact to EBIT. Lastly, pension expense in SOI for 2016 is expected to be up $30 million less than 2015, with the benefit from the change to the spot rate accounting method. These items are summarized in a slide included in the appendix to today's presentation. 
Moving on to foreign exchange, we expect translation to be a headwind of $45 million for the full year based on current spot rates. With the sale of the North American Motorcycle business, we will not have the associated operating income of about $30 million, with the majority of that impact in the spring and summer months. Finally, we have a combined $35 million negative impact from start-up costs associated with the Americas plant and projected increases in marketing investments. 
Additional financial assumptions for 2016 are listed on Slide 13. I'll cover a few key highlights from this slide. Following the refinancings and debt repayments in 2015, our interest expense is expected to be $350 million to $375 million, a significant reduction year-over-year. Our global pension expense is expected to decline from $135 million to a range of $65 million to $85 million, following a change to the spot rate method of accounting for the calculation of annual interest cost. The expected benefit in SOI from this change is approximately $45 million in 2016. This benefit will be partially offset by about $20 million from actuarial losses experienced in 2015. Additionally, our 2016 pension expense will not include expense from Venezuela, which had pension expense of $27 million in 2015. Working capital is expected to be a [indiscernible] of about $50 million and our CapEx outlook is $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Finally, for 2016, we expect other corporate costs to be approximately $165 million. 
In total our target range for SOI is $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. From this range and the other financial assumptions we provided in today's presentation, you can see we are also targeting another year with significant cash flow generation. Our strong cash flow provides the ability to continue funding our 2014 through 2016 capital allocation plan. 
Now turning to Slide 14, I'd like to cover the increase to our share repurchase program and other updates to our 2014 to 2016 capital allocation plan. Growth CapEx is $900 million, following choices we've made given weakness in some of our emerging markets. We've slowed down investments in Brazil and China while maintaining our investments in the new Americas plant. The dividend and share repurchase basket of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion reflects a $650 million increase in the authorization for share repurchases. We have spent $542 million through 2015. Given the seasonality of our cash flow, we would expect that the majority of our purchases in 2016 will be completed in the second half of the year, in line with our cash flow generation. As a final note, our debt repayment and pension funding basket is expected to be about $900 million in line with achieving our target ratio of 2.0x to 2.1x adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio by the end of 2016.

And I think if you look at the NCAA college football playoff series coverage, hopefully, many on the call were watching that, we had a lot of coverage on that, first time we really had that extensive of coverage. Obviously, our spend went up. But as we look at it, it is well worth the cost of doing that and that hit our margin for the quarter. And in addition to that, we did see a little bit of just product mix change as we saw our fourth quarter. Clearly, our consumer margins, consumer business margins continue to be very strong based on a lot of the things we talked about in terms of our new products and our product mix and consumer. However, we did see a slowdown of the commercial business, particularly the commercial OE business has slowed in Q4 and you saw our assumptions for that even going out into 2016. So I think you take those 2 things, those are really the drivers that hit the margin as we look at the comparative period."

So we see distortions in the industry, and that potentially could happen in the truck business if these things were to ultimately pass. And additionally, what we would point out is as we've seen in the past, those tires end up going to different places.

You're assuming net benefit of maybe 75% of this. But at the same time, you're saying that you're experiencing some challenges in meeting demand in some of the higher end tariffs.

I know you recall we went through about a 3, 4 year period where we have significantly increasing raw material prices and where we've now had a number of years, including going on to '16 of decreasing raw material prices. And we managed very well our price/mix on the way up dealing with those increased costs, took us a while to catch up, if you remember, and I think we're demonstrating an ability to manage price/mix versus raw materials on the way down. And I think if we can say what's underpinning that, I would suggest to you again this notion of how we've built a very aligned business model, selling the Goodyear value proposition to our customers, not just build upon a product and a tire, but also built around the marketing that we bring, even the new e-commerce platforms that we're bringing the sales tools and training. All those type of things, our customers, our dealers, our distributors are seeing the value of that, and that is certainly competitively advantaged in Goodyear. And our goal always was for that to turn up in the value we bring to the dealers and creating value for them and certainly creating value for us. So I would say that's in particular what I would say is driving it. Obviously, if we go around the world, we have a variety of different circumstances. I can talk to as well given devaluations of currencies and all that sort of thing. But maybe I'll stop there for a moment."

I think on a macro basis though, your point continues to be the right one that we've seen, and that's the demand for those high complex tires. Still, we see being head of supply. And as a consequence, that's a positive dynamic for our industry as we look ahead. The rest of the world also say it's a tough place. If we look at EMEA right now, very competitive environment, with what has been the devaluation of the euro. I know we've seen a little bit of reversal of that as a region, but certainly that makes our raw materials more expensive. So we're really working on our value proposition in Europe as well, aligning ourselves with our dealers, putting our new products out there and trying to create value for them and for us. Again, with that in Latin America, obviously, Brazil is in a very difficult situation. The real, I think peaked at 4 20 and that's certainly putting a lot of pressure on our raw material costs there as well, and we're obviously being very active in trying to make sure we can recover that. And in Asia, I think that we've always demonstrated very good capabilities to deliver price/mix versus raw material. Remember, that raw material hits us much quicker in Asia, but given where we play, a lot in performance in SUV, our distribution and our business model there likes us -- allows us to perform very well there. I think if you add all that up, we've got a lot of positives and certainly headwinds going into 2016. But if you look at the outlook that Laura highlighted, we're at another $75 million of positive price/mix versus raw going into 2016.

There were some initiatives that paid off quite quickly and others that needed to build momentum through our plans over time. One aspect of it, we haven't even, on conversion savings, our plant optimization hasn't been fully rolled out in all of our plants yet, and won't be quite finished even in 2016.

But I think the question of Latin America, I think that the #1 thing that I would point out, we've been there almost 100 years in Latin America, and we've gone through periods of volatility not unlike this before, and we have a lot of confidence, one to work through it, and two, the confidence that the market is going to come back. And I think that's the most important thing to say. We have staying power there, and we believe that will come back. In terms of things that we are doing right now, I would point toward a couple of things. In particular, if you look at our consumer replacement volume, it's a very big bright spot for us in a difficult environment. We have been mixing up our business, the larger rim diameter tires, we did that with some of the investments we made in the region, and we're actually going out and expanding our distribution to grow our business there. This is happening in Brazil, it's happening in the Indian region, it's happening in Mexico. Our Brazil volumes started out very strong in consumer replacement. They weakened a little bit, but still very positive in 2015. Our volumes in places like Mexico, the Andean region were very strong double digits and a lot of growth there. So as we're in a difficult environment, we're making sure that we're planting the seeds and growing our business for when that market ultimately comes back. And that is working extremely well as we expand into the region there. Look, that said, I'll echo your comments. Brazil is in a very, very difficult position. The OE businesses, OE auto manufacturers, you've all read the same things. I won't go through the numbers, but clearly, they're in a very difficult situation there. That impacts us as well. I think Laura said our OE business was down fairly significantly. We also had, as an industry, a lot of capacity that went into Brazil. That means in a weaker demand environment, we actually have more supply. But certainly not helping things as we go. So I have to echo your comments, that Latin America will be tough certainly through 2016. But our belief is, hey, this is a long-term gain, reflecting the long-term and we're going to continue to make very cautious and thoughtful investments in this region as we go. And I think we have again a good track record of doing that, and the belief that what Latin America represents to us is upside in terms of our optimal segment operating income. And I might say, Venezuela obviously creates a headwind for us, but that's something we're going to deal with as well as we look to the future."

As I mentioned, earlier, our margin for the year was 14.3%, segment operating income margin, a record for us in a mature market in North America. We would put that up against any business anywhere. So very strong. And that business is really benefiting from the aligned business model that I mentioned earlier that we've built over the number of years and you're saying that come through. So we're very, very pleased. And as Laura mentioned, we feel there's opportunity to continue to grow this business particularly with the incremental HVA supply, not. As we look to Q4, I think a couple of things. One, we had a pretty strong comp in Q4 of '14 because if you remember, we had sort of a, a lot of customers buying in Q3 '14 as related to the tariffs at that moment in time. Our results in Q3, if you remember, versus the industry, were a little bit low. Q4, in terms was actually pretty for us in 2014. So we had a pretty strong comp in that period. Secondly, this question of mixing up around HVA tires I think is very relevant. So while we are improving our mix and our margin, we talked about the SUV tires, the performance tires, the wrangler tires and the like, what's also happening is while we're getting higher-margin, those tires going through our factories means our factories run a little bit slower. So we're seeing a little bit less volume coming through those factories, where one doesn't equal one in terms of an LVA tire to an HVA tire. So some of that impact is coming through. So we know that, we've talked about that. So even though we have very robust margins, very strong demand and very positive outlook, you saw a little bit of that impact Q4 as well. As we mentioned, we're getting more tires, we will again get more tires out of our North America factory in 2016 -- factories, I should say. We're bringing more tires in, taking advantage some of the weakness around the globe to be both of those tires and demanded and again, asked Laura just mentioned we've got our Americas factories coming online. So we'll continue to build up to provide more of those high demand tires as well. And I have to say, having been on the side where we had too much capacity versus not necessarily enough of it, this is a better place to be than having factories with capacity to fill. So we're very comfortable with where we are and we need to -- we're going to continue to get more of those tires to our customers who were really asking for them right now."

We're going into our price/mix versus raw material equation going into 2016. I think if you look at the guidance that we gave on Page 12 of the slides, we're seeing price/mix versus raws in 2016 is about $75 million year-over-year improvement. And, Emmanuel, I would say, I feel very good about that in our business delivering that when you look at the goals that we put ahead from '15 to '16, the 10% to 15%, getting $75 million of that improvement coming from price/mix versus raw material I think is something that we feel is doable, but is a very strong contributor to year-over-year increase. So maybe a long way of saying $75 million of price/mix versus raw improvement, I'm very comfortable with in terms of the number that we're shooting for."

So a lot of good momentum as we go into 2016. Not a lot of changes versus '15. We are projecting a small use of cash of about $50 million for working capital. And then you'll also recall that with the dissolution of these joint ventures around the world effective October 1st of 2015, that we no longer have this kind of minority interest either as part of it, okay.

And then as we feel confident in those programs, we begin to roll those out to the SBUs. So in 2015, that expense was in corporate other, causing it to be higher than you expected, but that will get moved out into SOI. Again, no change to EBIT, and put into the regions in 2016, okay. So that's one kind of change year-over-year. And then no doubt, in addition to that, the strong performance we had in our financials in 2015 then led to an increase in incentive comp as well, and that is booked in corporate other."

This morning, I'll provide a review of our fourth quarter and full year results and I'll then cover the highlights and provide context for each of our business units headed into 2016.

This morning, I'll provide a review of our fourth quarter and full year results and I'll then cover the highlights and provide context for each of our business units headed into 2016. I'll also provide some thoughts that look beyond this year before I turn the call over to Laura to review the financials in detail and review our outlook. 
I'm extremely pleased with our outstanding results in 2015 as we delivered 18% growth in our full year segment operating income, exceeding $2 billion for the first time in our 117-year history. Excluding the impact of currency on our results, our segment operating income grew 27%, which is a clear indication of the strength of our underlying business. This is our third consecutive year of record segment operating income. What stands out as most gratifying, however, is that these results were achieved amidst a challenging global economic climate. This outstanding performance contributed to free cash flow from operations that reached $951 million for the year. 
And as pleased as I am to report these results, I believe it's more important to view this as evidence of the soundness of our strategy, our ability to execute against that strategy and outstanding performance by our teams across the globe who have consistently met our goals. Our consistent progress has resulted in steady segment operating income growth and positions us well for that growth to continue. As I've said many times, we are not measuring success by the quarter or the year, but by continued progress toward our destination of creating sustainable economic value. That will not change. 
Evidence of our progress can be found in our stock price performance as measured by our 3-year total shareholder return. Goodyear is in the 94th percentile of the S&P 500 companies over that period. This is an outstanding achievement and demonstrates our focus on creating shareholder value. 
Our performance to date has enabled us to win with our customers in a competitive marketplace and execute on our 2014 to 2016 capital allocation plan. And today, we announced the $650 million increase to our share repurchase program. This announcement is very meaningful considering the position the company is in today versus where we were just 5 years ago. The consistent approach of executing against our strategy has allowed us to generate record earnings and strong cash flow. Not only have these results allowed us to continue to invest in our business for future growth, but they have allowed us to focus on strengthening our balance sheet while simultaneously returning capital to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. The ability to deliver on this plan further validates our strategy. 
Turning now to our business units. We had a record quarter in both North America and Asia Pacific. Our EMEA business showed a strong recovery versus a very weak fourth quarter last year. And our Latin American business continues to grapple with the weak economic environment in that region. Our global volumes grew nearly 7% in the quarter, partly because of our acquisition of Nippon Goodyear in Japan in October. Demand for our premium HVA products continued to be strong. We are confident that our brands and our value proposition will enable growth over the long term. Remember, we're not pursuing volume for volume's sake. Our team remains disciplined in our approach as we pursue profitable volume growth. 
2015 also marked a very strong year for our operational excellence initiatives and cost savings programs, which made an important contribution to our earnings growth by delivering cost savings in excess of inflation. In each region, we succeeded through steady execution of our strategy focused on increasing the value of the Goodyear brand for our customers and for Goodyear. 
Our North America business continued to deliver excellent results and has strong momentum as we move into 2016. North America's fourth quarter segment operating income was up 16%, continuing the trend of strong growth in 2015. This performance was a result of all aspects of our aligned business model working together. We expect moderate industry growth in North America in 2016 as many of the key economic indicators continue to be positive. Employment levels, miles driven and low gasoline prices all remain favorable and provide a productive platform for growth in 2016. We continue to expect strong demand in our OE and Replacement businesses. While OE growth expectations in the U.S. market have moderated considerably for the coming year, our OE selectivity strategy continues to pay dividends as we see strong ongoing pull-through on first and second replacements. 
You'll recall that the sour recovery began in earnest in 2010, and since then, we've seen 6 strong years of growth in OE. As first replacement is typically around the 3- to 4-year mark for a new vehicle, we can expect another several years of strong consumer replacement demand. This is the specific result our OE strategy was intended to have in the Replacement segment. It's working as we expected. And although OE growth may be moderating, overall increases in SUV and light truck are outpacing the industry. As you would expect, these platforms depend on the performance characteristics of Goodyear's premium high-value-added tires such as the Goodyear Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure, the Wrangler DuraTrac and the new Wrangler TrailRunner AT, which we recently announced. These are the types of platforms we targeted in our OE strategy. In 2015, our products were on 75% of the 15 top-selling U.S. SUV and light truck platforms including the best-selling Ford F-150, underpinning our OE growth and driving a richer mix. 
Even with North America continuing to turn in record results each quarter, we still see many opportunities in the year ahead including delivery of more premium HVA tires for our customers and consumers. To respond to the increasing demand, we delivered 1.1 million more consumer tires to our customers in 2015 and we're increasing our capability for 2016 and beyond. Some of that volume will come following investments we've made in our existing footprint and from units we're bringing in from our global facilities. Still more will be available with the start of production in our Americas plant in 2017. 
And though our North America e-commerce installer program is still in its early stages, I am extremely pleased with our thoughtful rollout and our very, very positive results. We're connecting online shoppers who come to us through goodyear.com to a preferred dealer who's part of our installer program. Our early data indicates that we're driving new business to our network of aligned dealers. Nearly 70% of consumers who bought on goodyear.com were new to the installing dealer.  
At a recent Annual North America Dealer Conference, our customers made it clear to us that online sales are huge opportunity for our retailers to grow their businesses. Their positive comments about the platform, our products and especially Goodyear's total value proposition in consumer and in commercial and off-the-road as well energized our team in a way that we've never seen. 
In a larger context, the response from our customers at the conference was overwhelmingly positive to exciting new product introductions, to our sales tools and training, to our marketing support and to our collaboration with them to execute our strategy and help them grow their businesses. 
Our team, and more importantly, our customers, came away from the meeting confident that Goodyear's total value proposition distinguishes us from competitors. Also, we believe that our customers left more aligned and more committed to Goodyear than ever before. We're clearly on the right path, and we expect our positive momentum to continue in 2016. 
In early December, we announced the consolidation of North America and Latin America into a new strategic business unit, the Americas, beginning this year. With this move, our customers and consumers will be served better by the combined business, and we will be stronger partner and supplier in both regions over the long term. These benefits will be achieved over time by integrating the businesses to improve product supply and customer service behind the proven leadership of Steve McClellan. All manufacturing plants in the combined region including the new Americas plant will be leveraged to serve all customers in Latin America and in North America. 
Though North America and Latin America approach their markets differently, there are increasing similarities including the growth of HVA tires and we'll use the key learning from our North America turnaround and success to navigate the challenges in Latin America. 
In the near term, our Latin America business continues to be challenged by the political and economic environment. This includes the recession in Brazil and ongoing challenges and Venezuela, which have led to its accounting deconsolidation this quarter. As such, we will continue to focus on our cost structure in the region as we anticipate the recessionary environment in Brazil to continue through 2016. Laura will have more on Venezuela in her remarks. 
In EMEA, our business made solid improvements in the fourth quarter with segment operating income of $100 million and segment operating margin above 8%. Winter volumes in the fourth quarter started strong, but lost momentum as the weather in our key markets proved to be relatively mild as we expected. Winter weather has returned in some regions of Europe, but at this point, our dealers sell from existing inventories. Typically, late winter weather should support the 2016 selling season and inventories today are at more balanced levels versus last year. Even so, our optimism at this point must be tempered by dealer caution after several mild winters in a row. 
We feel confident about our competitive position and our product portfolio heading into the summer selling season. Over the course of the year, we expect consumer industry growth to be about 2.5% for both OE and Replacement. On the cost side, the team has made progress with the closing of our Amiens facility and with some capacity actions announced in 2015 in the U.K. and Germany. 
EMEA is an excellent business for us and we remain positive about its future. However, we realize that the region faces several challenges, 3 there at the top of my list are the potential further weakening of the euro, the continued influx of Asian imports in Eastern European countries and the fluctuations of our business due to the effect of weather on the winter tire market. Our competitive advantage in this market is our ability to design and manufacture outstanding products that are recognized through tire labeling and magazine test scores. European consumers value the technology and performance of Goodyear tires. That remains a strong foundation to build upon. That said, we also have to continue to look at our cost structure and work to strengthen our distribution network to further differentiate our value proposition. In short, we are positive on EMEA's long-term potential and we believe stronger margins are achievable in the competitive EMEA market. 
In Asia Pacific, we achieved record fourth quarter segment operating income of $96 million, an increase of more than 20% following strong volume growth of 38% in the quarter. Our unit volumes were up 12% excluding the impact of the new Japanese replacement business. We saw strong growth in our China and India consumer businesses, but again saw continued deterioration in Australia due to ongoing challenges in that country and a currency that depreciated 17% in 2015. China had a very strong fourth quarter with our volumes increasing 30% versus the prior year. The increase was primarily due to Consumer OE where sales surged 43% year-over-year, triggered by local tax incentives on small cars as well as our success gaining new Chinese OE accounts. Consumer replacement volume grew 10%, driven by strong execution of our sell-through programs. While we expect continued volatility in the next few months, we remain confident in the long-term market outlook in China with continued growth in the middle class, fueling growth in the automotive sector. 
We are well positioned to benefit from this market growth, given our award-winning product lines and strong position in OE creating aftermarket pull. Most recently, our EfficientGrip Performance tire won China Auto News' Golden Wheels Award for 2015 as tire of the year for comfort. 
With the acquisition of the Japanese business in the fourth quarter, I'm excited about the prospects for growth tied to this heavily weighted HVA market. We see significant opportunities to grow our Goodyear-branded products in this key market.  
In summary. We remain optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities within our business in Asia Pacific. We'll continue driving new product introductions, OE pull-through and expanding our retail network to support long-term growth in the region. 
As we look at 2015, I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. Achieving these outcomes, even amidst global economic challenges, is perhaps the best indication of the strength of our strategy and the changes we've made to Goodyear's business over the past several years. In 2013, when we set out our 3-year plan, we established our target of 10% to 15% annual segment operating income growth, which would have pegged our earnings at around $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion in 2016. Since then, the macroeconomic crisis in Venezuela has dramatically worsened with the decline in the price of oil. With its deconsolidation, we are committed to grow 10% to 15% in our remaining businesses in 2016 into that same initial level of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. 
Over the past few years, we've been transparent with our level of earnings and cash balance in Venezuela. From talking with our investors, we understand that many have been discounting that value for some time. We believe that's the right way to think about it. 
In the year ahead, we expect relative strength in our mature markets, and like this year, continued volatility in emerging markets. We are confident in our 2016 plan and remain committed to our strategy of pursuing profitable volume and share in segments where the Goodyear brand is a differentiator. 
With the heightened concern about the state of the global economy today, we will continue to initiate adjustments to our cost base amidst changing markets. We also are working on plans for further actions on costs including capacity actions later this year. 
Looking beyond 2016, we expect our growth will continue. We will share our next-stage plan via an Investor Day later this year and we expect to provide more details on timing over the next few months. However, I can tell you much of the story will remain familiar. We are as focused as ever on being the industry's innovation leader, being first with customers, being the leader in targeted market segments, and as a result, being a company that continuously drive sustainable value. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Laura."
275789,323469359,929222,"The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company","Executives","Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will start with a review of our fourth quarter results including points from each of our 4 strategic business units.

My remarks today will start with a review of our fourth quarter results including points from each of our 4 strategic business units. I'll then cover updates to our full year outlook for 2016 including the changes related to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan business before we open up the call for your questions.  
Our fourth quarter results include the impact of the October 1 dissolution of our global alliance with SRI, which included several joint ventures. You'll recall the dissolution impacts several areas across the businesses, and as shown in our June 5, 2015, investor presentation, the total net impact is expected to be accretive to net income and adjusted EPS. 
Turning to Slide 7, I'd like to highlight a few items on our income statement. In the quarter, we grew segment operating income by 33% to $476 million and our SOI margin increased 350 basis points to 11.7%. 
Unit volumes increased 2.6 million units or 7% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in Asia Pacific and a recovery in EMEA tire sales in this year's fourth quarter. The net impact of the dissolution of the joint ventures on total volume was an increase of 1.2 million units with Asia Pacific's benefit more than offsetting North America's decrease in volume from the same overall transaction. 
The decline in our net sales for the quarter is more than explained by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 
Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was significantly lower than we expected. This was primarily the result of the recognition of $55 million in foreign tax credits and research and development tax credits, following U.S. legislative actions in December. 
Our reported earnings per share on a diluted basis was a net loss of $1.42. The results were impacted by certain significant items including a charge for the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary on December 31, 2015. A summary of these items is listed in the appendix of today's presentation. After adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $0.93, up $0.34 from last year. 
Consistent with our approach in previous quarters, for year-over-year comparison purposes, we have provided a U.S. tax-adjusted EPS. For the quarter, the adjusted EPS on that basis is $0.83, which includes the $55 million tax credit. As a reminder, although we are incurring tax expense in the U.S. today due to our significant U.S. deferred tax assets, we do not anticipate paying significant cash income taxes in the U.S. through 2020. 
The step chart on Slide 8 walks fourth quarter 2014 segment operating income to fourth quarter 2015. Year-over-year, SOI increased $117 million. The net impact of volume growth and unabsorbed fixed cost was a benefit of $73 million. The benefits of lower raw material costs and improved price/mix combine for a net benefit of $108 million during the quarter with continued strong performance in North America. On a full year basis, our price/mix versus raw materials benefit was $356 million. Excluding Venezuela, it was $77 million. Our $80 million of cost savings was more than offset by the impact of inflation, driven by hyperinflation in Venezuela. I'll note that fourth quarter cost savings included a $30 million favorable adjustment to our general and product liability reserve. On a full year basis, or net cost savings were $29 million year-over-year. Excluding Venezuela, our net cost savings were $227 million, reflecting the continued momentum of our operational excellence initiatives. Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $21 million in the quarter, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar particularly against the euro. Other, a negative $36 million, includes an $18 million impact from our other tire-related businesses for the quarter including the divestiture of our U.S. motorcycle business as part of the joint venture dissolution. 
Turning to Slide 9. The balance sheet is presented on a pro forma basis, reflecting the redemption of our euro notes that occurred on January 14, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.2 billion and reflect the derecognition of $320 million in Venezuela. Our total debt of $5.5 billion is down $910 million from the end of 2014, driven by debt repayment and currency translation on our overseas debt balances. In December, we repaid $400 million on our second lean term loan, leaving a balance remaining of $600 million. Our global pension liability declined $72 million from last year's level, driven by contributions to our international plants. I'll also note that we continue to execute on our pension strategy. During 2015, we completed programs to offer lump sums to certain former employees in the U.S. As a result, we recognized a noncash pretax pension settlement charge of $137 million, which is included as a significant item on Slide 21. This action had a small positive impact on our U.S. funded status and it reduces our PBGC premiums and overall liability risk going forward. 
Slide 10 shows we generated $951 million of free cash flow from operations in 2015. Working capital was a use of $42 million and our CapEx spend was $983 million. We also repurchased $100 million worth of our common stock during the fourth quarter or about 3 million shares, bringing the total since the start of the program to $413 million. 
Moving now to the business units on Slide 11, I'll start with North America. North America continues to deliver strong results with another record quarter and segment operating income of $266 million. Operating margin for the quarter was about 14%, reflecting the seventh consecutive quarter of margin exceeding 10%. North America's $37 million improvement in year-over-year earnings was driven by strong price/mix net of raw material costs, reflecting the value of the Goodyear brand and our industry-leading products and services. 
North America benefited from improved factory utilization in the third quarter as well as from cost savings including favorable general and product liability costs, as I noted earlier, which more than offset higher marketing expense and the impact of the divestiture of our Dunlop-branded Japanese OE and U.S. motorcycle businesses. Excluding the impact of the joint venture dissolution, North America's consumer volume was essentially flat in the fourth quarter when compared with last year's very strong fourth quarter. You'll recall that our third quarter of 2014 had weak shipments as a result of the tariff prebuy, which then benefited shipments in the fourth quarter of 2014 as distributors and retailers rebalanced inventory levels. 
North America continues to be challenged to fully satisfy market demand for our premium high-value-added tires. We are working diligently to leverage our global manufacturing footprint and continue to invest in the Americas to meet this demand. 
In the commercial truck business, fourth quarter sales units declined 12% year-over-year. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in our Commercial OE business and also reflects some increased pressure in the replacement industry from an influx of low-end imported units. 
For the full year of 2015, North America earned record segment operating income of $1.1 billion, a year-over-year improvement of $305 million. We believe these results are further evidence that our strategy is delivering sustainable value. 
Europe, Middle East and Africa generated segment operating income of $100 million in the quarter, which was $70 million higher than the prior year. The increase in SOI was primarily driven by volume improvement and our cost savings programs, which more than offset foreign currency translation and inflation headwinds. Despite another warm winter and continued pressure from Asian imports in Eastern Europe, our fourth quarter EMEA unit volumes increased about 11% year-over-year. The volume increase was driven by European winter tire industry sell-in, which grew 5% year-over-year, and our strong performance in consumer replacement where year-over-year volumes increased by 13%. 
In commercial truck, we again saw strong performance in a stable industry environment. We saw double-digit volume gains in Commercial OE and we continued to gain share in replacement. 
Asia Pacific generated segment operating income of $96 million during the fourth quarter. This sets a new record for the region and is $16 million above the same period the year before. The main driver was positive volume, which was partially offset by continuing currency headwinds due to the weakening Chinese RMB. Our segment operating margin in the region increased to 17.2%. Our volume grew 38% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of the Japanese Replacement tire business, our volume growth was 12%. 
Outside of Japan, volume growth came from our 2 primary growth engines, China and India. Despite the slowing Chinese economy, we grew double digits in OE as well as in our Replacement business. In India, strong market conditions and our ability to increase share have especially benefited our Replacement business. While we anticipate slower growth and continuing currency headwinds for the region in the short term, we continue to view China and the rest of the region as a key long-term growth opportunity. We are investing in our teams, our products and our capabilities to drive that growth. 
We had a challenging quarter in Latin America due to the persistent weak economic environment in Brazil and continued volatility in Venezuela. In the quarter, our volume decreased 11% versus 2014. The decline in volume was driven by 3 factors. First, our Consumer OE business declined 29% due to a continuing recessionary environment, driven by a 36% decline in the industry in Brazil. Second, our consumer replacement sales in the quarter were down 5%. This volume decline was influenced by some pull-ahead of orders into the prior quarter due to announced price increases effective in October. And third, Commercial Replacement industry volumes declined 12% year-over-year primarily in Brazil. Segment operating income in the fourth quarter was $14 million, which was down $6 million from the prior year. In the quarter, Latin America's results were negatively impacted by cost inflation and lower volume. For the quarter, operating income from our Venezuelan business was $22 million. This operating income excludes foreign currency exchange losses related to the Venezuelan bolivar, which were $5 million in the quarter. 
The economic environment in Venezuela continues to be extremely challenging. We were unable to exchange bolivars for U.S. dollars during the fourth quarter, which we require to purchase imported raw materials for operations. These conditions, combined with other Venezuelan regulations, have increasingly limited our ability to make and execute operational decisions at our Venezuelan subsidiary. As a result, we concluded we do not meet the accounting criteria for control and we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiary on December 31. Despite this change, we continue to maintain operations in Venezuela and serve our customers there. 
Our Latin America team is continuing to work proactively to mitigate our exposure and maximize market opportunities in an increasingly difficult environment. We continue to focus on costs and we will work to leverage the Americas consolidation to improve capabilities, to improve processes and to reduce costs. 
Slide 12 shows our full year modeling assumptions for 2016. We have included our 2015 results excluding Venezuela on the left-hand side of the chart for comparison purposes. Full year SOI in Venezuela was $119 million. After adjusting for its deconsolidation, our 2015 SOI was $1.9 billion. We are committed to growing our SOI 10% to 15% year-over-year in our remaining operations and are targeting SOI of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion in 2016. 
We see sales volume growth of approximately 3% for the year from our revised base of about 165 million units, which excludes Venezuela. This volume will come from incremental growth in all of our regions and also includes the full year benefit from the acquisition of Nippon Goodyear. I'll note that similar to prior guidance, we expect a volume benefit of about $15 per tire in 2016. 
Our outlook for price/mix net of raw materials is a full year net benefit of approximately $75 million. For 2016, we expect raw materials to decrease about 5% year-over-year. This includes the negative impact of both the RMI index agreements with our OE customers in certain large commercial fleets as well as an impact from currency on raw material transactions in our international businesses. 
Unabsorbed overhead for 2016 is expected to be a benefit of approximately $50 million, reflecting the benefit of higher overall volumes. 
We expect cost savings versus general inflation to be a benefit of about $135 million in 2016 as operational excellence programs from our core business continue to deliver. In line with the timing of some of our operational excellence initiatives and our cadence in 2015, our cost savings benefits will ramp up through the year. 
While we had outstanding performance of $227 million in net cost savings in 2015, excluding Venezuela, there are a few reasons for the change in 2016. Our 2015 full year cost savings included a $35 million benefit from general and product liability reserve adjustments including the $30 million I mentioned during the Q4 SOI walk. In addition, as we have deployed a few central initiatives regionally, we will increase our allocation of these costs to the SBUs in 2016. This will show as a headwind to cost savings with an offsetting reduction below SOI in other corporate costs with no impact to EBIT. 
Lastly, pension expense in SOI for 2016 is expected to be up $30 million less than 2015 with the benefit from the change to the spot rate accounting method. 
These items are summarized in a slide included in the appendix to today's presentation. 
Moving on to foreign exchange. We expect translation to be a headwind of $45 million for the full year based on current spot rates. With the sale of the North American motorcycle business, we will not have the associated operating income of about $30 million with the majority of that impact in the spring and summer months. 
Finally, we have a combined $35 million negative impact from start-up costs associated with the Americas plant and projected increases in marketing investments. 
Additional financial assumptions for 2016 are listed on Slide 13. I'll cover a few key highlights from this slide. Following the refinancings and debt repayments in 2015, our interest expense is expected to be $350 million to $375 million, a significant reduction year-over-year. 
Our global pension expense is expected to decline from $135 million to a range of $65 million to $85 million, following a change to the spot rate method of accounting for the calculation of annual interest costs. The expected benefit in SOI from this change is approximately $45 million in 2016. This benefit will be partially offset by about $20 million from actuarial losses experienced in 2015. Additionally, our 2016 pension expense will not include expense from Venezuela, which had pension expense of $27 million in 2015. 
Working capital is expected to be a use of about $50 million and our CapEx outlook is $1 billion to $1.1 billion. 
Finally, for 2016, we expect other corporate costs to be approximately $165 million. 
In total, our target range for SOI is $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. From this range and the other financial assumptions we provided in today's presentation, you can see we are also targeting another year with significant cash flow generation. Our strong cash flow provides the ability to continue funding our 2014 through 2016 capital allocation plan. 
Now turning to Slide 14, I'd like to cover the increase to our share repurchase program and other updates to our 2014 to 2016 capital allocation plan. Growth CapEx is $900 million, following choices we've made given weakness in some of our emerging markets. We've slowed down investments in Brazil and China while maintaining our investments in the new Americas plant. 
The dividend and share repurchase basket of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion reflects a $650 million increase in the authorization for share repurchases. We have spent $542 million through 2015. Given the seasonality of our cash flow, we would expect that the majority of our purchases in 2016 will be completed in the second half of the year, in line with our cash flow generation. 
As a final note, our debt repayment and pension funding basket is expected to be about $900 million, in line with achieving our target ratio of 2.0x to 2.1x adjusted debt-to-EBITDAP ratio by the end of 2016. 
Now we'll open the call up for your questions."

And I think if you look at the NCAA college football play-offs series coverage, hopefully many on the call were watching that, we had a lot of coverage on that, first time we really had that extensive of coverage. Obviously, our spend went up. But as we look at it, it was well worth the cost of doing that and that did hit our margin for the quarter. And in addition to that, we did see a little bit of just product mix change as we saw our fourth quarter. Clearly, our consumer margins, consumer business margins, continue to be very strong based on a lot of the things we talked about in terms of our new products and our product mix in consumer. However, we did see a slowdown of the commercial business, particularly the Commercial OE business slowed in Q4, and you saw our assumptions for that even going out into 2016. So I think you take those 2 things, those are really the drivers that hit the margin as we look at the comparative period."

So we see distortions in the industry and that potentially could happen in the truck business if these things were to ultimately pass. And additionally, what we would point out is, as we've seen in the past, those tires end up going to different places. So we saw consumer tires go down to Latin America a number of years back when the real was very strong. More recently, we've seen consumer tires go over to Eastern Europe. So tires will move around and I'd just say that as sort of a reminder to everyone as they think about this."

You're assuming net benefit of maybe 75% of this, but at the same time you're saying that you're experiencing some challenges in meeting demand in some of the higher-end tariffs. So maybe just give us some color on the pricing dynamics and how Goodyear's affected."

I know you recall we went through about a 3-, 4-year period where we had significantly increasing raw material prices and where we've now had a number of years including going on into '16 of decreasing raw material prices. And we managed very well our price/mix on the way up dealing with those increased costs, took us a while to catch up, if you remember, and I think we're demonstrating an ability to manage price/mix versus raw materials on the way down. And I think if we can say what's underpinning that, I would suggest to you again this notion of how we've built a very aligned business model, selling the Goodyear value proposition to our customers, not just built upon a product and a tire, but also built around the marketing that we bring, even the new e-commerce platforms that we're bringing, the sales tools and training. All those type of things, our customers, our dealers, our distributors are seeing the value of that and that is certainly competitively advantage in Goodyear. And our goal always was for that to turn up in the value we bring to the dealers and creating value for them and certainly creating value for us. So I would say that's, in particular, what I would say is driving it. Obviously, if we go around the world, we have a variety of different circumstances I can talk to as well given devaluations of currencies and all that sort of thing, but maybe I'll stop there for a moment."

I think on a macro basis though, your point continues to be the right one that we've seen and that's the demand for those high complex tires still we see being ahead of supply, and as a consequence, that's a positive dynamic for our industry as we look ahead. The rest of the world, I'll also say it's a tough place. As we look at EMEA right now, very competitive environment with what has been the devaluation of the euro. I know we've seen a little bit of reversal of that as of recent, but certainly that makes our raw materials more expensive. So we're really working on our value proposition in Europe as well, aligning ourselves with our dealers, putting our new products out there and trying to create value for them and for us. Again, with that, in Latin America, obviously, Brazil is in a very difficult situation. The real, I think, peaked at 4.20 and that's certainly putting a lot of pressure on our raw material costs there as well and we're obviously being very active trying to make sure that we can recover that. And in Asia, I think that we've always demonstrated very good capabilities to deliver price/mix versus raw material. Remember, that raw material hits us much quicker in Asia. But given where we play a lot in performance in SUV, our distribution and our business model there likes us to -- allows us to perform very well there. And I think if you add all that up, we've got a lot of positives and certainly headwinds going into 2016. But if you look at the outlook that Laura highlighted, we're at about another $75 million of positive price/mix versus raws going into 2016. But look, we have to -- we've got to continue to work hard and make sure we're delivering that value for our customers, and as I said, it's been working."

But I think the question of Latin America, I think the #1 thing I would point out, we've been there almost 100 years in Latin America and we've gone through periods of volatility not unlike this before and we have a lot of confidence, one, to work through it; and two, the confidence that the markets are going to come back, and I think that's the most important thing to say. We have staying power there and we believe it will come back. In terms of things that we are doing right now, I would point toward a couple of things. In particular, if you look at our consumer replacement volume, it's a very big, bright spot for us in a difficult environment. We have been mixing up our business, the larger rim diameter tires, we did that with some of the investments that we've made in the region and we're actually going out and expanding our distribution to grow our business there. This is happening in Brazil, it's happening in the Andean region, it's happening in Mexico. Our Brazil volumes started out very strong in consumer replacement. They weakened a little, but still very positive in 2015. Our volumes in places like Mexico, the Andean region were very strong double digits and a lot of growth there. So as we're in a difficult environment, we're making sure that we're planting the seeds and growing our business for when that market ultimately comes back. And that is working extremely well as we expand into the region there. Look, that said, I'll echo your comments. Brazil is in a very, very difficult position. The OE businesses, OE auto manufacturers, you've all read the same things. I won't go through the numbers, but clearly they're in a very difficult situation there. That impacts us as well. I think, Laura said our OE business was down fairly significantly. We also had, as an industry, a lot of capacity that went into Brazil. That means in a weaker demand environment, we actually have more supply. That's certainly not helping things as we go. So I have to echo your comments that Latin America will be tough certainly through 2016. But our belief is, hey, this is a long-term gain, reflecting the long term and we're going to continue to make very cautious and thoughtful investments in this region as we go. And I think we have again a good track record of doing that and the belief that what Latin America represents to us is upside in terms of our ultimate segment operating income. And I might say, Venezuela obviously creates a headwind for us, but that's something we're going to deal with as well as we look to the future."

Emmanuel, I would say -- before I go to the volume, I would just say I am extremely pleased with our North America business' performance in the fourth quarter as well as all of 2015 and certainly even the years moving up to that. As I mentioned, earl",504,"Yes. Emmanuel, I would say -- before I go to the volume, I would just say I am extremely pleased with our North America business' performance in the fourth quarter as well as all of 2015 and certainly even the years moving up to that. As I mentioned, earlier, our margin for the year was 14.3%, segment operating income margin, a record for us in a mature market in North America. We would put that up against any business anywhere. So very strong. And that business is really benefiting from the aligned business model that I mentioned earlier that we've built over the number of years and you're seeing that come through. So we're very, very pleased. And as Laura mentioned, we feel there are opportunities to continue to grow this business, particularly with the incremental HVA supply coming on. As we look to Q4, I think a couple of things. One, we had a pretty strong comp in Q4 of '14 because, if you remember, we had sort of a lot of customers buying in Q3 '14 as related to the tariffs at that moment in time. Our results in Q3, if you remember, versus the industry, were a little bit low. Q4, in turn was actually pretty strong for us in 2014. So we had a pretty strong comp in that period. Secondly, this question of mixing up around HVA tires, I think, is very relevant. So while we are improving our mix and our margin, we talked about the SUV tires, the Performance tires, the Wrangler tires and the like, what's also happening is while we're getting higher margin, those tires going through our factories means our factories run a little bit slower so we're seeing a little bit less volume coming through those factories where one doesn't equal one in terms of an LVA tire to an HVA tire so some of that impact is coming through. So we know that, we've talked about that. So even though we've had very robust margins, very strong demand and very positive outlook, you saw a little bit of that impact Q4 as well. As we mentioned, we're getting more tires -- we will again get more tires out of our North America factory in 2016 -- factories, I should say. We're bringing more tires in, taking advantage of some of the weakness around the globe to bring more of those tires in demand in. And again, as Laura just mentioned, we have our Americas factories coming online. So we'll continue to build up to providing more of those high-demand tires as well. And I have to say, having been on the side where we had too much capacity versus not necessarily enough of it, this is a better place to be than having factories with capacity to fill. So we're very comfortable with where we are and we need to -- we're going to continue to get more of those tires to our customers who were really asking for them right now."

When you look at the goals that we put ahead from '15 to '16, the 10% to 15%, getting $75 million of that improvement coming from price/mix versus raw material, I think, is something that we feel is doable, but is a very strong contributor to that year-over-year increase.

So in 2015, that expense was in corporate other causing it to be higher than you expected, but that will get moved out into SOI, again no change to EBIT, and put into the regions in 2016, okay. So that's one kind of change year-over-year. And then, no doubt, in addition to that, the strong performance we had in our financials in 2015 then led to an increase in incentive comp as well and that is booked in corporate other."

This morning, I'll provide a review of our fourth quarter and full year results and I'll then cover the highlights and provide context for each of our business units headed into 2016. I'll also provide some thoughts that look beyond this year before I turn the call over to Laura to review the financials in detail and review our outlook. 
I'm extremely pleased with our outstanding results in 2015 as we delivered 18% growth in our full year segment operating income, exceeding $2 billion for the first time in our 117-year history. Excluding the impact of currency on our results, our segment operating income grew 27%, which is a clear indication of the strength of our underlying business. This is our third consecutive year of record segment operating income. What stands out as most gratifying, however, is that these results were achieved amidst a challenging global economic climate. This outstanding performance contributed to free cash flow from operations that reached $951 million for the year. 
And as pleased as I am to report these results, I believe it's more important to view this as evidence of the soundness of our strategy, our ability to execute against that strategy and outstanding performance by our teams across the globe who have consistently met our goals. Our consistent progress has resulted in steady segment operating income growth and positions us well for that growth to continue. As I've said many times, we are not measuring success by the quarter or the year, but by continued progress toward our destination of creating sustainable economic value. That will not change. 
Evidence of our progress can be found in our stock price performance as measured by our 3-year total shareholder return. Goodyear is in the 94th percentile of the S&P 500 companies over that period. This is an outstanding achievement and demonstrates our focus on creating shareholder value. 
Our performance to date has enabled us to win with our customers in a competitive marketplace and execute on our 2014 to 2016 capital allocation plan. And today, we announced the $650 million increase to our share repurchase program. This announcement is very meaningful considering the position the company is in today versus where we were just 5 years ago. The consistent approach of executing against our strategy has allowed us to generate record earnings and strong cash flow. Not only have these results allowed us to continue to invest in our business for future growth, but they have allowed us to focus on strengthening our balance sheet while simultaneously returning capital to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. The ability to deliver on this plan further validates our strategy. 
Turning now to our business units. We had a record quarter in both North America and Asia Pacific. Our EMEA business showed a strong recovery versus a very weak fourth quarter last year. And our Latin American business continues to grapple with the weak economic environment in that region. Our global volumes grew nearly 7% in the quarter, partly because of our acquisition of Nippon Goodyear in Japan in October. Demand for our premium HVA products continued to be strong. We are confident that our brands and our value proposition will enable growth over the long term. Remember, we're not pursuing volume for volume's sake. Our team remains disciplined in our approach as we pursue profitable volume growth. 
2015 also marked a very strong year for our operational excellence initiatives and cost savings programs, which made an important contribution to our earnings growth by delivering cost savings in excess of inflation. In each region, we succeeded through steady execution of our strategy focused on increasing the value of the Goodyear brand for our customers and for Goodyear. 
Our North America business continued to deliver excellent results and has strong momentum as we move into 2016. North America's fourth quarter segment operating income was up 16%, continuing the trend of strong growth in 2015. This performance was a result of all aspects of our aligned business model working together. We expect moderate industry growth in North America in 2016 as many of the key economic indicators continue to be positive. Employment levels, miles driven and low gasoline prices all remain favorable and provide a productive platform for growth in 2016. We continue to expect strong demand in our OE and Replacement businesses. While OE growth expectations in the U.S. market have moderated considerably for the coming year, our OE selectivity strategy continues to pay dividends as we see strong ongoing pull-through on first and second replacements. 
You'll recall that the SAR recovery began in earnest in 2010, and since then, we've seen 6 strong years of growth in OE. As first replacement is typically around the 3- to 4-year mark for a new vehicle, we can expect another several years of strong consumer replacement demand. This is the specific result our OE strategy was intended to have in the Replacement segment. It's working as we expected. And although OE growth may be moderating, overall increases in SUV and light truck are outpacing the industry. As you would expect, these platforms depend on the performance characteristics of Goodyear's premium high-value-added tires such as the Goodyear Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure, the Wrangler DuraTrac and the new Wrangler TrailRunner AT, which we recently announced. These are the types of platforms we targeted in our OE strategy. In 2015, our products were on 75% of the 15 top-selling U.S. SUV and light truck platforms including the best-selling Ford F-150, underpinning our OE growth and driving a richer mix. 
Even with North America continuing to turn in record results each quarter, we still see many opportunities in the year ahead including delivery of more premium HVA tires for our customers and consumers. To respond to the increasing demand, we delivered 1.1 million more consumer tires to our customers in 2015 and we're increasing our capability for 2016 and beyond. Some of that volume will come following investments we've made in our existing footprint and from units we're bringing in from our global facilities. Still more will be available with the start of production in our Americas plant in 2017. 
And though our North America e-commerce installer program is still in its early stages, I am extremely pleased with our thoughtful rollout and our very, very positive results. We're connecting online shoppers who come to us through goodyear.com to a preferred dealer who's part of our installer program. Our early data indicates that we're driving new business to our network of aligned dealers. Nearly 70% of consumers who bought on goodyear.com were new to the installing dealer.  
At our recent Annual North America Dealer Conference, our customers made it clear to us that online sales are huge opportunity for our retailers to grow their businesses. Their positive comments about the platform, our products and especially Goodyear's total value proposition in consumer and in commercial and off-the-road as well energized our team in a way that we've never seen. 
In a larger context, the response from our customers at the conference was overwhelmingly positive to exciting new product introductions, to our sales tools and training, to our marketing support and to our collaboration with them to execute our strategy and help them grow their businesses. 
Our team, and more importantly, our customers, came away from the meeting confident that Goodyear's total value proposition distinguishes us from competitors. Also, we believe that our customers left more aligned and more committed to Goodyear than ever before. We're clearly on the right path, and we expect our positive momentum to continue in 2016. 
In early December, we announced the consolidation of North America and Latin America into a new strategic business unit, the Americas, beginning this year. With this move, our customers and consumers will be served better by the combined business, and we'll be stronger partner and supplier in both regions over the long term. These benefits will be achieved over time by integrating the businesses to improve product supply and customer service behind the proven leadership of Steve McClellan. All manufacturing plants in the combined region including the new Americas plant will be leveraged to serve all customers in Latin America and in North America. 
Though North America and Latin America approach their markets differently, there are increasing similarities including the growth of HVA tires and we'll use the key learning from our North America turnaround and success to navigate the challenges in Latin America. 
In the near term, our Latin America business continues to be challenged by the political and economic environment. This includes the recession in Brazil and ongoing challenges and Venezuela, which have led to its accounting deconsolidation this quarter. As such, we will continue to focus on our cost structure in the region as we anticipate the recessionary environment in Brazil to continue through 2016. Laura will have more on Venezuela in her remarks. 
In EMEA, our business made solid improvements in the fourth quarter with segment operating income of $100 million and segment operating margin above 8%. Winter volumes in the fourth quarter started strong, but lost momentum as the weather in our key markets proved to be relatively mild as we expected. Winter weather has returned in some regions of Europe, but at this point, our dealers sell from existing inventories. Typically, late winter weather should support the 2016 selling season and inventories today are at more balanced levels versus last year. Even so, our optimism at this point must be tempered by dealer caution after several mild winters in a row. 
We feel confident about our competitive position and our product portfolio heading into the summer selling season. Over the course of the year, we expect consumer industry growth to be about 2.5% for both OE and Replacement. On the cost side, the team has made progress with the closing of our Amiens facility and with some capacity actions announced in 2015 in the U.K. and Germany. 
EMEA is an excellent business for us and we remain positive about its future. However, we realize that the region faces several challenges. Three that are at the top of my list are the potential further weakening of the euro, the continued influx of Asian imports in Eastern European countries and the fluctuations of our business due to the effect of weather on the winter tire market. Our competitive advantage in this market is our ability to design and manufacture outstanding products that are recognized through tire labeling and magazine test scores. European consumers value the technology and performance of Goodyear tires. That remains a strong foundation to build upon. That said, we also have to continue to look at our cost structure and work to strengthen our distribution network to further differentiate our value proposition. In short, we are positive on EMEA's long-term potential and we believe stronger margins are achievable in the competitive EMEA market. 
In Asia Pacific, we achieved record fourth quarter segment operating income of $96 million, an increase of more than 20% following strong volume growth of 38% in the quarter. Our unit volumes were up 12% excluding the impact of the new Japanese replacement business. We saw strong growth in our China and India consumer businesses, but again saw continued deterioration in Australia due to ongoing challenges in that country and a currency that depreciated 17% in 2015. China had a very strong fourth quarter with our volumes increasing 30% versus the prior year. The increase was primarily due to Consumer OE where sales surged 43% year-over-year, triggered by local tax incentives on small cars as well as our success gaining new Chinese OE accounts. Consumer replacement volume grew 10%, driven by strong execution of our sell-through programs. While we expect continued volatility in the next few months, we remain confident in the long-term market outlook in China with continued growth in the middle class, fueling growth in the automotive sector. 
We are well positioned to benefit from this market growth, given our award-winning product lines and strong position in OE creating aftermarket pull. Most recently, our EfficientGrip Performance tire won China Auto News' Golden Wheels Award for 2015 as tire of the year for comfort. 
With the acquisition of the Japanese business in the fourth quarter, I'm excited about the prospects for growth tied to this heavily weighted HVA market. We see significant opportunities to grow our Goodyear-branded products in this key market.  
In summary. We remain optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities within our business in Asia Pacific. We'll continue driving new product introductions, OE pull-through and expanding our retail network to support long-term growth in the region. 
As we look at 2015, I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. Achieving these outcomes, even amidst global economic challenges, is perhaps the best indication of the strength of our strategy and the changes we've made to Goodyear's business over the past several years. In 2013, when we set out our 3-year plan, we established our target of 10% to 15% annual segment operating income growth, which would have pegged our earnings at around $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion in 2016. Since then, the macroeconomic crisis in Venezuela has dramatically worsened with the decline in the price of oil. With its deconsolidation, we are committed to grow 10% to 15% in our remaining businesses in 2016 into that same initial level of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. 
Over the past few years, we've been transparent with our level of earnings and cash balance in Venezuela. From talking with our investors, we understand that many have been discounting that value for some time. We believe that's the right way to think about it. 
In the year ahead, we expect relative strength in our mature markets, and like this year, continued volatility in emerging markets. We are confident in our 2016 plan and remain committed to our strategy of pursuing profitable volume and share in segments where the Goodyear brand is a differentiator. 
With the heightened concern about the state of the global economy today, we will continue to initiate adjustments to our cost base amidst changing markets. We also are working on plans for further actions on costs including capacity actions later this year. 
Looking beyond 2016, we expect our growth will continue. We will share our next-stage plan via an Investor Day later this year and we expect to provide more details on timing over the next few months. However, I can tell you much of the story will remain familiar. We are as focused as ever on being the industry's innovation leader, being first with customers, being the leader in targeted market segments, and as a result, being a company that continuously drives sustainable value. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Laura."

My remarks today will start with a review of our fourth quarter results including points from each of our 4 strategic business units. I'll then cover updates to our full year outlook for 2016 including the changes related to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan business before we open up the call for your questions.  
Our fourth quarter results include the impact of the October 1 dissolution of our global alliance with SRI, which included several joint ventures. You'll recall the dissolution impacts several areas across the businesses, and as shown in our June 5, 2015, investor presentation, the total net impact is expected to be accretive to net income and adjusted EPS. 
Turning to Slide 7, I'd like to highlight a few items on our income statement. In the quarter, we grew segment operating income by 33% to $476 million and our SOI margin increased 350 basis points to 11.7%. 
Unit volumes increased 2.6 million units or 7% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in Asia Pacific and a recovery in EMEA tire sales in this year's fourth quarter. The net impact of the dissolution of the joint ventures on total volume with an increase of 1.2 million units with Asia Pacific's benefit more than offsetting North America's decrease in volume from the same overall transaction. 
The decline in our net sales for the quarter is more than explained by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 
Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was significantly lower than we expected. This was primarily the result of the recognition of $55 million in foreign tax credits and research and development tax credits, following U.S. legislative actions in December. 
Our reported earnings per share on a diluted basis was a net loss of $1.42. The results were impacted by certain significant items including a charge for the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary on December 31, 2015. A summary of these items is listed in the appendix of today's presentation. After adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $0.93, up $0.34 from last year. 
Consistent with our approach in previous quarters, for year-over-year comparison purposes, we have provided a U.S. tax-adjusted EPS. For the quarter, the adjusted EPS on that basis is $0.83, which includes the $55 million tax credit. As a reminder, although we are incurring tax expense in the U.S. today due to our significant U.S. deferred tax assets, we do not anticipate paying significant cash income taxes in the U.S. through 2020. 
The step chart on Slide 8 walks fourth quarter 2014 segment operating income to fourth quarter 2015. Year-over-year, SOI increased $117 million. The net impact of volume growth and unabsorbed fixed cost was a benefit of $73 million. The benefits of lower raw material costs and improved price/mix combined for a net benefit of $108 million during the quarter with continued strong performance in North America. On a full year basis, our price/mix versus raw materials benefit was $356 million. Excluding Venezuela, it was $77 million. Our $80 million of cost savings was more than offset by the impact of inflation, driven by hyperinflation in Venezuela. I'll note that fourth quarter cost savings included a $30 million favorable adjustment to our general and product liability reserve. On a full year basis, or net cost savings were $29 million year-over-year. Excluding Venezuela, our net cost savings were $227 million, reflecting the continued momentum of our operational excellence initiatives. Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $21 million in the quarter, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar particularly against the euro. Other, a negative $36 million, includes an $18 million impact from our other tire-related businesses for the quarter including the divestiture of our U.S. motorcycle business as part of the joint venture dissolution. 
Turning to Slide 9. The balance sheet is presented on a pro forma basis, reflecting the redemption of our euro notes that occurred on January 14, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.2 billion and reflect the derecognition of $320 million in Venezuela. Our total debt of $5.5 billion is down $910 million from the end of 2014, driven by debt repayment and currency translation on our overseas debt balances. In December, we repaid $400 million on our second lien term loan, leaving a balance remaining of $600 million. Our global pension liability declined $72 million from last year's level, driven by contributions to our international plans. I'll also note that we continue to execute on our pension strategy. During 2015, we completed programs to offer lump sums to certain former employees in the U.S. As a result, we recognized a noncash pretax pension settlement charge of $137 million, which is included as a significant item on Slide 21. This action had a small positive impact on our U.S. funded status and it reduces our PBGC premiums and overall liability risk going forward. 
Slide 10 shows we generated $951 million of free cash flow from operations in 2015. Working capital was a use of $42 million and our CapEx spend was $983 million. We also repurchased $100 million worth of our common stock during the fourth quarter or about 3 million shares, bringing the total since the start of the program to $413 million. 
Moving now to the business units on Slide 11, I'll start with North America. North America continues to deliver strong results with another record quarter and segment operating income of $266 million. Operating margin for the quarter was about 14%, reflecting the seventh consecutive quarter of margin exceeding 10%. North America's $37 million improvement in year-over-year earnings was driven by strong price/mix net of raw material costs, reflecting the value of the Goodyear brand and our industry-leading products and services. 
North America benefited from improved factory utilization in the third quarter as well as from cost savings including favorable general and product liability costs, as I noted earlier, which more than offset higher marketing expense and the impact of the divestiture of our Dunlop-branded Japanese OE and U.S. motorcycle businesses. Excluding the impact of the joint venture dissolution, North America's consumer volume was essentially flat in the fourth quarter when compared with last year's very strong fourth quarter. You'll recall that our third quarter of 2014 had weak shipments as a result of the tariff prebuy, which then benefited shipments in the fourth quarter of 2014 as distributors and retailers rebalanced inventory levels. 
North America continues to be challenged to fully satisfy market demand for our premium high-value-added tires. We are working diligently to leverage our global manufacturing footprint and continue to invest in the Americas to meet this demand. 
In the commercial truck business, fourth quarter sales units declined 12% year-over-year. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in our Commercial OE business and also reflects some increased pressure in the replacement industry from an influx of low-end imported units. 
For the full year of 2015, North America earned record segment operating income of $1.1 billion, a year-over-year improvement of $305 million. We believe these results are further evidence that our strategy is delivering sustainable value. 
Europe, Middle East and Africa generated segment operating income of $100 million in the quarter, which was $70 million higher than the prior year. The increase in SOI was primarily driven by volume improvement and our cost savings programs, which more than offset foreign currency translation and inflation headwinds. Despite another warm winter and continued pressure from Asian imports in Eastern Europe, our fourth quarter EMEA unit volumes increased about 11% year-over-year. The volume increase was driven by European winter tire industry sell-in, which grew 5% year-over-year, and our strong performance in consumer replacement where year-over-year volumes increased by 13%. 
In commercial truck, we again saw strong performance in a stable industry environment. We saw double-digit volume gains in Commercial OE and we continued to gain share in replacement. 
Asia Pacific generated segment operating income of $96 million during the fourth quarter. This sets a new record for the region and is $16 million above the same period the year before. The main driver was positive volume, which was partially offset by continuing currency headwinds due to the weakening Chinese RMB. Our segment operating margin in the region increased to 17.2%. Our volume grew 38% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of the Japanese Replacement tire business, our volume growth was 12%. 
Outside of Japan, volume growth came from our 2 primary growth engines, China and India. Despite the slowing Chinese economy, we grew double digits in OE as well as in our Replacement business. In India, strong market conditions and our ability to increase share have especially benefited our Replacement business. While we anticipate slower growth and continuing currency headwinds for the region in the short term, we continue to view China and the rest of the region as a key long-term growth opportunity. We are investing in our teams, our products and our capabilities to drive that growth. 
We had a challenging quarter in Latin America due to the persistent weak economic environment in Brazil and continued volatility in Venezuela. In the quarter, our volume decreased 11% versus 2014. The decline in volume was driven by 3 factors. First, our Consumer OE business declined 29% due to a continuing recessionary environment, driven by a 36% decline in the industry in Brazil. Second, our consumer replacement sales in the quarter were down 5%. This volume decline was influenced by some pull-ahead of orders into the prior quarter due to announced price increases effective in October. And third, Commercial Replacement industry volumes declined 12% year-over-year primarily in Brazil. Segment operating income in the fourth quarter was $14 million, which was down $6 million from the prior year. In the quarter, Latin America's results were negatively impacted by cost inflation and lower volume. For the quarter, operating income from our Venezuelan business was $22 million. This operating income excludes foreign currency exchange losses related to the Venezuelan bolivar, which were $5 million in the quarter. 
The economic environment in Venezuela continues to be extremely challenging. We were unable to exchange bolivars for U.S. dollars during the fourth quarter, which we require to purchase imported raw materials for operations. These conditions, combined with other Venezuelan regulations, have increasingly limited our ability to make and execute operational decisions at our Venezuelan subsidiary. As a result, we concluded we do not meet the accounting criteria for control and we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiary on December 31. Despite this change, we continue to maintain operations in Venezuela and serve our customers there. 
Our Latin America team is continuing to work proactively to mitigate our exposure and maximize market opportunities in an increasingly difficult environment. We continue to focus on costs and we will work to leverage the Americas consolidation to improve capabilities, to improve processes and to reduce costs. 
Slide 12 shows our full year modeling assumptions for 2016. We have included our 2015 results excluding Venezuela on the left-hand side of the chart for comparison purposes. Full year SOI in Venezuela was $119 million. After adjusting for its deconsolidation, our 2015 SOI was $1.9 billion. We are committed to growing our SOI 10% to 15% year-over-year in our remaining operations and are targeting SOI of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion in 2016. 
We see sales volume growth of approximately 3% for the year from our revised base of about 165 million units, which excludes Venezuela. This volume will come from incremental growth in all of our regions and also includes the full year benefit from the acquisition of Nippon Goodyear. I'll note that similar to prior guidance, we expect a volume benefit of about $15 per tire in 2016. 
Our outlook for price/mix net of raw materials is a full year net benefit of approximately $75 million. For 2016, we expect raw materials to decrease about 5% year-over-year. This includes the negative impact of both the RMI index agreements with our OE customers in certain large commercial fleets as well as an impact from currency on raw material transactions in our international businesses. 
Unabsorbed overhead for 2016 is expected to be a benefit of approximately $50 million, reflecting the benefit of higher overall volumes. 
We expect cost savings versus general inflation to be a benefit of about $135 million in 2016 as operational excellence programs from our core business continue to deliver. In line with the timing of some of our operational excellence initiatives and our cadence in 2015, our cost savings benefits will ramp up through the year. 
While we had outstanding performance of $227 million in net cost savings in 2015, excluding Venezuela, there are a few reasons for the change in 2016. Our 2015 full year cost savings included a $35 million benefit from general and product liability reserve adjustments including the $30 million I mentioned during the Q4 SOI walk. In addition, as we have deployed a few central initiatives regionally, we will increase our allocation of these costs to the SBUs in 2016. This will show as a headwind to cost savings with an offsetting reduction below SOI in other corporate costs with no impact to EBIT. 
Lastly, pension expense in SOI for 2016 is expected to be up $30 million less than 2015 with the benefit from the change to the spot rate accounting method. 
These items are summarized in a slide included in the appendix to today's presentation. 
Moving on to foreign exchange. We expect translation to be a headwind of $45 million for the full year based on current spot rates. With the sale of the North American motorcycle business, we will not have the associated operating income of about $30 million with the majority of that impact in the spring and summer months. 
Finally, we have a combined $35 million negative impact from start-up costs associated with the Americas plant and projected increases in marketing investments. 
Additional financial assumptions for 2016 are listed on Slide 13. I'll cover a few key highlights from this slide. Following the refinancings and debt repayments in 2015, our interest expense is expected to be $350 million to $375 million, a significant reduction year-over-year. 
Our global pension expense is expected to decline from $135 million to a range of $65 million to $85 million, following a change to the spot rate method of accounting for the calculation of annual interest costs. The expected benefit in SOI from this change is approximately $45 million in 2016. This benefit will be partially offset by about $20 million from actuarial losses experienced in 2015. Additionally, our 2016 pension expense will not include expense from Venezuela, which had pension expense of $27 million in 2015. 
Working capital is expected to be a use of about $50 million and our CapEx outlook is $1 billion to $1.1 billion. 
Finally, for 2016, we expect other corporate costs to be approximately $165 million. 
In total, our target range for SOI is $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. From this range and the other financial assumptions we provided in today's presentation, you can see we are also targeting another year with significant cash flow generation. Our strong cash flow provides the ability to continue funding our 2014 through 2016 capital allocation plan. 
Now turning to Slide 14, I'd like to cover the increase to our share repurchase program and other updates to our 2014 to 2016 capital allocation plan. Growth CapEx is $900 million, following choices we've made given weakness in some of our emerging markets. We've slowed down investments in Brazil and China while maintaining our investments in the new Americas plant. 
The dividend and share repurchase basket of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion reflects a $650 million increase in the authorization for share repurchases. We have spent $542 million through 2015. Given the seasonality of our cash flow, we would expect that the majority of our repurchases in 2016 will be completed in the second half of the year, in line with our cash flow generation. 
As a final note, our debt repayment and pension funding basket is expected to be about $900 million, in line with achieving our target ratio of 2.0x to 2.1x adjusted debt-to-EBITDAP ratio by the end of 2016. 
Now we'll open the call up for your questions."

And I think if you look at the NCAA college football play-offs series coverage, hopefully many on the call were watching that, we had a lot of coverage on that, first time we really had that extensive of coverage. Obviously, our spend went up. But as we look at it, it was well worth the cost of doing that and that did hit our margin for the quarter. And in addition to that, we did see a little bit of just product mix change as we saw our fourth quarter. Clearly, our consumer margins, consumer business margins, continue to be very strong based on a lot of the things we talked about in terms of our new products and our product mix in consumer. However, we did see a slowdown of the commercial business, particularly the Commercial OE business slowed in Q4, and you saw our assumptions for that even going out into 2016. So I think you take those 2 things, those are really the drivers that hit the margin as we look at the comparative period."

So we see distortions in the industry and that potentially could happen in the truck business if these things were to ultimately pass. And additionally, what we would point out is, as we've seen in the past, those tires end up going to different places. So we saw consumer tires go down to Latin America a number of years back when the real was very strong. More recently, we've seen consumer tires go over to Eastern Europe.

I know you recall we went through about a 3-, 4-year period where we had significantly increasing raw material prices and where we've now had a number of years including going out into '16 of decreasing raw material prices. And we managed very well our price/mix on the way up dealing with those increased costs, took us a while to catch up, if you remember, and I think we're demonstrating an ability to manage price/mix versus raw materials on the way down. And I think if we can say what's underpinning that, I would suggest to you again this notion of how we've built a very aligned business model, selling the Goodyear value proposition to our customers, not just built upon a product and a tire, but also built around the marketing that we bring, even the new e-commerce platforms that we're bringing, the sales tools and training. All those type of things, our customers, our dealers, our distributors are seeing the value of that and that is certainly competitively advantaging Goodyear. And our goal always was for that to turn up in the value we bring to the dealers and creating value for them and certainly creating value for us. So I would say that's, in particular, what I would say is driving it. Obviously, if we go around the world, we have a variety of different circumstances I can talk to as well given devaluations of currencies and all that sort of thing, but maybe I'll stop there for a moment."

I think on a macro basis though, your point continues to be the right one that we've seen and that's the demand for those high complex tires still we see being ahead of supply, and as a consequence, that's a positive dynamic for our industry as we look ahead. The rest of the world, I'll also say it's a tough place. As we look at EMEA right now, very competitive environment with what has been the devaluation of the euro. I know we've seen a little bit of reversal of that as of recent, but certainly that makes our raw materials more expensive. So we're really working on our value proposition in Europe as well, aligning ourselves with our dealers, putting our new products out there and trying to create value for them and for us. Again, with that, in Latin America, obviously, Brazil is in a very difficult situation. The real, I think, peaked at 4.20 and that's certainly putting a lot of pressure on our raw material costs there as well and we're obviously being very active trying to make sure that we can recover that. And in Asia, I think that we've always demonstrated very good capabilities to deliver price/mix versus raw material. Remember, that raw material hits us much quicker in Asia. But given where we play a lot in performance and SUV, our distribution and our business model there likes us to -- allows us to perform very well there. And I think if you add all that up, we've got a lot of positives and certainly headwinds going into 2016. But if you look at the outlook that Laura highlighted, we're at about another $75 million of positive price/mix versus raws going into 2016. But look, we have to -- we've got to continue to work hard and make sure we're delivering that value for our customers, and as I said, it's been working."

Short answer is there is plenty of runway left on operational excellence initiative. But this plan, this cost savings, the beauty of it is, in the early years, there were some initiatives that paid off quite quickly and others that needed to build momentum through our plants over time. One aspect of it, we haven't even -- on conversion savings, our plant optimization hasn't been fully rolled out in all of our plants yet and won't be quite finished even in 2016.

But I think the question of Latin America, I think the #1 thing I would point out, we've been there almost 100 years in Latin America and we've gone through periods of volatility not unlike this before and we have a lot of confidence, one, to work through it; and two, the confidence that the markets are going to come back, and I think that's the most important thing to say. We have staying power there and we believe it will come back. In terms of things that we are doing right now, I would point toward a couple of things. In particular, if you look at our consumer replacement volume, it's a very big, bright spot for us in a difficult environment. We have been mixing up our business, the larger rim diameter tires, we did that with some of the investments that we've made in the region and we're actually going out and expanding our distribution to grow our business there. This is happening in Brazil, it's happening in the Andean region, it's happening in Mexico. Our Brazil volumes started out very strong in consumer placement. They weakened a little, but still very positive in 2015. Our volumes in places like Mexico, the Andean region were very strong double digits and a lot of growth there. So as we're in a difficult environment, we're making sure that we're planting the seeds and growing our business for when that market ultimately comes back. And that is working extremely well as we expand into the region there. Look, that said, I'll echo your comments. Brazil is in a very, very difficult position. The OE businesses, OE auto manufacturers, you've all read the same things. I won't go through the numbers, but clearly they're in a very difficult situation there. That impacts us as well. I think, Laura said our OE business was down fairly significantly. We also had, as an industry, a lot of capacity that went into Brazil. That means in a weaker demand environment, we actually have more supply. That's certainly not helping things as we go. So I have to echo your comments that Latin America will be tough certainly through 2016. But our belief is, hey, this is a long-term game, reflecting the long term and we're going to continue to make very cautious and thoughtful investments in this region as we go. And I think we have again a good track record of doing that and the belief that what Latin America represents to us is upside in terms of our ultimate segment operating income. And I might say, Venezuela obviously creates a headwind for us, but that's something we're going to deal with as well as we look to the future."

As I mentioned, earl",504,"Yes. Emmanuel, I would say -- before I go to the volume, I would just say I am extremely pleased with our North America business' performance in the fourth quarter as well as all of 2015 and certainly even the years moving up to that. As I mentioned, earlier, our margin for the year was 14.3%, segment operating income margin, a record for us in a mature market in North America. We would put that up against any business anywhere. So very strong. And that business is really benefiting from the aligned business model that I mentioned earlier that we've built over the number of years and you're seeing that come through. So we're very, very pleased. And as Laura mentioned, we feel there are opportunities to continue to grow this business, particularly with the incremental HVA supply coming on. As we look to Q4, I think a couple of things. One, we had a pretty strong comp in Q4 of '14 because, if you remember, we had sort of a lot of customers buying in Q3 '14 as related to the tariffs at that moment in time. Our results in Q3, if you remember, versus the industry, were a little bit low. Q4, in turn was actually pretty strong for us in 2014. So we had a pretty strong comp in that period. Secondly, this question of mixing up around HVA tires, I think, is very relevant. So while we are improving our mix and our margin, we talked about the SUV tires, the Performance tires, the Wrangler tires and the like, what's also happening is while we're getting higher margin, those tires going through our factories means our factories run a little bit slower so we're seeing a little bit less volume coming through those factories where one doesn't equal one in terms of an LVA tire to an HVA tire so some of that impact is coming through. So we know that, we've talked about that. So even though we've had very robust margins, very strong demand and very positive outlook, you saw a little bit of that impact Q4 as well. As we mentioned, we're getting more tires -- we will again get more tires out of our North America factory in 2016 -- factories, I should say. We're bringing more tires in, taking advantage of some of the weakness around the globe to bring more of those tires in demand in. And again, as Laura just mentioned, we have our Americas factories coming online. So we'll continue to build up to providing more of those high-demand tires as well. And I have to say, having been on the side where we had too much capacity versus not necessarily enough of it, this is a better place to be than having factories with capacity to fill. So we're very comfortable with where we are and we need to -- we're going to continue to get more of those tires to our customers who are really asking for them right now."

And then as we feel confident in those programs, we begin to roll those out to the SBUs. So in 2015, that expense was in corporate other causing it to be higher than you expected, but that will get moved out into SOI, again no change to EBIT, and put into the regions in 2016, okay. So that's one kind of change year-over-year. And then, no doubt, in addition to that, the strong performance we had in our financials in 2015 then led to an increase in incentive comp as well and that is booked in corporate other."

Then with next stage with our longer-term plan, I'll share an update to our strategy road map, which",1993,"Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's call by providing a summary of our first quarter highlights in each of our 3 regions. Then with next stage with our longer-term plan, I'll share an update to our strategy road map, which has been the cornerstone of how we operate our business. Laura will follow with the financial review and our 2016 outlook. 
We delivered strong first quarter performance highlighted by record segment operating income of $419 million. That's an increase of 14% in our core segment operating income, which excludes Venezuela from our 2015 base. On that same basis, our volumes grew 3% in the quarter. Demand for our premium-branded, high-value added products is robust and our product mix continues to grow richer. Our results are not only consistent with our expectations for the quarter, but also with our long-term strategy and reflect the continued strong execution of our teams. As you know, this is our first quarter of results for our combined Americas business and I'm extremely pleased with the team's performance. While we'll talk in some detail about how the U.S. and certain other countries are performing as part of our quarterly updates, I want to reinforce long-term benefits we anticipate in managing the business internally as one consolidated unit. 
After adjusting for the loss of Venezuela's income, America segment operating income grew 15% in the quarter, driven by strong demand for our premium-branded HVA products. In the U.S., favorable demand has been created by lower fuel prices, higher miles driven and growing consumer plant donates particularly in SUV and light truck. We are growing our OE profitability by winning shipments on many of the most popular vehicles and responding to the increasing complexity of OEM requirements. Our success in OE gives us a favorable position in the subsequent replacement market. 
Our consumer volumes in the U.S. were essentially flat in the first quarter. Customers want more premium Goodyear-branded products and increasing our supply is both our biggest challenge and our greatest opportunity. We're just about one year away from when we expect our new factory in Mexico to come online, and we're very excited about the opportunity to begin increasing our supply for our most complex tires with this incremental capacity. In the interim, we are looking to maximize our footprint in the Americas to get the tires where they are needed most in the region. 
Conditions in Brazil remain challenging during the quarter. The ongoing recession and political uncertainty contributed to the overall economic stress in the country. Although, our replacement in OE segments both weekend in Brazil, it's profit contribution was positive in the first quarter. We feel very good about of our ability to drive growth in mix in HVA segments in Brazil and about how we've managed our value proposition in this difficult recessionary environment. 
In summary, we had a very strong first quarter in the Americas, and we're looking forward to opportunities across our markets in 2016 and in the longer-term as well. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa delivered 10% growth in segment in operating income. We had a good overall performance and relatively solid industry environment with the strong demand for our HVA products for many of our OE and replacement customers. 
Early this month, I spent time with several of our customers in Europe. I came back encouraged by the conference in Goodyear and their preference for our products. At the same time, they made it clear that they want even more of our HVA products, particularly in the performance in SUV categories. The growth in more complex HVA tires is as healthy in Europe as it is here in the U.S. The industry's evolution to high-value-added tires has been accelerated by many European car companies. Their preferences are driving mix up both in OE and replacement across the entire region. 
While our EMEA business delivered good results in the first quarter, we are continue to look at our cost structure and working to strengthen and further differentiate our value proposition through our distribution and service network. We see opportunities to grow profitably and remain positive on EMEA's longer-term potential. 
Our Asia Pacific business delivered another strong quarter fueled by robust volume growth in China and India and because of the acquisition of Nippon Goodyear in Japan. Segment operating income grew 18% from last year's first quarter. 
I'd like to take a minute to touch on our business in China, where we had another strong quarter as volume increased more than 20% versus the prior year. Our growth was broad-based as OE was up nearly 30% and replacement volume increased nearly 20%. OE continues to benefit from strong car sales growth while replacement was driven by our teams strong execution of sell-through programs. We remained confident in the long-term market outlook with continued expansion of the middle-class spring growth in Asia Pacific. We are well positioned to benefit from this market growth given our award-winning product lines and strong position in OE, again creating a replacement market pull. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with our strong first quarter performance. Even though we are running our business to create long-term shareholder value, a strong first quarter provides a good foundation for the remainder of the year. I'd like to spend the rest of my time this morning reviewing our updated strategy road map. As some of you may recall, we unveiled our original road map at the Investor Meeting in March, 2011, and since then it has served as our guide to win in a rapidly changing and completing tire industry. So the original road map served us well. We believe that an update was needed to more accurately reflect how we'll win, how we'll work and where we're focus in an increasingly complex and competitive market. 
As I take you through it, there's one important thing to keep in mind. The updated road map does not represent a change in strategy. The road map is more specific about our goals and expectation and ties our overall strategy to driving performance for our customers and consumers. Starting right at the top, we begin with a clear and direct expression of our goal to deliver sustainable revenue and profit growth over the long term while increasing the value of our brand. Our emphasis is on the end. Our goal is sustainable revenue and profit growth. Top line growth and margin expansion remain our objective global economic headwinds. When we do both, we increase the value Goodyear creates for all of our stakeholders, associates, customers, consumers, suppliers, and of course, investors. The body of the road map comprises 3 clearly defined and interdependent elements: how we'll win, how we'll work and where we'll focus. I'll briefly touch on all 3 and as I go through them, you'll see how all the content is integrated no matter where it appears on the road map. 
First, the how we'll win section has been distilled to 3 key elements that you've heard us talk about on many of our quarterly calls. Innovation excellence is what we strive for when designing products from the market back. This ensures that we are creating products and services that respond to the demand of consumers end-users and our customers. In sales and marketing excellence, we strive to create demand for our brand and for our innovative products, driving consumers and end-users to our customers. We help them grow their businesses by leveraging the power of our brands and providing industry-leading market and sales tools and training. Our insights and the search build value proposition for our customers that goes beyond products alone. The result is that more consumers will ask for Goodyear tires and our customers will prefer to sell Goodyear tires. 
Sales and marketing excellence is about making it easier to do both. The final element in this section is operational excellence. This means efficiently making more the tires the market demand, especially in the face of increasing complexity. As a result, we'll be a more reliable supplier by having the right tire at the right time to meet customer and consumer demand. 
Our operational excellence initiatives around the world are delivering both cost-savings and improving efficiency. We certainly had success, but we know there is still much more work to be done here. Now it's important each of these areas are individually, the key concept on this part of the strategy road map is winning at the intersection of all 3. Our goal is to deliver a value proposition built on innovation, reliability and quality that wins over price alone, by putting of our customer at the center of the intersection and by making this the clear purpose of all of our initiatives, we see the opportunity to distinguish ourselves in the rapidly changing tire industry. 
Moving to the second section of the strategy road map. We identify 5 competencies that define how we'll work. As you read through the individual items, think of them as behaviors we expect from our associates in order to be successful at the intersection in the how we'll win section. For example, collaboration and agility are simple words, but key competencies mastered only by top-tier companies to help deliver outsized results for customers and for shareholders. 
The final section of the road map is, where we'll focus. These are real world priorities, where we'll aim our excellence efforts. Some of these are given, quality, consumer experience and customer service have always been priorities and will remain so. Putting them in writing, reaffirms our commitment to them. Focusing on high-value segments is something else we've talked about frequently. The ability to supply high-value-added tires of increasing complexity, such as larger rim diameters and greater performance specifications is where the growth and profitability are and will increasingly be in the tire industry, that's why they are important. 
The specific segments may differ from region to region, but the value proposition is the same. We want to win in the parts of the market, where we can capture the full value of our brand, our technology, our distribution and our products and services. We will not chase volumes for volume's focusing on high-value segments is critical to creating sustainable value and profitable growth. 
The final priority is mastering complexity. This is a major challenge for every tire company. There is complexity in manufacturing and OE supply chain virtually every step in our and an operations, complexity in the tire industry is increasing at a pace not seen since the shift to radial tires, but it's being, driven by OEMs by regulators seeking to reduced CO2 emissions and by consumers who won't compromise on performance. It's affecting bad development, manufacturing, supply chain, consumer experience and customer service. The complexity of today's OE tires, let alone tomorrow, is signaled currently greater than it was just 5 years ago. We will embrace this trend by managing the necessary complexity and by eliminating the unneeded complexity and everything we do. There is a lot of detail on the better strategy road map. And as I said, this is not reflect a new strategy. Our objective with updated road map was to clarify what's important to us and create a single page document to reinforce alignment among all of our associates throughout the organization. A team that is a line from top to bottom around a common set of goals as defined in our strategy road map is the most important ingredient in our plan for long-term success. 
Now in closing, I'll add a final comment. We'll review with you our strategy road map ties into the long-term trends in our industry, which we call the MegaTrends at our Investor Conference in Boston on September 15. Also, we will use the conference to discuss our strategic business units and update our long-term performance targets. Further details on the conference will be forthcoming. Now I'll turn the call over to Laura"

Today, I will cover our first quarter results and provide more detail on key income drivers of the quarter. I'll also provide an update regarding our full year outlook for 2016 before we open the call up for yo",1776,"Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter results and provide more detail on key income drivers of the quarter. I'll also provide an update regarding our full year outlook for 2016 before we open the call up for your questions. 
Turning to the income statement on Slide 5, you will see our results for the first quarter. Consistent with how we have provided our full year outlook at our call in February, we have provided call outs that remove the effect of deconsolidating Venezuela in order to provide better transparency to our underlying core business. 
On that basis, you see we had an outstanding quarter. Volume was up 3%, segment operating income of $419 million was up 14%, and SOI margin of 11.4% increased 2.1 points. Looking at the income statement items as reported for the first quarter, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies reduce sales by $141 million year-over-year. The sales comparison to prior year was also negatively impacted by deconsolidation of Venezuela, which had $94 million of net sales in the first quarter of 2015. 
Gross margin improved 3 4 points to 26.8%. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.68. Our results were influenced by certain significant items and after adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $0.72, an impressive increase of 33% over first quarter of 2015. In addition to our stronger overall segment operating income, interest expense and minority interest were lower by a combined $32 million versus last year, primarily driven by refinancing transactions we completed in 2015, and the dissolution of our global alliance with SRI late last year. 
As you will see on the step chart on Slide 6, which walks first quarter 2015 segment operating income to first quarter 2016, we have also isolated the effect of deconsolidating Venezuela to provide transparency on the drivers of our core SOI. The benefit of higher volume in the first quarter and higher production levels in the fourth quarter drove an overall improvement of $47 million. Lower raw material costs of $68 million more than offset reduced price mix of $30 million for a net benefit of $38 million during the quarter. Cost saving actions of $47 million, driven by our operational excellence initiatives, more more than offset the $33 million negative impact of inflation. 
Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $12 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the Canadian dollar. Other negative of $34 million includes increased accruals in incentive compensation, higher advertising spend, particularly in Asia Pacific and a $6 million impact from the divesture of our North American motorcycle business in October of 2015. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 7. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.1 billion. Net debt is up versus year-end, which reflects the normal working capital seasonality in our business versus the prior-year period, the increase includes the impact of Venezuela's deconsolidation. Free cash flow from operations is shown on Slide 8. For the quarter, we used $585 million of cash, which is in line with the typical first quarter seasonality of our business. Over the last 12 months, our free cash flow performance has been strong nearly at $800 million. 
Moving on to the business units on Slide 9. I'll start with our new Americas business unit. The Americas delivered strong segment operating income of $260 million with year-over-year growth of $12 million. Excluding the $22 million impact related to the deconsolidation of Venezuela, SOI increased 15%. Americas margin expanded more than 200 basis points in the quarter, primarily driven by positive price/mix performance, coupled with a raw material benefit. We saw very strong mix in the U.S., especially from growth in ROE business. The Americas also benefited from improved factory utilization and our operational excellence initiatives. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of lower volume and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Our volume in the Americas declined 6% year-over-year. When excluding the impact of both Venezuela and the sale of GDTNA from our 2015 bass, our unit volume decreased 2%. This decline was primarily driven by lower unit volume in our consumer business in Brazil, where consumer tires sales were down 16% year-over-year in a continuing recessionary environment. 
We saw declines in Brazil OE as a result of decreased vehicle production versus last year and a decline in the replacement in line with the overall industry. Even so as Rich mentioned, our HVA product mix is growing and Brazil was profitable in the first quarter despite the very difficult economic environment. This is a testament to the strength of our brand and our team. As Rich mentioned, demand remained strong in the U.S. However, in our consumer business unit volumes were essentially flat as we remained constrained in our ability to satisfy growing market demand for our premium high-value-added tires. Our capacity has been impacted by increasing complexity in HVA tires, including growth in OE with SUV and light truck segments that have longer cycle times in our plants.  As you are aware, we are making strives to improve our supply within our U.S. and global manufacturing footprint to meet this demand. Separately, I'll note that our first quarter sales in our U.S. commercial business declined almost 15%, driven by declines in OE. Overall, we're very pleased with the strong profit contribution of the Americas in the first quarter as a consolidated unit. We are focused on increasing our supply of high-value-added tires to drive profitable long-term volume growth, while maintaining our focus on operational excellence and delivering strong SOI across the region. 
Turning to Slide 10, Europe, Middle East and Africa delivered segment operating income of $80 million in the quarter, up 10%, driven by the benefit of higher production volumes during the fourth quarter. Volume was up almost 2% compared to last year and was primarily driven by an increase of 5% in consumer OE with strong demand for Goodyear products throughout the region. 
Consumer replacement summer industry volumes were up 3% during the quarter. And in winter tires, channel inventory are more normalized following the first quarter sellout. Our commercial truck business also continues to deliver consistent results, growing market share based on the strength of our premium-branded products and a relatively stable industry environment.  Our EMEA business delivered solid performance in the first quarter of 2016. We are very confident in our team, our product portfolio and in our ability to grow profitably throughout 2016. 
Turning to Slide 11, Asia Pacific delivered first quarter segment operating income of $79 million, representing a $12 million increase versus the same period last year. The main driver in income was higher volume, which was partially offset by increased SAG and investments in advertising, both related to our recently acquired replacement business in Japan. SOI margin in the region increased 16.2% from 14.9% a year ago. Asia Pacific sold 7.3  million tires in the first quarter, representing 28% growth versus last year. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of the replacement tire business in Japan, our volume growth was 11%, which was driven by 2 of our largest and fastest-growing markets in China and India.  The outstanding first quarter performance of our Asia Pacific business confirms our confidence and our commitment to targeted growth investments in the region. 
Turning now to Slide 12. I'll cover our full year modeling assumptions for 2016. In summary, our full year outlook remains unchanged from our February call, and we continue to target $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion in SOI in 2016. Following increases in underlying raw material cost since February, we now expect raw material costs to be only 2% lower than last year before cost-saving action. In our year-end earnings call in February, we were expecting a 5% decline during 2016. However, we continue to see our full year price/mix versus raw material benefit at around $75 million, unchanged from our February outlook. We expect second quarter raw materials to be down 3% and the remaining price/mix net of raw materials benefit to be spread evenly throughout the last 3 quarters. Our intent is to offset increases in raw materials with price and mix. We could see some volatility related to RMIs in the quarter. But as we look at 2016, we still feel very good about the year and the long-term sustainability of our margins. 
In cost-savings versus inflation, we continue to expect a benefit of $135 million for the full year. However, I'll note that we do expect about $35 million in incremental cost in the Americas SOI in the second quarter. This temporary increase in our cost is primarily related to labor and engineering expenses that were incurred toward the end of 2015 and early this year as we prioritize plant optimization activities and make shifts in production to enhance our capabilities to supply more HVA tires. While we do expect some offsets in the quarter across our SBUs, we wanted to highlight this expected increase in the America. As a result, we expect our total second quarter cost-savings versus inflation to be similar to the first quarter actuals and improving later in the year for full year savings of $135 million. 
Regarding foreign currency translation, we are maintaining our full year impact to segment operating income of approximately $45 million. While current spot rates would imply a more favorable outcome, it's very early in the year and currencies remain volatile. And as a reminder for the Americas, the divested motorcycle business has its strongest comparable in the second quarter, which corresponds to the seasonality of that business. Additional financial assumptions for 2016 are listed on Slide 13. We revised our full year expectation for financing fees to $45 million, which is a $15 million lower than our prior forecast. This change is a result of our adoption of new guidance regarding the presentation of debt issuance cost on the income statement. While the offsetting amount is now recorded within interest expense, our interest expense guidance for the full year remains unchanged at $350 million to $375 million, as the increase has been offset by lower interest rate than expected. 
And finally, we repurchased $50 million in shares during the first quarter. We repurchased $463 million so far under our existing 1.1 billion share repurchase authorization. Consistent with our previous communication, we remain committed to repurchasing additional shares through 2016 and early 2017, with the majority of our plan spend towards the end of the year and aligned with our cash flow generation. 
Now I'll open the line up for your questions."

You almost have to do sort of a tour around the world to really see what's going on. I will say to your comment on HVA pricing, clearly, the part of the market that's growing where the demand is still outstrips supply as we've reviewed many times in the past, I would say a very good demand supply equation, and we are able to certainly capture the value of those products going forward. So as we've always said, our high-value segments of those targeted marketed segments, I would say still very, very robust environment and we're very pleased with how that's moving. I think if you look at pricing around the world again we don't really comment on pricing specifically, so I won't do that. But certainly in EMEA, it remains a very competitive market there. We've seen that in the past, and I think we expect that to continue. The industry clearly showing some signs of strengthening, particularly in the OE part of the market as we said. And we have many places we do business in Europe, so we manage that value proposition market-by-market, but we see it as still a very good place for us. The biggest impact that we continue to see is that of sort of Chinese or Asian tires coming into Eastern Europe and putting pricing pressure on there. In Latin America, we could probably use Brazil as a marker. Again in what we've seen there is the impact of the devaluation of the currency against tire raw material prices, so a lot of pressure there. We've had already a price increase announced in Q4 2015. And our way to do business there has always been to get the value of our products by recovering the cost of our raw materials and dealing with the deevaluation of the impacts there. That's exactly what we can do to do in that very difficult environment that I will tell you our volumes there as we talked down in the past are increasingly mixing up to HVA tires sort of 17-inch and above rim diameter tires, and that is a part of the market that is still very favorable for us there. And in North America,  I would say really pretty stable environment that we've seen there, not really a whole lot else to talk about there. The higher end of the market is doing very well for us. And in Asia Pacific, what you're seeing there and we'll continue to see is raw material rises. Remember that gets through our footprint -- our raw material cost quicker because of the cycle times. So again, we've been very active in the market there recovering those from material prices as well."

But your consumer replacement OE, I think together the business was flat in the U.S. against this pretty strong backdrop, you mentioned that you're still capacity constraint, which is probably why we're still positive price/mix of the top line in the U.S. despite lower raw materials, I guess, our question is, as you progress through the year, do you see this easing up at all or even against pretty nice backdrop for volumes in North America given increasing VMTs and growing make a carpark whether your consumer business is going to grow up not?"

But listen, I think you have actually capitalized it very well if you look at the market, and you look at our overall volume as a company, excluding Venezuela, we grew to 3%, which is really pretty much in line with what",771,"No, no. I just wanted to be sure. But listen, I think you have actually capitalized it very well if you look at the market, and you look at our overall volume as a company, excluding Venezuela, we grew to 3%, which is really pretty much in line with what we said, strong volumes in Asia and EMEA. When you come back and look at the Americas, and you adjusted again for Venezuela and then GDTNA what you see is Brazil was the weak spot in the Americas. And you come down to U.S. if you like, if you want to call that you hit it on the head, we're about flat. And the way  I would frame that up, again, David, you kind of laid it out properly, if you look at consumer placement, just look at our main numbers, it was up about 6%. But as you've said, very distorted by over 30% increase and sort of non-member Asian imports coming in, and that is the long tail whips of clarifying. You have all the industry being impacted by really in the first half. Second half of 2014. If you think about this, there is a lot the prebuy, by which meant Q1 2015, there wasn't really any buying going on, that buying sort of went back to trend line Q1 '16 this past quarter, so you saw that big increase over 30%. But if you follow it over the period, it's about on the normal sort of import purchases that the industries  always had. So distorted by quarter not really over the long term. If you look at members, members are up about 0.6%, call it, 1%. And I think in that environment, what you said we've got vehicle mise travels being up about 2%, you've got the sellout up around about 1% to 2%, which for us always has been a good marker of what's happening in the industry. So good environment. Our main members up 0.6 and to your point Goodyear flat. And as you look at us, I would say what we've seen is increased demand from our OEM sort of strategy that we've laid out over the years with the strong's are with the OEM demands we're dedicating more capacity to that. In fact, demand was up higher than we expected there as well. As we do that, as you know those tires are really high specifications, yields are a little bit lower, so that's having a little bit of an impact on us as well. I would say, I'm pleased with that because essentially it says we're on strategy. We said we wanted to get on the right and bring those through to our dealers as a replacement first and second replacements is coming through. So the strategy is working exactly as intended. The demand is higher, therefore, we are having trouble keeping up with those tires, and you're seeing some of that in the replacement market. But to frame it in the quarter sort of use it as a proxy just for the moment, our main members up 0.6, Goodyear up -- flat in replacement, so driven by those things. As we look forward, I think to the question of can we catch up, it's exactly the intent. We've got focused improvement. As Laura mentioned, get more tires out of the factories we have. We have the factory coming on in 2016 and we have imported -- excuse me 2017, I'm sorry, getting ahead of myself, and then we have some of the import tires coming in from some of our factories overseas to try to use that capacity in a period of low demand. So our intent is certainly to get ahead of it. But I would say this notion of being a tire short versus the tire long is helpful to us. I would say, we're executing on plan. We've got an excellent environment. We've got an excellent demand for our Goodyear tires. We're executing on our plan. Hey, the fact of the matter is it's what we talk about everyday, we need more of tires that customers want right now and that's why you hear us talking about it. And the last thing, David, I would say is we always have to keep in mind the tire industry is cyclical. We want to always be talking about this, but our focus will always be on getting those HVA tires to our customers, because even in weaker markets, eventually will come those tires will still outperform the rest of the market. So hopefully that gives a little bit of perspective."

It's actually a good thing for us. That part of the market that's growing both in demand is the toughest part of the market. That's where we're headed, that's where our focus is. And that's why as we look at where our margins will be. We're not giving a forecast next quarter or 3 quarters down the road. But as we look down out into the future, I think the opportunities are actually more exciting today than they were, let's say, 5 years ago. I think that's true about the auto industry in general in terms of what's coming and maybe even a simple example, you saw some of our domestic OE customers investing in more SUV. SUV tires and mixing up the SUV tires is really a good business mix for us. And so as we look at where the industry's going, I think the missed opportunities still get us very excited and we'll say that I don't think we look at, St. Pete margins and where we're never going to go from here. I think the opportunities are actually pretty excited."

I would say just from the behavior perspective, we see prebuy ahead, when we've had the tariffs on passenger tires and we have already seeing some of that pre-buy particularly in the replacement market for truck tires. So that's behavior I think is, repeating itself and is why you saw the OE side -- the OE industry actually have some headwinds in the quarter where the replacement side was impacted less. That again is some of the pre-buy coming in in anticipation of what happens. For us, most of our truck tires are made right here in The United States. We do import some tires, but essentially the bulk of our products are made right here in the U.S. And remember, we have very strong products, very strong linkages to the OEMs. I mean, you saw some of the slowdown in the quarter, but long term, our technology is valued by the OEMs and it's valued by the fleets, not only because of the products, but because of our prior solution fleet solution models to them as well. So again can't say how it's ultimately going to play out, but for us, we've got a very good, I would say, an envy of the inventory truck business model here, and we're going to continue execute no matter what happens."

So you saw our raw material forecast go from 5% down to 2%, so difference in the benefit that we would get.

And even periods of, let's say, a rising raw material cost, we have a very strong track record of being able to recover our cost in the marketplace because of the mission. So as we see raw material prices going up, which we do, I think today natural rubber is proxy was like $0.71 a pound, that's up from $0.59 or $0.60 a pound not too long ago. Our philosophy has always been to recover our costs and get paid for the value proposition in the marketplace. It's our philosophy and we execute tactically to go do that. And that's no different when you look at the environment that we're in right now. And again, I would say, rather than just saying we're going to do this, if you look at our track record of offsetting increased raw material costs, it is quite substantial. We've been quite successful at it, and we intend to really do it no different at this time. I would tell you, though as we spoke in the past in these environments, there can be a lag when we ultimately recover that because of the way the materials flow-through our P&Ls, goes faster through Asia, let's say, than it does in the U.S. But again philosophically, our view is that we will recover the value of the value we bring to our customers in the marketplace and it's no different year, as we look at change in our cost of raw materials."

So I think as you look at Q1, you got a little bit of signal impact in there as well. But long-term, and 2016, very good market.

We don't have any other particular announcements to make at this time, but, Emmanuel, what, I would say is I agree with you, and I think our team in place with you and one of the focused items to go over our European business at the beginning of the year is making sure that we have the diligence on cost again on a tactical basis, but then also strategically as we look out to the future to make sure that we're getting our break-even point lower and on the things that would from an operations perspective from the management perspective from a structural perspective, and that's what we're going to continue to focus on."

I'll begin today's call by providing a summary of our first quarter highlights in each of our 3 regions. Then, with an eye on the next stage and our longer-term plan, I'll share an update to our strategy road map, which has been the cornerstone of how we operate our business. Laura will follow with the financial review and our 2016 outlook.
We delivered strong first quarter performance highlighted by record segment operating income of $419 million. That's an increase of 14% in our core segment operating income, which excludes Venezuela from our 2015 base. On that same basis, our volumes grew 3% in the quarter. Demand for our premium-branded, high-value added products is robust, and our product mix continues to grow richer. Our results are not only consistent with our expectations for the quarter, but also with our long-term strategy and reflect the continued strong execution of our teams. As you know, this is our first quarter of results for our combined Americas business, and I'm extremely pleased with the team's performance. While we'll talk in some detail about how the U.S. and certain other countries are performing as part of our quarterly updates, I want to reinforce the long-term benefits we anticipate in managing the business internally as one consolidated unit.
After adjusting for the loss of Venezuela's income, Americas segment operating income grew 15% in the quarter, driven by strong demand for our premium-branded HVA products. In the U.S., favorable demand has been created by lower fuel prices, higher miles driven and growing consumer owing needs, particularly in SUV and light truck. We are growing our OE profitability by winning fitments on many of the most popular vehicles and responding to the increasing complexity of OEM requirements. Our success in OE gives us a favorable position in the subsequent replacement market.
Our consumer volumes in the U.S. were essentially flat in the first quarter. Customers want more premium Goodyear-branded products, and increasing our supply is both our biggest challenge and our greatest opportunity. We're just about one year away from when we expect our new factory in San Luis Potosí, Mexico to come online, and we're very excited about the opportunity to begin increasing our supply for our most complex tires with this incremental capacity. In the interim, we are working to maximize our footprint in the Americas to get the tires where they are needed most in the region. 
Conditions in Brazil remain challenging during the quarter. The ongoing recession and political uncertainty contributed to the overall economic stress in the country. Although, our replacement in OE segments both weekend in Brazil, it's profit contribution was positive in the first quarter. We feel very good about our ability to drive growth in mix in HVA segments in Brazil and about how we've managed our value proposition in this difficult recessionary environment.
In summary, we had a very strong first quarter in the Americas, and we're looking forward to opportunities across our markets in 2016 and in the longer term as well.
Our Europe, Middle East and Africa business delivered 10% growth in segment operating income. We had a good overall performance and a relatively solid industry environment with strong demand for our HVA products for many of our OE and replacement customers.
Early this month, I spent time with several of our customers in Europe. I came back encouraged by their confidence in Goodyear and their preference for our products. At the same time, they made it clear that they want even more of our HVA products, particularly in the performance in SUV categories. The growth in more complex HVA tires is as healthy in Europe as it is here in the U.S. The industry's evolution to high-value-added tires has been accelerated by many European car companies. Their preferences are driving mix up, both in OE and replacement across the entire region.
While our EMEA business delivered good results in the first quarter, we are continuing to look at our cost structure and working to strengthen and further differentiate our value proposition through our distribution and service network. We see opportunities to grow profitably and remain positive on EMEA's longer-term potential.
Our Asia Pacific business delivered another strong quarter fueled by robust volume growth in China and India and because of the acquisition of Nippon Goodyear in Japan. Segment operating income grew 18% from last year's first quarter.
I'd like to take a minute to touch on our business in China, where we had another strong quarter as volume increased more than 20% versus the prior year. Our growth was broad based, as OE was up nearly 30%, and replacement volume increased nearly 20%. OE continues to benefit from strong car sales growth, while replacement was driven by our team's strong execution of sell-through programs. We remain confident in the long-term market outlook with continued expansion of the middle-class spring growth in Asia Pacific. We are well positioned to benefit from this market growth given our award-winning product lines and strong position in OE, again creating a replacement market pull.
Overall, I'm very pleased with our strong first quarter performance. Even though we are running our business to create long-term shareholder value, a strong first quarter provides a good foundation for the remainder of the year. I'd like to spend the rest of my time this morning reviewing our updated strategy road map. As some of you may recall, we unveiled our original road map at the Investor Meeting in March 2011, and since then it has served as our guide to win in a rapidly changing and competitive tire industry. So the original road map served us well. We believe that an update was needed to more accurately reflect how we'll win, how we'll work and where we'll focus in an increasingly complex and competitive market.
As I take you through it, there's one important thing to keep in mind. The updated road map does not represent a change in strategy. The road map is more specific about our goals and expectation and ties our overall strategy to driving performance for our customers and consumers. Starting right at the top, we begin with a clear and direct expression of our goal, to deliver sustainable revenue and profit growth over the long term while increasing the value of our brand. Our emphasis is on the end. Our goal is sustainable revenue and profit growth. Top line growth and margin expansion remain our objective amidst global economic headwinds. When we do both, we increase the value Goodyear creates for all our stakeholders, associates, customers, consumers, suppliers and, of course, investors. The body of the road map comprises 3 clearly defined and interdependent elements: how we'll win, how we'll work and where we'll focus. I'll briefly touch on all 3, and as I go through them, you'll see how all the content is integrated no matter where it appears on the road map.
First, the ""how we'll win"" section has been distilled to 3 key elements that you've heard us talk about on many of our quarterly calls. Innovation excellence is what we strive for when designing products from the market back. This ensures that we are creating products and services that respond to the demands of consumers, end-users and our customers. In sales and marketing excellence, we strive to create demand for our brand and for our innovative products, driving consumers and end-users to our customers. We help them grow their businesses by leveraging the power of our brands and providing industry-leading market and sales tools and training. Our insights and search build value proposition for our customers that goes beyond products alone. The result is that more consumers will ask for Goodyear tires and our customers will prefer to sell Goodyear tires.
Sales and marketing excellence is about making it easier to do both. The final element in this section is operational excellence. This means efficiently making more of the tires the market demands, especially in the face of increasing complexity. As a result, we'll be a more reliable supplier by having the right tire at the right time to meet customer and consumer demand.
Our operational excellence initiatives around the world are delivering both cost savings and improving efficiency. We certainly had success, but we know there's still much more work to be done here. Now it's important as each of these areas are individually -- the key concept on this part of the strategy road map is winning at the intersection of all 3. Our goal is to deliver a value proposition built on innovation, reliability and quality that wins over price alone, by putting our customer at the center of the intersection and by making this the clear purpose of all of our initiatives, we see the opportunity to distinguish ourselves in the rapidly changing tire industry.
Moving to the second section of the strategy road map. We identify 5 competencies that define how we'll work. As you read through the individual items, think of them as behaviors we expect from our associates in order to be successful at the intersection in the ""how we'll win"" section. For example, collaboration and agility are simple words, but key competencies mastered only by top-tier companies to help deliver outsized results for customers and for shareholders.
The final section of the road map is, ""where we'll focus"". These are real world priorities, where we'll aim our excellence efforts. Some of these are [indiscernible] quality, consumer experience and customer service have always been priorities and will remain so. Putting them in writing, reaffirms our commitment to them. Focusing on high-value segments is something else we've talked about frequently. The ability to supply high-value-added tires of increasing complexity, such as larger rim diameters and greater performance specifications, is where the growth and profitability are and will increasingly be in the tire industry; that's why they are important.
The specific segments may differ from region to region, but the value proposition is the same. We want to win in the parts of the market, where we can capture the full value of our brand, our technology, our distribution and our products and services. We will not chase volume for volume's sake. Focusing on high-value segments is critical to creating sustainable value and profitable growth.
The final priority is mastering complexity. This is a major challenge for every tire company. There is complexity in manufacturing, in OE specs and supply chain; virtually every step in our end-to-end operations. Complexity in the tire industry is increasing at a pace not seen since the shift to radial tires. It's been driven by OEMs, by regulators seeking reduced CO2 emissions and by consumers who won't compromise on performance. It's affecting tire development, manufacturing, supply chain, consumer experience and customer service. The complexity of today's OE tires, let alone tomorrow, is significantly greater than it was just 5 years ago. We will embrace this trend by managing the necessary complexity and by eliminating the unneeded complexity in everything we do. There is a lot of detail on the updated strategy road map, and as I said, this does not reflect a new strategy. Our objective, with the updated road map, was to clarify what's important to us and create a single page document to reinforce alignment among all our associates throughout the organization. A team that is aligned from top to bottom around a common set of goals as defined in our strategy road map is the most important ingredient in our plan for long-term success.
Now in closing, I'll add a final comment. We'll review with you how our strategy road map ties into the long-term trends in our industry, which we call the MegaTrends at our Investor Conference in Boston on September 15. Also, we will use the conference to discuss our strategic business units and update our long-term performance targets. Further details on the conference will be forthcoming.
Now I'll turn the call over to Laura."
275789,331058657,964281,"The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company","Executives","Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter results and provide more detail on key income drivers of the quarter. I'll also provide an update regarding our full year outlook for 2016 before we open the call up for yo",1776,"Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter results and provide more detail on key income drivers of the quarter. I'll also provide an update regarding our full year outlook for 2016 before we open the call up for your questions.
Turning to the income statement on Slide 5, you will see our results for the first quarter. Consistent with how we have provided our full year outlook at our call in February, we have provided call outs that remove the effect of deconsolidating Venezuela in order to provide better transparency to our underlying core business.
On that basis, you see we had an outstanding quarter. Volume was up 3%, segment operating income of $419 million was up 14%, and SOI margin of 11.4% increased 2.1 points. Looking at the income statement items as reported for the first quarter, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies reduce sales by $141 million year-over-year. The sales comparison to prior year was also negatively impacted by the deconsolidation of Venezuela, which had $94 million of net sales in the first quarter of 2015.
Gross margin improved 3 4 [ph] point to 26.8%. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.68. Our results were influenced by certain significant items and after adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $0.72, an impressive increase of 33% over first quarter 2015. In addition to our stronger overall segment operating income, interest expense and minority interest were lower by a combined $32 million versus last year, primarily driven by refinancing transactions we completed in 2015 and the dissolution of our global alliance with SRI late last year.
As you will see on the step chart on Slide 6, which walks first quarter 2015 segment operating income to first quarter 2016, we have also isolated the effect of deconsolidating Venezuela to provide transparency on the drivers of our core SOI. The benefit of higher volume in the first quarter and higher production levels in the fourth quarter drove an overall improvement of $47 million. Lower raw material costs of $68 million more than offset reduced price/mix of $30 million for a net benefit of $38 million during the quarter. Cost saving actions of $47 million, driven by our operational excellence initiatives more than offset the $33 million negative impact of inflation.
Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $12 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the Canadian dollar. Other negative of $34 million includes increased accruals in incentive compensation, higher advertising spend, particularly in Asia Pacific and a $6 million impact from the divesture of our North American motorcycle business in October of 2015.
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 7. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.1 billion. Net debt is up versus year-end, which reflects the normal working capital seasonality in our business versus the prior year period, the increase includes the impact of Venezuela's deconsolidation. Free cash flow from operations is shown on Slide 8. For the quarter, we used $585 million of cash, which is in line with the typical first quarter seasonality of our business. Over the last 12 months, our free cash flow performance has been strong nearly $800 million.
Moving now to the business units on Slide 9. I'll start with our new Americas business unit. The Americas delivered strong segment operating income of $260 million with year-over-year growth of $12 million. Excluding the $22 million impact related to the deconsolidation of Venezuela, SOI increased 15%. Americas margin expanded more than 200 basis points in the quarter, primarily driven by positive price/mix performance, coupled with raw material benefit. We saw very strong mix in the U.S., especially from growth in ROE business. The Americas also benefited from improved factory utilization and our operational excellence initiatives. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of lower volume and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Our volume in the Americas declined 6% year-over-year. When excluding the impact of both Venezuela and the sale of GDTNA from our 2015 base, our unit volume decreased 2%. This decline was primarily driven by lower unit volume in our consumer business in Brazil, where consumer tires sales were down 16% year-over-year in a continuing recessionary environment.
We saw declines in Brazil OE as a result of decreased vehicle production versus last year and a decline in replacement in line with the overall industry. Even so as Rich mentioned, our HVA product mix is growing and Brazil was profitable in the first quarter despite the very difficult economic environment. This is a testament to the strength of our brand and our team. As Rich mentioned, demand remains strong in the U.S. However, in our consumer business, unit volumes were essentially flat as we remained constrained in our ability to satisfy growing market demand for our premium high-value-added tires. Our capacity has been impacted by increasing complexity in HVA tires, including growth in OE with SUV and light truck fitments that have longer cycle times in our plants. As you are aware, we are making strives to improve our supply within our U.S. and global manufacturing footprint to meet this demand. Separately, I'll note that first quarter sales in our U.S. commercial business declined almost 15%, driven by declines in OE. Overall, we're very pleased with the strong profit contribution of the Americas in the first quarter as a consolidated unit. We are focused on increasing our supply of high-value-added tires to drive profitable long-term volume growth, while maintaining our focus on operational excellence and delivering strong SOI across the region.
Turning to Slide 10, Europe, Middle East and Africa delivered segment operating income of $80 million in the quarter, up 10%, driven by the benefit of higher production volumes during the fourth quarter. Volume was up almost 2% compared to last year and was primarily driven by an increase of 5% in consumer OE with strong demand for Goodyear products throughout the region.
Consumer replacement summer industry volumes were up 3% during the quarter, and in winter tires, channel inventory are more normalized following the first quarter sellout. Our commercial truck business also continues to deliver consistent results, growing market share based on the strength of our premium-branded products in a relatively stable industry environment. Our EMEA business delivered solid performance in the first quarter of 2016. We are very confident in our team, our product portfolio and in our ability to grow profitably throughout 2016.
Turning to Slide 11, Asia Pacific delivered first quarter segment operating income of $79 million, representing a $12 million increase versus the same period last year. The main driver in income was higher volume, which was partially offset by increased SAG and investments in advertising, both related to our recently acquired replacement business in Japan. SOI margin in the region increased to 16.2% from 14.9% a year ago. Asia Pacific sold 7.3 million tires in the first quarter, representing 28% growth versus last year. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of the replacement tire business in Japan, our volume growth was 11%, which was driven by 2 of our largest and fastest-growing markets in China and India. The outstanding first quarter performance of our Asia Pacific business confirms our confidence and our commitment to targeted growth investments in the region.
Turning now to Slide 12. I'll cover our full year modeling assumptions for 2016. In summary, our full year outlook remains unchanged from our February call, and we continue to target $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion in SOI in 2016. Following increases in underlying raw material cost since February, we now expect raw material costs to be only 2% lower than last year before cost-saving action. In our year-end earnings call in February, we were expecting a 5% decline during 2016. However, we continue to see our full year price/mix versus raw material benefit at around $75 million, unchanged from our February outlook. We expect second quarter raw materials to be down 3% and the remaining price/mix net of raw materials benefit to be spread evenly throughout the last 3 quarters. Our intent is to offset increases in raw materials with price and mix. We could see some volatility related to RMIs in the quarter. But as we look at 2016, we still feel very good about the year and the long-term sustainability of our margin.
In cost savings versus inflation, we continue to expect a benefit of $135 million for the full year. However, I'll note that we do expect about $35 million in incremental cost in the Americas SOI in the second quarter. This temporary increase in our cost is primarily related to labor and engineering expenses that were incurred toward the end of 2015 and early this year, as we prioritize plant optimization activities and made shifts in production to enhance our capabilities to supply more HVA tires. While we do expect some offsets in the quarter across our SBUs, we wanted to highlight this expected increase in the America. As a result, we expect our total second quarter cost savings versus inflation to be similar to the first quarter actuals and improving later in the year for full year savings of $135 million.
Regarding foreign currency translation, we are maintaining our full year impact to segment operating income of approximately $45 million. While current spot rates would imply a more favorable outcome, it's very early in the year and currencies remain volatile. And as a reminder for the Americas, the divested motorcycle business has its strongest comparable in the second quarter, which corresponds to the seasonality of that business.
Additional financial assumptions for 2016 are listed on Slide 13. We revised our full year expectation for financing fees to $45 million, which is a $15 million lower than our prior forecast. This change is a result of our adoption of new guidance regarding the presentation of debt issuance cost on the income statement. While the offsetting amount is now recorded with an interest expense, our interest expense guidance for the full year remains unchanged at $350 million to $375 million, as the increase has been offset by lower interest rate than expected.
And finally, we repurchased $50 million in shares during the first quarter. We repurchased $463 million so far under our existing 1.1 billion share repurchase authorization. Consistent with our previous communication, we remain committed to repurchasing additional shares through 2016 and early 2017, with the majority of our plan spend towards the end of the year and aligned with our cash flow generation.
Now I'll open the line up for your questions."

You almost have to do sort of a tour around the world to really see what's going on. I will say to your comment on HVA pricing, clearly, the part of the market that's growing where the demand is still outstrips supply as we've reviewed many times in the past, I would say a very good demand-supply equation, and we are able to certainly capture the value of those products going forward. So as we've always said, our high-value segments of those targeted marketed segments, I would say still a very, very robust environment, and we're very pleased with how that's moving. I think if you look at pricing around the world, again, we don't really comment on pricing specifically, so I won't do that. But certainly in EMEA, it remains a very competitive market there. We've seen that in the past, and I think we expect that to continue. The industry clearly is showing some signs of strengthening, particularly in the OE part of the market as we said. And we have many places we do business in Europe, so we manage that value proposition market-by-market, but we see it as still a very good place for us. The biggest impact that we continue to see is that of -- sort of Chinese or Asian tires coming into Eastern Europe and putting pricing pressure on there. In Latin America, we could probably use Brazil as a marker. Again, what we've seen there is the impact of the devaluation of the currency against tire raw material prices, so a lot of pressure there. We've had already a price increase announced in Q4 2015. And our way to do business there has always been to get the value of our products by recovering the cost of our raw materials and dealing with the devaluation impacts there. That's exactly what we'll continue to do in that very difficult environment. I will tell you our volumes there, as we've talked down in the past, are increasingly mixing up to HVA tires to sort of 17-inch and above rim diameter tires, and that is a part of the market that is still very favorable for us there. And in North America, I would say really pretty stable environment that we've seen there, not really a whole lot else to talk about there. The higher end of the market is doing very well for us. And in Asia Pacific, what you're seeing there and will continue to see is raw material rises. Remember that gets through our footprint -- our raw material cost quicker because of the cycle times.

But listen, I think you've actually capsulized it very well. If you look at the market and you look at our overall volume as a company, excluding Venezuela, we grew to 3%, which is really pretty much in line with what we said, strong volumes in Asia and EMEA. When you come back and look at the Americas, and you adjust again for Venezuela and then the GDTNA piece, what you see is Brazil was the weak spot in the Americas. And you come down to kind of the U.S., if you like, if you want to call that you hit it on the head, we're about flat. And the way I would frame that up, again, David, you kind of laid it out properly, if you look at consumer placement, just look at our EMEA numbers, it was up about 6%, but as you've said, very distorted by over 30% increase and sort of nonmember Asian imports coming in, and that is the long tail whips of terrifying. So you have all the industry being impacted by terrifying really in the first half. The second half of 2014, if you think about this, there was a lot of prebuy, which meant Q1 2015, there wasn't really any buying going on. That buying sort of went back to trend line in Q1 '16 this past quarter, so you saw that big increase of over 30%. But if you follow it over the period, it's about on the normal sort of import purchases that the industry has always had. So distorted by quarter not really over the long term. If you look at members, members are up about 0.6%, call it, 1%. And I think in that environment, what you said, we've got vehicle miles traveled, being up about 2%; you've got sellout round about 1% to 2%, which, for us, has always been a good marker of what's happening in the industry. So good environment. Our main members are up 0.6% and to your point Goodyear flat. And as you look at us, I would say what we've seen is increased demand from our OEM sort of strategy that we've laid out over the years with the strong [indiscernible] with the OEM demands we're dedicating more capacity to that. In fact, demand is up higher than we expected there as well. As we do that, as you know, those tires are really high specifications, yields are a little bit lower, so that's having a little bit of an impact on us as well. I would say I'm pleased with that, because essentially it says we're on strategy. We said we wanted to get on the right fitments and bring those fitments through to our dealers as a replacement first and second replacements is coming through. So the strategy is working exactly as intended. The demand is higher, therefore, we are having trouble keeping up with those tires, and you're seeing some of that in the replacement market. But to frame it in the quarter, sort of use it as a proxy just for the moment, our main members are up 0.6%, Goodyear up -- flat in replacement, so driven by those things. As we look forward, I think to the question of can we catch up, it's exactly the intent. We've got focused improvement, as Laura mentioned, get more tires out of the factories we have. We have the San Luis Potosí factory coming on in 2016 and we have imported -- excuse me 2017, I'm sorry, getting ahead of myself, and then we have some of the import tires coming in from some of our factories overseas to try to use that capacity in a period of low demand. So our intent is certainly to get ahead of it. But I would say this notion of being a tire short versus the tire long is helpful to us. I would say, we're executing on plan. We've got an excellent environment. We've got an excellent demand for our Goodyear tires. We're executing on our plan. Hey, the fact of the matter is it's what we talk about everyday, we need more of tires that customers want right now and that's why you hear us talking about it. And the last thing, David, I would just say is we always have to keep in mind the tire industry is cyclical. We won't always be talking about this, but our focus will always be on getting those HVA tires to our customers, because even in weaker markets that eventually will come those tires will still outperform the rest of the market. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of perspective."

It's actually a good thing for us. That part of the market that's growing both in demand -- both in volume and in profitability, is the toughest part of the market. That's where we're headed, that's where our focus is. And that's why I think as we look at where our margins will be, we're not giving a forecast next quarter or 3 quarters down the road. But as we look down out into the future, I think the opportunities are actually more exciting today than they were, let's say, 5 years ago. I think that's true about the auto industry in general in terms of what's coming. And maybe even a simple example, you saw some of our domestic OE customers investing in more SUV product. SUV tires and mixing up to SUV tires is really a good business mix for us. And so as we look at where the industry is going, I think the mix opportunity still get us very excited and we'll say that I don't think we look at it and say, ""We are at peek margins and, boy, we're never going to go from here.""

I would say just from a behavior perspective, we see prebuy ahead, when we've had the tariffs on passenger tires and we have already seeing some of that prebuy particularly in the replacement markets for truck tires. So that behavior I think is repeating itself and that's why you saw the OE side of -- the OE industry actually have some headwinds in the quarter where the replacement side was impacted less. That again is some of the prebuy coming in in anticipation of what happens. For us, most of our truck tires are made right here in The United States. We do import some tires, but essentially the bulk of our products are made right here in the U.S. And remember, we have very strong products, very strong linkages to the OEMs. I mean, you saw some of that slowdown in the quarter, but long term, our technology is valued by the OEMs and it's valued by the fleets, not only because of the products, but because of our entire solution -- fleet solution model to them as well. So again, can't say how it's ultimately going to play out, but, for us, we've got a very good, I would say, an envy of the industry truck business model here, and -- but we're going to continue to execute no matter what happens."

So you saw our raw material forecast go from 5% down to 2%, so difference in the benefit that we would get.

And it's something that we've done very well over time. And even in periods of, let's say, rising raw material cost, we have a very strong track record of being able to recover our cost in the marketplace because of that value proposition. So as we see raw material prices going up, which we do, I think today natural rubber is approximately it was like $0.71 a pound, that's up from $0.59 or $0.60 a pound not too long ago. Our philosophy has always been to recover our costs and get paid for the value proposition in the marketplace. It's our philosophy, and we execute tactically to go do that. And that's no different when you look at the environment that we're in right now. And again, I would say, rather than just saying we're going to do this, if you look at our track record of offsetting increased raw material costs, it is quite substantial. We've been quite successful at it, and we intend to really do it no different at this time. I would tell you though, as we've spoken in the past in these environments, there can be a lag when we ultimately recover that because of the way the materials flow through our P&Ls, goes faster through Asia, let's say, than it does in the U.S. But again, philosophically, our view is that we will recover the value of the value we bring to our customers in the marketplace and it's no different here, as we look at a change in our cost of raw materials."

Clearly, when looking at your margins you've had a dramatic improvements, but there's still a pretty decent gap, I guess, versus some of the other parameters that operate in Europe. What sort of actions are you sort of [indiscernible] and more importantly, what sort of timing should we expect to see further benefits of the margin profile from these cost and restructuring?"

I'll begin today's call by providing a summary of our first quarter highlights in each of our 3 regions. Then, with an eye on the next stage and our longer-term plan, I'll share an update to our strategy road map, which has been the cornerstone of how we operate our business. Laura will follow with the financial review and our 2016 outlook.
We delivered strong first quarter performance highlighted by record segment operating income of $419 million. That's an increase of 14% in our core segment operating income, which excludes Venezuela from our 2015 base. On that same basis, our volumes grew 3% in the quarter. Demand for our premium-branded, high-value added products is robust, and our product mix continues to grow richer. Our results are not only consistent with our expectations for the quarter, but also with our long-term strategy and reflect the continued strong execution of our teams. As you know, this is our first quarter of results for our combined Americas business, and I'm extremely pleased with the team's performance. While we'll talk in some detail about how the U.S. and certain other countries are performing as part of our quarterly updates, I want to reinforce the long-term benefits we anticipate in managing the business internally as one consolidated unit.
After adjusting for the loss of Venezuela's income, Americas segment operating income grew 15% in the quarter, driven by strong demand for our premium-branded HVA products. In the U.S., favorable demand has been created by lower fuel prices, higher miles driven and growing consumer OE needs, particularly in SUV and light truck. We are growing our OE profitability by winning fitments on many of the most popular vehicles and responding to the increasing complexity of OEM requirements. Our success in OE gives us a favorable position in the subsequent replacement market.
Our consumer volumes in the U.S. were essentially flat in the first quarter. Customers want more premium Goodyear-branded products, and increasing our supply is both our biggest challenge and our greatest opportunity. We're just about 1 year away from when we expect our new factory in San Luis Potosí, Mexico to come online, and we're very excited about the opportunity to begin increasing our supply for our most complex tires with this incremental capacity. In the interim, we are working to maximize our footprint in the Americas to get the tires where they are needed most in the region. 
Conditions in Brazil remain challenging during the quarter. The ongoing recession and political uncertainty contributed to the overall economic stress in the country. Although, our replacement in OE segments both weakened in Brazil, it's profit contribution was positive in the first quarter. We feel very good about our ability to drive growth in mix in HVA segments in Brazil and about how we've managed our value proposition in this difficult recessionary environment.
In summary, we had a very strong first quarter in the Americas, and we're looking forward to opportunities across our markets in 2016 and in the longer term as well.
Our Europe, Middle East and Africa business delivered 10% growth in segment operating income. We had a good overall performance and a relatively solid industry environment, with strong demand for our HVA products for many of our OE and replacement customers.
Early this month, I spent time with several of our customers in Europe. I came back encouraged by their confidence in Goodyear and their preference for our products. At the same time, they made it clear that they want even more of our HVA products, particularly in the performance and SUV categories. The growth in more complex HVA tires is as healthy in Europe as it is here in the U.S. The industry's evolution to high-value-added tires has been accelerated by many European car companies. Their preferences are driving mix up both in OE and replacement across the entire region.
While our EMEA business delivered good results in the first quarter, we are continuing to look at our cost structure and working to strengthen and further differentiate our value proposition through our distribution and service network. We see opportunities to grow profitably and remain positive on EMEA's longer-term potential.
Our Asia Pacific business delivered another strong quarter fueled by robust volume growth in China and India and because of the acquisition of Nippon Goodyear in Japan. Segment operating income grew 18% from last year's first quarter.
I'd like to take a minute to touch on our business in China, where we had another strong quarter as volume increased more than 20% versus the prior year. Our growth was broad based, as OE was up nearly 30%, and replacement volume increased nearly 20%. OE continues to benefit from strong car sales growth, while replacement was driven by our team's strong execution of sell-through programs. We remain confident in the long-term market outlook, with continued expansion of the middle-class spring growth in Asia Pacific. We are well positioned to benefit from this market growth given our award-winning product lines and strong position in OE, again creating a replacement market pull.
Overall, I'm very pleased with our strong first quarter performance. Even though we are running our business to create long-term shareholder value, a strong first quarter provides a good foundation for the remainder of the year. I'd like to spend the rest of my time this morning reviewing our updated strategy road map. As some of you may recall, we unveiled our original road map at the Investor Meeting in March 2011, and since then it has served as our guide to win in a rapidly changing and competitive tire industry. Though the original road map served us well, we believe that an update was needed to more accurately reflect how we'll win, how we'll work and where we'll focus in an increasingly complex and competitive market.
As I take you through it, there's one important thing to keep in mind. The updated road map does not represent a change in strategy. The road map is more specific about our goals and expectation and ties our overall strategy to driving performance for our customers and consumers. Starting right at the top, we begin with a clear and direct expression of our goal, to deliver sustainable revenue and profit growth over the long term while increasing the value of our brand. Our emphasis is on the ""and."" Our goal is sustainable revenue and profit growth. Top line growth and margin expansion remain our objective amidst global economic headwinds. When we do both, we increase the value Goodyear creates for all our stakeholders, associates, customers, consumers, suppliers and, of course, investors. The body of the road map comprises 3 clearly defined and interdependent elements: how we'll win, how we'll work and where we'll focus. I'll briefly touch on all 3, and as I go through them, you'll see how all the content is integrated no matter where it appears on the road map.
First, the ""how we'll win"" section has been distilled to 3 key elements that you've heard us talk about on many of our quarterly calls. Innovation excellence is what we strive for when designing products from the market back. This ensures that we are creating products and services that respond to the demands of consumers, end-users and our customers. In sales and marketing excellence, we strive to create demand for our brand and for our innovative products, driving consumers and end-users to our customers. We help them grow their businesses by leveraging the power of our brands and providing industry-leading market and sales tools and training. Our insights and research build value proposition for our customers that goes beyond products alone. The result is that more consumers will ask for Goodyear tires and our customers will prefer to sell Goodyear tires.
Sales and marketing excellence is about making it easier to do both. The final element in this section is operational excellence. This means efficiently making more of the tires the market demands, especially in the face of increasing complexity. As a result, we'll be a more reliable supplier by having the right tire at the right time to meet customer and consumer demand.
Our operational excellence initiatives around the world are delivering both cost savings and improving efficiency. We certainly had success, but we know there's still much more work to be done here. Now as important as each of these areas are individually, the key concept on this part of the strategy road map is winning at the intersection of all 3. Our goal is to deliver a value proposition built on innovation, reliability and quality that wins over price alone, by putting our customer at the center of the intersection and by making this the clear purpose of all our initiatives, we see the opportunity to distinguish ourselves in the rapidly changing tire industry.
Moving to the second section of the strategy road map, we identify 5 competencies that define how we'll work. As you read through the individual items, think of them as behaviors we expect from our associates in order to be successful at the intersection in the ""how we'll win"" section. For example, collaboration and agility are simple words but key competencies mastered only by top-tier companies to help deliver outsized results for customers and for shareholders.
The final section of the road map is ""where we'll focus."" These are real world priorities, where we'll aim our excellence efforts. Some of these are givens. Quality, consumer experience and customer service have always been priorities and will remain so. Putting them in writing, reaffirms our commitment to them. Focusing on high-value segments is something else we've talked about frequently. The ability to supply high-value-added tires of increasing complexity, such as larger rim diameters and greater performance specifications, is where the growth and profitability are and will increasingly be in the tire industry; that's why they are important.
The specific segments may differ from region to region, but the value proposition is the same. We want to win in the parts of the market, where we can capture the full value of our brand, our technology, our distribution and our products and services. We will not chase volume for volume's sake. Focusing on high-value segments is critical to creating sustainable value and profit growth.
The final priority is mastering complexity. This is a major challenge for every tire company. There is complexity in manufacturing, in OE specs and supply chain; virtually every step in our end-to-end operations. Complexity in the tire industry is increasing at a pace not seen since the shift to radial tires. It's being driven by OEMs, by regulators seeking reduced CO2 emissions and by consumers who won't compromise on performance. It's affecting tire development, manufacturing, supply chain, consumer experience and customer service. The complexity of today's OE tires, let alone tomorrow's, is significantly greater than it was just 5 years ago. We will embrace this trend by managing the necessary complexity and by eliminating the unneeded complexity in everything we do. There is a lot of detail on the updated strategy road map, and as I said, this does not reflect a new strategy. Our objective, with the updated road map, was to clarify what's important to us and create a single-page document to reinforce alignment among all our associates throughout the organization. A team that is aligned from top to bottom around a common set of goals as defined in our strategy road map is the most important ingredient in our plan for long-term success.
Now in closing, I'll add a final comment. We'll review with you how our strategy road map ties into the long-term trends in our industry, which we call the MegaTrends, at our Investor Conference in Boston on September 15. Also, we will use the conference to discuss our strategic business units and update our long-term performance targets. Further details on the conference will be forthcoming.
Now I'll turn the call over to Laura."
275789,331058657,964439,"The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company","Executives","Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter results and provide more detail on key income drivers in the quarter. I'll also provide an update regarding our full year outlook for 2016 before we open the call up for yo",1770,"Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter results and provide more detail on key income drivers in the quarter. I'll also provide an update regarding our full year outlook for 2016 before we open the call up for your questions.
Turning to the income statement on Slide 5, you will see our results for the first quarter. Consistent with how we have provided our full year outlook at our call in February, we have provided callouts that remove the effect of deconsolidating Venezuela in order to provide better transparency to our underlying core business.
On that basis, you see we had an outstanding quarter. Volume was up 3%, segment operating income of $419 million was up 14% and SOI margin of 11.4% increased 2.1 points. Looking at the income statement items as reported for the first quarter, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies reduced sales by $141 million year-over-year. The sales comparison to prior year was also negatively impacted by the deconsolidation of Venezuela, which had $94 million of net sales in the first quarter of 2015.
Gross margin improved 3 full points to 26.8%. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.68. Our results were influenced by certain significant items and after adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $0.72, an impressive increase of 33% over first quarter 2015. In addition to our stronger overall segment operating income, interest expense and minority interest were lower by a combined $32 million versus last year, primarily driven by refinancing transactions we completed in 2015 and the dissolution of our global alliance with SRI late last year.
As you will see on the step chart on Slide 6, which walks first quarter 2015 segment operating income to first quarter 2016, we have also isolated the effect of deconsolidating Venezuela to provide transparency on the drivers of our core SOI. The benefit of higher volume in the first quarter and higher production levels in the fourth quarter drove an overall improvement of $47 million. Lower raw material costs of $68 million more than offset reduced price/mix of $30 million for a net benefit of $38 million during the quarter. Cost-saving actions of $47 million, driven by our operational excellence initiatives, more than offset the $33 million negative impact of inflation.
Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $12 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the Canadian dollar. Other, a negative of $34 million, includes increased accruals in incentive compensation; higher advertising spend, particularly in Asia-Pacific; and a $6 million impact from the divesture of our North American motorcycle business in October of 2015.
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 7. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.1 billion. Net debt is up versus year-end, which reflects the normal working capital seasonality in our business. Versus the prior year period, the increase includes the impact of Venezuela's deconsolidation. Free cash flow from operations is shown on Slide 8. For the quarter, we used $585 million of cash, which is in line with the typical first quarter seasonality of our business. Over the last 12 months, our free cash flow performance has been strong at nearly $800 million.
Moving now to the business units on Slide 9. I'll start with our new Americas business unit. The Americas delivered strong segment operating income of $260 million with year-over-year growth of $12 million. Excluding the $22 million impact related to the deconsolidation of Venezuela, SOI increased 15%. Americas margin expanded more than 200 basis points in the quarter, primarily driven by positive price/mix performance, coupled with a raw material benefit. We saw very strong mix in the U.S., especially from growth in ROE business. The Americas also benefited from improved factory utilization and our operational excellence initiatives. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of lower volume and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Our volume in the Americas declined 6% year-over-year. When excluding the impact of both Venezuela and the sale of GDTNA from our 2015 base, our unit volume decreased 2%. This decline was primarily driven by lower unit volume in our consumer business in Brazil, where consumer tires sales were down 16% year-over-year in a continuing recessionary environment.
We saw declines in Brazil OE as a result of decreased vehicle production versus last year and a decline in replacement in line with the overall industry. Even so, as Rich mentioned, our HVA product mix is growing and Brazil was profitable in the first quarter despite the very difficult economic environment. This is a testament to the strength of our brand and our team. As Rich mentioned, demand remains strong in the U.S. However, in our consumer business, unit volumes were essentially flat as we remain constrained in our ability to satisfy growing market demand for our premium high-value-added tires. Our capacity has been impacted by increasing complexity in HVA tires, including growth in OE, with SUV and light truck fitments that have longer cycle times in our plants. As you are aware, we are making strides to improve our supply within our U.S. and global manufacturing footprint to meet this demand. Separately, I'll note that first quarter sales in our U.S. commercial business declined almost 15%, driven by declines in OE. Overall, we're very pleased with the strong profit contribution of the Americas in the first quarter as a consolidated unit. We are focused on increasing our supply of high-value-added tires to drive profitable long-term volume growth, while maintaining our focus on operational excellence and delivering strong SOI across the region.
Turning to Slide 10, Europe, Middle East and Africa delivered segment operating income of $80 million in the quarter, up 10%, driven by the benefit of higher production volumes during the fourth quarter. Volume was up almost 2% compared to last year and was primarily driven by an increase of 5% in consumer OE, with strong demand for Goodyear products throughout the region.
Consumer replacement summer industry volumes were up 3% during the quarter, and in winter tires, channel inventories are more normalized following the first quarter sellout. Our commercial truck business also continues to deliver consistent results, growing market share based on the strength of our premium-branded products in a relatively stable industry environment. Our EMEA business delivered solid performance in the first quarter of 2016. We are very confident in our team, our product portfolio and in our ability to grow profitably throughout 2016.
Turning to Slide 11, Asia-Pacific delivered first quarter segment operating income of $79 million, representing a $12 million increase versus the same period last year. The main driver in income was higher volume, which was partially offset by increased SAG and investments in advertising, both related to our recently acquired replacement business in Japan. SOI margin in the region increased to 16.2% from 14.9% a year ago. Asia-Pacific sold 7.3 million tires in the first quarter, representing 28% growth versus last year. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of the replacement tire business in Japan, our volume growth was 11%, which was driven by 2 of our largest and fastest-growing markets in China and India. The outstanding first quarter performance of our Asia-Pacific business confirms our confidence and our commitment to targeted growth investments in the region.
Turning now to Slide 12. I'll cover our full year modeling assumptions for 2016. In summary, our full year outlook remains unchanged from our February call, and we continue to target $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion in SOI in 2016. Following increases in underlying raw material costs since February, we now expect raw material costs to be only 2% lower than last year before cost-saving actions. In our year-end earnings call in February, we were expecting a 5% decline during 2016. However, we continue to see our full year price/mix versus raw material benefit at around $75 million, unchanged from our February outlook. We expect second quarter raw materials to be down 3% and the remaining price/mix net of raw materials benefit to be spread evenly throughout the last 3 quarters. Our intent is to offset increases in raw materials with price and mix. We could see some volatility related to RMIs in the quarter, but as we look at 2016, we still feel very good about the year and the long-term sustainability of our margin.
In cost savings versus inflation, we continue to expect a benefit of $135 million for the full year. However, I'll note that we do expect about $35 million in incremental cost in the Americas SOI in the second quarter. This temporary increase in our cost is primarily related to labor and engineering expenses that were incurred toward the end of 2015 and early this year, as we prioritized plant optimization activities and made shifts in production to enhance our capabilities to supply more HVA tires. While we do expect some offsets in the quarter across our SBUs, we wanted to highlight this expected increase in the Americas. As a result, we expect our total second quarter cost savings versus inflation to be similar to the first quarter actuals and improving later in the year for full year savings of $135 million.
Regarding foreign currency translation, we are maintaining our full year impact to segment operating income of approximately $45 million. While current spot rates would imply a more favorable outcome, it's very early in the year and currencies remain volatile. And as a reminder for the Americas, the divested motorcycle business has its strongest comparable in the second quarter, which corresponds to the seasonality of that business.
Additional financial assumptions for 2016 are listed on Slide 13. We've revised our full year expectation for financing fees to $45 million, which is $15 million lower than our prior forecast. This change is a result of our adoption of new guidance regarding the presentation of debt issuance costs on the income statement. While the offsetting amount is now recorded within interest expense, our interest expense guidance for the full year remains unchanged at $350 million to $375 million, as the increase has been offset by lower interest rates than expected.
And finally, we repurchased $50 million in shares during the first quarter. We've repurchased $463 million so far under our existing $1.1 billion share repurchase authorization. Consistent with our previous communication, we remain committed to repurchasing additional shares through 2016 and early 2017, with the majority of our planned spend towards the end of the year and aligned with our cash flow generation.
Now I'll open the line up for your questions."

You almost have to do sort of a tour around the world to really see what's going on. I will say to your comment on HVA pricing, clearly, the part of the market that's growing, where the demand is -- still outstrips supply as we've reviewed many times in the past, I would say a very good demand-supply equation, and we are able to certainly capture the value of those products going forward. So as we've always said, our high-value segments, those targeted marketed segments, I would say still a very, very robust environment, and we're very pleased with how that's moving. I think if you look at pricing around the world, again, we don't really comment on pricing specifically, so I won't do that. But certainly in EMEA, it remains a very competitive market there. We've seen that in the past, and I think we expect that to continue. The industry clearly is showing some signs of strengthening, particularly in the OE part of the market, as we said. And we have many places we do business in Europe, so we manage that value proposition market-by-market, but we see it as still a very good place for us. The biggest impact that we continue to see is that of -- sort of Chinese or Asian tires coming into Eastern Europe and putting pricing pressure on there. In Latin America, we could probably use Brazil as a marker. Again, what we've seen there is the impact of the devaluation of the currency against tire raw material prices, so a lot of pressure there. We've had already a price increase announced in Q4 2015. And our way to do business there has always been to get the value of our products by recovering the cost of raw materials and dealing with the devaluation impacts there. That's exactly what we'll continue to do in that very difficult environment. I will tell you our volumes there, as we've talked down in the past, are increasingly mixing up the HVA tires to sort of 17-inch and above rim diameter tires, and that is a part of the market that is still very favorable for us there. And in North America, I would say really pretty stable environment that we've seen there. Not really a whole lot else to talk about there. The higher end of the market is doing very well for us. And in Asia-Pacific, what you're seeing there and will continue to see as raw material rises, remember that gets through our footprint -- our raw material cost quicker because of the cycle times. So again, we've been very active in the market there recovering those raw material prices as well."

I just wanted to be sure. But listen, I think you've actually capsulized it very well. If you look at the market and you look at our overall volume as a company, excluding Venezuela, we grew the 3%, which is really pretty much in line with what we said; strong volumes in Asia and EMEA. When you come back and look at the Americas, and you adjust, again, for Venezuela and then the GDTNA piece, what you see is Brazil was the weak spot in the Americas. And then you come down to kind of the U.S., if you like, if you want to call it that, you hit it on the head, we're about flat. And the way I would frame that up -- again, David, you kind of laid it out properly. If you look at consumer placement, just look at our EMEA numbers, it was up about 6%, but as you've said, very distorted by over 30% increase and sort of nonmember Asian imports coming in, and that is the long tail whipsaw of tariff buying. So you have all the industry being impacted by tariff buying really in the first half. The second half of 2014, if you think about this, there was a lot of prebuy, which meant Q1 2015, there wasn't really any buying going on. That buying sort of went back to trend line in Q1 '16 this past quarter, so you saw that big increase of over 30%. But if you follow it over the period, it's about on the normal sort of import purchases that the industry has always had. So distorted by quarter not really over the long term. If you look at members, members are up about 0.6%, call it, 1%. And I think in that environment, what you said, we've got vehicle miles traveled, being up about 2%; you've got sellout up round about 1% to 2%, which, for us, has always been a good marker of what's happening in the industry. So good environment. Our main members are up 0.6% and, to your point, Goodyear flat. And as you look at us, I would say what we've seen is increased demand from our OEM sort of strategy that we've laid out over the years, with the strong SAR with the OEM demands, we're dedicating more capacity to that. In fact, demand is up higher than we expected there as well. As we do that, as you know, those tires are really high specifications, yields are a little bit lower, so that's having a little bit of an impact on us as well. I would say I'm pleased with that, because essentially it says we're on strategy. We said we wanted to get on the right fitments and bring those fitments through to our dealers as a replacement; first and second replacements is coming through. So the strategy is working exactly as intended. The demand is higher, therefore, we are having trouble keeping up with those tires, and you're seeing some of that in the replacement market. But to frame it in the quarter, sort of use it as a proxy just for the moment, our main members are up 0.6%, Goodyear up -- flat in replacement, so driven by those things. As we look forward, I think to the question of can we catch up, it's exactly the intent. We've got focused improvement, as Laura mentioned, getting more tires out of the factories we have. We have the San Luis Potosí factory coming on in 2016 and we have imported -- excuse me, 2017. I'm sorry, getting ahead of myself. And then we have some of the import tires coming in from some of our factories overseas to try to use that capacity in a period of low demand. So our intent is certainly to get ahead of it. But I would say this notion of being a tire short versus a tire long is helpful to us. I would say, we're executing on plan. We've got an excellent environment. We've got an excellent demand for our Goodyear tires. We're executing on our plan. Hey, the fact of the matter is it's what we talk about every day. We need more of tires that customers want right now and that's why you hear us talking about it. And the last thing, David, I would just say is we always have to keep in mind the tire industry is cyclical. We won't always be talking about this, but our focus will always be on getting those HVA tires to our customers, because even in weaker markets that eventually will come, those tires will still outperform the rest of the market. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of perspective."

It's actually a good thing for us. That part of the market that's growing both in demand -- both in volume and in profitability, is the toughest part of the market. That's where we're headed, that's where our focus is. And that's why I think as we look at where our margins will be, we're not giving a forecast next quarter or 3 quarters down the road. But as we look down -- out into the future, I think the opportunities are actually more exciting today than they were, let's say, 5 years ago. I think that's true about the auto industry in general in terms of what's coming. And maybe even a simple example, you saw some of our domestic OE customers investing in more SUV production. SUV tires and mixing up to SUV tires is really a good business mix for us. And so as we look at where the industry is going, I think the mix opportunities still get us very excited and we'll say that I don't think we look at it and say, ""We are at peek margins and, boy, we're never going to go from here.""

I would say just from a behavior perspective, we see prebuy ahead, when we've had the tariffs on passenger tires and you have already seeing some of that prebuy particularly in the replacement markets for truck tires. So that behavior, I think, is repeating itself and that's why you saw the OE side of -- the OE industry, actually, have some headwinds in the quarter where the replacement side was impacted less. That again is some of the prebuy coming in in anticipation of what happens. For us, most of our truck tires are made right here in the United States. We do import some tires, but essentially the bulk of our products are made right here in the U.S. And remember, we have very strong products, very strong linkages to the OEMs. I mean, you saw some of that slowdown in the quarter, but long term, our technology is valued by the OEMs and it's valued by the fleets, not only because of the products, but because of our entire solution -- fleet solution model to them as well.

And it's something that we've done very well over time. And even periods of, let's say, rising raw material cost, we have a very strong track record of being able to recover our cost in the marketplace because of that value proposition. So as we see raw material prices going up, which we do. I think today natural rubber as a proxy was like $0.71 a pound. That's up from $0.59 or $0.60 a pound not too long ago. Our philosophy has always been to recover our costs and get paid for the value proposition in the marketplace. It's our philosophy, and we execute tactically to go do that. And that's no different when we look at the environment that we're in right now. And again, I would say, rather than just saying we're going to do this, if you look at our track record of offsetting increased raw material costs, it is quite substantial. We've been quite successful at it, and we intend to really do it no different at this time. I would tell you, though, as we've spoken in the past in these environments, there can be a lag when we ultimately recover that because of the way the materials flow through our P&Ls. Goes faster through Asia, let's say, than it does in the U.S. But again, philosophically, our view is that we will recover the value of -- the value we bring to our customers in the marketplace and it's no different here, as we look at a change in our cost of raw materials."

EMEA had growth and, by definition, that is a mature market, where we see opportunity. And while we don't break it down for you, I can say that by certain segments of our market within North America, we had year-over-year growth as well in terms of those high-value segments of the market that we targeted. So we are seeing growth in the places that are very important to us as well. In terms of the impact of imports going forward, I would expect that the amount of imports that we get increases over time and it will help to alleviate some of the supply problem that we have. I mean, that's kind of what we said in the past, and I think that will continue to happen."

In addition, we delivered overall segment operating margin of 13",1737,"[Audio Gap] 
 combining this quarter with our record first quarter, our segment operating income for the first half of the year was $950 million, the highest first half ever for Goodyear. 
In addition, we delivered overall segment operating margin of 13.7% in the second quarter, an increase over last year. The Americas provided more than half of our SOI and its underlying operations continue to remain solid. 
Furthermore, all 3 of our global businesses are in segment operating margins of more than 11.5%. Taken in total, our segment operating performance reflects the unwavering execution of our strategy, which has proved its strength even in volatile market conditions. 
Our consistent progress has resulted in steady earnings growth and positions as well for that growth to continue. I would like to spend the next few minutes providing my perspective on each of our SBUs as was my thoughts on industry outlook for the remainder of the year.
The Americas, which is a reminder, now includes both our North America and Latin America businesses delivered $291 million of operating income. As expected, its earnings were less than last year because of the few discrete items in the quarter. Laura will provide more detail on those items in her remarks. 
Nonetheless,, the Americas underlying business performance remain strong, and continues to demonstrate the earnings power of the value proposition in our core business. Demand remained robust for our premium  HDA tires, in particularly, in light truck and SUV. These segments take advantage of our strengths, and continue to drive growth in mix in our U.S. business. 
We continue to see strong demand for our Wrangler DuraTrac and our Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure products. In addition, other shipments for passenger cars also performed very well in the quarter, specifically our Eagle RSA, the Eagle F1 asymmetric season and the Assurance Comfort trend. In broader industry terms, the underlying fundamentals in the U.S., such as miles driven, gasoline prices and fuel consumption remain favorable. Americans used an average of almost 9.8 million barrels of gasoline a day, in the 4 weeks ending July 1, the highest levels since the energy information administration started collecting weekly consumption data 35 years ago. Also, while the SARS moderated from its peak levels, SUV and light truck vehicle growth has increased 6% over the last 12 months. We always depend on the technology and the performance characteristics, of Goodyear's high-value-added products for SUV and light truck shipments. And these are the type of platforms, we target with our OE strategy and it's working. 
The U.S. replacement industry data on the whole, however, reflect a solid softer volumes in the second quarter compared to a year ago. As we outlined on Slide 6, this decline was primarily as a result of higher-than-normal level of imports in the second quarter of last year. You'll recall imports were abnormally low in the first quarter of 2015, following the announcement of the U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. The situation was exaggerated by import strikes making product flow difficult for many importers. 
As a result, the second quarter of 2015, saw about $50 million more imported tires than the first quarter. And separately, we've seen some destocking at the dealer and distributer level for some broader market products this quarter. Our view is that this excess inventory was concentrated towards the lower end of the market in the economy and mid-tier segments.
If we take a step back from the quarter, the year-to-date industry selling for consumer replacement is up 1%. What's important to note is that within that growth is an increase in RAM size of 17 integrator of 9%. Since the start of recovery began in 2010, we've seen several years of growth in OE with a mix shift to those premium tires. Rim size is a 17-inch or greater grow from 49% of the OE market in 2009 to 73% in 2013. We're seeing the benefit of that mixed shift in the replacement market as well. Tire sizes of 17-inch and greater grew 10% and 7% in the first and second quarter, respectively. And we're outperforming in this portion of the market. Goodyear brand, the Goodyear brand nearly double the industry in growth in 17-inch and greater rim sizes in the second quarter. This is exactly what our OE strategy was designed to do. As you know, we have been investing in the U.S. plants to increase our capability to supply more premium HVA tires. Some of that investment has been in CapEx, and some in engineering in Chechen production within our existing footprint. We're continuing to increase our capability to grow in this profitable segment.
Looking ahead, we expect that the overall U.S. industry will remain weak in July, as a result of the highest import compatible from all of 2015. In the intermediate to longer term, we continue to feel very confident about the fundamentals in the U.S., and continue to expect strong demand for our HVA products.
Turning now to Brazil. Economic conditions there remain challenging during the quarter. Industry shipments and consumer replacement were down about 2%. And OE continued its stiff decline. Despite the macroeconomic headwinds, Brazil's profit contribution was once again positive in the quarter. We feel very good about our ability to drive growth in mix in HVA segments in Brazil over the long term, and while the economy -- while the economic recovery is in around the quarter, we believe that we're well positioned in the marketplace when it does occur and we do believe that it will occur.
Shifting to Europe. Our EMEA business unit delivered a $148 million in operating income during the second quarter. That's a 37% increase driven by strong volume in both consumer OE and replacement. Industry selling remained healthy during the second quarter, especially in OE, which is driven by higher production levels in Western Europe. New passenger car registration grew for the 34 month in a row in June, posting growth of more than 9% in the first half of the year.
European auto companies preference for premium large rim diameter HVA tires including Goodyear's high-performance lines are driving mix up in OE and later on in the placement across the region. 
And we're delivering award-winning products to meet their demand. We recently launched the new Eagle F1 asymmetric 3 ultrahigh performance tire and industry-leading product for Europe's growing OE market. The new member of the Eagle family was tested by leading organizations and outperformed other brands in both dry and wet conditions as well as in durability leading the demand pull from our premium OE customers across the region.
In the EMEA consumer replacement, we saw a strong growth in our SUV and light truck segments, as Goodyear branded tires, particularly, EfficientGrip SUV tires claimed the top spot in several important magazine tests. As we look to the second half of the year, we're again taking a measured approach to winter tire sales based on the warm weather we've seen in the region over the past several years. Although, the winter inventory situation is more balanced, heading into the selling season versus last year. Our plan is based on a green winter and weather aside, our products are positioned to win in the marketplace. The strength of our winter tire portfolio combined with an attractive value proposition for our customers, has us well positioned to make the most of the winter industry demand.
Finally, as you know, we've been focused on our cost initiatives in EMEA and improvements in this area also contributed to the recent earnings in the quarter. With the economic uncertainties surrounding Brexit and its impact in Europe in the intermediate and longer-term, we will remain both agile and diligent on cost actions in this changing market.
In Asia Pacific reaching a segment operating income $92 million with volume growth of 21%. Our unit volumes were up 4%, excluding the impact of our newly reacquired Japanese replacement business. As we've seen in prior quarters, volume growth was robust in our China consumer business. But there was further deterioration in Australia due to the ongoing challenges in the country. 
China had a strong second quarter with consumer tire volume growth of 8% and double-digit growth in the SUV and light truck segments. We have had success in both OE replacement and winning new Chinese OE accounts and in strong execution of sell-through programs, building upon our expanding service and retail networks there. 
Consistent with our strategy, we grew in Asia Pacific with the right mix of products. As an example, Asia Pacific scored product win with the Sport Maxx high performance tire, which was awarded best-in-class in the 2016 motor magazine tire test. Sport Maxx outperformed its competition in all 5 of the tested performance attributes, being in the computing tires by the biggest margin in 8 years. Design for a wide range of high-performance vehicles, our innovative products are driving demand in the region. 
We remain very optimistic about the long-term value proposition of our business in Asia Pacific. Our new product introductions, growing OE relationships and increasing points of distribution, give us confidence that we will continue to be successful and grow in this important market.
Looking back at our global businesses in the second quarter and over the first half, I'm very pleased with our record results, which were driven by strong demand in premium HVA products across our regions. The Goodyear brand and our value propositions continues to be a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Goodyear's value proposition has many elements, including a trusted iconic global brand, industry-leading products, diverse distribution channels, capable of responding to customer requirements, strong customer relationships, particularly, at the OEMs and an unwavering focus on the consumer. 
Our teams have made the commitment to winning with consumers and helping our customers build their businesses every day, while taking the long view of creating sustainable value. Our first half results demonstrate that and we are focused on execution across our markets by pursuing profitable volume in share in segments with the Goodyear brand as a differentiator. 
We are committed to our target of 10% to 15% annual growth or $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion of segment operating income in 2016. We look forward to discussing emerging trends in our industry and our strategic plans for the future as part of our Investor Day on September 15t.
Now I'll turn the call over to Laura."

Today, I will cover our second quarter results and provide more detail on key income drivers in the quarter. I'll also provide an update regarding our full year outlook for 2016 before we open the call up for your questions.
Turning to the income statement on Slide 8. You'll see our results for the second quarter. Consistent with our representation in April, we have provided call-outs that highlight the effect of deconsolidating Venezuela. Looking at the income statement items, as reported for the second quarter, the sales comparison to prior year was negatively impacted by deconsolidation of Venezuela, which had a $115 million of net sales in the second quarter of 2015. 
Similarly, other tire-related revenues were lower by $86 million, driven by the 2015 sale of the North American motorcycle business. Additionally, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, reduced sales by $84 million year-over-year.
Our gross margins were stable at 27.5% and segment operating margin increased 50 basis points in the quarter. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, SOI margin increased 1 full point. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.75. Our results were influenced by certain significant items. Adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $1.16. I'll note that our segment operating income in the quarter was impacted by a $24 million unfavorable, out-of-period adjustment related to the elimination of intercompany profit in the Americas region. The correction is related primarily to 2012 to 2015, prior period financials, with the majority attributable to 2012. This amount is included as a significant item in the adjusted net income.
Turning to step chart on Slide 9, which rocked second quarter 2015 segment operating income to second quarter 2016. After adjusting for the $36 million impact of Venezuela, our 2015 core SOI was $540 million. The benefit of higher volume in the second quarter and higher production levels in the first quarter drove an overall improvement of $21 million. 
Lower raw material costs of $49 million more than offset reduced price mix of $44 million for a net benefit of $5 million during the quarter. Cost saving actions of $66 million, driven by our operational excellence initiatives, more than offset the negative impact of inflation, delivering a net benefit of $33 million.
Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $10 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly, against the Argentine peso, the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real. Other was lower by $8 million, and includes a $14 million impact of the divestiture of our North American motorcycle business, which was partially offset by lower incentive compensation of $10 million. 
In summary, we achieved another record quarter with growth in core SOI of 3%. Excluding the impact of the out-of-period adjustment, our core SOI was $555 million and growth was 8%.
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.1 billion. Net debt is up versus a year-end, which reflects the normal working capital seasonality in our business. Versus the prior year period, the increase includes the impact of Venezuela's deconsolidation. Free cash flow from operations is shown on slide 11. For the quarter, we generated $99 million of cash. Working capital was the use of $75 million of cash and in line with the typical seasonality of our business. Additionally, cash flow from operating activities was $261 million for the 3 months ended June 30.
Now let's move to the business units on Slide 12. The Americas generated segment operating income of $291 million in the second quarter or 13.9% to sales. The year-over-year decline in SOI is more than explained by several noteworthy items that totaled $79 million. 
First, the $36 million impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela. Second, the $24 million out-of-period adjustments, primarily related to 2012. And third, a $19 million impact from the sale of GDTNA business last year. The Americas also saw a higher conversion costs in the quarter, due to additional engineering activities, and the shift in production to increase our supply of HVA tires. Despite these headwinds, our core business in the Americas, continues to be strong. The execution of our strategy enabled us to continue to realize positive price mix performance. Customers are demanding more of our HVA tires, particularly, premium SUV and light truck tires. Unit sales in the second quarter were $18.8 million or down 6% versus 2015. In OE, our unit volume decreased by 900,000 units. The sale of GDTNA, which included sales of Dunlop-branded tires to Japanese OEMs in the U.S., explained almost half of the decline. And we also saw OE declines in both Brazil and in the U.S. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, our replacement volume was flat.
In summary, and despite several notable headwinds within the Americas region, the underlying performance is solid. The quarter also offers proof of our margin sustainability. Excluding the out-of-period adjustment, the Americas achieved SOI margin that was higher than last year. We accomplished this margin improvement in markets that were softer and with significantly, lower raw material tailwinds. This performance is validation of the strength of our strategy, products and the Goodyear brand in the marketplace.
Turning to Slide 13. Europe, Middle East and Africa continue to deliver positive results segment operating income of $148 million in the quarter, up 37% compared to prior year. This was a third conservative quarter of year-over-year earnings growth, driven by a higher production and sales volumes throughout the region. As well as our continued focus on cost-savings initiatives. Volume was up or more than 4% compared to last year and was driven by growth in both consumer OE and replacement channels. Strong demand for Goodyear products resulted in an 8% increase in consumer OE units and consumer replacement volumes were up almost 3% in the quarter. 
Within our industry demand also increased more than 10% year-on-year in the quarter, evidence of channel inventories being more normalized this year. 
Our commercial truck business also continues to deliver consistent results with volumes up almost 4% in the quarter. Our EMEA business delivered already very strong performance in the second quarter of 2016. We remain confident in our team, our product portfolio and in our ability to deliver sustainable revenue and profit growth.
Turning to Slide 14. Asia Pacific delivered record second quarter segment operating income of $92 million, an $8 million improvement versus last year. The main drivers continue to be strong volume growth and the benefit of lower raw material costs, which will partially offset by a lower price/mix, and increase SAP expense related to our recently acquired replacement business in Japan. Our segment operating margin in the region increased to 17.4%, up from 17.1% a year ago. Asia-Pacific volume was $7.3 million tire units representing a 20% -- 21% growth versus last year. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of the Japanese replacement tire business, the remaining volume growth is primarily attributable to our 8% consumer tire growth in China, one of our largest and fastest-growing markets in the region. 
Additionally, the countries 6.5% growth across our business, which was partially offset by lower volume in Australia. We are well positioned in Asia-Pacific and continue to be excited about the long-term growth and opportunities there.
Turning now to Slide 15. I'll cover our full year modeling assumptions for 2016. In summary, our full year outlook in SOI income drivers remain unchanged from our April call. We continue to target $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion in SOI in 2016. With the moderating raw material costs since April, we now expect the raw material costs to be about 4% lower than last year before cost-savings actions. We continue to see our full year price/mix versus a raw material benefit at around $75 million, unchanged from our earlier outlook. We expect third quarter raw materials to be down about 4% based on current spot rate. The remaining price/mix net of raw material benefit should flow evenly across the back half of the year.
In cost savings versus inflation, we continue to expect a benefit of $135 million for the full year. The remaining net cost savings are expected at to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter.
Regarding foreign currency translation, we continue to expect a headwind of approximately $45 million. While current spot rates would imply a slightly more favorable outcome, currencies remain volatile. The divested North America motorcycle business will have a negative $10 million impact year-over-year for the third quarter.
Additional financial assumptions for 2016 are listed on Slide 16. Our income tax rate has been lowered to about 28% of global pretax operating profit, following our experience today. Cash taxes remain at 10% to 15% of global pretax operating profit.
And finally, we repurchased 100 million of shares during the second quarter. We have repurchased 563 million so far under our existing $1.1 billion share repurchase authorization and we remain committed to repurchasing additional shares through 2016 and early 2017.

And I might take just 2 seconds to give you a view on how we think about Europe overall. We still view it is really a fantastic market, despite some of the ongoing, let's say, unsolved economic issues that still lingered over there. Remember, the market is growing there, and particularly in 17-inch and above, particularly, that when we compared to 16-inch and below, where you are not seeing nearly as much growth and sometimes, let's say, it can even be viewed as flat depending on the market. We see the markets are still demanding excellent technology, driven by the OEMs. We really love the car park, that still sits in Europe there. So we look at it as a great market and add to it and then seasonal market as you bring in winter tires and winter tire -- the winter summer switch, and really a robust market for us. The biggest headwind we still see there, as we've talked about in the past is the ongoing sort of movement of lower end Asian tires, particularly, Eastern Europe that has been, probably we'll continue to cause a headwind and again, it's an example of when tariffs go up in 1 region, those tires typically move to somewhere else, you may remember in the past, they went down to South America as those economy slowed and currencies depreciated, our tariffs are back in the U.S. now they are in the Eastern Europe. So that's a continued headwind for us over there. But our goal is to continue to drive mix, continue to align our distribution, consistent with our strategy over there. Our focus will be on new products. And leveraging our brands and to your point, it may continuing to focus on our cost and actions over there. So I would say that we've made an improvement in Europe. We would expect those cost improvements to stick with us. I would say, we're only on the front-end of fixing our European business over the long term. Our goal is to do some of the same things we have done at North America, in Europe as well and we feel very good about that. But that's probably not a direct straight line either. So as we fight of the low-cost tires coming into the East, that actually has a negative impact on our mix in Europe, or that height some of the positive impact we're getting on the 17-inch and above. So I guess, overall, I would say, we'd expect strong results in Europe as we look to '16 and out into '17.  I'd expect that you'd still see some significant cost action there, as we move ahead, as we look at our production over there. And John, the team over there are very focused on cost, day-to-day cost as well as structural cost to reduce the fixed cost of that business going forward. So I feel good and I would say, we're on the front-end of what we expect."

Because the reason, I ask is one of the larger questions are pushback that I will get from investors is a really just on the industry being able to be price discipline and if there's going to be a quarter or 2, or a half a year or 2 or 3 quarters a year, where the tire manufacturers are essentially caught with increasing raw material costs without adding in or passing on those price increases. And if you look at 2Q results with only a price/mix on raw materials, positive $5 billion versus the first quarter about $38 million. Based on the question, what's going to change in the back half of the year, that's going to maintain that positive price/mix over raw materials and If even that we had in the second quarter really being the away and a favorable raw material environment?"

So for the 1 short answer is price/mix versus raw is obviously big piece of that is mix. And there are some things we're doing in the business that result in a much stronger mix as we get into the second half of the year. So that's one piece of it. Now similar to my opening remarks as we look at the remaining price/mix that arise a benefit, we do see it flowing evenly across the back half of the year. So when you look at the third quarter and the fourth quarter, to get to our full year guide of the $75 million year-over-year, we see about a 4% decrease, in cost in the third quarter, getting to more like down 1% or 2% in the fourth quarter. So about 4% in the third quarter, maybe down 1% or so in the fourth quarter."

David, the other thing, I would just add more is sort of a historical macro comment. We have weathered both significant price increase, raw material increases and certainly, giving those raw material price increases back or having those raw material price increase or decrease. And I think our track record is very good of managing both the pluses and the minuses, the increases and decreases, as we manage our business and as we said, you can have a timing differences to catch up with you have significant movements in raw materials.

How do we bring our innovation and technology those shipments working with the OEMs. And then looking at what the replacement cycle is, is the target as you know, on the early replacements.

One, I mean you are correct, with a white winter, excuse me -- the way as well as the; industry would no doubt sell more tires., I think from our -- from our high or down, I think well over 20% from where white winter would have industry volumes. So definitely that would be an increase to our volume. And our share in there, our tires, our products in there performed very well. So that certainly, would help us in a significant way. I will also remind you because we have not one of these in the while, there is a selling season that's going on now for winter tires and we feel again a pretty good about that because the channels are not as well as they have been in the past. But you also have the situation where you are making those tires early, so as we said, we're planning for a great winter, we're not planning for a white winter, that's for inventory and cost purposes. But we are keeping the ability and the flexibility to try to make more of those tires should we get into white winter and to be able to catch up those. So that's part of our strategy. I would say, the second thing, just in general on EMEA volumes, what you're also seeing is sort of an intentional mixed shift towards as not just growing volume for volume looking at how they concentrate on HVA tires in both the OE and the replacement markets as well as certain geographic markets and by also doing that and making investments to do that, we are also then not pursuing aggressively, not volume-for-volume shake, some low-end tires that are just not the place where Goodyear Dunlop brands can add value and where our value proposition doesn't play well . We see in Europe, just like we used to see in the U.S. and still doing in some cases a sort of 4 tires for $99, you see the same type of offerings in certain parts of Europe, that's not where we are going to play and it's not that where we can deliver the value that our investors -- would expect from us. So that's playing as well."

And if you think about it, what we're still seeing and what we have seen for a while, is sort of that consistent sellout. Remember, sellout tends to follow GDP over time. There can be dislocations, but sellout and GDP tend to be a pretty correlated thing, over EBITDA time. What we're seeing right now again is Laura alluded to, is really disappeared some of the RMA figures that are out there., so, if I could walk you through a couple of things very quickly, and you can -- I think referred back to Slide 5, it is in our deck, but remember, in the second half of 2014, you have a really big pre-buy and of the tariffs coming into the market. What they did was, in Q1 2015, you remember we said in the last quarter, we had a pretty easy comp, because if you think about the behaviorally, the channel stop buying as they bought a lot in the second half of 2014. And what they did in the second half of 2015 -- excuse me -- the second quarter of 2015 was start to restock again and as they did that our Q2 2015 to Q2 2016 comp became tougher. so you see on a growth basis a little growth, happening, but it's really again all because of imports, coming in and the volumes at the low end of the market. And I think, Laura also made the comment and I made the comment that you're going to see that continuing the month of July because it's actually comp of the year and we saw a lot of this restocking going on in the channel. So I have you think about if I could maybe put that parts a little more simply, tariffs really start the industry as we go. Those tariffs really impact the low end of the market, which is not where we play, it's not very focused. We're focusing on the 17-inch and above. And 17-inch and above as we showed you, we saw in Q1 and Q2, that market grew 10% and 7% using the U.S.A. numbers of the industry. So, I think you are actually seeing good growth in that part of the market, where you don't see a distorted by tariffs, so, that's a -- there's 1 element. The second element of it I would say, we look at it vehicle miles traveled, gasoline and is a pretty good, but you have to  remember we kind of say all vehicle miles traveled are created equal. So you have a lot of new cars on the road. I think I mentioned, this earlier, that really haven't coming from the first replacement yet. So we have got a new cost that are continuing to drive this vehicle miles traveled. And you also have to remember RMA numbers are based on selling, not sellout, where vehicle miles traveled would be rubber burning, which would be more looking to sell out number not a silly number. So when you have all the happening with the channel on sell in, because at tariffs, you see that sort of at the moment, dislocation between the sell in and sellout, we said another way, but the RMA reporting was actually have to not in the marketplace. So we would think those 2 things are going to come together, as we get some consistency, in terms of comps over time. And we said we really very pleased with what's happening, because of the market of 17-inch and above our HVA, we use at 17-inch and about as of the pilot is in the slight pick the HVA markets are really moving a very positive way. And, as he said earlier, that something we feel really good about it, particularly, as with regard to the future. Because those have at the present margin yet. Our issues we just got to keep more of the tires, so, long story, but hopefully that helps. Thank you."

This morning, I will review highlights from our second quarter, provide an update on the industry and the key markets in each of our regions and give my perspective on our  business for the remainder of the year. Laura will follow with the financial review of each of our businesses and an update to our outlook before we open the call for your questions. 
In the second quarter, we delivered segment operating income of $531 million, reflecting strong performance across the company.  That's a second quarter record in our core segment operating income, which I'll remind you, excludes Venezuela from our 2015 base. Our operating performance helped drive a nearly 40% increase in our adjusted EPS of $1.16. Our second quarter was anchored by a 37% increase in operating income in our EMEA business unit. Our Asia Pacific business also continued its strong performance, with a nearly 10% increase in earnings. 
Combining this quarter with our record first quarter, our segment operating income for the first half of the year was $950 million, the highest first half ever for Goodyear. 
In addition, we delivered overall segment operating margin of 13.7% in the second quarter, an increase over last year. The Americas provided more than half of our SOI, and its underlying operations continue to remain solid. 
Furthermore, all 3 of our global businesses are in segment operating margins of more than 11.5%. Taken in total, our segment operating performance reflects the unwavering execution of our strategy, which has proved its strength even in volatile market conditions. 
Our consistent progress has resulted in steady earnings growth and positions us well for that growth to continue. I'd like to spend the next few minutes providing my perspective on each of our SBUs as well as my thoughts on the industry outlook for the remainder of the year.
The Americas, which is a reminder, now includes both our North America and Latin America businesses, delivered $291 million of operating income. As expected, its earnings were less than last year because of the few discrete items in the quarter. Laura will provide more detail on those items in her remarks. 
Nonetheless, the Americas' underlying business performance remains strong and continues to demonstrate the earnings power of the value proposition in our core business. Demand remained robust for our premium  HVA tires, and in particularly, in light truck and SUV. These segments take advantage of our strengths and continue to drive growth in mix in our U.S. business. 
We continue to see strong demand for our Wrangler DuraTrac and our Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure products. In addition, our shipments for passenger cars also performed very well in the quarter, specifically, our Eagle RSA, the Eagle F1 Asymmetric All-Season and the Assurance ComforTred. In broader industry terms, the underlying fundamentals in the U.S., such as miles driven, gasoline prices and fuel consumption, remain favorable. Americans used an average of almost 9.8 million barrels of gasoline a day in the 4 weeks ending July 1, the highest level since the Energy Information Administration started collecting weekly consumption data 35 years ago. 
Also, while the SAR is moderated from its peak levels, SUV and light truck vehicle growth has increased 6% over the last 12 months. We always depend on the technology and the performance characteristics of Goodyear's high-value-added products for SUV and light truck fitments. And these are the type of platforms we target with our OE strategy, and it's working. 
The U.S. replacement industry data on a whole, however, reflect the softer volumes in the second quarter compared to a year ago. As we've outlined on Slide 6, this decline was primarily as a result of a higher-than-normal level of imports in the second quarter of last year. You'll recall imports were abnormally low in the first quarter of 2015, following the announcement of the U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. The situation was exacerbated by a port strike, making product flow difficult for many importers. 
As a result, the second quarter of 2015 saw about $50 million more imported tires than the first quarter. And separately, we've seen some destocking at the dealer and distributor level for some broader market products this quarter. Our view is that this excess inventory was concentrated towards the lower end of the market in the economy and mid-tier segments.
If we take a step back from the quarter, the year-to-date industry sell-in for consumer replacement is up 1%. What's important to note is that within that growth is an increase in rim size of 17-inch or greater of 9%. Since the start of recovery began in 2010, we've seen several years of growth in OE with a mix shift to those premium tires. rim size of 17-inch or greater grew from 49% of the OE market in 2009 to 73% in 2013. We're seeing the benefit of that mix shift in the replacement market as well. Tire sizes of 17-inch and greater grew 10% and 7% in the first and second quarter, respectively. And we're outperforming in this portion of the market. Goodyear brand -- the Goodyear brand nearly doubled the industry in growth in 17-inch and greater rim sizes in the second quarter. This is exactly what our OE strategy was designed to do. As you know, we've been investing in our U.S. plants to increase our capability to supply more premium HVA tires. Some of that investment has been in CapEx, and some in engineering and shifts in production within our existing footprint. We're continuing to increase our capability to grow in this profitable segment.
Looking ahead, we expect that the overall U.S. industry will remain weak in July as a result of the highest import comparable from all of 2015. In the intermediate to longer term, we continue to feel very confident about the fundamentals in the U.S., and continue to expect strong demand for our HVA products.
Turning now to Brazil. Economic conditions there remain challenging during the quarter. Industry shipments and consumer replacement were down about 2%, and OE continued its steep decline. Despite the macroeconomic headwinds, Brazil's profit contribution was once again positive in the quarter. We feel very good about our ability to drive growth in mix in HVA segments in Brazil over the long term, and while the economy -- excuse me, while the economic recovery is in around the corner, we believe that we're well positioned in the marketplace when it does occur. And we do believe that it will occur.
Now shifting to Europe. Our EMEA business unit delivered $148 million in operating income during the second quarter. That's a 37% increase, driven by strong volume in both consumer OE and replacement. Industry sell-in remained healthy during the second quarter, especially in OE, which is driven by higher-production levels in Western Europe. New passenger car registration grew for the 34th month in a row in June, posting growth of more than 9% in the first half of the year.
European auto companies preference for premium, large-rim diameter HVA tires, including Goodyear's high-performance lines, are driving mix up in OE and later on in replacement across the region. 
And we're delivering award-winning products to meet that demand. We recently launched the new Eagle F1 Asymmetric 3 Ultra-High Performance tire, an industry-leading product for Europe's growing OE market. The new member of the Eagle family was tested by leading organizations and outperformed other brands in both dry and wet conditions as well as in durability, leading to demand pull from our premium OE customers across the region.
In EMEA's consumer replacement, we saw strong growth in our SUV and light truck segments, as Goodyear-branded summer tires, particularly, EfficientGrip SUV tires, claimed the top spot in several important magazine tests. As we look to the second half of the year, we're again taking a measured approach to winter tire sales based on the warmer weather we've seen in the region over the past several years. Although the winter inventory situation is more balanced heading into the selling season versus last year. Our plan is based on a green winter, and weather aside, our products are positioned to win in the marketplace. The strength of our winter tire portfolio, combined with an attractive value proposition for our customers, has us well positioned to make the most out of the winter industry.
Finally, as you know, we've been focused on our cost initiatives in EMEA, and improvements in this area also contributed to the region's earnings in the quarter. With the economic uncertainties surrounding Brexit and its impact in Europe in the intermediate and longer term, we will remain both agile and diligent on cost actions in this changing market.
In Asia Pacific, we achieved record segment operating income of $92 million, with volume growth of 21%. Our unit volumes were up 4%, excluding the impact of our newly reacquired Japanese replacement business. As we've seen in prior quarters, volume growth was robust in our China consumer business, but there was further deterioration in Australia due to the ongoing challenges in the country. 
China had a strong second quarter with consumer tire volume growth of 8% and double-digit growth in the SUV and light truck segments. We've had success in both OE replacement and winning new Chinese OE accounts and in strong execution of sell-through programs, building upon our expanding service and retail networks there. 
Consistent with our strategy, we grew in Asia Pacific with the right mix of products. As an example, Asia Pacific scored product wins with the Sport Maxx high-performance tire, which was awarded best-in-class in the 2016 MOTOR Magazine tire test. Sport Maxx outperformed its competition in all 5 of the tested performance attributes, beating the competing tires by the biggest margin in 8 years. Designed for a wide range of high-performance vehicles, our innovative products are driving demand in the region. 
We remain very optimistic about the long-term value proposition of our business in Asia Pacific. Our new product introductions, growing OE relationships and increasing points of distribution, give us confidence that we will continue to be successful and grow in this important market.
Looking back at our global businesses in the second quarter and over the first half, I'm very pleased with our record results, which were driven by strong demand in premium HVA products across our regions. The Goodyear brand and our value propositions continues to be a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Goodyear's value proposition has many elements, including a trusted iconic global brand, industry-leading products, diverse distribution channels capable of responding to customer requirements, strong customer relationships, particularly, at the OEMs in an unwavering focus on the consumer. 
Our teams have made the commitment to winning with consumers and helping our customers build their businesses every day, while taking the long view of creating sustainable value. Our first half results demonstrate that, and we are focused on execution across our markets by pursuing profitable volume in share in segments where the Goodyear brand as a differentiator. 
We are committed to our target of 10% to 15% annual growth or $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion of segment operating income in 2016. We look forward to discussing emerging trends in our industry and our strategic plans for the future as part of our Investor Day on September 15.
Now I'll turn the call over to Laura."

Today, I will cover our second quarter results and provide more detail on key income drivers in the quarter. I'll also provide an update regarding our full year outlook for 2016 before we open the call up for your questions.
Turning to the income statement on Slide 8. You will see our results for the second quarter. Consistent with our presentation in April, we have provided call-outs that highlight the effect of deconsolidating Venezuela. Looking at the income statement items, as reported for the second quarter, the sales comparison to prior year was negatively impacted by the deconsolidation of Venezuela, which had $115 million of net sales in the second quarter of 2015. 
Similarly, other tire-related revenues were lower by $86 million, driven by the 2015 sale of the North American motorcycle business. Additionally, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies reduced sales by $84 million year-over-year.
Our gross margins were stable at 27.5%, and segment operating margin increased 50 basis points in the quarter. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, SOI margin increased 1 full point. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.75. Our results were influenced by certain significant items. Adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $1.16. I'll note that our segment operating income in the quarter was impacted by a $24 million unfavorable, out-of-period adjustment related to the elimination of intercompany profit in the Americas region. The correction is related primarily to 2012 to 2015 prior-period financials, with the majority attributable to 2012. This amount is included as a significant item in the adjusted net income.
Turning to the step chart on Slide 9, which walks second quarter 2015 segment operating income to second quarter 2016. After adjusting for the $36 million impact of Venezuela, our 2015 core SOI was $514 million. The benefit of higher volume in the second quarter and higher-production levels in the first quarter drove an overall improvement of $21 million. 
Lower raw material costs of $49 million more than offset reduced price mix of $44 million for a net benefit of $5 million during the quarter. Cost-savings actions of $66 million, driven by our operational excellence initiatives, more than offset the negative impact of inflation, delivering a net benefit of $33 million.
Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $10 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly, against the Argentine peso, the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real. Other was lower by $8 million, and includes a $14 million impact of the divestiture of our North American motorcycle business, which was partially offset by lower incentive compensation of $10 million. 
In summary, we achieved another record quarter with growth in core SOI of 3%. Excluding the impact of the out-of-period adjustment, our core SOI was $555 million and growth was 8%.
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.1 billion. Net debt is up versus year-end, which reflects the normal working capital seasonality in our business. Versus the prior year period, the increase includes the impact of Venezuela's deconsolidation. Free cash flow from operations is shown on Slide 11. For the quarter, we generated $99 million of cash. Working capital was the use of $75 million of cash and in line with the typical seasonality of our business. Additionally, cash flow from operating activities was $261 million for the 3 months ended June 30.
Now let's move to the business units on Slide 12. The Americas generated segment operating income of $291 million in the second quarter or 13.9% to sales. The year-over-year decline in SOI is more than explained by several noteworthy items that totaled $79 million. 
First, the $36 million impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela. Second, the $24 million out-of-period adjustments, primarily related to 2012. And third, a $19 million impact from the sale of GDTNA business last year. 
The Americas also saw higher conversion costs in the quarter, due to additional engineering activities and the shift in production to increase our supply of HVA tires. Despite these headwinds, our core business in the Americas continues to be strong. The execution of our strategy enables us to continue to realize positive price mix performance. Customers are demanding more of our HVA tires, particularly, premium SUV and light truck tires. Unit sales in the second quarter were $18.8 million or down 6% versus 2015. In OE, our unit volume decreased by 900,000 units. The sale of GDTNA, which included sales of Dunlop-branded tires to Japanese OEMs in the U.S., explains almost half of the decline, and we also saw OE declines in both Brazil and in the U.S. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, our replacement volume was flat.
In summary, and despite several notable headwinds within the Americas region, the underlying performance is solid. The quarter also offers proof of our margin sustainability. Excluding the out-of-period adjustment, the Americas achieved SOI margin that was higher than last year. We accomplished this margin improvement in markets that were softer and with significantly lower raw material tailwinds. This performance is validation of the strength of our strategy, products and the Goodyear brand in the marketplace.
Turning to Slide 13. Europe, Middle East and Africa continued to deliver positive results with segment operating income of $148 million in the quarter, up 37% compared to prior year. This was the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth, driven by higher production and sales volumes throughout the region as well as our continued focus on cost-savings initiatives. Volume was up more than 4% compared to last year, and was driven by growth in both consumer OE and replacement channels. Strong demand for Goodyear products resulted in an 8% increase in consumer OE units, and consumer replacement volumes were up almost 3% in the quarter. 
Winter industry demand also increased more than 10% year-on-year in the quarter, evidence of channel inventories being more normalized this year. 
Our commercial truck business also continues to deliver consistent results, with volumes up almost 4% in the quarter. Our EMEA business delivered very strong performance in the second quarter of 2016. We remain confident in our team, our product portfolio and in our ability to deliver sustainable revenue and profit growth.
Turning to Slide 14. Asia Pacific delivered record second quarter segment operating income of $92 million, an $8 million improvement versus last year. The main drivers continue to be strong volume growth and the benefit of lower raw material costs, which were partially offset by a lower price/mix, and increase SAP expense related to our recently acquired replacement business in Japan. Our segment operating margin in the region increased to 17.4%, up from 17.1% a year ago. Asia-Pacific volume was $7.3 million tire units representing a 20% -- 21% growth versus last year. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of the Japanese replacement tire business, the remaining volume growth is primarily attributable to our 8% consumer tire growth in China, one of our largest and fastest-growing markets in the region. 
Additionally, the ASEAN [ph] countries saw a 6.5% growth across our business, which was partially offset by lower volume in Australia. We are well positioned in Asia-Pacific and continue to be excited about the long-term growth and opportunities there.
Turning now to Slide 15. I'll cover our full year modeling assumptions for 2016. In summary, our full year outlook and SOI income drivers remain unchanged from our April call. We continue to target $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion in SOI in 2016. With moderating raw material costs since April, we now expect raw material costs to be about 4% lower than last year before cost-savings actions. We continue to see our full year price mix versus raw material benefit at around $75 million, unchanged from our earlier outlook. We expect third quarter raw materials to be down about 4% based on current spot rate. The remaining price mix net of raw materials benefit should flow evenly across the back half of the year.
In cost savings versus inflation, we continue to expect a benefit of $135 million for the full year. The remaining net cost savings are expected to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter.
Regarding foreign currency translations, we continue to expect a headwind of approximately $45 million. While current spot rates would imply a slightly more favorable outcome, currencies remain volatile. The divested North America motorcycle business will have a negative $10 million impact year-over-year for the third quarter.
Additional financial assumptions for 2016 are listed on Slide 16. Our income tax rate has been lowered to about 28% of global pretax operating profit, following our experience today. Cash taxes remain at 10% to 15% of global pretax operating profit.
And finally, we repurchased 100 million of shares during the second quarter. We've repurchased 563 million so far under our existing $1.1 billion share repurchase authorization and  we remain committed to repurchasing additional shares through 2016 and early 2017. 
Now, we'll open the line up for your questions."

And I might take just 2 seconds to give you a view on how we think about Europe overall. We still view it as really a fantastic market despite some of the ongoing, let's say, unsolved economic issues that still linger over there. Remember, the market is growing there, particularly in 17-inch and above, particularly, that when you compare it to 16-inch and below, where you're not seeing nearly as much growth and sometimes, it can even be viewed as flat depending on the market. We see the market still demanding excellent technology, driven by the OEMs. We really love the carpark that still sits in Europe there. So we look at it as a great market and add to it than then seasonal market as you bring in winter tires and the winter tire -- the winter summer switch, and really a robust market for us. The biggest headwind we still see there, as we've talked about in the past, is the ongoing sort of movement of low-end Asian tires, particularly into Eastern Europe that has and probably we'll continue to cause a headwind and again, it's an example of when tariffs go up in one region, those tires typically move to somewhere else, you may remember in the past, they went down to South America as those economy slowed and currencies depreciated, tariffs are back in the U.S., now they're in Eastern Europe. So that's a continued headwind for us over there. But our goal is to continue to drive mix, continue to align our distribution consistent with our strategy over there. Our focus will be on new products and leveraging our brands, and to the point you made, continuing to focus on our cost actions over there. So I would say that we've made an improvement in Europe. We would expect those cost improvements to stick with us. I would say, we're only on the front end of fixing our European business over the long term. Our goal is to do some of the same things we've done in North America and Europe as well, and we feel very good about that. But that's probably not a direct, straight line either. So as we fight off the low-cost tires coming into the East, that actually has a negative impact on our mix in Europe, that hides some of the positive impact we're getting on the 17-inch and above. So I guess, overall, I would say, we would expect strong results in Europe as we look to '16 and out into '17.  I would expect that you'll still see some significant cost actions there as we move ahead, as we look at our production over there. And Jean-Claude Kihn and the team over there are very focused on cost, day-to-day cost as well as structural cost to reduce the fixed cost of that business going forward. So I feel good, and I would say, we're on the front end of what we expect."

On the cadence for price/mix less raw materials, obviously, we've seen oil somewhat creeped up sequentially, but still be down year-over-year. As we think about the go-forward if raw materials do continue to hold the levels where they are and end up increasing year-over-year, how do you expect in the P&L to flow for price price/mix less raws as raw materials increase and then possible prices are passed on to consumers. Because -- the reason I asked is one of the larger questions or pushback that I'll get from investors is really just on the industry being able to be price-disciplined, and if there's going to be 1 quarter or 2, or 0.5 year to 3 quarters of a year where the tire manufacturers are essentially caught with increasing raw material costs without adding in or passing on those price increases. And as you look at 2Q results with only a price/mix less raw materials, positive $5 million versus the first quarter about $38 million and you start to question what's going to change in the back half of the year that's going to maintain that positive price/mix over raw materials if -- in the event that we had the second quarter really being eaten away in a favorable raw material environment?"

So for the one short answer is price/mix versus raw, obviously a big piece of that is mix. And there are some things we're doing in the business that result in a much stronger mix as we get into the second half of the year. So that's one piece of it. Now similar to my opening remarks, as we look at the remaining price/mix net of raws benefit, we do see it flowing evenly across the back half of the year. So when you look at the third quarter and the fourth quarter, to get to our full year guide of the $75 million year-over-year, we see about a 4% decrease in raws in the third quarter, getting to more like down 1% or 2% in the fourth quarter. So about 4% in the third quarter, maybe down 1% or so in the fourth quarter."

How do we bring our innovation and technology with those fitments working with the OEMs. And then looking at what the replacement cycle is, is the target as you know, on the early replacements. As we look at -- I think it was Slide 6 in our deck, you can see that the mix is moving up 17-inch and above from 49% of the 73% in total. And what it says is, most of those, maybe I shouldn't say most, that's maybe too specific. I don't have the number here.

One, I mean you are correct, with a white winter, excuse me -- we, as well as the industry, would, no doubt, sell more tires, I think from our -- from a high or down, I think well over 20% from where white winter would have industry volumes. So definitely that would be an increase to our volume. And our share in there, our tires, our products in there performed very well. So that certainly would help us in a significant way. I will also remind you because we haven't had one of these in the while, there is a sell-in season that's going on now for winter tires, and we feel again pretty good about that because the channels are not as full as they have been in the past. But you also have the situation where you are making those tires early. So as we said, we're planning for a green winter, we're not planning for a white winter, that's for inventory and cost purposes. But we are keeping the ability and the flexibility to try to make more of those tires should we get into a white winter and be able to catch up those. So that's part of our strategy. I would say, the second thing, just in general on EMEA volumes, what you're also seeing there is sort of an intentional mix shift towards as not just growing volume for volume looking at how we concentrate on HVA tires in both the OE and the replacement markets as well as in certain geographic markets and by also doing that and making investments to do that, we are also then not pursuing aggressively, not volume-for-volume's sake, some low-end tires that are just not a place where the Goodyear Dunlop brands can add value and where our value proposition doesn't play well . We see in Europe, just like we used to see in the U.S. and still doing in some cases,  sort of 4 tires for $99, you see those same type of offerings in certain parts of Europe. That's not where we are going to play and it's not that where we can deliver the value that our investors -- excuse me, would expect from us. So that's playing into it as well."

I would say, as we look to markets, like Brazil or Latin America where we have significant currency devaluations and we've seen raw materials, not just natural rubber, dollar base raw materials go up. We are continuing to manage as you'd expect. We've announced price increases in Brazil, for example, from Q3 2015 all through to Q1 2016, because of the devaluation that we've seen in the currency there. So there's a market we will continue to be very active trying to get the value for our products in the marketplace. Other markets obviously have different stories. I'm not -- I won't go through everywhere like that, but I would say that the world around excess capacity again is Brazil in this example, where the OE business was down again about 20% in the quarter, we've got to be very vigilant in managing price/mix versus raw materials. So it's very hard to answer that question in one way. I would say, definitely we're going to continue down the path to  do, that."

I think there's a couple of things that are happening as we sort of dissect this. And if we think about it, what we're still seeing and what we have seen for a while is sort of that consistent sellout. Remember, sellout tends to follow GDP over time. There can be dislocations, but sellout and GDP tend to be a pretty correlated thing over a period of time. What we're seeing right now, again, as Laura alluded to it, is really how tariffs have disrupted some of the RMA figures that are out there. So if I could walk you through a couple of things very quickly, and you can, I think refer back to Slide 5, that is in our deck. But remember, in the second half of '14, you had a really big pre-buy ahead of the tariffs coming into the market. What that did was in Q1 '15, if you remember we said in the last quarter, we had a pretty easy comp, because if you think about just behaviorally, the channel stopped buying as they bought a lot in the second half of '14. What they did in the second half of '15 -- or excuse me, the second quarter of '15 will start to restock again. And as they did that, our Q2 '15 to Q2 '16 comp became tougher. So you see, on a gross basis, a little growth happening, but it's really again all because of imports coming in and the volumes at the low end of the market. And I think, Laura also made the comment, or I made the comment that you're going to see that continue in the month of July because it's actually the highest comp of the year where you saw a lot of this restocking going on in the channel. So I'd have you think about, if I could maybe put that parts a little more succinctly, tariffs really do distort the industry as we go. Those tariffs really impact the low end of the market, which is not where we play, it's not where we focus. We're focusing on that 17-inch and above. And 17-inch and above, as we showed you, we saw in Q1 and Q2, that market grew 10% and 7% using the U.S.A. numbers of the industry. So I think you are actually seeing good growth in that part of the market where you don't see it distorted by the tariffs. So that's a -- that 's one element of it.  The second element of it, I would say, we look at it, vehicle miles traveled, gasoline usage, everything is pretty good. But you have to remember we kind of say all vehicle miles traveled aren't created equal. So you have a lot of new cars on the road. I think I mentioned this earlier, that really haven't coming from the first replacement yet. So we have got a new cars that are continuing to drive those vehicle miles traveled. And you also have to remember RMA numbers are based on sell-in, not sell-out, where vehicle miles traveled would be rubber burning on the road, which would be more akin looking to a sell-out number not a sell-in number. So when you have all those distortions happening with the channel on sell-in because of tariffs, you see that sort of, at the moment, dislocation between sell-in and sell-out  or said in another way, but the RMA is reporting what was actually happening  out in the marketplace. So we would think those 2 things are going to come together, as we get some consistency, in terms of comps over time. And we'd say, we're really very pleased with what's happening, because the market of 17-inch and above, or HVA, we use at 17-inch and above to sort of highlight in the slides. The HVA markets are really moving in a very positive way. And, as I said earlier's, that something we feel really good about it, particularly as we look out to the future. Because those haven't hit replacement market yet. Our issues we just got to keep making more of the tires. So, long story, but hopefully that helps."

The cost-savings versus inflation, okay?

Now, the $29 million as we said back in the first quarter is really some extra labor, it's engineering expense, it's really everything we've done to shift more and more to those more complex HVA tires, and that does add cost.

This morning, I will review highlights from our second quarter, provide an update on the industry and the key markets in each of our regions and give my perspective on our business for the remainder of the year. Laura will follow with the financial review of each of our businesses and an update to our outlook before we open the call for your questions. 
In the second quarter, we delivered segment operating income of $531 million, reflecting strong performance across the company.  That's a second quarter record in our core segment operating income, which I'll remind you, excludes Venezuela from our 2015 base. Our operating performance helped drive a nearly 40% increase in our adjusted EPS of $1.16. Our second quarter was anchored by a 37% increase in operating income in our EMEA business unit. Our Asia Pacific business also continued its strong performance, with a nearly 10% increase in earnings. 
Combining this quarter with our record first quarter, our segment operating income for the first half of the year was $950 million, the highest first half ever for Goodyear. 
In addition, we delivered overall segment operating margin of 13.7% in the second quarter, an increase over last year. The Americas provided more than half of our SOI, and its underlying operations continue to remain solid. 
Furthermore, all 3 of our global businesses earned segment operating margins of more than 11.5%. Taken in total, our segment operating performance reflects the unwavering execution of our strategy, which has proved its strength even in volatile market conditions. 
Our consistent progress has resulted in steady earnings growth and positions us well for that growth to continue. I'd like to spend the next few minutes providing my perspective on each of our SBUs as well as my thoughts on the industry outlook for the remainder of the year.
The Americas, which as a reminder, now includes both our North America and Latin America businesses, delivered $291 million of operating income. As expected, its earnings were less than last year because of a few discrete items in the quarter. Laura will provide more detail on those items in her remarks. 
Nonetheless, the Americas' underlying business performance remains strong and continues to demonstrate the earnings power of the value proposition in our core business. Demand remained robust for our premium  HVA tires, and in particularly, in light truck and SUV. These segments take advantage of our strengths and continue to drive growth in mix in our U.S. business. 
We continue to see strong demand for our Wrangler DuraTrac and our Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure products. In addition, our fitments for passenger cars also performed very well in the quarter, specifically, our Eagle RSA, the Eagle F1 Asymmetric All-Season and the Assurance ComforTred. In broader industry terms, the underlying fundamentals in the U.S., such as miles driven, gasoline prices and fuel consumption, remain favorable. Americans used an average of almost 9.8 million barrels of gasoline a day in the 4 weeks ending July 1, the highest level since the Energy Information Administration started collecting weekly consumption data 35 years ago. 
Also, while the SAAR has moderated from its peak levels, SUV and light truck vehicle growth has increased 6% over the last 12 months. The OEs depend on the technology and the performance characteristics of Goodyear's high-value-added products for SUV and light truck fitments. And these are the type of platforms we target with our OE strategy, and it's working. 
The U.S. replacement industry data on the whole, however, reflected softer volumes in the second quarter compared to a year ago. As we've outlined on Slide 6, this decline was primarily as a result of a higher-than-normal level of imports in the second quarter of last year. You'll recall imports were abnormally low in the first quarter of 2015, following the announcement of the U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. The situation was exacerbated by a port strike, making product flow difficult for many importers. 
As a result, the second quarter of 2015 saw about 15 million more imported tires than the first quarter. And separately, we've seen some destocking at the dealer and distributor level for some broader market products this quarter. Our view is that this excess inventory was concentrated towards the lower end of the market in the economy and mid-tier segments.
If we take a step back from the quarter, the year-to-date industry sell-in for consumer replacement is up 1%. What's important to note is that within that growth is an increase in rim sizes of 17-inch or greater of 9%. Since the SAAR recovery began in 2010, we've seen several years of growth in OE with a mix shift to those premium tires. Rim size of 17-inch or greater grew from 49% of the OE market in 2009 to 73% in 2013. We're seeing the benefit of that mix shift in the replacement market as well. Tire sizes of 17-inch and greater grew 10% and 7% in the first and second quarter, respectively. And we're outperforming in this portion of the market. Goodyear brand -- the Goodyear brand nearly doubled the industry in growth in 17-inch and greater rim sizes in the second quarter. This is exactly what our OE strategy was designed to do. As you know, we've been investing in our U.S. plants to increase our capability to supply more premium HVA tires. Some of that investment has been in CapEx, and some in engineering and shifts in production within our existing footprint. We're continuing to increase our capability to grow in this profitable segment.
Looking ahead, we expect that the overall U.S. industry will remain weak in July as a result of the highest import comparable from all of 2015. In the intermediate to longer term, we continue to feel very confident about the fundamentals in the U.S., and continue to expect strong demand for our HVA products.
Turning now to Brazil. Economic conditions there remain challenging during the quarter. Industry shipments and consumer replacement were down about 2%, and OE continued its steep decline. Despite the macroeconomic headwinds, Brazil's profit contribution was once again positive in the quarter. We feel very good about our ability to drive growth and mix in HVA segment in Brazil over the long term, and while the economy -- excuse me, while the economic recovery isn't around the corner, we believe that we're well positioned in the marketplace when it does occur. And we do believe that it will occur.
Now shifting to Europe. Our EMEA business unit delivered $148 million in operating income during the second quarter. That's a 37% increase, driven by strong volume in both consumer OE and replacement. Industry sell-in remained healthy during the second quarter, especially in OE, which was driven by higher-production levels in Western Europe. New passenger car registration grew for the 34th month in a row in June, posting growth of more than 9% in the first half of the year.
European auto companies' preference for premium, large-rim diameter HVA tires, including Goodyear's high-performance lines, are driving mix up in OE and later on in replacement across the region. 
And we're delivering award-winning products to meet that demand. We recently launched the new Eagle F1 Asymmetric 3 Ultra-High Performance tire, an industry-leading product for Europe's growing OE market. The new member of the Eagle family was tested by leading organizations and outperformed other brands in both dry and wet conditions as well as in durability, leading to demand pull from our premium OE customers across the region.
In EMEA consumer replacement, we saw strong growth in our SUV and light truck segments, as Goodyear-branded summer tires, particularly, EfficientGrip SUV tires, claimed the top spot in several important magazine tests. As we look to the second half of the year, we are again taking a measured approach to winter tire sales based on the warmer weather we've seen in the region over the past several years. Although the winter inventory situation is more balanced heading into the sell-in season versus last year. Our plan is based on a green winter, and weather aside, our products are positioned to win in the marketplace. The strength of our winter tire portfolio, combined with an attractive value proposition for our customers, has us well positioned to make the most out of the winter industry [indiscernible].
Finally, as you know, we've been focused on our cost initiatives in EMEA, and improvements in this area also contributed to the region's earnings in the quarter. With the economic uncertainties surrounding Brexit and its impact in Europe in the intermediate and longer term, we will remain both agile and diligent on cost actions in this changing market.
In Asia Pacific, we achieved record segment operating income of $92 million, with volume growth of 21%. Our unit volumes were up 4%, excluding the impact of our newly reacquired Japanese replacement business. As we've seen in prior quarters, volume growth was robust in our China consumer business, but there was further deterioration in Australia due to the ongoing challenges in the country. 
China had a strong second quarter with consumer tire volume growth of 8% and double-digit growth in the SUV and light truck segments. We've had success in both OE and replacement and winning new Chinese OE accounts and in strong execution of sell-through programs, building upon our expanding service and retail network there. 
Consistent with our strategy, we grew in Asia Pacific with the right mix of products. As an example, Asia Pacific scored product wins with the Sport Maxx high-performance tire, which was awarded best-in-class in the 2016 MOTOR Magazine tire test. Sport Maxx outperformed its competition in all 5 of the tested performance attributes, beating the competing tires by the biggest margin in 8 years. Designed for a wide range of high-performance vehicles, our innovative products are driving demand in the region. 
We remain very optimistic about the long-term value proposition of our business in Asia Pacific. Our new product introductions, growing OE relationships and increasing points of distribution, give us confidence that we will continue to be successful and grow in this important market.
Looking back at our global businesses in the second quarter and over the first half, I'm very pleased with our record results, which were driven by strong demand in premium HVA products across our regions. The Goodyear brand and our value proposition continues to be a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Goodyear's value proposition has many elements, including a trusted iconic global brand, industry-leading products, diverse distribution channels capable of responding to customer requirements, strong customer relationships, particularly, at the OEMs and an unwavering focus on the consumer. 
Our teams have made the commitment to winning with consumers and helping our customers build their businesses every day, while taking the long view of creating sustainable value. Our first half results demonstrate that, and we are focused on execution across our markets by pursuing profitable volume in share in segments where the Goodyear brand as a differentiator. 
We are committed to our target of 10% to 15% annual growth or $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion of segment operating income in 2016. We look forward to discussing emerging trends in our industry and our strategic plans for the future as part of our Investor Day on September 15.
Now I'll turn the call over to Laura."

Today, I will cover our second quarter results and provide more detail on key income drivers in the quarter. I'll also provide an update regarding our full year outlook for 2016 before we open the call up for your questions.
Turning to the income statement on Slide 8. You will see our results for the second quarter. Consistent with our presentation in April, we have provided call-outs that highlight the effect of deconsolidating Venezuela. Looking at the income statement items, as reported for the second quarter, the sales comparison to prior year was negatively impacted by the deconsolidation of Venezuela, which had $115 million of net sales in the second quarter of 2015. 
Similarly, other tire-related revenues were lower by $86 million, driven by the 2015 sale of the North American motorcycle business. Additionally, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies reduced sales by $84 million year-over-year.
Our gross margins were stable at 27.5%, and segment operating margin increased 50 basis points in the quarter. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, SOI margin increased 1 full point. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.75. Our results were influenced by certain significant items. Adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $1.16. I'll note that our segment operating income in the quarter was impacted by a $24 million unfavorable, out-of-period adjustment related to the elimination of intercompany profit in the Americas region. The correction is related primarily to 2012 to 2015 prior-period financials, with the majority attributable to 2012. This amount is included as a significant item in the adjusted net income.
Turning to the step chart on Slide 9, which walks second quarter 2015 segment operating income to second quarter 2016. After adjusting for the $36 million impact of Venezuela, our 2015 core SOI was $514 million. The benefit of higher volume in the second quarter and higher-production levels in the first quarter drove an overall improvement of $21 million. 
Lower raw material costs of $49 million more than offset reduced price mix of $44 million for a net benefit of $5 million during the quarter. Cost-savings actions of $66 million, driven by our operational excellence initiatives, more than offset the negative impact of inflation, delivering a net benefit of $33 million.
Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $10 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly, against the Argentine peso, the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real. Other was lower by $8 million, and includes a $14 million impact of the divestiture of our North American motorcycle business, which was partially offset by lower incentive compensation of $10 million. 
In summary, we achieved another record quarter with growth in core SOI of 3%. Excluding the impact of the out-of-period adjustment, our core SOI was $555 million and growth was 8%.
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.1 billion. Net debt is up versus year-end, which reflects the normal working capital seasonality in our business. Versus the prior year period, the increase includes the impact of Venezuela's deconsolidation. Free cash flow from operations is shown on Slide 11. For the quarter, we generated $99 million of cash. Working capital was the use of $75 million of cash and in line with the typical seasonality of our business. Additionally, cash flow from operating activities was $261 million for the 3 months ended June 30.
Now let's move to the business units on Slide 12. The Americas generated segment operating income of $291 million in the second quarter or 13.9% to sales. The year-over-year decline in SOI is more than explained by several noteworthy items that total $79 million. 
First, the $36 million impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela. Second, the $24 million out-of-period adjustments, primarily related to 2012. And third, a $19 million impact from the sale of GDTNA business last year. 
The Americas also saw higher conversion costs in the quarter, due to additional engineering activities and a shift in production to increase our supply of HVA tires. Despite these headwinds, our core business in the Americas continues to be strong. The execution of our strategy enables us to continue to realize positive price mix performance. Customers are demanding more of our HVA tires, particularly, premium SUV and light truck tires. Unit sales in the second quarter were $18.8 million or down 6% versus 2015. In OE, our unit volume decreased by 900,000 units. The sale of GDTNA, which included sales of Dunlop-branded tires to Japanese OEMs in the U.S., explains almost half of the decline, and we also saw OE declines in both Brazil and in the U.S. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, our replacement volume was flat.
In summary, and despite several notable headwinds within the Americas region, the underlying performance is solid. The quarter also offers proof of our margin sustainability. Excluding the out-of-period adjustment, the Americas achieved SOI margin that was higher than last year. We accomplished this margin improvement in markets that were softer and with significantly lower raw material tailwinds. This performance is validation of the strength of our strategy, products and the Goodyear brand in the marketplace.
Turning to Slide 13. Europe, Middle East and Africa continued to deliver positive results with segment operating income of $148 million in the quarter, up 37% compared to prior year. This was the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth, driven by higher production and sales volumes throughout the region as well as our continued focus on cost-savings initiatives. Volume was up more than 4% compared to last year, and was driven by growth in both consumer OE and replacement channels. Strong demand for Goodyear products resulted in an 8% increase in consumer OE units, and consumer replacement volumes were up almost 3% in the quarter. 
Winter industry demand also increased more than 10% year-on-year in the quarter, evidence of channel inventories being more normalized this year. 
Our commercial truck business also continues to deliver consistent results, with volumes up almost 4% in the quarter. Our EMEA business delivered very strong performance in the second quarter of 2016. We remain confident in our team, our product portfolio and in our ability to deliver sustainable revenue and profit growth.
Turning to Slide 14. Asia Pacific delivered record second quarter segment operating income of $92 million, an $8 million improvement versus last year. The main drivers continue to be strong volume growth and the benefit of lower raw material costs, which were partially offset by a lower price mix, and increased SAG expenses related to our recently acquired replacement business in Japan. Our segment operating margin in the region increased to 17.4%, up from 17.1% a year ago. Asia-Pacific volume was 7.3 million tire units representing a 20% -- 21% growth versus last year. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of the Japanese replacement tire business, the remaining volume growth is primarily attributable to our 8% consumer tire growth in China, one of our largest and fastest-growing markets in the region. 
Additionally, the ASEAN countries saw a 6.5% growth across our business, which was partially offset by lower volume in Australia. We are well positioned in Asia-Pacific and continue to be excited about the long-term growth and opportunities there.
Turning now to Slide 15. I'll cover our full year modeling assumptions for 2016. In summary, our full year outlook and SOI income drivers remain unchanged from our April call. We continue to target $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion in SOI in 2016. With moderating raw material costs since April, we now expect raw material costs to be about 4% lower than last year before cost-savings actions. We continue to see our full year price mix versus raw material benefit at around $75 million, unchanged from our earlier outlook. We expect third quarter raw materials to be down about 4% based on current spot rate. The remaining price mix net of raw materials benefit should flow evenly across the back half of the year.
In cost savings versus inflation, we continue to expect a benefit of $135 million for the full year. The remaining net cost savings are expected to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter.
Regarding foreign currency translation, we continue to expect a headwind of approximately $45 million. While current spot rates would imply a slightly more favorable outcome, currencies remain volatile. The divested North America motorcycle business will have a negative $10 million impact year-over-year for the third quarter.
Additional financial assumptions for 2016 are listed on Slide 16. Our income tax rate has been lowered to about 28% of global pretax operating profit, following our experience to date. Cash taxes remain at 10% to 15% of global pretax operating profit.
And finally, we repurchased $100 million of shares during the second quarter. We've repurchased $563 million so far under our existing $1.1 billion share repurchase authorization and we remain committed to repurchasing additional shares through 2016 and early 2017.

And I might take just 2 seconds to give you a view on how we think about Europe overall. We still view it as really a fantastic market despite some of the ongoing, let's say, unsolved economic issues that still linger over there. Remember, the market is growing there, particularly in 17-inch and above, particularly, that when you compare it to 16-inch and below, where you're not seeing nearly as much growth and sometimes, it can even be viewed as flat depending on the market. We see the market still demanding excellent technology, driven by the OEMs. We really love the carpark that still sits in Europe there. So we look at it as a great market and add to it than then seasonal market as you bring in winter tires and the winter tire -- the winter summer switch, really a robust market for us. The biggest headwind we still see there, as we've talked about in the past, is the ongoing sort of movement of low-end Asian tires, particularly in through Eastern Europe that has and probably will continue to cause a headwind and again, it's an example of when tariffs go up in one region, those tires typically move to somewhere else, you may remember in the past, they went down to South America as those economies slowed and currencies depreciated, tariffs are back in the U.S., now they're in Eastern Europe. So that's a continued headwind for us over there. But our goal is to continue to drive mix, continue to align our distribution consistent with our strategy over there. Our focus will be on new products and leveraging our brands, and to the point you made, continuing to focus on our cost actions over there. So I would say that we've made an improvement in Europe. We would expect those cost improvements to stick with us. I would say, we're only on the front end of fixing our European business over the long term. Our goal is to do some of the same things we've done in North America in Europe as well, and we feel very good about that. But that's probably not a direct, straight line either. So as we fight off the low-cost tires coming into the East, that actually has a negative impact on our mix in Europe, that hides some of the positive impact we're getting on the 17-inch and above. So I guess, overall, I would say, we would expect strong results in Europe as we look to '16 and out into '17.  I would expect that you'll still see some significant cost actions there as we move ahead, as we look at our production over there. And Jean-Claude Kihn and the team over there are very focused on cost, day-to-day cost as well as structural cost to reduce the fixed cost of that business going forward. So I feel good, and I would say, we're on the front end of what we expect."

But given that production in U.K. has been diminished greatly from the period that I'm talking about, I don't think we see any significant disruption coming there. We like our business in the U.K., and we certainly think we can manage through this."

As we think about the go-forward if raw materials do continue to hold the levels where they are and end up increasing year-over-year, how do you expect the P&L to flow for price/mix less raws as raw materials increase and then possible prices are passed on to consumers. Because -- the reason I ask is one of the larger questions or pushback that I'll get from investors is really just on the industry being able to be price-disciplined, and if there's going to be 1 quarter or 2, or 0.5 year to 3/4 of a year where the tire manufacturers are essentially caught with increasing raw material costs without adding in or passing on those price increases. And as you look at 2Q results with only a price/mix less raw materials of positive $5 million versus the first quarter of about $38 million and you start to question what's going to change in the back half of the year that's going to maintain that positive price/mix over raw materials if -- in the event that we had the second quarter really being eaten away in a favorable raw material environment?"

And there are some things we're doing in the business that result in a much stronger mix as we get into the second half of the year. So that's one piece of it. Now similar to my opening remarks, as we look at the remaining price/mix net of raws benefit, we do see it flowing evenly across the back half of the year. So when you look at the third quarter and the fourth quarter, to get to our full year guide of the $75 million year-over-year, we see about a 4% decrease in raws in the third quarter, getting to more like down 1% or 2% in the fourth quarter.

How do we bring our innovation and technology with those fitments working with the OEMs. And then looking at what the replacement cycle is, with a target as you know, on the early replacements. As we look at -- I think it was Slide 6 in our deck, you can see that the mix is moving up 17-inch and above from 49% up to 73% of total. And what it says is, most of those, maybe I shouldn't say most, that's maybe too specific. I don't have the number here. But those tires, those vehicles, I should say, out there with the high SAAR that we see still haven't come to first replacement yet. So we feel really good about those vehicles, those light trucks and SUVs, which, as you know, are the top-selling vehicles in the U.S. are going to be coming in for replacements as we look to the future. So not only do we feel good today and in the past relative to these, we feel pretty good about where that market is going to be in the future.

One, I mean you are correct, with a white winter, excuse me -- we, as well as the industry, would, no doubt, sell more tires, I think from our -- from a high we're down, I think, well over 20% from where a ""white winter"" would have industry volumes. So definitely that would be an increase to our volume. And our share in there, our tires, our products in there performed very well. So that certainly would help us in a significant way. I'll also remind you because we haven't had one of these in the while, there is a sell-in season that's going on now for winter tires, and we feel again pretty good about that because the channels are not as full as they have been in the past. But you also have a situation where you are making those tires early. So as we said, we're planning for a green winter, we're not planning for a white winter, that's for inventory and cost purposes. But we are keeping the ability and the flexibility to try to make more of those tires should we get into a white winter and be able to catch up those. So that's part of our strategy. I would say, the second thing, just in general on EMEA volumes, what you're also seeing there is sort of an intentional mix shift toward us not just going volume for volume but looking at how we concentrate on HVA tires in both the OE and the replacement markets as well as in certain geographic markets and by also doing that and making investments to do that, we are also then not pursuing aggressively, not volume-for-volume's sake, some low-end tires that are just not a place where the Goodyear Dunlop brands can add value and where our value proposition doesn't play well . We see in Europe, just like we used to see in the U.S. and still do in some cases,  sort of 4 tires for $99, you see those same type of offerings in certain parts of Europe. That's not where we are going to play and it's not that where we can deliver the value that our investors -- excuse me, would expect from us. So that's playing into it as well."

We are continuing to manage as you'd expect.

So there's a market we will continue to be very active trying to get the value for our products in the marketplace. Other markets obviously have different stories. I'm not -- I won't go through everywhere like that, but I would say that the world around excess capacity, again I'll use Brazil in this example, where the OE business was down again about 20% in the quarter, we've got to be very vigilant in managing price/mix versus raw materials.

I think there's a couple of things that are happening as we sort of dissect this. And if we think about it, what we're still seeing and what we have seen for a while is sort of that consistent sellout. Remember, sellout tends to follow GDP over time. There can be dislocations, but sellout and GDP tend to be a pretty correlated thing over a period of time. What we're seeing right now, again, as Laura alluded to it, is really how tariffs have disrupted some of the RMA figures that are out there. So if I could walk you through a couple of things very quickly, and you can, I think refer back to Slide 5, that is in our deck. But remember, in the second half of '14, you had a really big pre-buy ahead of the tariffs coming into the market. What that did was in Q1 '15, if you remember we said in the last quarter, we had a pretty easy comp, because if you think about just behaviorally, the channel stopped buying as they bought a lot in the second half of '14. What they did in the second half of '15 -- or excuse me, the second quarter of '15 will start to restock again. And as they did that, our Q2 '15 to Q2 '16 comp became tougher. So you see, on a gross basis, a little growth happening, but it's really again all because of imports coming in and the volumes at the low end of the market. And I think, Laura also made the comment, or I made the comment that you're going to see that continue in the month of July because it's actually the highest comp of the year where you saw a lot of this restocking going on in the channel. So I'd have you think about, if I could maybe put that part a little more succinctly, tariffs really do distort the industry as we go. Those tariffs really impact the low end of the market, which is not where we play, it's not where we focus. We're focusing on that 17-inch and above. And 17-inch and above, as we showed you, we saw in Q1 and Q2, that market grew 10% and 7% using the U.S.A. numbers of the industry. So I think you are actually seeing good growth in that part of the market where you don't see it distorted by the tariffs. So that's a -- that 's one element of it.  The second element of it, I would say, we look at it, vehicle miles traveled, gasoline usage, the SAAR, everything's pretty good. But you have to remember we kind of say all vehicle miles traveled aren't created equal. So you have a lot of new cars on the road, I think I mentioned this earlier, that really haven't coming from the first replacement yet. So you got a lot of new cars that are continuing to drive those vehicle miles traveled. And you also have to remember RMA numbers are based on sell-in, not sell-out, where vehicle miles traveled would be rubber burning on the road, which would be more akin to a sell-out number, not a sell-in number. So when you have all those distortions happening with the channel on sell-in because of tariffs, you see this sort of, at the moment, dislocation between sell-in and sell-out or said in another way, what the RMA's reporting what was actually happening  out in the marketplace. So we would think those 2 things are going to come together, as we get some consistency, in terms of comps over time. And we'd say, we're really very pleased at what's happening, because the market of 17-inch and above, or HVA, we use at 17-inch and above to sort of highlight this in the slides, the HVA markets are really moving in a very positive way. And, as I said earlier, that's something we feel really good about it, particularly as we look out to the future. Because those haven't hit replacement market yet. Our issue is we just got to keep making more of those tires. So, long story, but hopefully that helps."

And then, again as we talked about and guided to, frankly, for the second quarter, we did have in the Americas a cost headwind of just about $30 million, and we called that out so you could model for that for the second quarter, but going forward, it -- every -- all of the cost is just built into the guidance, right. The cost-savings versus inflation, okay? So that's kind of when you look at the second quarter, that's really, the extra that hit in the second quarter that isn't there for the full year on our 10% to 15% or $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. Now, the $29 million as we said back in the first quarter is really some extra labor, it's engineering expense, it's really everything we've done to shift more and more to those more complex HVA tires, and that does add cost. But the margin with that, the benefit from that, more than offsets it."

This morning, I will review highlights from our second quarter, provide an update on the industry and the key markets in each of our regions and give my perspective on our business for the remainder of the year. Laura will follow with the financial review of each of our businesses and an update to our outlook before we open the call for your questions. 
In the second quarter, we delivered segment operating income of $531 million, reflecting strong performance across the company.  That's a second quarter record in our core segment operating income, which I'll remind you, excludes Venezuela from our 2015 base. Our operating performance helped drive a nearly 40% increase in our adjusted EPS of $1.16. Our second quarter was anchored by a 37% increase in operating income in our EMEA business unit. Our Asia Pacific business also continued its strong performance, with a nearly 10% increase in earnings. 
Combining this quarter with our record first quarter, our segment operating income for the first half of the year was $950 million, the highest first half ever for Goodyear. 
In addition, we delivered overall segment operating margin of 13.7% in the second quarter, an increase over last year. The Americas provided more than half of our SOI, and its underlying operations continue to remain solid. 
Furthermore, all 3 of our global businesses earned segment operating margins of more than 11.5%. Taken in total, our segment operating performance reflects the unwavering execution of our strategy, which has proved its strength even in volatile market conditions. 
Our consistent progress has resulted in steady earnings growth and positions us well for that growth to continue. I'd like to spend the next few minutes providing my perspective on each of our SBUs as well as my thoughts on the industry outlook for the remainder of the year.
The Americas, which as a reminder, now includes both our North America and Latin America businesses, delivered $291 million of operating income. As expected, its earnings were less than last year because of a few discrete items in the quarter. Laura will provide more detail on those items in her remarks. 
Nonetheless, the Americas' underlying business performance remains strong and continues to demonstrate the earnings power of the value proposition in our core business. Demand remained robust for our premium  HVA tires, and in particularly, in light truck and SUV. These segments take advantage of our strengths and continue to drive growth in mix in our U.S. business. 
We continue to see strong demand for our Wrangler DuraTrac and our Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure products. In addition, our fitments for passenger cars also performed very well in the quarter, specifically, our Eagle RSA, the Eagle F1 Asymmetric All-Season and the Assurance ComforTred. In broader industry terms, the underlying fundamentals in the U.S., such as miles driven, gasoline prices and fuel consumption, remain favorable. Americans used an average of almost 9.8 million barrels of gasoline a day in the 4 weeks ending July 1, the highest level since the Energy Information Administration started collecting weekly consumption data 35 years ago. 
Also, while the SAAR has moderated from its peak levels, SUV and light truck vehicle growth has increased 6% over the last 12 months. The OEs depend on the technology and the performance characteristics of Goodyear's high-value-added products for SUV and light truck fitments. And these are the type of platforms we target with our OE strategy, and it's working. 
The U.S. replacement industry data on the whole, however, reflected softer volumes in the second quarter compared to a year ago. As we've outlined on Slide 6, this decline was primarily as a result of a higher-than-normal level of imports in the second quarter of last year. You'll recall imports were abnormally low in the first quarter of 2015, following the announcement of the U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. The situation was exacerbated by a port strike, making product flow difficult for many importers. 
As a result, the second quarter of 2015 saw about 15 million more imported tires than the first quarter. And separately, we've seen some destocking at the dealer and distributor level for some broader market products this quarter. Our view is that this excess inventory was concentrated towards the lower end of the market in the economy and mid-tier segments.
If we take a step back from the quarter, the year-to-date industry sell-in for consumer replacement is up 1%. What's important to note is that within that growth is an increase in rim sizes of 17-inch or greater of 9%. Since the SAAR recovery began in 2010, we've seen several years of growth in OE with a mix shift to those premium tires. Rim size of 17-inch or greater grew from 49% of the OE market in 2009 to 73% in 2013. We're seeing the benefit of that mix shift in the replacement market as well. Tire sizes of 17-inch and greater grew 10% and 7% in the first and second quarter, respectively. And we're outperforming in this portion of the market. Goodyear brand -- the Goodyear brand nearly doubled the industry in growth in 17-inch and greater rim sizes in the second quarter. This is exactly what our OE strategy was designed to do. As you know, we've been investing in our U.S. plants to increase our capability to supply more premium HVA tires. Some of that investment has been in CapEx, and some in engineering and shifts in production within our existing footprint. We're continuing to increase our capability to grow in this profitable segment.
Looking ahead, we expect that the overall U.S. industry will remain weak in July as a result of the highest import comparable from all of 2015. In the intermediate to longer term, we continue to feel very confident about the fundamentals in the U.S., and continue to expect strong demand for our HVA products.
Turning now to Brazil. Economic conditions there remain challenging during the quarter. Industry shipments and consumer replacement were down about 2%, and OE continued its steep decline. Despite the macroeconomic headwinds, Brazil's profit contribution was once again positive in the quarter. We feel very good about our ability to drive growth and mix in HVA segment in Brazil over the long term, and while the economy -- excuse me, while the economic recovery isn't around the corner, we believe that we're well positioned in the marketplace when it does occur. And we do believe that it will occur.
Now shifting to Europe. Our EMEA business unit delivered $148 million in operating income during the second quarter. That's a 37% increase, driven by strong volume in both consumer OE and replacement. Industry sell-in remained healthy during the second quarter, especially in OE, which was driven by higher-production levels in Western Europe. New passenger car registration grew for the 34th month in a row in June, posting growth of more than 9% in the first half of the year.
European auto companies' preference for premium, large-rim diameter HVA tires, including Goodyear's high-performance lines, are driving mix up in OE and later on in replacement across the region. 
And we're delivering award-winning products to meet that demand. We recently launched the new Eagle F1 Asymmetric 3 Ultra-High Performance tire, an industry-leading product for Europe's growing OE market. The new member of the Eagle family was tested by leading organizations and outperformed other brands in both dry and wet conditions as well as in durability, leading to demand pull from our premium OE customers across the region.
In EMEA consumer replacement, we saw strong growth in our SUV and light truck segments, as Goodyear-branded summer tires, particularly, EfficientGrip SUV tires, claimed the top spot in several important magazine tests. As we look to the second half of the year, we are again taking a measured approach to winter tire sales based on the warmer weather we've seen in the region over the past several years. Although the winter inventory situation is more balanced heading into the sell-in season versus last year. Our plan is based on a green winter, and weather aside, our products are positioned to win in the marketplace. The strength of our winter tire portfolio, combined with an attractive value proposition for our customers, has us well positioned to make the most out of the winter industry [indiscernible].
Finally, as you know, we've been focused on our cost initiatives in EMEA, and improvements in this area also contributed to the region's earnings in the quarter. With the economic uncertainties surrounding Brexit and its impact in Europe in the intermediate and longer term, we will remain both agile and diligent on cost actions in this changing market.
In Asia Pacific, we achieved record segment operating income of $92 million, with volume growth of 21%. Our unit volumes were up 4%, excluding the impact of our newly reacquired Japanese replacement business. As we've seen in prior quarters, volume growth was robust in our China consumer business, but there was further deterioration in Australia due to the ongoing challenges in the country. 
China had a strong second quarter with consumer tire volume growth of 8% and double-digit growth in the SUV and light truck segments. We've had success in both OE and replacement and winning new Chinese OE accounts and in strong execution of sell-through programs, building upon our expanding service and retail network there. 
Consistent with our strategy, we grew in Asia Pacific with the right mix of products. As an example, Asia Pacific scored product wins with the Sport Maxx high-performance tire, which was awarded best-in-class in the 2016 MOTOR Magazine tire test. Sport Maxx outperformed its competition in all 5 of the tested performance attributes, beating the competing tires by the biggest margin in 8 years. Designed for a wide range of high-performance vehicles, our innovative products are driving demand in the region. 
We remain very optimistic about the long-term value proposition of our business in Asia Pacific. Our new product introductions, growing OE relationships and increasing points of distribution, give us confidence that we will continue to be successful and grow in this important market.
Looking back at our global businesses in the second quarter and over the first half, I'm very pleased with our record results, which were driven by strong demand in premium HVA products across our regions. The Goodyear brand and our value proposition continues to be a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Goodyear's value proposition has many elements, including a trusted iconic global brand, industry-leading products, diverse distribution channels capable of responding to customer requirements, strong customer relationships, particularly, at the OEMs and an unwavering focus on the consumer. 
Our teams have made the commitment to winning with consumers and helping our customers build their businesses every day, while taking the long view of creating sustainable value. Our first half results demonstrate that, and we are focused on execution across our markets by pursuing profitable volume in share in segments where the Goodyear brand as a differentiator. 
We are committed to our target of 10% to 15% annual growth or $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion of segment operating income in 2016. We look forward to discussing emerging trends in our industry and our strategic plans for the future as part of our Investor Day on September 15.
Now I'll turn the call over to Laura."

Today, I will cover our second quarter results and provide more detail on key income drivers in the quarter. I'll also provide an update regarding our full year outlook for 2016 before we open the call up for your questions.
Turning to the income statement on Slide 8. You will see our results for the second quarter. Consistent with our presentation in April, we have provided call-outs that highlight the effect of deconsolidating Venezuela. Looking at the income statement items, as reported for the second quarter, the sales comparison to prior year was negatively impacted by the deconsolidation of Venezuela, which had $115 million of net sales in the second quarter of 2015. 
Similarly, other tire-related revenues were lower by $86 million, driven by the 2015 sale of the North American motorcycle business. Additionally, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies reduced sales by $84 million year-over-year.
Our gross margins were stable at 27.5%, and segment operating margin increased 50 basis points in the quarter. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, SOI margin increased 1 full point. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.75. Our results were influenced by certain significant items. Adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $1.16. I'll note that our segment operating income in the quarter was impacted by a $24 million unfavorable, out-of-period adjustment related to the elimination of intercompany profit in the Americas region. The correction is related primarily to 2012 to 2015 prior-period financials, with the majority attributable to 2012. This amount is included as a significant item in the adjusted net income.
Turning to the step chart on Slide 9, which walks second quarter 2015 segment operating income to second quarter 2016. After adjusting for the $36 million impact of Venezuela, our 2015 core SOI was $514 million. The benefit of higher volume in the second quarter and higher-production levels in the first quarter drove an overall improvement of $21 million. 
Lower raw material costs of $49 million more than offset reduced price mix of $44 million for a net benefit of $5 million during the quarter. Cost-savings actions of $66 million, driven by our operational excellence initiatives, more than offset the negative impact of inflation, delivering a net benefit of $33 million.
Foreign currency exchange was a headwind of $10 million, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly, against the Argentine peso, the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real. Other was lower by $8 million, and includes a $14 million impact of the divestiture of our North American motorcycle business, which was partially offset by lower incentive compensation of $10 million. 
In summary, we achieved another record quarter with growth in core SOI of 3%. Excluding the impact of the out-of-period adjustment, our core SOI was $555 million and growth was 8%.
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1.1 billion. Net debt is up versus year-end, which reflects the normal working capital seasonality in our business. Versus the prior year period, the increase includes the impact of Venezuela's deconsolidation. Free cash flow from operations is shown on Slide 11. For the quarter, we generated $99 million of cash. Working capital was the use of $75 million of cash and in line with the typical seasonality of our business. Additionally, cash flow from operating activities was $261 million for the 3 months ended June 30.
Now let's move to the business units on Slide 12. The Americas generated segment operating income of $291 million in the second quarter or 13.9% to sales. The year-over-year decline in SOI is more than explained by several noteworthy items that total $79 million. 
First, the $36 million impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela. Second, the $24 million out-of-period adjustments, primarily related to 2012. And third, a $19 million impact from the sale of GDTNA business last year. 
The Americas also saw higher conversion costs in the quarter, due to additional engineering activities and a shift in production to increase our supply of HVA tires. Despite these headwinds, our core business in the Americas continues to be strong. The execution of our strategy enables us to continue to realize positive price mix performance. Customers are demanding more of our HVA tires, particularly, premium SUV and light truck tires. Unit sales in the second quarter were $18.8 million or down 6% versus 2015. In OE, our unit volume decreased by 900,000 units. The sale of GDTNA, which included sales of Dunlop-branded tires to Japanese OEMs in the U.S., explains almost half of the decline, and we also saw OE declines in both Brazil and in the U.S. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, our replacement volume was flat.
In summary, and despite several notable headwinds within the Americas region, the underlying performance is solid. The quarter also offers proof of our margin sustainability. Excluding the out-of-period adjustment, the Americas achieved SOI margin that was higher than last year. We accomplished this margin improvement in markets that were softer and with significantly lower raw material tailwinds. This performance is validation of the strength of our strategy, products and the Goodyear brand in the marketplace.
Turning to Slide 13. Europe, Middle East and Africa continued to deliver positive results with segment operating income of $148 million in the quarter, up 37% compared to prior year. This was the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth, driven by higher production and sales volumes throughout the region as well as our continued focus on cost-savings initiatives. Volume was up more than 4% compared to last year, and was driven by growth in both consumer OE and replacement channels. Strong demand for Goodyear products resulted in an 8% increase in consumer OE units, and consumer replacement volumes were up almost 3% in the quarter. 
Winter industry demand also increased more than 10% year-on-year in the quarter, evidence of channel inventories being more normalized this year. 
Our commercial truck business also continues to deliver consistent results, with volumes up almost 4% in the quarter. Our EMEA business delivered very strong performance in the second quarter of 2016. We remain confident in our team, our product portfolio and in our ability to deliver sustainable revenue and profit growth.
Turning to Slide 14. Asia Pacific delivered record second quarter segment operating income of $92 million, an $8 million improvement versus last year. The main drivers continue to be strong volume growth and the benefit of lower raw material costs, which were partially offset by a lower price mix, and increased SAG expenses related to our recently acquired replacement business in Japan. Our segment operating margin in the region increased to 17.4%, up from 17.1% a year ago. Asia-Pacific volume was 7.3 million tire units representing a 20% -- 21% growth versus last year. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of the Japanese replacement tire business, the remaining volume growth is primarily attributable to our 8% consumer tire growth in China, one of our largest and fastest-growing markets in the region. 
Additionally, the ASEAN countries saw a 6.5% growth across our business, which was partially offset by lower volume in Australia. We are well positioned in Asia-Pacific and continue to be excited about the long-term growth and opportunities there.
Turning now to Slide 15. I'll cover our full year modeling assumptions for 2016. In summary, our full year outlook and SOI income drivers remain unchanged from our April call. We continue to target $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion in SOI in 2016. With moderating raw material costs since April, we now expect raw material costs to be about 4% lower than last year before cost-savings actions. We continue to see our full year price mix versus raw material benefit at around $75 million, unchanged from our earlier outlook. We expect third quarter raw materials to be down about 4% based on current spot rate. The remaining price mix net of raw materials benefit should flow evenly across the back half of the year.
In cost savings versus inflation, we continue to expect a benefit of $135 million for the full year. The remaining net cost savings are expected to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter.
Regarding foreign currency translation, we continue to expect a headwind of approximately $45 million. While current spot rates would imply a slightly more favorable outcome, currencies remain volatile. The divested North America motorcycle business will have a negative $10 million impact year-over-year for the third quarter.
Additional financial assumptions for 2016 are listed on Slide 16. Our income tax rate has been lowered to about 28% of global pretax operating profit, following our experience to date. Cash taxes remain at 10% to 15% of global pretax operating profit.
And finally, we repurchased $100 million of shares during the second quarter. We've repurchased $563 million so far under our existing $1.1 billion share repurchase authorization and we remain committed to repurchasing additional shares through 2016 and early 2017.

I'm glad you focused on it, because we were pretty pleased with the way Europe delivered in the quarter. And I might take just 2 seconds to give you a view on how we think about Europe overall.

And I might take just 2 seconds to give you a view on how we think about Europe overall. We still view it as really a fantastic market despite some of the ongoing, let's say, unsolved economic issues that still linger over there. Remember, the market is growing there, particularly in 17-inch and above, particularly, that when you compare it to 16-inch and below, where you're not seeing nearly as much growth and sometimes, it can even be viewed as flat depending on the market. We see the market still demanding excellent technology, driven by the OEMs. We really love the carpark that still sits in Europe there. So we look at it as a great market and add to it than then seasonal market as you bring in winter tires and the winter tire -- the winter summer switch, really a robust market for us. The biggest headwind we still see there, as we've talked about in the past, is the ongoing sort of movement of low-end Asian tires, particularly in through Eastern Europe that has and probably will continue to cause a headwind and again, it's an example of when tariffs go up in one region, those tires typically move to somewhere else, you may remember in the past, they went down to South America as those economies slowed and currencies depreciated, tariffs are back in the U.S., now they're in Eastern Europe. So that's a continued headwind for us over there. But our goal is to continue to drive mix, continue to align our distribution consistent with our strategy over there. Our focus will be on new products and leveraging our brands, and to the point you made, continuing to focus on our cost actions over there. So I would say that we've made an improvement in Europe. We would expect those cost improvements to stick with us. I would say, we're only on the front end of fixing our European business over the long term. Our goal is to do some of the same things we've done in North America in Europe as well, and we feel very good about that. But that's probably not a direct, straight line either. So as we fight off the low-cost tires coming into the East, that actually has a negative impact on our mix in Europe, that hides some of the positive impact we're getting on the 17-inch and above. So I guess, overall, I would say, we would expect strong results in Europe as we look to '16 and out into '17.  I would expect that you'll still see some significant cost actions there as we move ahead, as we look at our production over there. And Jean-Claude Kihn and the team over there are very focused on cost, day-to-day cost as well as structural cost to reduce the fixed cost of that business going forward. So I feel good, and I would say, we're on the front end of what we expect."

On the cadence for price/mix less raw materials, obviously, we've seen oil somewhat creep up sequentially, but still be down year-over-year. As we think about the go-forward if raw materials do continue to hold the levels where they are and end up increasing year-over-year, how do you expect the P&L to flow for price/mix less raws as raw materials increase and then possible prices are passed on to consumers. Because -- the reason I ask is one of the larger questions or pushback that I'll get from investors is really just on the industry being able to be price-disciplined, and if there's going to be 1 quarter or 2, or 0.5 year to 3/4 of a year where the tire manufacturers are essentially caught with increasing raw material costs without adding in or passing on those price increases. And as you look at 2Q results with only a price/mix less raw materials of positive $5 million versus the first quarter of about $38 million and you start to question what's going to change in the back half of the year that's going to maintain that positive price/mix over raw materials if -- in the event that we had the second quarter really being eaten away in a favorable raw material environment?"

So for the one short answer is price/mix versus raw, obviously a big piece of that is mix. And there are some things we're doing in the business that result in a much stronger mix as we get into the second half of the year. So that's one piece of it. Now similar to my opening remarks, as we look at the remaining price/mix net of raws benefit, we do see it flowing evenly across the back half of the year. So when you look at the third quarter and the fourth quarter, to get to our full year guide of the $75 million year-over-year, we see about a 4% decrease in raws in the third quarter, getting to more like down 1% or 2% in the fourth quarter.

How do we bring our innovation and technology with those fitments working with the OEMs. And then looking at what the replacement cycle is, with a target as you know, on the early replacements. As we look at -- I think it was Slide 6 in our deck, you can see that the mix is moving up 17-inch and above from 49% up to 73% of total. And what it says is, most of those, maybe I shouldn't say most, that's maybe too specific. I don't have the number here. But those tires, those vehicles, I should say, out there with the high SAAR that we see still haven't come to first replacement yet.

So definitely that would be an increase to our volume. And our share in there, our tires, our products in there performed very well. So that certainly would help us in a significant way. I'll also remind you because we haven't had one of these in the while, there is a sell-in season that's going on now for winter tires, and we feel again pretty good about that because the channels are not as full as they have been in the past. But you also have a situation where you are making those tires early. So as we said, we're planning for a green winter, we're not planning for a white winter, that's for inventory and cost purposes. But we are keeping the ability and the flexibility to try to make more of those tires should we get into a white winter and be able to catch up those. So that's part of our strategy. I would say, the second thing, just in general on EMEA volumes, what you're also seeing there is sort of an intentional mix shift toward us not just going volume for volume but looking at how we concentrate on HVA tires in both the OE and the replacement markets as well as in certain geographic markets and by also doing that and making investments to do that, we are also then not pursuing aggressively, not volume-for-volume's sake, some low-end tires that are just not a place where the Goodyear Dunlop brands can add value and where our value proposition doesn't play well . We see in Europe, just like we used to see in the U.S. and still do in some cases,  sort of 4 tires for $99, you see those same type of offerings in certain parts of Europe. That's not where we are going to play and it's not that where we can deliver the value that our investors -- excuse me, would expect from us. So that's playing into it as well."

I think there's a couple of things that are happening as we sort of dissect this.

I think there's a couple of things that are happening as we sort of dissect this. And if we think about it, what we're still seeing and what we have seen for a while is sort of that consistent sellout. Remember, sellout tends to follow GDP over time. There can be dislocations, but sellout and GDP tend to be a pretty correlated thing over a period of time. What we're seeing right now, again, as Laura alluded to it, is really how tariffs have disrupted some of the RMA figures that are out there. So if I could walk you through a couple of things very quickly, and you can, I think refer back to Slide 5, that is in our deck. But remember, in the second half of '14, you had a really big pre-buy ahead of the tariffs coming into the market. What that did was in Q1 '15, if you remember we said in the last quarter, we had a pretty easy comp, because if you think about just behaviorally, the channel stopped buying as they bought a lot in the second half of '14. What they did in the second half of '15 -- or excuse me, the second quarter of '15 will start to restock again. And as they did that, our Q2 '15 to Q2 '16 comp became tougher. So you see, on a gross basis, a little growth happening, but it's really again all because of imports coming in and the volumes at the low end of the market. And I think, Laura also made the comment, or I made the comment that you're going to see that continue in the month of July because it's actually the highest comp of the year where you saw a lot of this restocking going on in the channel. So I'd have you think about, if I could maybe put that part a little more succinctly, tariffs really do distort the industry as we go. Those tariffs really impact the low end of the market, which is not where we play, it's not where we focus. We're focusing on that 17-inch and above. And 17-inch and above, as we showed you, we saw in Q1 and Q2, that market grew 10% and 7% using the U.S.A. numbers of the industry. So I think you are actually seeing good growth in that part of the market where you don't see it distorted by the tariffs. So that's a -- that 's one element of it.  The second element of it, I would say, we look at it, vehicle miles traveled, gasoline usage, the SAAR, everything's pretty good. But you have to remember we kind of say all vehicle miles traveled aren't created equal. So you have a lot of new cars on the road, I think I mentioned this earlier, that really haven't coming from the first replacement yet. So you got a lot of new cars that are continuing to drive those vehicle miles traveled. And you also have to remember RMA numbers are based on sell-in, not sell-out, where vehicle miles traveled would be rubber burning on the road, which would be more akin to a sell-out number, not a sell-in number. So when you have all those distortions happening with the channel on sell-in because of tariffs, you see this sort of, at the moment, dislocation between sell-in and sell-out or said in another way, what the RMA's reporting what was actually happening  out in the marketplace. So we would think those 2 things are going to come together, as we get some consistency, in terms of comps over time. And we'd say, we're really very pleased at what's happening, because the market of 17-inch and above, or HVA, we use at 17-inch and above to sort of highlight this in the slides, the HVA markets are really moving in a very positive way. And, as I said earlier, that's something we feel really good about it, particularly as we look out to the future. Because those haven't hit replacement market yet. Our issue is we just got to keep making more of those tires. So, long story, but hopefully that helps."

And then, again as we talked about and guided to, frankly, for the second quarter, we did have in the Americas a cost headwind of just about $30 million, and we called that out so you could model for that for the second quarter, but going forward, it -- every -- all of the cost is just built into the guidance, right. The cost-savings versus inflation, okay? So that's kind of when you look at the second quarter, that's really, the extra that hit in the second quarter that isn't there for the full year on our 10% to 15% or $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. Now, the $29 million as we said back in the first quarter is really some extra labor, it's engineering expense, it's really everything we've done to shift more and more to those more complex HVA tires, and that does add cost. But the margin with that, the benefit from that, more than offsets it."

As always, Laura will follow with a detailed financial report before opening the call for your questions. 
Our third quarter results were highlighted by continued growth in segment operating margin. All 3 of our global businesses achieved operating margins above 12%, led by our Asia Pacific business, which delivered 18.3% operating margin. In addition, our year-to-date core segment operating income grew to a record 9-month level. We delivered global segment operating margin of 14.5% for the quarter in a more challenging overall industry environment, particularly in our U.S. commercial truck tire business. 
This performance demonstrates the strength of our value proposition and our sustainability of margin growth in our business. As we discussed at our September Investor Day, our strategy is built to take advantage of the trends shaping our industry. Global demand for high-value-added large rim-diameter tires is increasing. And we believe that our portfolio of these products plus our connected business model position us on a path to sustained growth and competitive advantage. 
I'm also very pleased with the decisions we're making in our business units to drive and stay on our strategy. We continue to have opportunities to pursue short-term volume increases but recognize that these opportunities are in unprofitable parts of the market that are not growing. In other words, any potential near-term gains would fall outside our long-term strategy. The value of a strategy is in its consistent execution, regardless of industry and internal conditions. At Goodyear, we are committed to consistent execution of our strategy. 
Now during the third quarter and particularly late in the quarter, we experienced some headwinds to our plan. In addition to generally weaker overall industry conditions, 3 specific items affected our third quarter results and our expectations for the fourth quarter. I'll comment on each this morning. First, as a result of the challenging market conditions and lower volumes in our U.S. commercial truck tire business, we experienced higher conversion costs in the quarter. Second, we saw increased competition and deterioration in the pricing environment in EMEA, specifically in the smaller than 17-inch rim diameter consumer tire segment of the market. And third, there was incremental weakness in our OTR business consistent with what you're seeing in the mining industry. 
While these distinct items had a near-term impact on our results, the headwinds do not detract from our value proposition in the market or our ability to execute our long-term plan and achieve our 2020 targets. In fact, we made strong progress in the quarter in our targeted market segments that we reviewed with you at our September Investor Meeting. 
I'd like to address each of our business units, starting with the Americas. Our third quarter segment operating income was a solid $305 million and segment operating margin was strong at 14.7%. Even so, our results were lower than expected. To recap what we saw in the quarter, I'll depart from the usual flow of my review and begin with our U.S. commercial truck tire business, given its impact on this quarter. 
The U.S. commercial truck industry continues to be affected by weak OE volumes and the impact of tariffs on Chinese imports in the replacement market. The current industry environment in heavy truck, especially new truck production, continues to be challenging. Net orders for North America Class 8 trucks were down 29% in September alone and 39% year-to-date. In addition to this trend, an impact in the quarter related to a specific commercial OE customer exacerbated the weakness in the overall market. 
As you would expect, in response to the lower OE demand and to better manage our inventory, we reduced our production levels further during the quarter. The resulting increase in unabsorbed overhead in turn caused unexpected third quarter period costs, given the already lower utilization in our factories. Our outlook also includes additional ticket cuts to be made in the month of October. 
So the weakness in the OE segment, coupled with the prebuy associated with the expected tariff on Chinese truck tires, have created a short-term supply/demand imbalance in the marketplace. You recall a similar prebuy imbalance related to the tariff impact on consumer replacement tires as well. We expect the supply/demand imbalance to improve over the next several quarters. And we are confident in the strength of our portfolio of Goodyear Dunlop and our value-oriented Kelly brands, together with our industry-leading service network that offer our customers the right tires for their specific needs. Paired with our industry-leading fleet solutions business model, our commercial truck tire business remains competitively advantaged in reducing operating costs for our fleet customers in any economic environment. 
Now during my time at Goodyear, we have experienced volatility in the commercial truck OE industry before. For example, we saw a spike in new truck purchases triggered by pending emission regulations and mandatory engine changes. We've managed through these and similar circumstances in the past and know from experience that the demand imbalance always turns around. We expect this time to be no different. 
Switching now to the Americas consumer business. We saw robust margin expansion with strong mix up in both the U.S. and Brazil. Consumer margins in the Americas were up 200 basis points in the quarter, driven by growth in the 17-inch and larger segment in the U.S. Industry growth in these premium tires was 8% in the quarter, outpacing growth in overall market by nearly 3x. And as was the case last quarter, Goodyear outperformed the market growth in this segment. This remains a proof point of the soundness of our strategy. 
However, across the broader consumer replacement market, we've continued to see some destocking at the dealer and distributor level and a sluggish retail environment. As a result, we now expect the U.S. replacement industry to be up only modestly at 1% for the full year. Regardless, we remain bullish on the mix of trend and supply/demand situation for tires that are 17 inches and larger. That market remains robust. 
The underlying fundamentals in our industry, particularly miles driven, gasoline prices and fuel consumption remain strong. Vehicle miles traveled increased by a record 3.4% in August and is a strong indicator of the immediate-term demand. While the broader market consumer tire selling trends did not afford us an opportunity to offset headwinds in our commercial truck tire business this quarter, we expect more favorable demand in the consumer replacement market in the future. 
As I have said many times, we are not pursuing volume for volume's sake. Our team remains disciplined in our approach as we pursue profitable volume growth. The demand for our premium, high-value-added tires and replacement is still strong, and we continue to be challenged to fully satisfy market demand. We continue to be focused on increasing our capability and managing our production cost to increase our supply of the right tires for this demand for the balance of 2016 and into 2017. This remains our #1 priority. 
So overall, the Americas underlying consumer business performance remains robust and demonstrates the earnings power of the value proposition in our core business. And with the San Luis Potosí factory coming online in late 2017, we are on track to increase our supply of 17-inch and larger tires as this market continues to grow. 
Turning now to EMEA. We delivered stable segment operating income and year-over-year margin expansion of 70 basis points despite a weaker and more competitive industry environment. The European consumer replacement industry was flat in the quarter, driven by slight increases in summer and slight decreases in winter segments. The winter industry was down 1% as we have continued to see dealers and distributors delay winter purchases. Despite a very low comparable from last year's green winter sell-in, industry winter volumes in Europe were down 3% in the month of September. The winter segment did see robust growth in the 17-inch and larger segment, which was more than offset by a decline in smaller sizes. 
In the summer replacement industry, however, increased competition, including a continued presence of imported Chinese tires particularly in Eastern Europe, led to year-over-year volume declines in the quarter in our less than 17-inch segment of the market. In that environment, we didn't chase volume for volume's sake. We stuck to our mix-up strategy to capture the value of the Goodyear brand for us and for our customers, consistent with our objective to pursue profitable growth. 
As you recall from our Investor Day presentation, we expect global growth in the 17-inch and larger portion of the market at 15% through 2020, more than 3x the long-term industry growth rate of 4%. That's the opportunity. Now at the same time, we see the market for 16-inch and smaller tires to be increasingly oversupplied and less profitable. That shift implies declining growth, increased competition and overall tougher industry environment for the smaller sizes over the same period of time. 
Though we saw the effect of these factors on the summer tire segment already this quarter, our 2020 plan contemplated this impact and included corresponding actions we would take to address our presence and competitiveness in this part of the market. Our plan includes taking the necessary steps to shift our resources and reduce our exposure to declining less profitable market segments as evidenced by our footprint action we announced earlier this week in Philippsburg, Germany. This is one of the restructuring steps required to execute our 2020 plan and is at the core of what we believe is needed to recalibrate our EMEA business to the more profitable segments of the market. This is among the difficult but necessary decisions that will be required to execute our plan. And we are committed to do just that. 
As we have demonstrated continually over the past decade, we will reduce cost while investing in our business to grow. We are confident that our lineup of high-value-added large-rim diameter tires will enable us to meet the increasing demand in the industry's most profitable high-growth segments. We continue to have complete confidence in our strategy and we won't compromise our long-term value proposition in the marketplace. 
In Asia Pacific, our third quarter segment operating income was a record $99 million, an increase of 38% from last year's performance. In addition, segment operating margin was 18%. Our unit volumes were up 12%, excluding the impact of the new Japanese replacement business. China had an outstanding quarter as volumes increased more than 25% versus the prior year. Once again, our growth was broad-based as consumer OE was up 30% and consumer replacement volumes increased about 20%. On a year-to-date basis, our volume growth in China is about twice that of the industry. 
Similarly, we saw above-market growth in India in the quarter of nearly 9%. Our performance across these and other countries is driving share gains for our entire Asia Pacific region. We're very pleased with our results in Asia Pacific and we're consistently building our foundation to enable continued long-term growth in the region. We'll continue driving new product introductions, OE pull-through and build-out of our distribution network to support sustainable long-term growth. 
Reflecting on our 2016 targets. Clearly, we have experienced short-term obstacles in our markets. You saw in our press release this morning that we have revised our 2016 segment operating income targets to be between $2 billion and $2.25 billion. As I've said, the tire industry does not move in a straight line. Our team is prepared to deal with that volatility and will continue to be focused on long-term economic value creation in our business. In light of the progress we've made over the past several years, I'm pleased with the resilience of our margins despite the recent turbulence affecting our business. Achieving this stability is perhaps the best indication of the strength of our strategy and the changes we've made to Goodyear's business over the past several years. 
The headwinds we are experiencing this year do not track from our value proposition in the market or our ability to execute on our long-term plan. We continue to see our view of the industry mega trends being reaffirmed as the demand for 17-inch and larger tires remains robust. We know that we're in a very competitive tire industry, and there will be occasional obstacles and distractions that will challenge our focus. 
Winning in the global tire business will require hard work, agility and discipline. But I am absolutely confident in our commitment to executing our strategy. And we will continue our progress toward our 2020 target of $3 billion in segment operating income and $3.5 billion to $4 billion in returns to shareholders as part of our 2017 to 2020 capital allocation plan. We are as focused as ever on working on behalf of our customers by being the industry's innovation leader, being first with customers, being the leader in profitable segments of the market, and as a result, being a company that continuously drives sustainable value.

I'll also cover updates to our 2016 outlook before we open the call up for your questions. 
Turning to the income statement on Slide 8. And as in prior quarters, we have provided call-outs that highlight the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela. Our unit volume excluding Venezuela was about flat year-over-year as growth in Asia Pacific was offset by declines in Americas and EMEA. The deconsolidation of Venezuela reduced net sales by $155 million. In addition, lower volume negatively impacted revenues by $73 million. 
Other tire-related revenues were lower by $59 million, driven by the 2015 sale of the North American motorcycle business. Our gross margin increased to 28.9% and segment operating margin increased to 14.5% in the quarter. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $1.19. Our results were influenced by certain significant items. Adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $1.17, which represents an 18% increase versus last year. 
Turning to the step chart on Slide 9, which walks third quarter 2015 segment operating income to third quarter 2016. The negative impact of lower volume and production was $25 million. Lower raw material costs of $41 million more than offset reduced price/mix of $38 million for a net benefit of $3 million. Cost saving actions of $93 million, driven by our operational excellence initiatives, more than offset the $33 million negative impact of inflation, delivering a net benefit of $60 million. Foreign currency exchange was a slight headwind of $5 million, reflecting the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the British pound. 
Other was lower by $40 million, which was driven by the following 3 factors: first, a $14 million impact from the sale of our North American motorcycle business, bringing the full-year impact to $30 million; second, our commercial tire and service centers negatively impacted the quarter by $10 million, reflecting the more difficult environment for the commercial truck business in the U.S.; and third, lower earnings in our third-party chemical business, driven by the receipt of a royalty payment last year. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were about $1 billion. Total debt is down more than $200 million from the second quarter and net debt is down slightly as well. The increase in net debt versus year-end reflects the normal working capital seasonality in our business. The increase in net debt versus the prior year period includes the impact of Venezuela's deconsolidation. 
Free cash flow from operations is shown on Slide 11. For the quarter, we generated $150 million of cash. Working capital was a use of $264 million and in line with the typical third quarter seasonality of our business. Additionally, cash flow from operating activities was $357 million in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 12. The Americas business generated segment operating income of $305 million in the third quarter or 14.7% of sales. The year-over-year decline in SOI is more than explained by 3 factors: first, a $43 million impact from lower commercial truck demand, including higher conversion and period costs related to unabsorbed overhead and the impact on our commercial tire and service centers; second, a $39 million impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela; and third, a $16 million impact from the sale of the GDTNA business last year. 
Unit sales in the third quarter were $18.6 million or down 8% versus 2015. The negative impact of Venezuela and the sale of GDTNA together was about 600,000 units. Excluding these impacts, U.S. consumer volumes were about flat and U.S. commercial shipments were down 12%. The remainder of the unit volume decline was driven by lower consumer OE and replacement volume in Brazil and Canada. In summary, and despite several notable headwinds, the Americas region, particularly the underlying performance of our U.S. consumer business, which saw 200 basis points of margin improvement, remains sound. 
Turning to Slide 13. Europe, Middle East and Africa generated segment operating income of $152 million in the quarter. Segment operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 12.3%, primarily driven by our continued focus on cost efficiencies. This benefit was offset by the impact of lower volume in the quarter. Overall, EMEA unit volumes declined 4.5% year-over-year. EMEA's OE unit volume was down 8%. We began the quarter with lower expectations for our OE unit volume, following choices we've made consistent with our OE selectivity strategy and our intensifying focus on the more profitable 17-inch and larger rim-sized fitments. This impact was amplified by reduced demand as one of our customers experienced a supply disruption and lower-than-planned production during the quarter. 
Replacement tire shipments were down 3%, which is more than explained by increased competition at the lower end of the market in our summer consumer business, all in less than 17-inch rim diameter products. We have seen mild weather across Europe in October and continued to take a cautious approach on volume expectations for the remainder of the year. That said, the strength of our winter product portfolio has us well positioned to drive future business and win in our targeted market segments. As Rich mentioned, we are executing plans to realign our EMEA manufacturing footprint to enable growth in profitable market segments while building a foundation to deliver sustainable earnings. We are confident about the region's long-term growth opportunities and remain committed to that long-term growth. 
Turning to Slide 14. Asia Pacific delivered record third quarter segment operating income of $99 million, a $27 million improvement versus last year with the main driver continuing to be strong volume growth. Our segment operating margin in the region increased to 18.3%, up from 15.7% a year ago. Asia Pacific's volume was 8 million tire units, representing 33% growth versus last year. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of the Japanese replacement tire business, the remaining volume growth is primarily attributable to our key markets in China and India. We are well positioned in Asia Pacific and continue to be excited about the long-term growth opportunities there. 
Turning now to Slide 15. We have updated our full year SOI drivers. Overall, we now expect volume growth of 1% to 2% for the year and our unabsorbed overhead benefit has been updated to about $20 million. Fourth quarter unit volume will be about flat year-over-year as we expect continued pressure in a weaker environment in Brazil and in the less than 17-inch rim diameter summer segment in EMEA. Raw material costs were unchanged versus our prior outlook at down 4% for the year, although our net price/mix versus raw material cost benefit has been updated to approximately a $55 million benefit. This includes the impact of a more difficult commercial truck industry environment in the U.S. 
Reflecting our strong cost performance in the third quarter, our cost savings is revised up to about $150 million for the year. Our fourth quarter net cost savings will include a $30 million headwind for favorable adjustments to our general and product liability accruals last year. Regarding foreign currency translation, we now expect a headwind of approximately $25 million based on current spot rates. The final update in other reflects a weaker environment for our other tire-related businesses, particularly the U.S. commercial tire and service centers. This driver now reflects an additional $10 million headwind for the year. Our full year SOI guidance totals $2 billion to $2.25 billion for 2016. 
Additional financial assumptions for 2016 are listed on Slide 16. We have tightened the range for interest expense, which is now expected to be $360 million to $375 million for the full year. The next change is a slight increase in working capital, which is now expected to be a use of approximately $100 million. We expect CapEx to be about $1 billion, which was at the low end of the range we provided in July. 
Finally, I'll cover updates on our capital allocation plan. We repurchased $50 million of stock during the third quarter. We've repurchased $613 million so far under our existing $1.1 billion share repurchase authorization and $200 million year-to-date. We plan to purchase about $500 million in total for the year, which leaves about $300 million that we expect to complete over the balance of the year. Finally, we remain committed to our 2017 to 2020 capital allocation plan and our 2020 target of $3 billion in SOI. The temporary weakness we are seeing in our commercial business will not impact our ability to deliver on our long-term plan. 
With our announcement to close the Phillipsburg, Germany facility, we will use $165 million to $190 million of our 2017 to 2020 restructuring basket. The majority of this cash is expected as an outflow in 2018. The plant has 6 million units of capacity today, primarily in the less than 17-inch market. As part of our restructuring plan, we will reallocate production of the larger, more profitable sizes to existing facilities within our footprint at a lower cost. This action further enables our focus on high-value segments of the market while continuing to reduce our exposure to a declining market. 
Now we'll open the call up for your questions."

I understand that the supply/demand dynamic is going to be really good in the greater than 17-inch tire market. But you are calling out a few markets obviously that are relatively weak. Could you just give us some context on your exposure to the less than 17-inch tire market and how you see that kind of playing into your strategy of offsetting raw material costs with pricing?"

I guess the first thing that I would tell you sort of unequivocally, we don't view that there's any change to the upside to the trend of 17-inch or greater that we talked about. We still believe -- and I know you know these numbers, but we see almost a 4x increase in 17-inch and above versus the normal market. So that situation, a full stop, is exactly the same of what we see. And the question of what does that mean, you're relating that back a little bit to sort of the volume price/mix versus raw material equation. And particularly in light of -- I think you're right to call out some raw material headwinds coming in, in 2017. I would tell you, Rod, we have a track record even before we had sort of the tailwind of the 17-inch and above market coming in to manage volume price/mix effectively. And we would intend to do the same moving forward. I can tell you, I'm very pleased in the quarter even with the discipline that the businesses have had. I made reference to this in my comments as well. On the lower end of the market, particularly in Europe, we stuck to our value proposition and we stuck to our strategy and we didn't choose volume for volume's sake. We stuck to the value proposition. And you might be right to assume we lost a little volume in doing that. But it's the right thing to do in that part of the market that's declining, that's crowded, that's increasingly unprofitable, less profitable, I'll say, and getting more competitive as we go. So we stuck to our guns. That's what we're going to do. And we married that up also with a footprint action to give us the flexibility to take these actions going forward. So very pleased with the discipline there. And I can also tell you, even in the quarter, on the 17-inch and above market, I won't go into different markets here, but we actually increased our pricing and our value proposition even in the quarter in doing that. And you see that coming through, broadly speaking, in the margin improvements that we had both in North America and in EMEA. So as we look at this, I would say we don't see any change in what we talked about in September. We don't see any difference in terms of the opportunities that we see. And if anything, Rod, I would tell you we're really focused on accelerating the change in Europe as we move ahead. And accelerating it means exposing ourselves to having to take certain decisions courageously in terms of dealing with some of the segments of the market that we don't want to play in. And that's exactly what we're going to do. We know how to do it, and it's exactly what we're going to do going forward. So I'll just pause there for a moment, Rod."

And in total, I would say Europe today is roundabout, I think, approaching 30% of our total business is that 17-inch and above. You have to remember that the middle part of the market, which includes some below 17-inch tires, there's still a lot of tires that we have. And some of that business is very profitable as well. So we will continue to drive that business, but we're also going to continue to reduce our exposure to that going forward. That will -- some of that will actually move into 2017 as we do that. But again, the right decision for us is we take the capacity out and as we continue to mix up and change over that capacity to make 17-inch and above."

When you look at the first quarter of '17, that certainly will have headwinds because raws were so low in the first quarter of 2016. Now we'll get into exact percents and so on as we get to the February call, as we always do. But I'll just continue to point out, I think at Investor Day, we showed a couple of charts where historically, I think it was over the last 5 years, there is always RMIs that come into play a particular quarter or so. But we have been able to do that whether -- to manage through that, whether raw materials were increasing or decreasing."

It's the essence of the positive market that we see. Again, I'd go back, and if I could elaborate a bit, remember the starts with OE, which is where we're getting these fitments, and then if I could even point you back, you don't have to look at it now, but I think it's on Page 55 of what Stephen McClellan reviewed in the Investor Meeting. He showed a diagram that showed roundabout a 10-year period for the OE -- percentage OE of our business at 17-inch and above to sort of make its way into the replacement business, given the 2- to 3- to 4-year change of those tires going forward. We see that trend happening very fast. And that's the upside. That's the positive nature of what we have and that's where the supply/demand equation still sits in favor of ourselves as we move forward. That also says that as we migrate through that, we still sell a lot of our below 17-inch tires. And some of those certainly at a profit. So I don't want to leave you with the view that we're not selling any of those. As you know, that's still a big size of the market in total, but we are increasingly shifting over to the large rim-diameter tires. And I know you know this, but remember, even though they're still smaller volumes, the margins are higher and our driving what we have in our results. The 16 inch and below, increasingly crowded oversupply, declining literally competing against hundreds of brands and there are particularly some of the Asian brands coming into Europe as we've talked about in the past. So as we address that proactively, we won't exit it immediately, but we'll continue to mix up and that's what the margin profile is going to come. It's would say 8 which had a we have and industry as we look to the future. So hopefully that helped a little bit, Rod."

As I tried to articulate in my remarks, I mean, I think if you look at our commercial business, we really sort of had these 3 elements that impacted us in the quarter. One was, frankly, we had a weakness in consumer -- or Commercial OE volume, new trucks. We saw trucks down, I think 29% in the quarter, and just to be at the little bit of clarity and transparency on it, we tend to -- when we see those, we manage our inventory, we take production out. As we took that production out, what happened to us is when we go through our unabsorbed overhead calculations as part of our accounting policies, as you take that volume out, we can trip a number which was, again, very candidly unexpected where instead of that unabsorbed overhead or lower factory utilization turning up as a product cost and then being released to cost of sale when the tire is sold, it effectively gets recorded in the period that we take the production cuts in this case in September. So that was an issue that hit us in the quarter. Then we had a specific customer issue where we're, again, I won't elaborate on, but will say we're sticking to our value proposition as we go. And then we had, frankly, just lower volumes. This one is very hard to predict, but we had significant increases in the pre-buys ahead of the tariff and commercial truck tires. I think we had non-RMA members in the U.S. were up, I think 35% in Q1, I think 74% in Q2 and down 23% in Q3. And frankly, that's really hard to predict those pre-volume numbers as we go. And remember, that's in an industry where sort of ton, miles and the way to measure weight is, let's just say relatively flat and not up. So dealing with that also had an impact in the quarter. Again, a little bit harder to predict. But this is something we've seen before. Dealers have loaded up on truck tires, that means there's a little shelf space, but that will work its way through. Our products are leading in the industry. Our fleet solutions model continues to be very strong. That will work its way through it. It will take care of itself as we go forward and we're working through a distortion. Unfortunately, and again, just to be very transparent about it, that did have an impact on us in the quarter. So that was one of the things I would say. The OTR -- OTR did hit us, but that was a little bit more of the cyclicality of the mining industry. It wouldn't be what you're referring to, which I do remember about a year or so ago."

And Christina or Laura will correct me, our percentage of OE there is about 60%, it's higher than it is in other regions and that's because when we went to set up our business there, it started out as essentially all an OE business. And that therefore, that mix it still tends to way towards OE. That will sort of rectify over time. I would say a couple of things. One, the industry was still very strong, particularly the OE industry. I'd also point out that the OE industry in China does have volatility to it as well, but it was very strong right now. And what we've done over there is very consciously try to create, I would say, or creating a business model that's branded, that's focused on 17-inch and above larger rim-diameter tires and also focusing in getting the right vehicles to have that pull through. We've also created a network of stores, of distribution points that we manage very consciously. It's easy to open a lot of outlets and then have to close them later. Frankly, we've encountered that in the past, but we're very methodically managing our distribution channels over there and using digital and using other tools to reach those consumers. So our China business, from a brand, from a product, from a mix, from a customer base is very strong. And obviously, we know the growth is in Asia and in China, so we're very positive on that. And I think as we said in the September investor meeting, we're planning on increasing our capacity at our factory. And I won't elaborate here, we also increased -- announced capacity increases in India as well.

So there is one of the headwinds that we're facing in the fourth quarter that caused us to change the outlook. So that will continue. How long it takes the truck product to work through the shelves of the distribution, that's a harder one to call. But we know that will happen just as it happened with the consumer side, so it doesn't concern me. It's a question of when, not if. And then the larger question of what happens in 2017, I think that's largely going to be what happens from an industry perspective. And I think as we look to our guidance for 2017, we'll let you know. OE, new truck production, as I've mentioned, I think down 29%, I think it was in the quarter and 39% and 38% year-to-date. So that will change. I mean, David, one thing il tell you about the truck industry, having done this a while, you get to a feast or famine and, right now, we have the new truck production down. It will come back as we move ahead. Engine changes, whatever it is, we have pre-buys and pullouts. So it will come back. I'm very confident on that. But as we look to '17, I would say we'll wait till we get to the fourth quarter call and we'll be in a position to give you, in addition, a better guidance on that."

What we had to do is what we have to do to reach those -- the 2020 targets to make $20 million more in 17-inch and above tires. That is at the core of what we have to go do. And if you say what's on my mind every day and what will be driving the team to, it's actually that. And that means mixing up in making more the right tires in North America where you know we've been a little bit short supplied. We have to make the right tires at the right cost, no change from what we've been saying and no change from what we have to do. In EMEA, again, very -- trying to be very candid with you. We saw the replacement market decrease about 8% in September alone. We are out there trying to capture the value of our brand, the value of our value proposition in the marketplace. We stuck to our guns. We did not pursue volume for volume's sake as we're looking to mix up. And we've taken the actions, as Laura said, we couldn't necessarily talk about at the September meeting to be able to address our switch from mixing up to the higher end of the market. That kind of came through a bit more in September. Even then we thought, frankly, we didn't anticipate a market decrease in summer like that. The markets in Europe are a little difficult. We also said we planned on another green winter, but we actually saw winter volumes down again in September off of a week last year. So Europe, a little bit even tougher than we saw, but that's the tire business. That's okay. We're sticking to our guns and driving our strategy. So I would say really nothing has changed. In fact, if we peel back, if we don't get to that detail, if we look at our 17-inch and above business, if you want to just stay to that, in North America, very strong, in Europe, very strong, in Asia, very strong. So I would say those teams are moving ahead. And if again, I say what happened between now and September 15, the commercial business I went through, sort of walked you through what happened there, not happy with it, frankly. But it is what it is. And part of that was the volume recognition. And then volume recognition on our unabsorbed overhead accounting, I should say. Europe was our migration forward. And frankly, that is the strategy and we're going to be aggressive in doing that. And then we -- we did have a little bit of an OTR headwind, but I mean, I'm not going to say that's a difference maker. That's more on the periphery of what we have to say. So higher raw material costs going into '17. We'll have some of the SLP startup costs coming into '17. We won't get that until latter half of '17 when we get the units out of that. As others have mentioned, I guess, I just said it, the higher raw material cost going in. Those are some headwinds we're going to see. We're going to see some of the production cut hang over go into the first quarter as well. But we also know we've got tailwind on the 17-inch and above market. Asia continues to be very strong and these are..."

This morning, I'll cover updates to our industry and our 2016 plan since we last spoke at our Investor Day meeting in Boston, then I'll briefly discuss each of our regional businesses. As always, Laura will follow with a detailed financial report before opening the call for your questions. 
Our third quarter results were highlighted by continued growth in segment operating margin. All 3 of our global businesses achieved operating margins above 12%, led by our Asia Pacific business, which delivered 18.3% operating margin. In addition, our year-to-date core segment operating income grew to a record 9-month level. We delivered global segment operating margin of 14.5% for the quarter in a more challenging overall industry environment, particularly in our U.S. commercial truck tire business. 
This performance demonstrates the strength of our value proposition and our sustainability of margin growth in our business. As we discussed at our September Investor Day, our strategy is built to take advantage of the trends shaping our industry. Global demand for high-value-added large rim-diameter tires is increasing. And we believe that our portfolio of these products plus our connected business model position us on a path to sustained growth and competitive advantage. 
I'm also very pleased with the decisions we're making in our business units to drive and stay on our strategy. We continue to have opportunities to pursue short-term volume increases but recognize that these opportunities are in unprofitable parts of the market that are not growing. In other words, any potential near-term gains would fall outside our long-term strategy. The value of a strategy is in its consistent execution, regardless of industry and internal conditions. At Goodyear, we are committed to consistent execution of our strategy. 
Now during the third quarter and particularly late in the quarter, we experienced some headwinds to our plan. In addition to generally weaker overall industry conditions, 3 specific items affected our third quarter results and our expectations for the fourth quarter. I'll comment on each this morning. First, as a result of the challenging market conditions and lower volumes in our U.S. commercial truck tire business, we experienced higher conversion costs in the quarter. Second, we saw increased competition and deterioration in the pricing environment in EMEA, specifically in the smaller than 17-inch rim diameter consumer tire segment of the market. And third, there was incremental weakness in our OTR business consistent with what you're seeing in the mining industry. 
While these distinct items had a near-term impact on our results, the headwinds do not detract from our value proposition in the market or our ability to execute our long-term plan and achieve our 2020 targets. In fact, we made strong progress in the quarter in our targeted market segments that we reviewed with you at our September investor meeting. 
I'd like to address each of our business units, starting with the Americas. Our third quarter segment operating income was a solid $305 million and segment operating margin was strong at 14.7%. Even so, our results were lower than expected. To recap what we saw in the quarter, I'll depart from the usual flow of my review and begin with our U.S. commercial truck tire business, given its impact on this quarter. 
The U.S. commercial truck industry continues to be affected by weak OE volumes and the impact of tariffs on Chinese imports in the replacement market. The current industry environment in heavy truck, especially new truck production, continues to be challenging. Net orders for North America Class 8 trucks were down 29% in September alone and 39% year-to-date. In addition to this trend, an impact in the quarter related to a specific commercial OE customer exacerbated the weakness in the overall market. 
As you would expect, in response to the lower OE demand and to better manage our inventory, we reduced our production levels further during the quarter. The resulting increase in unabsorbed overhead in turn caused unexpected third quarter period costs, given the already lower utilization in our factories. Our outlook also includes additional ticket cuts to be made in the month of October. 
So the weakness in the OE segment, coupled with the prebuy associated with the expected tariff on Chinese truck tires, have created a short-term supply/demand imbalance in the marketplace. You recall a similar prebuy imbalance related to the tariff impact on consumer replacement tires as well. We expect the supply/demand imbalance to improve over the next several quarters. And we are confident in the strength of our portfolio of Goodyear Dunlop and our value-oriented Kelly brands, together with our industry-leading service network that offer our customers the right tires for their specific needs. Paired with our industry-leading fleet solutions business model, our commercial truck tire business remains competitively advantaged in reducing operating costs for our fleet customers in any economic environment. 
Now during my time at Goodyear, we have experienced volatility in the commercial truck OE industry before. For example, we saw a spike in new truck purchases triggered by pending emission regulations and mandatory engine changes. We've managed through these and similar circumstances in the past and know from experience that the demand imbalance always turns around. We expect this time to be no different. 
Switching now to the Americas consumer business. We saw robust margin expansion with strong mix up in both the U.S. and Brazil. Consumer margins in the Americas were up 200 basis points in the quarter, driven by growth in the 17-inch and larger segment in the U.S. Industry growth in these premium tires was 8% in the quarter, outpacing growth in overall market by nearly 3x. And as was the case last quarter, Goodyear outperformed the market growth in this segment. This remains a proof point of the soundness of our strategy. 
However, across the broader consumer replacement market, we've continued to see some destocking at the dealer and distributor level and a sluggish retail environment. As a result, we now expect the U.S. replacement industry to be up only modestly at 1% for the full year. Regardless, we remain bullish on the mix of trend and supply/demand situation for tires that are 17 inches and larger. That market remains robust. 
The underlying fundamentals in our industry, particularly miles driven, gasoline prices and fuel consumption remain strong. Vehicle miles traveled increased by a record 3.4% in August and is a strong indicator of the immediate-term demand. While the broader market consumer tire selling trends did not afford us an opportunity to offset headwinds in our commercial truck tire business this quarter, we expect more favorable demand in the consumer replacement market in the future. 
As I have said many times, we are not pursuing volume for volume's sake. Our team remains disciplined in our approach as we pursue profitable volume growth. The demand for our premium, high-value-added tires and replacement is still strong, and we continue to be challenged to fully satisfy market demand. We continue to be focused on increasing our capability and managing our production cost to increase our supply of the right tires for this demand for the balance of 2016 and into 2017. This remains our #1 priority. 
So overall, the Americas underlying consumer business performance remains robust and demonstrates the earnings power of the value proposition in our core business. And with the San Luis Potosí factory coming online in late 2017, we are on track to increase our supply of 17-inch and larger tires as this market continues to grow. 
Turning now to EMEA. We delivered stable segment operating income and year-over-year margin expansion of 70 basis points despite a weaker and more competitive industry environment. The European consumer replacement industry was flat in the quarter, driven by slight increases in summer and slight decreases in winter segments. The winter industry was down 1% as we have continued to see dealers and distributors delay winter purchases. Despite a very low comparable from last year's green winter sell-in, industry winter volumes in Europe were down 3% in the month of September. The winter segment did see robust growth in the 17-inch and larger segment, which was more than offset by a decline in smaller sizes. 
In the summer replacement industry, however, increased competition, including a continued presence of imported Chinese tires particularly in Eastern Europe, led to year-over-year volume declines in the quarter in our less than 17-inch segment of the market. In that environment, we didn't chase volume for volume's sake. We stuck to our mix-up strategy to capture the value of the Goodyear brand for us and for our customers, consistent with our objective to pursue profitable growth. 
As you recall from our Investor Day presentation, we expect global growth in the 17-inch and larger portion of the market at 15% through 2020, more than 3x the long-term industry growth rate of 4%. That's the opportunity. Now at the same time, we see the market for 16-inch and smaller tires to be increasingly oversupplied and less profitable. That shift implies declining growth, increased competition and overall tougher industry environment for the smaller sizes over the same period of time. 
Though we saw the effect of these factors on the summer tire segment already this quarter, our 2020 plan contemplated this impact and included corresponding actions we would take to address our presence and competitiveness in this part of the market. Our plan includes taking the necessary steps to shift our resources and reduce our exposure to declining less profitable market segments as evidenced by our footprint action we announced earlier this week in Philippsburg, Germany. This is one of the restructuring steps required to execute our 2020 plan and is at the core of what we believe is needed to recalibrate our EMEA business to the more profitable segments of the market. This is among the difficult but necessary decisions that will be required to execute our plan. And we are committed to do just that. 
As we have demonstrated continually over the past decade, we will reduce cost while investing in our business to grow. We are confident that our lineup of high-value-added large-rim diameter tires will enable us to meet the increasing demand in the industry's most profitable high-growth segments. We continue to have complete confidence in our strategy and we won't compromise our long-term value proposition in the marketplace. 
In Asia Pacific, our third quarter segment operating income was a record $99 million, an increase of 38% from last year's performance. In addition, segment operating margin was 18%. Our unit volumes were up 12%, excluding the impact of the new Japanese replacement business. China had an outstanding quarter as volumes increased more than 25% versus the prior year. Once again, our growth was broad-based as consumer OE was up 30% and consumer replacement volumes increased about 20%. On a year-to-date basis, our volume growth in China is about twice that of the industry. 
Similarly, we saw above-market growth in India in the quarter of nearly 9%. Our performance across these and other countries is driving share gains for our entire Asia Pacific region. We're very pleased with our results in Asia Pacific and we're consistently building our foundation to enable continued long-term growth in the region. We'll continue driving new product introductions, OE pull-through and build-out of our distribution network to support sustainable long-term growth. 
Reflecting on our 2016 targets. Clearly, we have experienced short-term obstacles in our markets. You saw in our press release this morning that we have revised our 2016 segment operating income targets to be between $2 billion and $2.25 billion. As I've said, the tire industry does not move in a straight line. Our team is prepared to deal with that volatility and will continue to be focused on long-term economic value creation in our business. In light of the progress we've made over the past several years, I'm pleased with the resilience of our margins despite the recent turbulence affecting our business. Achieving this stability is perhaps the best indication of the strength of our strategy and the changes we've made to Goodyear's business over the past several years. 
The headwinds we are experiencing this year do not track from our value proposition in the market or our ability to execute on our long-term plan. We continue to see our view of the industry mega trends being reaffirmed as the demand for 17-inch and larger tires remains robust. We know that we're in a very competitive tire industry, and there will be occasional obstacles and distractions that will challenge our focus. 
Winning in the global tire business will require hard work, agility and discipline. But I am absolutely confident in our commitment to executing our strategy. And we will continue our progress toward our 2020 target of $3 billion in segment operating income and $3.5 billion to $4 billion in returns to shareholders as part of our 2017 to 2020 capital allocation plan. We are as focused as ever on working on behalf of our customers by being the industry's innovation leader, being first with customers, being the leader in profitable segments of the market, and as a result, being a company that continuously drives sustainable value. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Laura."

I'll also cover updates to our 2016 outlook before we open the call up for your questions. 
Turning to the income statement on Slide 8. And as in prior quarters, we have provided call-outs that highlight the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela. Our unit volume excluding Venezuela was about flat year-over-year as growth in Asia Pacific was offset by declines in Americas and EMEA. The deconsolidation of Venezuela reduced net sales by $155 million. In addition, lower volume negatively impacted revenues by $73 million. 
Other tire-related revenues were lower by $59 million, driven by the 2015 sale of the North American motorcycle business. Our gross margin increased to 28.9% and segment operating margin increased to 14.5% in the quarter. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $1.19. Our results were influenced by certain significant items. Adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $1.17, which represents an 18% increase versus last year. 
Turning to the step chart on Slide 9, which walks third quarter 2015 segment operating income to third quarter 2016. The negative impact of lower volume and production was $25 million. Lower raw material costs of $41 million more than offset reduced price/mix of $38 million for a net benefit of $3 million. Cost saving actions of $93 million, driven by our operational excellence initiatives, more than offset the $33 million negative impact of inflation, delivering a net benefit of $60 million. Foreign currency exchange was a slight headwind of $5 million, reflecting the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the British pound. 
Other was lower by $40 million, which was driven by the following 3 factors: first, a $14 million impact from the sale of our North American motorcycle business, bringing the full-year impact to $30 million; second, our commercial tire and service centers negatively impacted the quarter by $10 million, reflecting the more difficult environment for the commercial truck business in the U.S.; and third, lower earnings in our third-party chemical business, driven by the receipt of a royalty payment last year. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were about $1 billion. Total debt is down more than $200 million from the second quarter and net debt is down slightly as well. The increase in net debt versus year-end reflects the normal working capital seasonality in our business. The increase in net debt versus the prior year period includes the impact of Venezuela's deconsolidation. 
Free cash flow from operations is shown on Slide 11. For the quarter, we generated $150 million of cash. Working capital was a use of $264 million and in line with the typical third quarter seasonality of our business. Additionally, cash flow from operating activities was $357 million in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 12. The Americas business generated segment operating income of $305 million in the third quarter or 14.7% of sales. The year-over-year decline in SOI is more than explained by 3 factors: first, a $43 million impact from lower commercial truck demand, including higher conversion and period costs related to unabsorbed overhead and the impact on our commercial tire and service centers; second, a $39 million impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela; and third, a $16 million impact from the sale of the GDTNA business last year. 
Unit sales in the third quarter were $18.6 million or down 8% versus 2015. The negative impact of Venezuela and the sale of GDTNA together was about 600,000 units. Excluding these impacts, U.S. consumer volumes were about flat and U.S. commercial shipments were down 12%. The remainder of the unit volume decline was driven by lower consumer OE and replacement volume in Brazil and Canada. In summary, and despite several notable headwinds, the Americas region, particularly the underlying performance of our U.S. consumer business, which saw 200 basis points of margin improvement, remains sound. 
Turning to Slide 13. Europe, Middle East and Africa generated segment operating income of $152 million in the quarter. Segment operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 12.3%, primarily driven by our continued focus on cost efficiencies. This benefit was offset by the impact of lower volume in the quarter. Overall, EMEA unit volumes declined 4.5% year-over-year. EMEA's OE unit volume was down 8%. We began the quarter with lower expectations for our OE unit volume, following choices we've made consistent with our OE selectivity strategy and our intensifying focus on the more profitable 17-inch and larger rim-sized fitments. This impact was amplified by reduced demand as one of our customers experienced a supply disruption and lower-than-planned production during the quarter. 
Replacement tire shipments were down 3%, which is more than explained by increased competition at the lower end of the market in our summer consumer business, all in less than 17-inch rim diameter products. We have seen mild weather across Europe in October and continued to take a cautious approach on volume expectations for the remainder of the year. That said, the strength of our winter product portfolio has us well positioned to drive future business and win in our targeted market segments. As Rich mentioned, we are executing plans to realign our EMEA manufacturing footprint to enable growth in profitable market segments while building a foundation to deliver sustainable earnings. We are confident about the region's long-term growth opportunities and remain committed to that long-term growth. 
Turning to Slide 14. Asia Pacific delivered record third quarter segment operating income of $99 million, a $27 million improvement versus last year with the main driver continuing to be strong volume growth. Our segment operating margin in the region increased to 18.3%, up from 15.7% a year ago. Asia Pacific's volume was 8 million tire units, representing 33% growth versus last year. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of the Japanese replacement tire business, the remaining volume growth is primarily attributable to our key markets in China and India. We are well positioned in Asia Pacific and continue to be excited about the long-term growth opportunities there. 
Turning now to Slide 15. We have updated our full year SOI drivers. Overall, we now expect volume growth of 1% to 2% for the year and our unabsorbed overhead benefit has been updated to about $20 million. Fourth quarter unit volume will be about flat year-over-year as we expect continued pressure in a weaker environment in Brazil and in the less than 17-inch rim diameter summer segment in EMEA. Raw material costs were unchanged versus our prior outlook at down 4% for the year, although our net price/mix versus raw material cost benefit has been updated to approximately a $55 million benefit. This includes the impact of a more difficult commercial truck industry environment in the U.S. 
Reflecting our strong cost performance in the third quarter, our cost savings is revised up to about $150 million for the year. Our fourth quarter net cost savings will include a $30 million headwind for favorable adjustments to our general and product liability accruals last year. Regarding foreign currency translation, we now expect a headwind of approximately $25 million based on current spot rates. The final update in other reflects a weaker environment for our other tire-related businesses, particularly the U.S. commercial tire and service centers. This driver now reflects an additional $10 million headwind for the year. Our full year SOI guidance totals $2 billion to $2.25 billion for 2016. 
Additional financial assumptions for 2016 are listed on Slide 16. We have tightened the range for interest expense, which is now expected to be $360 million to $375 million for the full year. The next change is a slight increase in working capital, which is now expected to be a use of approximately $100 million. We expect CapEx to be about $1 billion, which was at the low end of the range we provided in July. 
Finally, I'll cover updates on our capital allocation plan. We repurchased $50 million of stock during the third quarter. We've repurchased $613 million so far under our existing $1.1 billion share repurchase authorization and $200 million year-to-date. We plan to purchase about $500 million in total for the year, which leaves about $300 million that we expect to complete over the balance of the year. Finally, we remain committed to our 2017 to 2020 capital allocation plan and our 2020 target of $3 billion in SOI. The temporary weakness we are seeing in our commercial business will not impact our ability to deliver on our long-term plan. 
With our announcement to close the Philippsburg, Germany facility, we will use $165 million to $190 million of our 2017 to 2020 restructuring basket. The majority of this cash is expected as an outflow in 2018. The plant has 6 million units of capacity today, primarily in the less than 17-inch market. As part of our restructuring plan, we will reallocate production of the larger, more profitable sizes to existing facilities within our footprint at a lower cost. This action further enables our focus on high-value segments of the market while continuing to reduce our exposure to a declining market. 
Now we'll open the call up for your questions."

I understand that the supply/demand dynamic is going to be really good in the greater than 17-inch tire market. But you are calling out a few markets obviously that are relatively weak. Could you just give us some context on your exposure to the less than 17-inch tire market and how you see that kind of playing into your strategy of offsetting raw material costs with pricing?"

I guess the first thing that I would tell you sort of unequivocally, we don't view that there's any change to the upside to the trend of 17-inch or greater that we talked about.

I guess the first thing that I would tell you sort of unequivocally, we don't view that there's any change to the upside to the trend of 17-inch or greater that we talked about. We still believe -- and I know you know these numbers, but we see almost a 4x increase in 17-inch and above versus the normal market. So that situation, a full stop, is exactly the same of what we see. And the question of what does that mean, you're relating that back a little bit to sort of the volume price/mix versus raw material equation. And particularly in light of -- I think you're right to call out some raw material headwinds coming in, in 2017. I would tell you, Rod, we have a track record even before we had sort of the tailwind of the 17-inch and above market coming in to manage volume price/mix effectively. And we would intend to do the same moving forward. I can tell you, I'm very pleased in the quarter even with the discipline that the businesses have had. I made reference to this in my comments as well. On the lower end of the market, particularly in Europe, we stuck to our value proposition and we stuck to our strategy and we didn't choose volume for volume's sake. We stuck to the value proposition. And you might be right to assume we lost a little volume in doing that. But it's the right thing to do in that part of the market that's declining, that's crowded, that's increasingly unprofitable, less profitable, I'll say, and getting more competitive as we go. So we stuck to our guns. That's what we're going to do. And we married that up also with a footprint action to give us the flexibility to take these actions going forward. So very pleased with the discipline there. And I can also tell you, even in the quarter, on the 17-inch and above market, I won't go into different markets here, but we actually increased our pricing and our value proposition even in the quarter in doing that. And you see that coming through, broadly speaking, in the margin improvements that we had both in North America and in EMEA. So as we look at this, I would say we don't see any change in what we talked about in September. We don't see any difference in terms of the opportunities that we see. And if anything, Rod, I would tell you we're really focused on accelerating the change in Europe as we move ahead. And accelerating it means exposing ourselves to having to take certain decisions courageously in terms of dealing with some of the segments of the market that we don't want to play in. And that's exactly what we're going to do. We know how to do it, and it's exactly what we're going to do going forward. So I'll just pause there for a moment, Rod."

When you look at the first quarter of '17, that certainly will have headwinds because raws were so low in the first quarter of 2016. Now we'll get into exact percents and so on as we get to the February call, as we always do. But I'll just continue to point out, I think at Investor Day, we showed a couple of charts where historically, I think it was over the last 5 years, there is always RMIs that come into play a particular quarter or so. But we have been able to do that whether -- to manage through that, whether raw materials were increasing or decreasing."

It's the essence of the positive market that we see. Again, I'd go back, and if I could elaborate a bit, remember the starts with OE, which is where we're getting these fitments, and then if I could even point you back, you don't have to look at it now, but I think it's on Page 55 of what Stephen McClellan reviewed in the investor meeting. He showed a diagram that showed roundabout a 10-year period for the OE -- percentage OE of our business at 17-inch and above to sort of make its way into the replacement business, given the 2- to 3- to 4-year change of those tires going forward. We see that trend happening very fast. And that's the upside. That's the positive nature of what we have and that's where the supply/demand equation still sits in favor of ourselves as we move forward. That also says that as we migrate through that, we still sell a lot of below 17-inch tires and some of those certainly at a profit. So I don't want to leave you with the view that we're not selling any of those. As you know, that's still a big size of the market in total. But we're increasingly shifting over to the larger-rim diameter tires. And I know you know this, but remember, even though they're smaller volumes, the margins are higher and are driving what we have in our results. The 16-inch and below, increasingly crowded, oversupplied, declining, literally competing against hundreds of brands in there, particularly some of the Asian brands coming into Europe, as we've talked about in the past. So as we address that proactively, we won't exit it immediately, but we'll continue to mix up. And that's where that margin profile is going to come. It's, I would say, a great trend that we have in the industry as we look to the future. So hopefully that helped a little bit, Rod."

As I tried to articulate in my remarks, I mean, I think if you look at our commercial business, we really sort of had these 3 elements that impacted us in the quarter. One was, frankly, we had a weakness in consumer -- or in commercial OE volume, new trucks. We saw trucks down, I think, 29% in the quarter. And just to be -- add a little bit of clarity and transparency on it, we tend to -- when we see those, we manage our inventory, we take production out. As we took that production out, what happened to us is when we go through our unabsorbed overhead calculations as part of our accounting policies, as you take that volume out, we can trip a number which was again very candidly unexpected, where instead of that unabsorbed overhead or lower factory utilization turning up as a product cost and then being released as cost of sale when the tire is sold, it effectively gets recorded in the period that we take the production cuts, in this case in September. So that was an issue that hit us in the quarter. Then we had a specific customer issue, where again I won't elaborate on but will say we're sticking to our value proposition as we go. And then we had frankly just lower volumes. This one is very hard to predict, but we had significant increases in the prebuys ahead of the tariff in commercial truck tires. I think we had non-RMI members in the U.S. were up, I think, 35% in Q1, I think 74% in Q2 and down 23% in Q3. And frankly, that's really hard to predict those prebuying numbers as we go. And remember, that's in an industry where sort of ton miles and the way to measure freight is, let's just say, relatively flat and not up. So dealing with that also had an impact in the quarter. Again, a little bit harder to predict. But this is something we've seen before. Dealers have loaded up on truck tires. That means there's a little shelf space. But that will work its way through. Our products are leading in the industry. Our fleet solutions model continues to be very strong. That will work its way through. It will take care of itself as we go forward. And we're working through a distortion. Unfortunately, and again just to be very transparent about it, that did have an impact on us in the quarter. So that was one of the things I would say. The OTR, OTR did hit us, but that was a little bit more of the cyclicality of the mining industry. It wouldn't be what you're referring to, which I do remember about a year or so ago."

And Christina or Laura will correct me, our percentage of OE there is about 60%. It's higher than it is in other regions. And that's because when we went to set up our business there, it started out as essentially all an OE business. And therefore, that mix still tends to weigh towards OE. That will sort of rectify over time. I would say a couple of things. One, the industry was still very strong, particularly the OE industry. I'd also point out that the OE industry in China does have volatility to it as well, but it was very strong right now. And what we've done over there is very consciously try to create, I would say, or are creating a business model that's branded, that's focused on 17-inch and above larger-rim diameter tires and also focusing on getting the right vehicles to have that pull-through. We've also created a network of stores -- of distribution points that we manage very consciously. It's easy to open a lot of outlets, and then have to close them later. Frankly, we've encountered that in the past. But we're very methodically managing our distribution channels over there and using digital and using other tools to reach those consumers. So our China business, from a brand, from a product, from a mix, from a customer basis is very strong. And obviously, we know the growth is in Asia and in China, so we're very positive on that. And I think as we said in the September investor meeting, we're planning on increasing our capacity at our Pulandian factory. And I won't elaborate here, we also increased -- announced capacity increases in India as well. So an area of the world that's growing, area of the world that people are continuing to drive, and we're positioning ourself well for it."

And I think as we look to our guidance for 2017, we'll let you know. OE, new truck production, as I mentioned, I think down 29%, I think it was in the quarter, and 39% or 38% year-to-date. So that will change. I mean, David, one thing I'll tell you about the truck industry, having done this a while, you get to a feast or famine. And right now, we have the new truck production down. It will come back as we move ahead. Engine changes, whatever it is, we have prebuys and falloffs. So it will come back, I'm very confident on that.

What we have to do is what we have to do to reach those -- the 2020 targets, make and sell 20 million more in 17-inch and above tires. That is at the core of what we have to go do. And if you say what's on my mind every day and what are we driving the team to, it's actually that. And that means mixing up and making more the right tires in North America, where you know we've been a little bit short-supplied. We have to make the right tires at the right cost. No change from what we've been saying and no change from what we have to do. In EMEA, again very -- trying to be very candid with you, we saw the replacement market decrease about 8% in September alone. We are out there trying to capture the value of our brand, the value of our value proposition in the marketplace. We stuck to our guns. We did not pursue volume for volume's sake as we're looking to mix up. And we've taken the actions, as Laura said, we couldn't necessarily talk about at the September meeting, to be able to address our switch from mixing up to the higher end of the market. That kind of came through a bit more in September even than we thought. Frankly, we didn't anticipate a market decrease in summer like that. The markets in Europe are a little difficult. We also said we planned on another green winter, but we actually saw winter volumes down again in September off of a week last year. So Europe, a little bit even tougher than we saw, but that's the tire business. That's okay. We're sticking to our guns and driving our strategy. So I would say really nothing has changed. In fact, if we peel back, if we don't get to that detail, if we look at our 17-inch and above business, if you want to just [indiscernible] into that, in North America, very strong, in Europe, very strong, in Asia, very strong. So I would say those themes are moving ahead. And if again I say what happened between now and -- September 15, the commercial business I went through, I sort of walked you through what happened there. I'm not happy with it, frankly, but it is what it is. And part of that was the volume recognition. And then volume recognition on our unabsorbed overhead accounting, I should say. Europe was our migration forward. And frankly, that is the strategy, and we're going to be aggressive in doing that. And then we did have a little bit of an OTR headwind. But I mean, I'm not going to say that's a difference maker. That's more on the periphery of what we have to say. So higher raw material costs going into '17. We'll have some of the SLP startup costs coming into '17. We won't get that until latter half of '17, when we get the units out of that. As others have mentioned, I guess, I just said it, the higher raw material cost going in. Those are some headwinds that we're going to see. We're going to see some of the production cut hangover go into the first quarter as well. But we also know we've got tailwind on the 17-inch and above market. Asia continues to be very strong.

As always, Laura will follow with a detailed financial report before opening the call for your questions. 
Our third quarter results were highlighted by continued growth in segment operating margin. All 3 of our global businesses achieved operating margins above 12%, led by our Asia Pacific business, which delivered 18.3% operating margin. In addition, our year-to-date core segment operating income grew to a record 9-month level. We delivered global segment operating margin of 14.5% for the quarter in a more challenging overall industry environment, particularly in our U.S. commercial truck tire business. 
This performance demonstrates the strength of our value proposition and our sustainability of margin growth in our business. As we discussed at our September Investor Day, our strategy is built to take advantage of the trends shaping our industry. Global demand for high-value-added large-rim diameter tires is increasing. And we believe that our portfolio of these products plus our connected business model position us on a path to sustained growth and competitive advantage. 
I'm also very pleased with the decisions we're making in our business units to drive and stay on our strategy. We continue to have opportunities to pursue short-term volume increases but recognize that these opportunities are in unprofitable parts of the market that are not growing. In other words, any potential near-term gains would fall outside our long-term strategy. The value of a strategy is in its consistent execution, regardless of industry and internal conditions. At Goodyear, we are committed to consistent execution of our strategy. 
Now during the third quarter and particularly late in the quarter, we experienced some headwinds to our plan. In addition to generally weaker overall industry conditions, 3 specific items affected our third quarter results and our expectations for the fourth quarter. I'll comment on each this morning. First, as a result of the challenging market conditions and lower volumes in our U.S. commercial truck tire business, we experienced higher conversion costs in the quarter. Second, we saw increased competition and deterioration in the pricing environment in EMEA, specifically in the smaller than 17-inch rim diameter consumer tire segment of the market. And third, there was incremental weakness in our OTR business consistent with what you're seeing in the mining industry. 
While these distinct items had a near-term impact on our results, the headwinds do not detract from our value proposition in the market or our ability to execute our long-term plan and achieve our 2020 targets. In fact, we made strong progress in the quarter in our targeted market segments that we reviewed with you at our September investor meeting. 
I'd like to address each of our business units, starting with the Americas. Our third quarter segment operating income was a solid $305 million and segment operating margin was strong at 14.7%. Even so, our results were lower than expected. To recap what we saw in the quarter, I'll depart from the usual flow of my review and begin with our U.S. commercial truck tire business, given its impact on this quarter. 
The U.S. commercial truck industry continues to be affected by weak OE volumes and the impact of tariffs on Chinese imports in the replacement market. The current industry environment in heavy truck, especially new truck production, continues to be challenging. Net orders for North America Class 8 trucks were down 29% in September alone and 39% year-to-date. In addition to this trend, an impact in the quarter related to a specific commercial OE customer exacerbated the weakness in the overall market. 
As you would expect, in response to the lower OE demand and to better manage our inventory, we reduced our production levels further during the quarter. The resulting increase in unabsorbed overhead in turn caused unexpected third quarter period costs, given the already lower utilization in our factories. Our outlook also includes additional ticket cuts to be made in the month of October. 
The weakness in the OE segment, coupled with the prebuy associated with the expected tariff on Chinese truck tires, have created a short-term supply/demand imbalance in the marketplace. You'll recall a similar prebuy imbalance related to the tariff impact on consumer replacement tires as well. We expect the supply/demand imbalance to improve over the next several quarters. And we are confident in the strength of our portfolio of Goodyear Dunlop and our value-oriented Kelly brands, together with our industry-leading service network that offer our customers the right tires for their specific needs. Paired with our industry-leading fleet solutions business model, our commercial truck tire business remains competitively advantaged in reducing operating costs for our fleet customers in any economic environment. 
Now during my time at Goodyear, we have experienced volatility in the commercial truck OE industry before. For example, we saw a spike in new truck purchases triggered by pending emission regulations and mandatory engine changes. We've managed through these and similar circumstances in the past and know from experience that the demand imbalance always turns around. We expect this time to be no different. 
Switching now to the Americas consumer business. We saw robust margin expansion with strong mix up in both the U.S. and Brazil. Consumer margins in the Americas were up 200 basis points in the quarter, driven by growth in the 17-inch and larger segment in the U.S. Industry growth in these premium tires was 8% in the quarter, outpacing growth in the overall market by nearly 3x. And as was the case last quarter, Goodyear outperformed the market growth in this segment. This remains a proof point of the soundness of our strategy. 
However, across the broader consumer replacement market, we've continued to see some destocking at the dealer and distributor level and a sluggish retail environment. As a result, we now expect the U.S. replacement industry to be up only modestly at 1% for the full year. Regardless, we remain bullish on the mix of trend and supply/demand situation for tires that are 17 inches and larger. That market remains robust. 
The underlying fundamentals in our industry, particularly miles driven, gasoline prices and fuel consumption remain strong. Vehicle miles traveled increased by a record 3.4% in August and is a strong indicator of the immediate-term demand. While the broader market consumer tire sell-in trends did not afford us an opportunity to offset headwinds in our commercial truck tire business this quarter, we expect more favorable demand in the consumer replacement market in the future. 
As I have said many times, we are not pursuing volume for volume's sake. Our team remains disciplined in our approach as we pursue profitable volume growth. The demand for our premium, high-value-added tires and replacement is still strong, and we continue to be challenged to fully satisfy market demand. We continue to be focused on increasing our capability and managing our production cost to increase our supply of the right tires for this demand for the balance of 2016 and into 2017. This remains our #1 priority. 
So overall, the Americas' underlying consumer business performance remains robust and demonstrates the earnings power of the value proposition in our core business. And with the San Luis Potosí factory coming online in late 2017, we are on track to increase our supply of 17-inch and larger tires as this market continues to grow. 
Turning now to EMEA. We delivered stable segment operating income and year-over-year margin expansion of 70 basis points despite a weaker and more competitive industry environment. The European consumer replacement industry was flat in the quarter, driven by slight increases in summer and slight decreases in winter segments. The winter industry was down 1% as we have continued to see dealers and distributors delay winter purchases. Despite a very low comparable from last year's green winter sell-in, industry winter volumes in Europe were down 3% in the month of September. The winter segment did see robust growth in the 17-inch and larger segment, which was more than offset by a decline in smaller sizes. 
In the summer replacement industry, however, increased competition, including a continued presence of imported Chinese tires particularly in Eastern Europe, led to year-over-year volume declines in the quarter in our less than 17-inch segment of the market. In that environment, we didn't chase volume for volume's sake. We stuck to our mix-up strategy to capture the value of the Goodyear brand for us and for our customers, consistent with our objective to pursue profitable growth. 
As you recall from our Investor Day presentation, we expect global growth in the 17-inch and larger portion of the market at 15% through 2020, more than 3x the long-term industry growth rate of 4%. That's the opportunity. Now at the same time, we see the market for 16-inch and smaller tires to be increasingly oversupplied and less profitable. That shift implies declining growth, increased competition and overall tougher industry environment for the smaller sizes over the same period of time. 
Though we saw the effect of these factors on the summer tire segment already this quarter, our 2020 plan contemplated this impact and included corresponding actions we would take to address our presence and competitiveness in this part of the market. Our plan includes taking the necessary steps to shift our resources and reduce our exposure to declining less profitable market segments as evidenced by our footprint action we announced earlier this week in Philippsburg, Germany. This is one of the restructuring steps required to execute our 2020 plan and is at the core of what we believe is needed to recalibrate our EMEA business to the more profitable segments of the market. This is among the difficult but necessary decisions that will be required to execute our plan, and we are committed to do just that. 
As we have demonstrated continually over the past decade, we will reduce costs while investing in our business to grow. We are confident that our lineup of high-value-added large-rim diameter tires will enable us to meet the increasing demand in the industry's most profitable high-growth segments. We continue to have complete confidence in our strategy and we won't compromise our long-term value proposition in the marketplace. 
In Asia Pacific, our third quarter segment operating income was a record $99 million, an increase of 38% from last year's performance. In addition, segment operating margin was 18%. Our unit volumes were up 12%, excluding the impact of the new Japanese replacement business. China had an outstanding quarter as volumes increased more than 25% versus the prior year. Once again, our growth was broad-based as consumer OE was up 30% and consumer replacement volume increased about 20%. On a year-to-date basis, our volume growth in China is about twice that of the industry. 
Similarly, we saw above-market growth in India in the quarter of nearly 9%. Our performance across these and other countries is driving share gains for our entire Asia Pacific region. We're very pleased with our results in Asia Pacific and we're consistently building our foundation to enable continued long-term growth in the region. We'll continue driving new product introductions, OE pull-through and build-out of our distribution network to support sustainable long-term growth. 
Reflecting on our 2016 targets. Clearly, we have experienced short-term obstacles in our markets. You saw in our press release this morning that we revised our 2016 segment operating income targets to be between $2 billion and $2.025 billion. As I've said, the tire industry does not move in a straight line. Our team is prepared to deal with that volatility and will continue to be focused on long-term economic value creation in our business. In light of the progress we've made over the past several years, I'm pleased with the resilience of our margins despite the recent turbulence affecting our business. Achieving this stability is perhaps the best indication of the strength of our strategy and the changes we've made to Goodyear's business over the past several years. 
The headwinds we are experiencing this year do not detract from our value proposition in the market or our ability to execute on our long-term plan. We continue to see our view of the industry mega trends being reaffirmed as the demand for 17-inch and larger tires remains robust. We know that we're in a very competitive tire industry, and there will be occasional obstacles and distractions that will challenge our focus. 
Winning in the global tire business will require hard work, agility and discipline. But I am absolutely confident in our commitment to executing our strategy. And we will continue our progress toward our 2020 target of $3 billion in segment operating income and $3.5 billion to $4 billion in returns to shareholders as part of our 2017 to 2020 capital allocation plan. We are as focused as ever on working on behalf of our customers by being the industry's innovation leader, being first with customers, being the leader in profitable segments of the market, and as a result, being a company that continuously drives sustainable value.

Turning to the income statement on Slide 8, and as in prior quarters, we have provided call-outs that highlight the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela. Our unit volume excluding Venezuela was about flat year-over-year as growth in Asia Pacific was offset by declines in Americas and EMEA. The deconsolidation of Venezuela reduced net sales by $155 million. In addition, lower volume negatively impacted revenues by $73 million. 
Other tire-related revenues were lower by $59 million, driven by the 2015 sale of the North American motorcycle business. Our gross margin increased to 28.9% and segment operating margin increased to 14.5% in the quarter. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $1.19. Our results were influenced by certain significant items. Adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $1.17, which represents an 18% increase versus last year. 
Turning to the step chart on Slide 9, which walks third quarter 2015 segment operating income to third quarter 2016. The negative impact of lower volume and production was $25 million. Lower raw material costs of $41 million more than offset reduced price/mix of $38 million for a net benefit of $3 million. Cost saving actions of $93 million, driven by our operational excellence initiatives, more than offset the $33 million negative impact of inflation, delivering a net benefit of $60 million. Foreign currency exchange was a slight headwind of $5 million, reflecting the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the British pound. 
Other was lower by $40 million, which was driven by the following 3 factors: first, a $14 million impact from the sale of our North American motorcycle business, bringing the full-year impact to $30 million; second, our commercial tire and service centers negatively impacted the quarter by $10 million, reflecting the more difficult environment for the commercial truck business in the U.S.; and third, lower earnings in our third-party chemical business, driven by the receipt of a royalty payment last year. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were about $1 billion. Total debt is down more than $200 million from the second quarter and net debt is down slightly as well. The increase in net debt versus year-end reflects the normal working capital seasonality in our business. The increase in net debt versus the prior year period includes the impact of Venezuela's deconsolidation. 
Free cash flow from operations is shown on Slide 11. For the quarter, we generated $150 million of cash. Working capital was a use of $264 million and in line with the typical third quarter seasonality of our business. Additionally, cash flow from operating activities was $357 million in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 12. The Americas business generated segment operating income of $305 million in the third quarter or 14.7% of sales. The year-over-year decline in SOI is more than explained by 3 factors: first, a $43 million impact from lower commercial truck demand, including higher conversion and period costs related to unabsorbed overhead and the impact on our commercial tire and service centers; second, a $39 million impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela; and third, a $16 million impact from the sale of the GDTNA business last year. 
Unit sales in the third quarter were $18.6 million or down 8% versus 2015. The negative impact of Venezuela and the sale of GDTNA together was about 600,000 units. Excluding these impacts, U.S. consumer volumes were about flat and U.S. commercial shipments were down 12%. The remainder of the unit volume decline was driven by lower consumer OE and replacement volume in Brazil and Canada. 
In summary, and despite several notable headwinds, the Americas region, particularly the underlying performance of our U.S. consumer business, which saw 200 basis points of margin improvement, remains sound. 
Turning to Slide 13. Europe, Middle East and Africa generated segment operating income of $152 million in the quarter. Segment operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 12.3%, primarily driven by our continued focus on cost efficiencies. This benefit was offset by the impact of lower volume in the quarter. Overall, EMEA unit volumes declined 4.5% year-over-year. EMEA's OE unit volume was down 8%. We began the quarter with lower expectations for our OE unit volume, following choices we've made consistent with our OE selectivity strategy and our intensifying focus on the more profitable 17-inch and larger rim-sized fitments. This impact was amplified by reduced demand as one of our customers experienced a supply disruption and lower-than-planned production during the quarter. 
Replacement tire shipments were down 3%, which is more than explained by increased competition at the lower end of the market in our summer consumer business, all in less than 17-inch rim diameter products. We have seen mild weather across Europe in October and continue to take a cautious approach on volume expectations for the remainder of the year. That said, the strength of our winter product portfolio has us well positioned to drive future business and win in our targeted market segments. As Rich mentioned, we are executing plans to realign our EMEA manufacturing footprint to enable growth in profitable market segments while building a foundation to deliver sustainable earnings. We are confident about the region's long-term growth opportunities and remain committed to that long-term growth. 
Turning to Slide 14. Asia Pacific delivered record third quarter segment operating income of $99 million, a $27 million improvement versus last year with the main driver continuing to be strong volume growth. Our segment operating margin in the region increased to 18.3%, up from 15.7% a year ago. Asia Pacific's volume was 8 million tire units, representing 33% growth versus last year. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of the Japanese replacement tire business, the remaining volume growth is primarily attributable to our key markets in China and India. We are well positioned in Asia Pacific and continue to be excited about the long-term growth opportunities there. 
Turning now to Slide 15. We have updated our full year SOI drivers. Overall, we now expect volume growth of 1% to 2% for the year and our unabsorbed overhead benefit has been updated to about $20 million. Fourth quarter unit volume will be about flat year-over-year as we expect continued pressure in a weaker environment in Brazil and in the less than 17-inch rim diameter summer segment in EMEA. Raw material costs were unchanged versus our prior outlook at down 4% for the year, although our net price/mix versus raw material cost benefit has been updated to approximately a $55 million benefit. This includes the impact of a more difficult commercial truck industry environment in the U.S. 
Reflecting our strong cost performance in the third quarter, our cost savings is revised up to about $150 million for the year. Our fourth quarter net cost savings will include a $30 million headwind for favorable adjustments to our general and product liability accruals last year. Regarding foreign currency translation, we now expect a headwind of approximately $25 million based on current spot rates. The final update in other reflects a weaker environment for our other tire-related businesses, particularly the U.S. commercial tire and service centers. This driver now reflects an additional $10 million headwind for the year. Our full year SOI guidance totals $2 billion to $2.025 billion for 2016. 
Additional financial assumptions for 2016 are listed on Slide 16. We have tightened the range for interest expense, which is now expected to be $360 million to $375 million for the full year. The next change is a slight increase in working capital, which is now expected to be a use of approximately $100 million. We expect CapEx to be about $1 billion, which was the low end of the range we provided in July. 
Finally, I'll cover updates on our capital allocation plan. We repurchased $50 million of stock during the third quarter. We've repurchased $613 million so far under our existing $1.1 billion share repurchase authorization and $200 million year-to-date. We plan to purchase about $500 million in total for the year, which leaves about $300 million that we expect to complete over the balance of the year. Finally, we remain committed to our 2017 to 2020 capital allocation plan and our 2020 target of $3 billion in SOI. The temporary weakness we are seeing in our commercial business will not impact our ability to deliver on our long-term plan. 
With our announcement to close the Philippsburg, Germany facility, we will use $165 million to $190 million of our 2017 to 2020 restructuring basket. The majority of this cash is expected as an outflow in 2018. The plant has 6 million units of capacity today, primarily in the less than 17-inch market. As part of our restructuring plan, we will reallocate production of the larger, more profitable sizes to existing facilities within our footprint at a lower cost. This action further enables our focus on high-value segments of the market while continuing to reduce our exposure to a declining market. 
Now we'll open the call up for your questions."

I understand that the supply/demand dynamic is going to be really good in the greater than 17-inch tire market. But you are calling out a few markets obviously that are relatively weak. Could you just give us some context on your exposure to the less than 17-inch tire market and how you see that kind of playing into your strategy of offsetting raw material costs with pricing?"

I guess the first thing that I would tell you sort of unequivocally, we don't view that there's any change to the upside to the trend of 17-inch or greater that we talked about.

I guess the first thing that I would tell you sort of unequivocally, we don't view that there's any change to the upside to the trend of 17-inch or greater that we talked about. We still believe -- and I know you know these numbers, but we see almost a 4x increase in 17-inch and above versus the normal market. So that situation, a full stop, is exactly the same of what we see. 
And the question of what does that mean, you're relating that back a little bit to sort of the volume price/mix versus raw material equation. And particularly in light of -- I think you're right to call out some raw material headwinds coming in, in 2017. I would tell you, Rod, we have a track record, even before we had sort of the tailwind of the 17-inch and above market coming in, to manage volume price/mix effectively. And we would intend to do the same moving forward. 
I can tell you I'm very pleased, in the quarter even, with the discipline that the businesses have had. I made reference to this in my comments as well. On the lower end of the market, particularly in Europe, we stuck to our value proposition and we stuck to our strategy and we didn't choose volume for volume's sake. We stuck to the value proposition. And you might be right to assume we lost a little volume in doing that, but it's the right thing to do in that part of the market that's declining, that's crowded, that's increasingly unprofitable, less profitable I'll say, and getting more competitive as we go. So we stuck to our guns. That's what we're going to do. And we married that up also with a footprint action to give us the flexibility to take these actions going forward. So very pleased with the discipline there. 
And I can also tell you, even in the quarter, on the 17-inch and above market, I won't go into different markets here, but we actually increased our pricing and our value proposition even in the quarter in doing that. And you see that coming through, broadly speaking, in the margin improvements that we had both in North America and in EMEA. 
So as we look at this, I would say we don't see any change in what we talked about in September. We don't see any difference in terms of the opportunities that we see. And if anything, Rod, I would tell you we're really focused on accelerating the change in Europe as we move ahead. And accelerating it means exposing ourselves to having to take certain decisions courageously in terms of dealing with some of the segments of the market that we don't want to play in. And that's exactly what we're going to do. We know how to do it, and it's exactly what we're going to do going forward. So I'll just pause there for a moment, Rod."

And in total, I would say Europe today is around about, I think, approaching 30% of our total business, is that 17-inch and above. 
You have to remember that the middle part of the market, which includes some below 17-inch tires, there's still a lot of tires that we have. And some of that business is very profitable as well. So we will continue to drive that business, but we're also going to continue to reduce our exposure to that going forward. That will -- some of that will actually move into 2017 as we do that. But again, the right decision for us is we take the capacity out and as we continue to mix up and change over that capacity to make 17-inch and above."

Now we'll get into exact percents and so on as we get to the February call, as we always do. But I'll just continue to point out, I think at Investor Day we showed a couple of charts where historically, I think it was over the last 5 years, there is always RMIs that come into play a particular quarter or so. But we have been able to do that whether -- to manage through that, whether raw materials were increasing or decreasing."

It's the essence of the positive market that we see. Again, I'd go back, and if I could elaborate a bit, remember this starts with OE, which is where we're getting these fitments. And then if I could even point you back, you don't have to look at it now, but I think it's on Page 55 of what Steve McClellan reviewed in the investor meeting, he showed a diagram that showed around about a 10-year period for the OE -- percentage OE of our business at 17-inch and above to sort of make its way into the replacement business, given the 2- to 3- to 4-year change of those tires going forward. We see that trend happening very fast. And that's the upside. That's the positive nature of what we have and that's where the supply/demand equation still sits in favor of ourselves as we move forward. 
That also says that as we migrate through that, we still sell a lot of below 17-inch tires and some of those certainly at a profit. So I don't want to leave you with the view that we're not selling any of those. As you know, that's still a big size of the market in total. But we're increasingly shifting over to the larger-rim diameter tires. And I know you know this, but remember, even though they're smaller volumes, the margins are higher and are driving what we have in our results. 
The 16-inch and below, increasingly crowded, oversupplied, declining, literally competing against hundreds of brands in there, particularly some of the Asian brands coming into Europe, as we've talked about in the past. So as we address that proactively, we won't exit it immediately, but we'll continue to mix up. And that's where that margin profile is going to come. It's, I would say, a great trend that we have in the industry as we look to the future. So hopefully that helped a little bit, Rod."

As I tried to articulate in my remarks, I mean, I think if you look at our commercial business, we really sort of had these 3 elements that impacted us in the quarter. One was, frankly, we had a weakness in consumer -- or in commercial OE volume, new trucks. We saw trucks down, I think, 29% in the quarter. And just to be -- add a little bit of clarity and transparency on it, we tend to -- when we see those, we manage our inventory, we take production out. As we took that production out, what happened to us is, when we go through our unabsorbed overhead calculations as part of our accounting policies, as you take that volume out, we can trip a number which was again very candidly unexpected, where instead of that unabsorbed overhead or lower factory utilization turning up as a product cost and then being released as cost of sale when the tire is sold, it effectively gets recorded in the period that we take the production cut, in this case in September. So that was an issue that hit us in the quarter. 
Then we had a specific customer issue where, again, I won't elaborate on but will say we're sticking to our value proposition as we go. And then we had, frankly, just lower volumes. This one is very hard to predict, but we had significant increases in the prebuys ahead of the tariff in commercial truck tires. I think we had non-RMA members in the U.S. were up, I think, 35% in Q1, I think 74% in Q2 and down 23% in Q3. And frankly, that's really hard to predict those prebuying numbers as we go. And remember, that's in an industry where sort of ton miles and the way to measure freight is, let's just say, relatively flat and not up. So dealing with that also had an impact in the quarter. Again, a little bit harder to predict. 
But this is something we've seen before. Dealers have loaded up on truck tires. That means there's a little shelf space. But that will work its way through. Our products are leading in the industry. Our fleet solutions model continues to be very strong. That will work its way through. It will take care of itself as we go forward. And we're working through a distortion. Unfortunately, and again, just to be very transparent about it, that did have an impact on us in the quarter. So that was one of the things I would say. The OTR, OTR did hit us, but that was a little bit more of the cyclicality of the mining industry. It wouldn't be what you're referring to, which I do remember about a year or so ago."

And Christina or Laura will correct me, our percentage of OE there is about 60%. It's higher than it is in other regions. And that's because when we went to set up our business there, it started out as essentially all an OE business. And therefore, that mix still tends to weight towards OE. That will sort of rectify over time. 
I would say a couple things. One, the industry was still very strong, particularly the OE industry. I'd also point out that the OE industry in China does have volatility to it as well, but it was very strong right now. And what we've done over there is very consciously try to create, I would say are creating a business model that's branded, that's focused on 17-inch and above larger-rim diameter tires and also focusing on getting the right vehicles to have that pull-through. We've also created a network of stores -- of distribution points that we manage very consciously. It's easy to open a lot of outlets and then have to close them later. Frankly, we've encountered that in the past. But we're very methodically managing our distribution channels over there and using digital and using other tools to reach those consumers. 
So our China business, from a brand, from a product, from a mix, from a customer basis is very strong. And obviously, we know the growth is in Asia and in China, so we're very positive on that. And I think as we said in the September investor meeting, we're planning on increasing our capacity at our Pulandian factory. And I won't elaborate here, we also increased -- announced capacity increases in India as well.

So that is one of the headwinds that we're facing in the fourth quarter that caused us to change the outlook. So that will continue. How long it takes the truck product to work through the shelves of the distribution, that's a harder one to call. But we know that will happen just as it happened with the consumer side, so it doesn't concern me. It's a question of when, not if. 
And then the larger question of what happens in 2017, I think that's largely going to be what happens from an industry perspective. And I think as we look to our guidance for 2017, we'll let you know. 
OE, new truck production, as I mentioned, I think down 29%, I think it was, in the quarter, and 39% or 38% year-to-date. So that will change. I mean, David, one thing I'll tell you about the truck industry, having done this a while, you get to a feast or famine. And right now we have the new truck production down. It will come back as we move ahead. Engine changes, whatever it is, we have prebuys and falloffs. So it will come back. I'm very confident of that. But as we look to '17, I would say we'll wait until we get to the fourth quarter call and we'll be in a position to give you, I think, a better guidance on that."

What we have to do is, what we have to do to reach those -- that 2020 target is make and sell 20 million more 17-inch and above tires. That is at the core of what we have to go do. And if you say what's on my mind every day and what are we driving the team to, it's actually that. And that means mixing up and making more of the right tires in North America, where you know we've been a little bit short-supplied. We have to make the right tires at the right cost. No change from what we've been saying and no change from what we have to do. 
In EMEA, again, very -- trying to be very candid with you, we saw the replacement market decrease about 8% in September alone. We are out there trying to capture the value of our brand, the value of our value proposition in the marketplace. We stuck to our guns. We did not pursue volume for volume's sake as we're looking to mix up. And we've taken the actions, as Laura said, we couldn't necessarily talk about at the September meeting to be able to address our switch from mixing up to the higher end of the market. That kind of came through a bit more in September even than we thought. Frankly, we didn't anticipate a market decrease in summer like that. The markets in Europe are a little difficult. We also said we planned on another green winter, but we actually saw winter volumes down again in September off of a week last year. So Europe, a little bit even tougher than we saw, but that's the tire business. That's okay. We're sticking to our guns and driving our strategy. 
So I would say really nothing has changed. In fact, if we peel back, if we don't get to that detail, if we look at our 17-inch and above business, if you want to just distill it to that, in North America very strong, in Europe very strong, in Asia very strong. So I would say those themes are moving ahead. And if, again, I say what happened between now and -- excuse me, September 15, the commercial business I went through, I sort of walked you through what happened there. I'm not happy with it, frankly, but it is what it is. And part of that was the volume recognition. And then -- volume recognition on our unabsorbed overhead accounting, I should say. 
Europe was our migration forward. And frankly, that is the strategy, and we're going to be aggressive in doing that. And then we did have a little bit of an OTR headwind. But, I mean, I'm not going to say that's a difference maker. That's more on the periphery of what we have to say. 
So higher raw material costs going into '17. We'll have some of the SLP startup costs coming into '17. We won't get that until latter half of '17, when we'll get the units out of that. As others have mentioned, I guess I just said it, the higher raw material cost going in. Those are some headwinds we're going to see. We're going to see some of the production cut hangover go into the first quarter as well. But we also know we've got tailwind on the 17-inch and above market. Asia continues to be very strong. And these are..."

As always, Laura will follow with a detailed financial report before opening the call for your questions. 
Our third quarter results were highlighted by continued growth in segment operating margin. All 3 of our global businesses achieved operating margins above 12%, led by our Asia Pacific business, which delivered 18.3% operating margin. In addition, our year-to-date core segment operating income grew to a record 9-month level. We delivered global segment operating margin of 14.5% for the quarter in a more challenging overall industry environment, particularly in our U.S. commercial truck tire business. 
This performance demonstrates the strength of our value proposition and our sustainability of margin growth in our business. As we discussed at our September Investor Day, our strategy is built to take advantage of the trends shaping our industry. Global demand for high-value-added large-rim diameter tires is increasing. And we believe that our portfolio of these products plus our connected business model position us on a path to sustained growth and competitive advantage. 
I'm also very pleased with the decisions we're making in our business units to drive and stay on our strategy. We continue to have opportunities to pursue short-term volume increases but recognize that these opportunities are in unprofitable parts of the market that are not growing. In other words, any potential near-term gains would fall outside our long-term strategy. The value of a strategy is in its consistent execution, regardless of industry and internal conditions. At Goodyear, we are committed to consistent execution of our strategy. 
Now during the third quarter and particularly late in the quarter, we experienced some headwinds to our plan. In addition to generally weaker overall industry conditions, 3 specific items affected our third quarter results and our expectations for the fourth quarter. I'll comment on each this morning. First, as a result of the challenging market conditions and lower volumes in our U.S. commercial truck tire business, we experienced higher conversion costs in the quarter. Second, we saw increased competition and deterioration in the pricing environment in EMEA, specifically in the smaller than 17-inch rim diameter consumer tire segment of the market. And third, there was incremental weakness in our OTR business consistent with what you're seeing in the mining industry. 
While these distinct items had a near-term impact on our results, the headwinds do not detract from our value proposition in the market or our ability to execute our long-term plan and achieve our 2020 targets. In fact, we made strong progress in the quarter in our targeted market segments that we reviewed with you at our September investor meeting. 
I'd like to address each of our business units, starting with the Americas. Our third quarter segment operating income was a solid $305 million and segment operating margin was strong at 14.7%. Even so, our results were lower than expected. To recap what we saw in the quarter, I'll depart from the usual flow of my review and begin with our U.S. commercial truck tire business, given its impact on this quarter. 
The U.S. commercial truck industry continues to be affected by weak OE volumes and the impact of tariffs on Chinese imports in the replacement market. The current industry environment in heavy truck, especially new truck production, continues to be challenging. Net orders for North America Class 8 trucks were down 29% in September alone and 39% year-to-date. In addition to this trend, an impact in the quarter related to a specific commercial OE customer exacerbated the weakness in the overall market. 
As you would expect, in response to the lower OE demand and to better manage our inventory, we reduced our production levels further during the quarter. The resulting increase in unabsorbed overhead in turn caused unexpected third quarter period costs, given the already lower utilization in our factories. Our outlook also includes additional ticket cuts to be made in the month of October. 
The weakness in the OE segment, coupled with the prebuy associated with the expected tariff on Chinese truck tires, have created a short-term supply/demand imbalance in the marketplace. You'll recall a similar prebuy imbalance related to the tariff impact on consumer replacement tires as well. We expect the supply/demand imbalance to improve over the next several quarters. And we are confident in the strength of our portfolio of Goodyear Dunlop and our value-oriented Kelly brands, together with our industry-leading service network that offer our customers the right tires for their specific needs. Paired with our industry-leading fleet solutions business model, our commercial truck tire business remains competitively advantaged in reducing operating costs for our fleet customers in any economic environment. 
Now during my time at Goodyear, we have experienced volatility in the commercial truck OE industry before. For example, we saw a spike in new truck purchases triggered by pending emission regulations and mandatory engine changes. We've managed through these and similar circumstances in the past and know from experience that the demand imbalance always turns around. We expect this time to be no different. 
Switching now to the Americas consumer business. We saw robust margin expansion with strong mix up in both the U.S. and Brazil. Consumer margins in the Americas were up 200 basis points in the quarter, driven by growth in the 17-inch and larger segment in the U.S. Industry growth in these premium tires was 8% in the quarter, outpacing growth in the overall market by nearly 3x. And as was the case last quarter, Goodyear outperformed the market growth in this segment. This remains a proof point of the soundness of our strategy. 
However, across the broader consumer replacement market, we've continued to see some destocking at the dealer and distributor level and a sluggish retail environment. As a result, we now expect the U.S. replacement industry to be up only modestly at 1% for the full year. Regardless, we remain bullish on the mix of trend and supply/demand situation for tires that are 17 inches and larger. That market remains robust. 
The underlying fundamentals in our industry, particularly miles driven, gasoline prices and fuel consumption remain strong. Vehicle miles traveled increased by a record 3.4% in August and is a strong indicator of the immediate-term demand. While the broader market consumer tire sell-in trends did not afford us an opportunity to offset headwinds in our commercial truck tire business this quarter, we expect more favorable demand in the consumer replacement market in the future. 
As I have said many times, we are not pursuing volume for volume's sake. Our team remains disciplined in our approach as we pursue profitable volume growth. The demand for our premium, high-value-added tires and replacement is still strong, and we continue to be challenged to fully satisfy market demand. We continue to be focused on increasing our capability and managing our production cost to increase our supply of the right tires for this demand for the balance of 2016 and into 2017. This remains our #1 priority. 
So overall, the Americas' underlying consumer business performance remains robust and demonstrates the earnings power of the value proposition in our core business. And with the San Luis Potosí factory coming online in late 2017, we are on track to increase our supply of 17-inch and larger tires as this market continues to grow. 
Turning now to EMEA. We delivered stable segment operating income and year-over-year margin expansion of 70 basis points despite a weaker and more competitive industry environment. The European consumer replacement industry was flat in the quarter, driven by slight increases in summer and slight decreases in winter segments. The winter industry was down 1% as we have continued to see dealers and distributors delay winter purchases. Despite a very low comparable from last year's green winter sell-in, industry winter volumes in Europe were down 3% in the month of September. The winter segment did see robust growth in the 17-inch and larger segment, which was more than offset by a decline in smaller sizes. 
In the summer replacement industry, however, increased competition, including a continued presence of imported Chinese tires particularly in Eastern Europe, led to year-over-year volume declines in the quarter in our less than 17-inch segment of the market. In that environment, we didn't chase volume for volume's sake. We stuck to our mix-up strategy to capture the value of the Goodyear brand for us and for our customers, consistent with our objective to pursue profitable growth. 
As you recall from our Investor Day presentation, we expect global growth in the 17-inch and larger portion of the market at 15% through 2020, more than 3x the long-term industry growth rate of 4%. That's the opportunity. Now at the same time, we see the market for 16-inch and smaller tires to be increasingly oversupplied and less profitable. That shift implies declining growth, increased competition and overall tougher industry environment for the smaller sizes over the same period of time. 
Though we saw the effect of these factors on the summer tire segment already this quarter, our 2020 plan contemplated this impact and included corresponding actions we would take to address our presence and competitiveness in this part of the market. Our plan includes taking the necessary steps to shift our resources and reduce our exposure to declining less profitable market segments as evidenced by our footprint action we announced earlier this week in Philippsburg, Germany. This is one of the restructuring steps required to execute our 2020 plan and is at the core of what we believe is needed to recalibrate our EMEA business to the more profitable segments of the market. This is among the difficult but necessary decisions that will be required to execute our plan, and we are committed to do just that. 
As we have demonstrated continually over the past decade, we will reduce costs while investing in our business to grow. We are confident that our lineup of high-value-added large-rim diameter tires will enable us to meet the increasing demand in the industry's most profitable high-growth segments. We continue to have complete confidence in our strategy and we won't compromise our long-term value proposition in the marketplace. 
In Asia Pacific, our third quarter segment operating income was a record $99 million, an increase of 38% from last year's performance. In addition, segment operating margin was 18%. Our unit volumes were up 12%, excluding the impact of the new Japanese replacement business. China had an outstanding quarter as volumes increased more than 25% versus the prior year. Once again, our growth was broad-based as consumer OE was up 30% and consumer replacement volume increased about 20%. On a year-to-date basis, our volume growth in China is about twice that of the industry. 
Similarly, we saw above-market growth in India in the quarter of nearly 9%. Our performance across these and other countries is driving share gains for our entire Asia Pacific region. We're very pleased with our results in Asia Pacific and we're consistently building our foundation to enable continued long-term growth in the region. We'll continue driving new product introductions, OE pull-through and build-out of our distribution network to support sustainable long-term growth. 
Reflecting on our 2016 targets. Clearly, we have experienced short-term obstacles in our markets. You saw in our press release this morning that we revised our 2016 segment operating income targets to be between $2 billion and $2.025 billion. As I've said, the tire industry does not move in a straight line. Our team is prepared to deal with that volatility and will continue to be focused on long-term economic value creation in our business. In light of the progress we've made over the past several years, I'm pleased with the resilience of our margins despite the recent turbulence affecting our business. Achieving this stability is perhaps the best indication of the strength of our strategy and the changes we've made to Goodyear's business over the past several years. 
The headwinds we are experiencing this year do not detract from our value proposition in the market or our ability to execute on our long-term plan. We continue to see our view of the industry mega trends being reaffirmed as the demand for 17-inch and larger tires remains robust. We know that we're in a very competitive tire industry, and there will be occasional obstacles and distractions that will challenge our focus. 
Winning in the global tire business will require hard work, agility and discipline. But I am absolutely confident in our commitment to executing our strategy. And we will continue our progress toward our 2020 target of $3 billion in segment operating income and $3.5 billion to $4 billion in returns to shareholders as part of our 2017 to 2020 capital allocation plan. We are as focused as ever on working on behalf of our customers by being the industry's innovation leader, being first with customers, being the leader in profitable segments of the market, and as a result, being a company that continuously drives sustainable value. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Laura."

I'll also cover updates to our 2016 outlook before we open the call up for your questions. 
Turning to the income statement on Slide 8, and as in prior quarters, we have provided call-outs that highlight the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela. Our unit volume excluding Venezuela was about flat year-over-year as growth in Asia Pacific was offset by declines in Americas and EMEA. The deconsolidation of Venezuela reduced net sales by $155 million. In addition, lower volume negatively impacted revenues by $73 million. 
Other tire-related revenues were lower by $59 million, driven by the 2015 sale of the North American motorcycle business. Our gross margin increased to 28.9% and segment operating margin increased to 14.5% in the quarter. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $1.19. Our results were influenced by certain significant items. Adjusting for these items, our earnings per share was $1.17, which represents an 18% increase versus last year. 
Turning to the step chart on Slide 9, which walks third quarter 2015 segment operating income to third quarter 2016. The negative impact of lower volume and production was $25 million. Lower raw material costs of $41 million more than offset reduced price/mix of $38 million for a net benefit of $3 million. Cost saving actions of $93 million, driven by our operational excellence initiatives, more than offset the $33 million negative impact of inflation, delivering a net benefit of $60 million. Foreign currency exchange was a slight headwind of $5 million, reflecting the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the British pound. 
Other was lower by $40 million, which was driven by the following 3 factors: first, a $14 million impact from the sale of our North American motorcycle business, bringing the full-year impact to $30 million; second, our commercial tire and service centers negatively impacted the quarter by $10 million, reflecting the more difficult environment for the commercial truck business in the U.S.; and third, lower earnings in our third-party chemical business, driven by the receipt of a royalty payment last year. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were about $1 billion. Total debt is down more than $200 million from the second quarter and net debt is down slightly as well. The increase in net debt versus year-end reflects the normal working capital seasonality in our business. The increase in net debt versus the prior year period includes the impact of Venezuela's deconsolidation. 
Free cash flow from operations is shown on Slide 11. For the quarter, we generated $150 million of cash. Working capital was a use of $264 million and in line with the typical third quarter seasonality of our business. Additionally, cash flow from operating activities was $357 million in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 12. The Americas business generated segment operating income of $305 million in the third quarter or 14.7% of sales. The year-over-year decline in SOI is more than explained by 3 factors: first, a $43 million impact from lower commercial truck demand, including higher conversion and period costs related to unabsorbed overhead and the impact on our commercial tire and service centers; second, a $39 million impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela; and third, a $16 million impact from the sale of the GDTNA business last year. 
Unit sales in the third quarter were $18.6 million or down 8% versus 2015. The negative impact of Venezuela and the sale of GDTNA together was about 600,000 units. Excluding these impacts, U.S. consumer volumes were about flat and U.S. commercial shipments were down 12%. The remainder of the unit volume decline was driven by lower consumer OE and replacement volume in Brazil and Canada. 
In summary, and despite several notable headwinds, the Americas region, particularly the underlying performance of our U.S. consumer business, which saw 200 basis points of margin improvement, remains sound. 
Turning to Slide 13. Europe, Middle East and Africa generated segment operating income of $152 million in the quarter. Segment operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 12.3%, primarily driven by our continued focus on cost efficiencies. This benefit was offset by the impact of lower volume in the quarter. Overall, EMEA unit volumes declined 4.5% year-over-year. EMEA's OE unit volume was down 8%. We began the quarter with lower expectations for our OE unit volume, following choices we've made consistent with our OE selectivity strategy and our intensifying focus on the more profitable 17-inch and larger rim-sized fitments. This impact was amplified by reduced demand as one of our customers experienced a supply disruption and lower-than-planned production during the quarter. 
Replacement tire shipments were down 3%, which is more than explained by increased competition at the lower end of the market in our summer consumer business, all in less than 17-inch rim diameter products. We have seen mild weather across Europe in October and continue to take a cautious approach on volume expectations for the remainder of the year. That said, the strength of our winter product portfolio has us well positioned to drive future business and win in our targeted market segments. As Rich mentioned, we are executing plans to realign our EMEA manufacturing footprint to enable growth in profitable market segments while building a foundation to deliver sustainable earnings. We are confident about the region's long-term growth opportunities and remain committed to that long-term growth. 
Turning to Slide 14. Asia Pacific delivered record third quarter segment operating income of $99 million, a $27 million improvement versus last year with the main driver continuing to be strong volume growth. Our segment operating margin in the region increased to 18.3%, up from 15.7% a year ago. Asia Pacific's volume was 8 million tire units, representing 33% growth versus last year. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of the Japanese replacement tire business, the remaining volume growth is primarily attributable to our key markets in China and India. We are well positioned in Asia Pacific and continue to be excited about the long-term growth opportunities there. 
Turning now to Slide 15. We have updated our full year SOI drivers. Overall, we now expect volume growth of 1% to 2% for the year and our unabsorbed overhead benefit has been updated to about $20 million. Fourth quarter unit volume will be about flat year-over-year as we expect continued pressure in a weaker environment in Brazil and in the less than 17-inch rim diameter summer segment in EMEA. Raw material costs were unchanged versus our prior outlook at down 4% for the year, although our net price/mix versus raw material cost benefit has been updated to approximately a $55 million benefit. This includes the impact of a more difficult commercial truck industry environment in the U.S. 
Reflecting our strong cost performance in the third quarter, our cost savings is revised up to about $150 million for the year. Our fourth quarter net cost savings will include a $30 million headwind for favorable adjustments to our general and product liability accruals last year. Regarding foreign currency translation, we now expect a headwind of approximately $25 million based on current spot rates. The final update in other reflects a weaker environment for our other tire-related businesses, particularly the U.S. commercial tire and service centers. This driver now reflects an additional $10 million headwind for the year. Our full year SOI guidance totals $2 billion to $2.025 billion for 2016. 
Additional financial assumptions for 2016 are listed on Slide 16. We have tightened the range for interest expense, which is now expected to be $360 million to $375 million for the full year. The next change is a slight increase in working capital, which is now expected to be a use of approximately $100 million. We expect CapEx to be about $1 billion, which was the low end of the range we provided in July. 
Finally, I'll cover updates on our capital allocation plan. We repurchased $50 million of stock during the third quarter. We've repurchased $613 million so far under our existing $1.1 billion share repurchase authorization and $200 million year-to-date. We plan to purchase about $500 million in total for the year, which leaves about $300 million that we expect to complete over the balance of the year. Finally, we remain committed to our 2017 to 2020 capital allocation plan and our 2020 target of $3 billion in SOI. The temporary weakness we are seeing in our commercial business will not impact our ability to deliver on our long-term plan. 
With our announcement to close the Philippsburg, Germany facility, we will use $165 million to $190 million of our 2017 to 2020 restructuring basket. The majority of this cash is expected as an outflow in 2018. The plant has 6 million units of capacity today, primarily in the less than 17-inch market. As part of our restructuring plan, we will reallocate production of the larger, more profitable sizes to existing facilities within our footprint at a lower cost. This action further enables our focus on high-value segments of the market while continuing to reduce our exposure to a declining market. 
Now we'll open the call up for your questions."

I understand that the supply/demand dynamic is going to be really good in the greater than 17-inch tire market. But you are calling out a few markets obviously that are relatively weak. Could you just give us some context on your exposure to the less than 17-inch tire market and how you see that kind of playing into your strategy of offsetting raw material costs with pricing?"

I guess the first thing that I would tell you sort of unequivocally, we don't view that there's any change to the upside to the trend of 17-inch or greater that we talked about. We still believe -- and I kn",503,"So Rod, no, it's a good question, fair question. I guess the first thing that I would tell you sort of unequivocally, we don't view that there's any change to the upside to the trend of 17-inch or greater that we talked about. We still believe -- and I know you know these numbers, but we see almost a 4x increase in 17-inch and above versus the normal market. So that situation, a full stop, is exactly the same of what we see. 
And the question of what does that mean, you're relating that back a little bit to sort of the volume price/mix versus raw material equation. And particularly in light of -- I think you're right to call out some raw material headwinds coming in, in 2017. I would tell you, Rod, we have a track record, even before we had sort of the tailwind of the 17-inch and above market coming in, to manage volume price/mix effectively. And we would intend to do the same moving forward. 
I can tell you I'm very pleased, in the quarter even, with the discipline that the businesses have had. I made reference to this in my comments as well. On the lower end of the market, particularly in Europe, we stuck to our value proposition and we stuck to our strategy and we didn't choose volume for volume's sake. We stuck to the value proposition. And you might be right to assume we lost a little volume in doing that, but it's the right thing to do in that part of the market that's declining, that's crowded, that's increasingly unprofitable, less profitable I'll say, and getting more competitive as we go. So we stuck to our guns. That's what we're going to do. And we married that up also with a footprint action to give us the flexibility to take these actions going forward. So very pleased with the discipline there. 
And I can also tell you, even in the quarter, on the 17-inch and above market, I won't go into different markets here, but we actually increased our pricing and our value proposition even in the quarter in doing that. And you see that coming through, broadly speaking, in the margin improvements that we had both in North America and in EMEA. 
So as we look at this, I would say we don't see any change in what we talked about in September. We don't see any difference in terms of the opportunities that we see. And if anything, Rod, I would tell you we're really focused on accelerating the change in Europe as we move ahead. And accelerating it means exposing ourselves to having to take certain decisions courageously in terms of dealing with some of the segments of the market that we don't want to play in. And that's exactly what we're going to do. We know how to do it, and it's exactly what we're going to do going forward. So I'll just pause there for a moment, Rod."

When you look at the first quarter of '17, that certainly will have headwinds because raws were so low in the first quarter of 2016. Now we'll get into exact percents and so on as we get to the February call, as we always do. But I'll just continue to point out, I think at Investor Day we showed a couple of charts where historically, I think it was over the last 5 years, there is always RMIs that come into play a particular quarter or so. But we have been able to do that whether -- to manage through that, whether raw materials were increasing or decreasing."

It's the essence of the positive market that we see. Again, I'd go back, and if I could elaborate a bit, remember this starts with OE, which is where we're getting these fitments. And then if I could even point you back, you don't have to look at it now, but I think it's on Page 55 of what Steve McClellan reviewed in the investor meeting, he showed a diagram that showed around about a 10-year period for the OE -- percentage OE of our business at 17-inch and above to sort of make its way into the replacement business, given the 2- to 3- to 4-year change of those tires going forward. We see that trend happening very fast. And that's the upside. That's the positive nature of what we have and that's where the supply/demand equation still sits in favor of ourselves as we move forward. 
That also says that as we migrate through that, we still sell a lot of below 17-inch tires and some of those certainly at a profit. So I don't want to leave you with the view that we're not selling any of those. As you know, that's still a big size of the market in total. But we're increasingly shifting over to the larger-rim diameter tires. And I know you know this, but remember, even though they're smaller volumes, the margins are higher and are driving what we have in our results. 
The 16-inch and below, increasingly crowded, oversupplied, declining, literally competing against hundreds of brands in there, particularly some of the Asian brands coming into Europe, as we've talked about in the past. So as we address that proactively, we won't exit it immediately, but we'll continue to mix up. And that's where that margin profile is going to come. It's, I would say, a great trend that we have in the industry as we look to the future. So hopefully that helped a little bit, Rod."

As I tried to articulate in my remarks, I mean, I think if you look at our commercial business, we really sort of had these 3 elements that impacted us in the quarter. One was, frankly, we had a weakness in consumer -- or in commercial OE volume, new trucks. We saw trucks down, I think, 29% in the quarter. And just to be -- add a little bit of clarity and transparency on it, we tend to -- when we see those, we manage our inventory, we take production out. As we took that production out, what happened to us is, when we go through our unabsorbed overhead calculations as part of our accounting policies, as you take that volume out, we can trip a number which was again very candidly unexpected, where instead of that unabsorbed overhead or lower factory utilization turning up as a product cost and then being released as cost of sale when the tire is sold, it effectively gets recorded in the period that we take the production cut, in this case in September. So that was an issue that hit us in the quarter. 
Then we had a specific customer issue where, again, I won't elaborate on but will say we're sticking to our value proposition as we go. And then we had, frankly, just lower volumes. This one is very hard to predict, but we had significant increases in the prebuys ahead of the tariff in commercial truck tires. I think we had non-RMA members in the U.S. were up, I think, 35% in Q1, I think 74% in Q2 and down 23% in Q3. And frankly, that's really hard to predict those prebuying numbers as we go. And remember, that's in an industry where sort of ton miles and the way to measure freight is, let's just say, relatively flat and not up. So dealing with that also had an impact in the quarter. Again, a little bit harder to predict. 
But this is something we've seen before. Dealers have loaded up on truck tires. That means there's a little shelf space. But that will work its way through. Our products are leading in the industry. Our fleet solutions model continues to be very strong. That will work its way through. It will take care of itself as we go forward. And we're working through a distortion. Unfortunately, and again, just to be very transparent about it, that did have an impact on us in the quarter. So that was one of the things I would say. The OTR, OTR did hit us, but that was a little bit more of the cyclicality of the mining industry. It wouldn't be what you're referring to, which I do remember about a year or so ago."

And Christina or Laura will correct me, our percentage of OE there is about 60%. It's higher than it is in other regions. And that's because when we went to set up our business there, it started out as essentially all an OE business. And therefore, that mix still tends to weight towards OE. That will sort of rectify over time. 
I would say a couple things. One, the industry was still very strong, particularly the OE industry. I'd also point out that the OE industry in China does have volatility to it as well, but it was very strong right now. And what we've done over there is very consciously try to create, I would say are creating a business model that's branded, that's focused on 17-inch and above larger-rim diameter tires and also focusing on getting the right vehicles to have that pull-through. We've also created a network of stores -- of distribution points that we manage very consciously. It's easy to open a lot of outlets and then have to close them later. Frankly, we've encountered that in the past. But we're very methodically managing our distribution channels over there and using digital and using other tools to reach those consumers. 
So our China business, from a brand, from a product, from a mix, from a customer basis is very strong. And obviously, we know the growth is in Asia and in China, so we're very positive on that. And I think as we said in the September investor meeting, we're planning on increasing our capacity at our Pulandian factory. And I won't elaborate here, we also increased -- announced capacity increases in India as well. So an area of the world that's growing, area of the world that people are continuing to drive, and we're positioning ourself well for it."

OE, new truck production, as I mentioned, I think down 29%, I think it was, in the quarter, and 39% or 38% year-to-date. So that will change. I mean, David, one thing I'll tell you about the truck industry, having done this a while, you get to a feast or famine. And right now we have the new truck production down.

So our focus is really to help them solve their problems and deliver to them the tires they need to achieve the outcomes that they need. And I think the value we bring has a proportional relationship back to the value that we receive. So our goal is to help them solve their problems, to help them make better vehicles. And if we do that, I'm confident that our value proposition will be recognized."

So conceptually, you had your Investor Day just about a month ago, very bullish tone and obviously you remain bullish on the sort of the long term. But it seems like maybe the near-term headwinds are quite a bit worse than what you just thought a month ago. So what has changed so dramatically within the last month?

What we have to do is, what we have to do to reach those -- that 2020 target is make and sell 20 million more 17-inch and above tires. That is at the core of what we have to go do. And if you say what's on my mind every day and what are we driving the team to, it's actually that. And that means mixing up and making more of the right tires in North America, where you know we've been a little bit short-supplied. We have to make the right tires at the right cost. No change from what we've been saying and no change from what we have to do. 
In EMEA, again, very -- trying to be very candid with you, we saw the replacement market decrease about 8% in September alone. We are out there trying to capture the value of our brand, the value of our value proposition in the marketplace. We stuck to our guns. We did not pursue volume for volume's sake as we're looking to mix up. And we've taken the actions, as Laura said, we couldn't necessarily talk about at the September meeting to be able to address our switch from mixing up to the higher end of the market. That kind of came through a bit more in September even than we thought. Frankly, we didn't anticipate a market decrease in summer like that. The markets in Europe are a little difficult. We also said we planned on another green winter, but we actually saw winter volumes down again in September off of a week last year. So Europe, a little bit even tougher than we saw, but that's the tire business. That's okay. We're sticking to our guns and driving our strategy. 
So I would say really nothing has changed. In fact, if we peel back, if we don't get to that detail, if we look at our 17-inch and above business, if you want to just distill it to that, in North America very strong, in Europe very strong, in Asia very strong. So I would say those themes are moving ahead. And if, again, I say what happened between now and -- excuse me, September 15, the commercial business I went through, I sort of walked you through what happened there. I'm not happy with it, frankly, but it is what it is. And part of that was the volume recognition. And then -- volume recognition on our unabsorbed overhead accounting, I should say. 
Europe was our migration forward. And frankly, that is the strategy, and we're going to be aggressive in doing that. And then we did have a little bit of an OTR headwind. But, I mean, I'm not going to say that's a difference maker. That's more on the periphery of what we have to say. 
So higher raw material costs going into '17. We'll have some of the SLP startup costs coming into '17. We won't get that until latter half of '17, when we'll get the units out of that. As others have mentioned, I guess I just said it, the higher raw material cost going in. Those are some headwinds we're going to see. We're going to see some of the production cut hangover go into the first quarter as well. But we also know we've got tailwind on the 17-inch and above market. Asia continues to be very strong. And these are..."

The key in our case is to have a sound strategy, to have the constancy of purpose and to not be dissuaded by all these externalities to move away from that strategy. That's what we're doing at Goodyear. At times it can be harder than others, but that's what we're doing. Listen, it was a tougher quarter. I'm not the happiest with it, and I'll say that with the appropriate humility. But our core business is sound. The market is very strong for us and our strategy is working.
