Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. .Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.65. This represents decreases of $0.13 [ph] sequentially and $0.85 when compared to th",915,"Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. .
Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.65. This represents decreases of $0.13 [ph] sequentially and $0.85 when compared to the same quarter last year. 
During the quarter, we recorded $2.1 billion of pretax charges. These charges are a direct result of the very challenging market condition we are operating in and include severance, impairment and restructuring charges. The asset impairment charges largely relate to our North America business, which, as you know, as being the hardest hit during this downturn. All of these charges are described in detail in our earnings press release. 
Our fourth quarter revenue of $7.7 billion decreased 9% sequentially. Approximately 1/3 of the revenue decline was attributable to pricing. Despite the very challenging environment, both in terms of pricing and activity, pretax operating margins only declined by 132 basis points sequentially to 16.6%. This was due to continued strong and proactive cost management across the entire organization. 
Sequential highlights by product group were as follows: fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.2 billion decreased 7% sequentially, while margins decreased [ph] 230 basis points to 24.2%. These declines were due to decreases in exploration spending that largely impacted Wireline internationally. We also did not see the year-end surge in multiclient and software sales that we typically experience in Q4. 
Drilling Group revenue of $3 billion decreased 8%, primarily due to pricing pressure and activity declines internationally that have mostly affected Drilling & Measurement and M-I SWACO. As a result of strong cost management, Drilling Group margins only declined 173 basis points to 16.7%. 
Production Group revenue of $2.7 billion decreased 10%, primarily due to the continued decline in activities and further pricing pressure in North America. Production Group markets were essentially flat at 11.3%, as SBM projects and higher earnings from our investment in OneSubsea compensated for the effects of the lower activity and pricing pressure. 
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 18.2% in the fourth quarter. This was lower than the previous quarter by about 2 percentage points. This decrease was largely due to the decline in mix of earnings between North America and the rest of the world as well as the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies and an R&D credit during the quarter. 
Excluding the impact of Cameron, we expect the ETR in 2016 to be around 20%. On a pro forma basis, we expect the combined company ETR to be in the low 20s, although this would remain sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. 
Our cash flow generation continues to be very strong. During the whole of 2015, we generated $8.8 billion of cash flow from operations. During the fourth quarter, we generated $2.2 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $800 million during 2015 and $200 million during the fourth quarter. 
In light of our strong cash flow generation, yesterday our Board of Directors approved a new $10 billion share buyback program. This new program will be effective once the remaining $1.4 billion of authorization under the current program is exhausted. 
During the quarter, our net debt deteriorated to $343 million to $5.5 billion, as we continue to invest in future revenue streams. During the fourth quarter, we spent $627 million on CapEx and invested approximately $600 million in SBM projects and $150 million in multiclient projects. Full year 2016 CapEx, excluding multiclient and SBM investments, is expected to be around $2.4 billion. 
During the quarter, we spent $398 million to repurchase 5.4 million shares at an average price of $73.86. This is despite being prohibited under the securities laws from repurchasing our shares for about 1 month prior to the Cameron shareholder vote. 
Let me take this opportunity to talk a little bit about the Cameron transaction. In order to ensure an efficient capital structure within the group, Schlumberger Holding Corporation, our principal U.S. subsidiary that we will also refer to as SHC, is a leading entity that will acquire Cameron. SHC will acquire approximately 137 million shares of common stock from its parent and [indiscernible] shares to Cameron shareholders. SHC will also take cash of approximately $2.8 billion in connection with this transaction. 
During the fourth quarter, SHC issued $6 billion of notes. These notes have a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.15% and have maturity ranging from 2017 to 2025. SHC will use to the proceeds from this debt issuance to partially fund the purchase of the 3 -- 137 million shares from the parent company. SHC will then use the combination of cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings to finance the difference between the proceeds received from the issuance of these notes and the cash required to complete the Cameron merger. 
As a result of this debt issuance, Schlumberger's pretax interest expense will increase approximately $40 million in Q1 as compared to Q4. 
As we close the Cameron transaction, we will begin to incur mergers and integration-related costs. These will include transaction costs, the cost of the integration, one-off purchase accounting adjustments as well as one-off costs to achieve the synergies. These amounts will be most significant in the quarter the transaction closes and the quarters immediately following the merger. We will call out these charges for you as they are incurred. 
And now I will turn the conference over to Paal."

Negative market sentiments intensified in the fourth quarter, with global oil production continuing, extending the various trend in global inventories and causing a further fall in oil prices, which reached",2179,"Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. 
Negative market sentiments intensified in the fourth quarter, with global oil production continuing, extending the various trend in global inventories and causing a further fall in oil prices, which reached a 12-year low in December. 
The worsening market conditions added further pressure to the deep financial crisis throughout the oil and gas value chain and prompted operators to make further cuts to the already low E&P investment levels. 
For many of our customers, available cash and annual budgets were exhausted well before the halfway point of the fourth quarter, leading to unscheduled and abrupt activity cancellations, creating an operating environment that is increasingly complex to navigate and very traditional year-end product in both the multiclient seismic sales were largely muted. 
As planned, we implemented another significant adjustments to our cost and resource base during the fourth quarter, including the relief of 10,000 employees as well as further streamlining of our overhead, infrastructure and asset base. 
In spite of these significant structural adjustments, our overall fourth quarter results were in some areas impacted by events that were either outside of our control, already chose to maintain cost and resource levels, pending availability of additional customer budgets in the new year. However, as we exited the fourth quarter, I believe we are making necessary adjustments to our cost and resource base and that we are well positioned to continue to deliver a solid financial results in both the first quarter and throughout 2016, which will clearly be another very challenging year for our industry. 
Looking closer at our fourth quarter results. Global revenues fell 9% sequentially, driven by a continuing decline in rig activity and persistent tightening pressure throughout our global operations, together with a broad range of activity disruptions, project delays and cancellations. In North America, revenue was down 14% sequentially, which is in line with the reduction of the burning rig count and driven by exhausted customer budgets and cash flows, together with the extended holiday period. 
Our North American pretax operating margins remained very resilient at 7.1%, driven by proactive cost and resource management, excellent performance from our supply chain and distribution organization, strong execution and new technology sales from our operations, all of which were further supported by our transformation program. 
On land, in both the U.S. and Canada, the weakening activity resulted in additional commercial pressure for all product lines, and in particular, in pressure pumping, where pricing levels dropped further into a sustainable territory for both operating margin and cash flow. 
We also saw continued pricing pressure and activity reductions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as the drilling rig count dropped by another 2% potentially and where year-end [indiscernible] seismic sales were largely muted. 
Turning to the International markets. Revenue was 6% lower sequentially, as customer budget cuts from the start of the deep winter slowdown and the absence of a traditional year-end product and multiclient seismic sales all impacted results. Our fourth quarter International operating margins dropped to 22%, driven by further pricing pressure and unfavorable revenue mix and a significant impact of activity disruptions, particularly in the Middle East & Asia. 
In Latin America, revenue declined 1% sequentially, with pretax operating margin improving by 229 basis points to 23%. 
In terms of revenue, solid activity in Mexico and Ecuador was offset by further budget reductions in Colombia and Brazil, while the weakening of the peso had a negative impact in our fourth quarter revenue in Argentina. 
Margins remained resilient across the area, as the cost and resource base adjustment made during the previous quarter took full effect and as we continue to leverage our transformation program. This combination more than offset the persistent pricing pressure we saw throughout our customer base. 
In Europe/CIS & Africa, revenue fell 9% sequentially, while pretax operating margins dropped 138 basis points to 20.8%. The drop in revenue was led by Russia & Central Asia, where a further weakening of the rubble, the start of the winter slowdown in Russia and a noticeable reduction in activity throughout the Caspian region all impacted the results. 
In Europe, activity in the Norway was resilient, but this was more than offset by a significant reduction in Continental Europe and the U.K., while in Africa, solid activity in Nigeria and Algeria was not enough to offset the further weakening in Central and West Africa. 
In the Middle East & Asia, revenue declined by 5% sequentially, while pretax operating margin decreased [ph] by 448 basis points to 22.5%. The sequential drop in revenue was led by Asia, where we saw a general weakening in activity throughout the region, which was most pronounced in Malaysia and Australia, where project ended and customer budgets were cut further. 
Fourth quarter revenue was also down in the Middle East, where a solid activity in Kuwait and Iraq was more than offset by a reduction in the rest of the region. 
In terms of operating margins, pricing pressure across the area was only partially offset by adjustments to our cost and resource base and where project cancellations, delayed startup of new projects and activity constructions 2015 budget limitations all contributed to the sequential reduction in operating margins. 
Our fourth quarter results capped [ph] the year where we have faced the most severe industry downturn in 30 years but where we saw management and strong execution are showing that we can navigate the challenging operating environment better than most and for these solid financial results, while maintaining the bandwidth to pursue and capitalize on opportunities that strengthen the competitive position of the company. So as we prepare for another very challenging year, 
I would like to summarize what we have delivered in, 2015, as this sets a very good benchmark for our expectations and ambitions for the year to come. 
Looking first at the top line. Full year revenue dropped by 27% in 2015, driven by a 39% drop in North America, where we have further strengthened our market position in spite the [indiscernible] not to pursue work [indiscernible] outside of our financial return requirements. 
Our International revenue fell by 21% in 2015, with this comparable to the drop in E&P investments. 
Included in this revenue drop is both impact of a higher leverage towards the exploration, deepwater and seismic markets, where E&P investments saw significant higher reductions and also include the impact of the strong dollar against the number of foreign currencies. 
These revenue mix headwinds are fully absorbed in our results at this stage, which makes our International business a highly compressed Coldspring, which we will capitalize on when E&P investments and customer activity starts recovering. In addition to this, we have, in the past period, significantly increased our win rate, which further strengthens our very solid contracts portfolio and puts us in a great position to increase market share going forward. 
Looking at the 2015 profitability. Full year global operating margins fell by only 342 [ph] basis points to 18.4%, as we maintained our wide margin lead in the International markets and as we now are also approaching a similar margin gap in North America. We have not protect our margins into a very approach to cost and resource management and by further accelerating our corporate transformation program. Together, these actions have delivered the decremental margins of 31% in 2015, which is about half the level seen in previous downturns. 
Turning next to cash. Our free cash flow in 2015 was about $5 billion, which represents net income conversion rate of 114%. This includes CapEx of $2.4 billion, which is now down to 59% of D&A, in addition to investments of $1.4 billion in future revenue streams in the areas of SBM and multiclient seismic. 
Our ability to generate free cash in this part of the cycle is unmatched in the oil field services industry and unique ability to capitalize on the significant this is opportunities that the current market conditions present. 
From our free cash flow, we have returned $4.6 billion of cash to our shareholders through $2.4 billion in dividend payments and $2.2 billion worth of stock buybacks. In addition to this, we have spent about $500 million on M&A, where we continue to target smaller, disruptive technology companies that we can integrate into our existing and future work flows and deploy through our expenses global organization. 
The strength of our free cash flow can also be seen from our net debt level, which has only increased by $160 million on a full year basis, driven by the financial performance I have just described. 
With respect to the pending Cameron transaction, the integration plans are now largely completed, and we are fully ready for day 1. We still expect to close the transaction during the first quarter of 2016, and we have already received antitrust approvals from the U.S., Canada, Russia and Brazil. 
The fact that we restructured to include 78% of stock provides us with the necessary insulation from the ongoing market turmoil, and during the fourth quarter, we also secured the required financing for our U.S. entity that will make the acquisition. 
Turning next to people. We have, in the past year, unfortunately, had to release more than 34,000 employees, which represents an unprecedented number for the company and where all have an impact as we are going through disheartening process of letting colleagues and friends go in all parts of the company. I am, at this stage, optimistic that we have completed the workforce reductions required in this downturn, and I look forward to being able to stay focused on our organization from the negative sentiments of the past year towards a brighter future as we work through the remaining challenges of this downturn. 
In terms of R&D, we did reduce investment levels in 2015, but we were still able to protect our capability and ensure the progress of all our key projects. In the past year, we made solid advances on several new technology trends through a combination of organic and inorganic efforts, and we look forward to update you further on this in our communication in the coming year. 
And lastly, in 2015, we significantly accelerated our corporate transformation program, stepping up both investment levels and the detailed engagement of our global organization. 
As part of this, we prepared a comprehensive and granular 3-year transformation plan covering each of our 600 business units, with specific deliverables and business impact goals set at all levels in our organization. 
In parallel with this, we have delivered noticeable cost savings and efficiency gain that can be seen in our 2015 financial results. Together, we had 23% reduction in our customer MPT rate, which is the largest and improvement we have ever achieved. 
In summary, while 2015 has been extremely challenging year for the industry and for Schlumberger, we have clearly demonstrated our ability to navigate the complex landscape and capitalize on the opportunities the current business environment presents. And we are fully prepared to efforts and achievements in 2016. 
So while we all look forward to recovery in the oil price and the market conditions in our industry, it is evident that the longer the current market environment continues, the stronger we will emerge as a company relative to our competitors while the upturn ultimately comes. 
Turning next to the market outlook. We still believe that the underlying balance of supply and demand continues to tighten, driven by both solid growth in demand and the weakening supply, as the dramatic cuts in E&P investments are starting to take effect. 
In North America, [indiscernible] production is declining [ph] more or less as we expected, and in December, below the levels from 1 year ago. The resilience in production outside of OPEC and North America is, in many cases, driven by the producers opening that task wide-open to maximize cash flow, which alternates we will likely be higher rate after a these short-term actions are exhausted. 
So while the global oil market is still being weighed down by [indiscernible] reduce growth in Chinese demand, the magnitude of additional and exports and the continued various trend in global oil inventory, we still expect the positive movement in oil prices during 2016, with specific timing being a function of the shape of the non-OPEC decline rates. 
This means that the market outlook for oil field services in the coming quarters will remain challenging, as the pressure and activity and service pricing is set to continue. 
It also means that 2016 E&P investment levels [indiscernible] for a second successful year that and any significant recovery in our activity levels will be a 2017 event. 
Still at Schlumberger, we remain confident in our ability to weather this downturn much better than our surroundings. And through our global reach, the strength our technology offering and our corporate transformation program, we are currently creating a considerable leverage that will enable us to increase revenue market share, deliver superior earnings and margin and continue to generate unmatched levels of free cash flow. 
Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions."

If you're looking for an indication of what the plan or how we see Q1 shaping up, it's going to be not a very challenging quarter, both from an activity and a pricing standpoint. The reason we raised the oil prices it's going to be lower rig count and more activity disruptions, we believe. This is going to be continued budget pressure throughout the first half from all customer groups, where they now have to operate within cash flow. In addition, we're going to see the winter slowdown in the Northern Hemisphere in Q1, which is going to be another activity headwind, right? So I would say that rather than going to margin revenues, if we focus on the EPS, I would say that the current Q1 consensus is probably the best case scenario from what we can see today in terms of Q1 earnings."

In terms of integrating Cameron as an organization, it will actually be a fairly simple task because Cameron, as it is today, will become the fourth product group of Schlumberger, together with Characterization, Drilling and Production. And Scott, the CEO of Cameron, is going to join us and continue to head up Cameron in its present form.

Now we have the added [indiscernible] transformation. On top of that was very, very solid management team that is excellent at executing. But it's tough to maintain margins at the levels that we currently see. I'm very pleased with how the North America team has managed and navigated in the past year. And 7.1% in Q4, I think, is excellent. It's going to be tough to continue to keep it at these levels, but with the energy and the focus our team on the ground in North America has, I'm optimistic that we will continue to significantly outperform the rest of the team there. As you look at the international margins, they are actually holding off recently well. We announced 6 quarters into the downturn internationally. And we are only 253 basis points down, which is basically half what we saw in 2009, in the last downturn. But economic environment and as always going to be variations, driven by unplanned events. And if you look at land for example, we had a big drop in Q3, and we managed to throw that back in Q4 as some of the actions that we put in place in the third quarter took full effect. Now in Q4, we did see a significant impact on our M&A margins, and part of this is pricing and part of it is permanent activity reduction. But there is also a significant part with this temporary witness down to building something. And if you look at the ground, we have a long list of actions in place to address what they can in order to offset some of these margin headwinds. I can't promise you that we're going to get all the margins back in EMEA, but I would say that the EMEA team is clearly unhappy having been surpassed the land team at the most profitable area. So I really look forward to return competition between these 2."

Let me just take all the currency situation. As far as our International operation, overall, we have a natural hedge, which -- what it means is basically the match the revenue that we get currency if it's in line with our local cost and local currencies.

I just like to summarize the 3 most important point that we have discussed. First, the business environment in the oil industry weakened further in the fourth quarter, leading to traditional reductions in both activity and pricing levels and making 2015 diverse industry downturns since 1986. In spite of this, we delivered full year performance compared to previous downturns, generating $5 billion [ph] in free cash flow and returning $4.6 billion in cash to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In addition, we spent $500 million on technology acquisitions that further broadened our portfolio and yet increased our net debt by only $160 million. Second, 2016 was another challenging year during which we were continue to deliver a superior financial results from some actors and capitalizing on the goal opportunities set the current marketing environment presents. We remain constructive in our view on the market outlook for the medium term, and continue to believe that our underlying balance of supply and demand tightening, driven by growth in demand [indiscernible] supply, as the massive cuts in E&P revenue takes further effect from and by the size of the annual supply replacement challenge. Lastly, with the closing merger with Cameron International during the first quarter, while the integration is largely complete for day 1, and with antitrust approvals all progressing on time. We are excited about what the commission of our 2 companies will bring and look forward to doing forces with more than 20,000 Cameron employees.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. .Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.65.

Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.65. This represent decreases of $0.13 sequentially and $0.85 when compared to the same quarter last year. 
During the quarter, we recorded $2.1 billion of pretax charges. These charges are the direct result of the very challenging market conditions we are operating in and include severance, impairment and restructuring charges. The asset impairment charges largely relate to our North America business, which, as you know, has been the hardest hit during this downturn. All of these charges are described in detail in our earnings press release.
Our fourth quarter revenue of $7.7 billion decreased 9% sequentially. Approximately 1/3 of the revenue decline was attributable to pricing. Despite the very challenging environment, both in terms of pricing and activity, pretax operating margins only declined by 132 basis points sequentially to 16.6%. This was due to continued strong and proactive cost management across the entire organization.
Sequential highlights by product group were as follows: fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.2 billion decreased 7% sequentially, while margin decreased 230 basis points to 24.2%. These declines were due to decreases in exploration spending that largely impacted Wireline internationally. We also did not see the year-end surge in multiclient and software sales that we typically experience in Q4.
Drilling Group revenue of $3 billion decreased 8%, primarily due to pricing pressure and activity declines internationally that have mostly affected Drilling & Measurement and M-I SWACO. As a result of strong cost management, Drilling Group margins only declined 173 basis points to 16.7%.
Production Group revenue of $2.7 billion decreased 10%, primarily due to the continued decline in land activities and further pricing pressure in North America. Production Group margins were essentially flat at 11.3% as SPM projects and higher earnings from our investment in OneSubsea compensated for the effects of the lower activity and pricing pressure.
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 18.2% in the fourth quarter. This was lower than the previous quarter by about 2 percentage points. This decrease was largely due to the geographic mix of earnings between North America and the rest of the world as well the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies and an R&D credit during the quarter.
Excluding the impact of Cameron, we expect the ETR in 2016 to be around 20%. On a pro forma basis, we expect the combined company ETR to be in the low 20s, although this would remain sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings.
Our cash flow generation continues to be very strong. During whole of 2015, we generated $8.8 billion of cash flow from operations. During the fourth quarter, we generated $2.2 billion of cash flow from operation. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $800 million during 2015 and $200 million during the fourth quarter. 
In light of our strong cash flow generation, yesterday our Board of Directors approved a new $10 billion share buyback program. This new program will be effective once the remaining $1.4 billion of authorization under the current program is exhausted.
During the quarter, our net debt deteriorated to $343 million to $5.5 billion, as we continue to invest in future revenue streams. During the fourth quarter, we spent $627 million on CapEx and invested approximately $600 million in SPM projects and $150 million in multiclient projects. Full year 2016 CapEx, excluding multiclient and SPM investments, is expected to be around $2.4 billion. 
During the quarter, we spent $398 million to repurchase 5.4 million shares at an average price of $73.86. This is despite being prohibited under the securities laws from repurchasing our shares for about 1 month prior to the Cameron shareholder vote.
Let me take this opportunity to talk a little bit about the Cameron transaction. In order to ensure an efficient capital structure within the group, Schlumberger Holding Corporation, our principal U.S. subsidiary that we also refer to as SHC, is the legal entity that will acquire Cameron. SHC will acquire approximately 137 million shares of common stock from its parent and transfer these shares to Cameron shareholders. SHC will also take cash of approximately $2.8 billion in connection with this transaction.
During the fourth quarter, SHC issued $6 billion of notes. These notes have a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.15% and have maturities to ranging from 2017 to 2025. SHC will use the proceeds from this debt issuance to partially fund the purchase of the 3 -- 137 million shares from the parent company. SHC will then use a combination of cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings to finance the difference between the proceeds received from the issuance of these notes and the cash required to complete the Cameron merger.  As a result of this debt issuance, Schlumberger's pretax interest expense will increase approximately $40 million in Q1 as compared to Q4.
As we close the Cameron transaction, we will begin to incur merger and integration-related costs. These will include transaction costs, the cost of the integration thing, one-off purchase accounting adjustment as well as one-off costs to achieve the synergies. These amounts will be most significant in the quarter with transaction closes and the quarters immediately following the merger. We will separately call out these charges for you as are incurred.
And now I will turn the conference over to Paal."

Negative market sentiments intensified in the fourth quarter with global oil production of oil continuing, extending the various trend in global inventories and causing a further fall in oil prices, which re",2203,"Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. 
Negative market sentiments intensified in the fourth quarter with global oil production of oil continuing, extending the various trend in global inventories and causing a further fall in oil prices, which reached a 12-year low in December.
The worsening market conditions added further pressure to the deep financial crisis throughout the oil and gas value chain and prompted operators to make further cuts to the already low E&P investment levels.
For many of our customers, available cash and annual budgets were exhausted well before the halfway point of the fourth quarter, leading to unscheduled and abrupt activity cancelations, creating an operating environment that is increasingly complex to navigate and very traditional year-end product and multiclient seismic sales were largely muted.
As planned, we implemented another significant adjustment to our cost and resource base during the fourth quarter, including the release of 10,000 employees as well as further streamlining of our overheads, infrastructure and asset base.
In spite of these significant structural adjustments, our overall fourth quarter results were, in some areas, impacted by events that were either outside of our control, already chose to maintain cost and resource levels, pending availability of additional customer budgets in the new year. However, as we exited the fourth quarter, I believe we are making necessary adjustments to our cost and resource base and that we are well positioned to continue to deliver solid financial results in both the first quarter and throughout 2016, which will clearly be another very challenging year for our industry. 
Looking closer at our fourth quarter results. Global revenues fell 9% sequentially, driven by a continuing decline in rig activity and persistent tightening pressure throughout our global operations, together with a broad range of activity disruptions, project delays and cancelations. In North America, revenue was down 14% sequentially, which is in line with the reduction in the drilling rig counts and driven by exhausted customer budgets and cash flows, together with the extended holiday period.
Our North American pretax operating margins remained very resilient at 7.1%, driven by proactive cost and resource management, excellent performance from our supply chain and distribution organization, strong execution and new technology sales from our operations, all of which were further supported by our transformation program.
On land, in both the U.S. and Canada, the weakening activity resulted in additional commercial pressure for all product lines, and in particular, in pressure pumping, where pricing levels dropped further into unsustainable territory for both operating margins and cash flow.
We also saw continued pricing pressure and activity reductions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as the drilling rig count dropped by another 2% sequentially and where year-end multiclient seismic sales were largely muted.
Turning to the International markets. Revenue was 6% lower sequentially as customer budget cuts, the start of the seasonal winter slowdown and the absence of the traditional year-end product and multiclient seismic sales, all impacted results. Our fourth quarter international operating margins dropped to 22%, driven by further pricing pressure and unfavorable revenue mix and a significant impact of activity disruptions, particularly in the Middle East & Asia.
In Latin America, revenue declined 1% sequentially, with pretax operating margin improving by 229 basis points to 23%. 
In terms of revenue, solid activity in Mexico and Ecuador was offset by a further budget reductions in Colombia and Brazil, while the weakening of the peso had a negative impact in our fourth quarter revenue in Argentina. 
Margins remained resilient across the area, as the cost and resource base adjustments made during the previous quarter took full effect and as we continue to leverage our transformation program. This combination more than offset the persistent pricing pressure we saw throughout our customer base.
In Europe/CIS & Africa, revenue fell 9% sequentially, while pretax operating margins dropped 138 basis points to 20.8%. The drop in revenue was led by Russia and Central Asia, where a further weakening of the ruble, the start of the seasonal winter slowdown in Russia and a noticeable reduction in activity throughout the Caspian region all impacted the results. 
In Europe, activity in Norway was resilient, but this was more than offset by a significant reduction in Continental Europe and the U.K., while in Africa, solid activity in Nigeria and Algeria was not enough to offset the further weakening in Central and West Africa. 
In the Middle East & Asia, revenue declined by 5% sequentially, while pretax operating margin decreased by 448 basis points to 22.5%. The sequential drop in revenue was led by Asia, where we saw a general weakening in activity throughout the region, which was most pronounced in Malaysia and Australia, where project ended and customer budgets were cut further.
Fourth quarter revenue was also down in the Middle East, where a solid activity in Kuwait and Iraq was more than offset by reductions in the rest of the region.
In terms of operating margins, pricing pressure across the area was only partially offset by adjustments to our cost and resource base and where project cancelations delayed startup of new projects and activity disruptions due to 2015 budget limitations, all contributed to the sequential reduction in operating margins.
Our fourth quarter results caps an year where we have faced the most severe industry downturn in 30 years, but where we through rapid management and strong execution have shown that we can navigate the challenging operating environment better than most and for these solid financial results, while maintaining the bandwidth to pursue and capitalize on opportunities that strengthen the competitive position of the company. So as we prepare for another very challenging year, 
I would like to summarize what we have delivered in, 2015, as this sets a very good benchmark for our expectations and ambitions for the year to come. 
Looking first at the top line. Full year revenue dropped by 27% in 2015, driven by a 39% drop in North America, where we have further strengthened our market position in spite of our decision not to pursue work that falls outside of our financial return requirements.
Our International revenue fell by 21% in 2015, with this comparable to the drop in E&P investments. 
Included in this revenue drop is both the impact of our higher leverage towards the exploration, deepwater and seismic markets, where E&P investments saw a significant higher reductions and also include the impact of the strong dollar against the number of foreign currencies.
These revenue mix headwinds are fully absorbed in our results at this stage, which makes our International business a highly compressed coil spring, which we will capitalize on when E&P investments and customer activity starts recovering. In addition to this, we have, in the past year, significantly increased our tender win rate, which further strengthens our very solid contracts portfolio and puts us in a great position to increase market share going forward. 
Looking at the 2015 profitability. Full year global operating margins fell by only 342 basis points to 18.4%, as we maintained our wide margin lead in the International markets and as we now are also approaching a similar margin gap in North America. We have managed to protect our margins due to a very practical approach to cost and resource management and by further accelerating our corporate transformation program. Together, these actions have delivered decremental margins of 31% in 2015, which is about half the level seen in previous downturns.
Turning next to cash. Our free cash flow in 2015 was about $5 billion, which represents net income conversion rate of 114%. This includes CapEx of $2.4 billion, which is now down to 59% of D&A, in addition to investments of $1.4 billion in future revenue streams in the areas of SPM and multiclient seismic.
Our ability to generate free cash in this part of the cycle is unmatched in the oil field services industry and gives us a unique ability to capitalize on the significant business opportunities that the current market conditions present.  From our free cash flow, we have returned $4.6 billion of cash to our shareholders through $2.4 billion in dividend payments and $2.2 billion worth of stock buybacks. In addition to this, we have spent about $500 million on M&A, where we continue to target smaller, disruptive technology companies that we can integrate into our existing and future work flows and deploy through our extensive global organization.
The strength of our free cash flow can also be seen from our net debt level, which has only increased by $160 million on a full year basis, driven by the financial performance I have just described.
With respect to the pending Cameron transaction, the integration plans are now largely completed, and we are fully ready for day 1. We still expect to close the transaction during the first quarter of 2016, and we have already received antitrust approvals from the U.S., Canada, Russia and Brazil.
The fact that we structured the deal to include 78% of stock provides us with the necessary insulation from the ongoing market turmoil, and during the fourth quarter, we also secured the required financing for our U.S. entity that will make the acquisition.
Turning next to people. We have, in the past year, unfortunately, had to release more than 34,000 employees, which represents an unprecedented number for the company and where we all have been impacted as we are going through this disheartening process of letting colleagues and friends go in all parts of the company. I am, at this stage, optimistic that we have completed the workforce reductions required in this downturn, and I look forward to be able to stay focused throughout our organization from the negative sentiments of the past year towards a brighter future as we work through the remaining challenges of this downturn.
In terms of R&D, we did reduce investment levels in 2015, but we were still able to protect our capabilities and ensure the progress of all our key projects. In the past year, we made solid advances on several new technology fronts through a combination of organic and inorganic efforts, and we look forward to update you further on this in our external communications in the coming year. 
And lastly, in 2015, we significantly accelerated our corporate transformation program, stepping up both investment levels and the detailed engagement of our global organization. 
As part of this, we prepared a comprehensive and granular 3-year transformation plan covering each of our 600 business units, with specific deliverables and business impact goals set at all levels in our organization.
In parallel with this, we have delivered noticeable cost savings and efficiency gains that can be seen in our 2015 financial results. Together, we had 23% reduction in our customer NPT rate, which is the largest annual improvement we have ever achieved. 
In summary, while 2015 has been an extremely challenging year for the industry and for Schlumberger, we have clearly demonstrated our ability to navigate a complex landscape and capitalized on the opportunities the current business environment presents. And we are fully prepared to repeat these efforts and achievements in 2016.
So while we all look forward to recovery in the oil price and the market conditions in our industry, it is evident that the longer the current market environment continues, the stronger we will emerge as a company relative to our competitors when the upturn ultimately comes.
Turning next to the market outlook. We still believe that the underlying balance of supply and demand continues to tighten, driven by both solid growth in demand and the weakening supply, as the dramatic cuts in E&P investments are starting to take effect. 
In North America  shale oil production is declining  more or less as we expected, and  was in December, below the levels from 1 year ago. The apparent resilience in production outside of OPEC and North America is, in many cases, driven by producers opening the taps to wide open to maximize cash flow, which also means that we will likely see a higher decline rates after these short-term actions are exhausted.  So while the global oil market is still being weighed down by pressures of reduced growth in Chinese demand, the magnitude of additional uranium exports and the continued various trend in global oil inventories, we still expect the positive movement in oil prices during 2016, with specific timing being a function of the shape of the non-OPEC decline rates.  This means that the market outlook for oil field services in the coming quarters will remain challenging as the pressure on activity and service pricing is set to continue.  It also means that 2016 E&P investment levels will fall for a second successive year and that any significant recovery in our activity levels will be a 2017 event.
Still at Schlumberger, we remain confident in our ability to weather this downturn much better than our surroundings. And through our global reach, the strength of our technology offering and our corporate transformation program, we are currently creating a considerable leverage that will enable us to increase revenue market share, deliver superior earnings and margin and continue to generate unmatched levels of free cash flow. 
Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions."

There's really no change to the philosophy that we have in any part of the cycle, the first thing we look to is to reinvest into the business, and that is CapEx for the service and product segments that we have. In 2016, we are going to keep CapEx flat. With 2015 and that's you may ask why. If you look at the base business, it is indeed coming down, but we have certain new activities that we are looking to invest into, in particular, the land drilling markets for the rig of the future, and there is a few other strategic investments that we are looking to make when it comes to our internal CapEx. In addition to this, we continue to invest in future revenue streams, both multiclient seismic where we have a significant program going on in Mexico.

In addition, we're going to see the winter slowdown in the Northern Hemisphere in Q1, which is going to be another activity headwind, right?

In terms of synergies, the detailed work that we've done has really confirmed the numbers that we put up at the announcement, lots of opportunities, which initially going to be cost focused, but this transaction is largely a revenue transaction, and we are very excited about what we can do by joining the R&D forces of the 2 companies and creating the integrated drilling and production systems that we have laid out earlier. In terms of integrating Cameron as an organization, it will actually be a fairly simple task because Cameron, as it is today, will become the fourth product group of Schlumberger, together with Characterization, Drilling and Production. And Scott Rowe, the CEO of Cameron, is going to join us and continue to head up Cameron in its present form. So the main thing we were focusing on in terms of integration initially is going to be to coordinate the customer interface, and to streamline the back-office and also then more for merge over time the R&D organization.

So with only a few years left and the oil price being at the very low level, this is what caused the impairment of the remaining balance we have. If you look at the rest of the portfolio and the new contract that we've entered into in recent years, these are all fee-per-barrel type of contracts, where obviously the project economics are linked to the oil price, but where our compensation is basically an isolated fee-per-barrel setup. So as with any of these projects, they do carry a higher risk than what our base business does.

Now we have, we added tool in our toolkit for just the transformation. On top of that with very, very solid management team that is excellent at executing. But it's tough to maintain margins at the levels that we currently see. I'm very pleased with how the North America team has managed and navigated in the past year. And 7.1% in Q4, I think, is excellent. It's going to be tough to continue to keep it at these levels, but with the energy and the focus our team on the ground in North America has, I'm optimistic that we will continue to significantly outperform the rest of the field there. Now if you look at the international margins, they are actually holding off recently well. We announced 6 quarters into the downturn internationally. And we are only 253 basis points down, which is basically half what we saw in 2009, in the last downturn. But it's the very economic environment and there's always going to be quarterly variations, driven by unplanned events. And if you look at LAM for an example, we had a big drop in Q3, and we managed to curl that back in Q4 as some of the actions that we put in place in the third quarter took full effect. Now in Q4, we did see a significant impact on our M&A margins, and part of this is pricing and part of it is permanent activity reduction. But there is also a significant part which is temporary, which is down to delays and stoppages. And if you look at the team we have on the ground, we have a long list of actions in place to address what they can in order to offset some of these margin headwinds. So I can't promise you that we're going to get all the margins back in MEA, but I would say that the MEA team is clearly unhappy having been surpassed by the LAM team at the most profitable area. So I really look forward to the internal competition between these two."

These are relatively small compared to what our customers would be interested in. And they are generally late-life fields, where we can come in and try to change the recovery curve and add reserves and production to the field in late-life. We're generally focused on LAM. And the only thing I would say is that the opportunity set has increased. There are more customers that are coming to us now that has these type of fields and are interested in doing these type of business models with us. So there's not a dramatic shift in the type of assets that we are looking at, but it's generally just more of them. And for the fields that we enter into contracts on, obviously, we will have to look at the total economics of the fee for the lifetime of the contract, which is generally, I would say, at least 15 years. So in that, it's obviously important that the total project is economical. And then the way we set up our contracts is today generally on the fee-per-barrel, where we are, I would say, insulated against variations in oil price. That means that if it goes down, we don't get hit at all. But again, we are leaving the upside to our customers if oil prices are higher than what is in the assumption. So we have a very, I would say, solid post from evaluating this. And like I said earlier in the call, we are actively pursuing these type of contracts, where we can get the terms that we won contractually and where we are satisfied at the reservoir holds the upside, both in production and reserves."

Last question, let that. Let me just take overall the currency situation. As far as our International operation, overall, we have a natural hedge, which -- what it means is basically we match the revenue that we get in local currency if it is in line with our local cost and local currencies. It varies between jurisdictions. So in some areas, we lose a bit on the currency, but then gains in other places compensate for it. In 2015, we've seen the numbers. We've lost a lot of revenue because of currency. And almost 20% of the reduction of revenue between 2014 to 2015 was currency, but actually did not impact the margin significantly. So it is all International, yes, that is a bit and we manage it, as I said, it is natural hedge. We prevent ourselves from taking more local currency than we consume locally for local cost. As far as SPM is concerned, normally, most of our SPM projects actually are dollar-based revenue-wise.

So before we close this morning, I just like to summarize the 3 most important points that we have discussed. First, the business environment in the oil industry weakened further in the fourth quarter, leading to additional reductions in both activity and pricing levels and making 2015 diverse industry downturns since 1986. In spite of this, we delivered strong full year performance compared to previous downturns, generating $5 billion in free cash flow and returning $4.6 billion in cash to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In addition, we spent $500 million on technology acquisitions that further broadened our portfolio and yet we increased our net debt by only $160 million. Second, 2016 was the another challenging year during which we will aim to continue to deliver superior financial results in parallel with pursuing and capitalizing on the broad opportunity set the current marketing environment presents. We remain constructive in our view on the market outlook for the medium term, and continue to believe that the underlying balance of supply and demand is tightening driven by growth in demand, reach and supply as the massive cuts in E&P investments take further effect and by the size of the annual supply replacement challenge. Lastly, we look forward to closing our merger with Cameron International during the first quarter, where the integration planning is largely complete for day 1, and with antitrust approvals all progressing on track. We are excited about what the combination of our 2 companies will bring and look forward to joining forces with more than 20,000 Cameron employees. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to continue to weather this downturn better than our surroundings through our global reach, the strength of our technology offering and the strength of our corporate transformation program.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. .Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.65.

Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.65. This represents decreases of $0.13 sequentially and $0.85 when compared to the same quarter last year. 
During the quarter, we recorded $2.1 billion of pretax charges. These charges are the direct result of the very challenging market conditions we are operating in and include severance, impairment and restructuring charges. The asset impairment charges largely relate to our North America business, which, as you know, has been the hardest hit during this downturn. All of these charges are described in detail in our earnings press release.
Our fourth quarter revenue of $7.7 billion decreased 9% sequentially. Approximately 1/3 of the revenue decline was attributable to pricing. Despite the very challenging environment, both in terms of pricing and activity, pretax operating margins only declined by 132 basis points sequentially to 16.6%. This was due to continued strong and proactive cost management across the entire organization.
Sequential highlights by product group were as follows: fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.2 billion decreased 7% sequentially, while margin decreased 230 basis points to 24.2%. These declines were due to decreases in exploration spending that largely impacted Wireline internationally. We also did not see the year-end surge in multiclient and software sales that we typically experience in Q4.
Drilling Group revenue of $3 billion decreased 8%, primarily due to pricing pressure and activity declines internationally that have mostly affected Drilling & Measurement and M-I SWACO. As a result of strong cost management, Drilling Group margins only declined 173 basis points to 16.7%.
Production Group revenue of $2.7 billion decreased 10%, primarily due to the continued decline in land activities and further pricing pressure in North America. Production Group margins were essentially flat at 11.3%, as SPM projects and higher earnings from our investment in OneSubsea compensated for the effects of the lower activity and pricing pressure.
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 18.2% in the fourth quarter. This was lower than the previous quarter by about 2 percentage points. This decrease was largely due to the geographic mix of earnings between North America and the rest of the world as well the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies and an R&D credit during the quarter.
Excluding the impact of Cameron, we expect the ETR in 2016 to be around 20%. On a pro forma basis, we expect the combined company ETR to be in the low 20s, although this would remain sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings.
Our cash flow generation continues to be very strong. During whole of 2015, we generated $8.8 billion of cash flow from operations. During the fourth quarter, we generated $2.2 billion of cash flow from operation. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $800 million during 2015 and $200 million during the fourth quarter. 
In light of our strong cash flow generation, yesterday our Board of Directors approved a new $10 billion share buyback program. This new program will be effective once the remaining $1.4 billion of authorization under the current program is exhausted.
During the quarter, our net debt deteriorated at [ph] $343 million to $5.5 billion, as we continue to invest in future revenue streams. During the fourth quarter, we spent $627 million on CapEx and invested approximately $600 million in SPM projects and $150 million in multiclient projects. Full year 2016 CapEx, excluding multiclient and SPM investments, is expected to be around $2.4 billion. 
During the quarter, we spent $398 million to repurchase 5.4 million shares at an average price of $73.86. This is despite being prohibited under the securities laws from repurchasing our shares for about 1 month prior to the Cameron shareholder vote.
Let me take this opportunity to talk a little bit about the Cameron transaction. In order to ensure an efficient capital structure within the group, Schlumberger Holding Corporation, our principal U.S. subsidiary that we also refer to as SHC, is the legal entity that will acquire Cameron. SHC will acquire approximately 137 million shares of common stock from its parent and transfer these shares to Cameron shareholders. SHC will also take cash of approximately $2.8 billion in connection with this transaction.
During the fourth quarter, SHC issued $6 billion of notes. These notes have a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.15% and have maturities ranging from 2017 to 2025. SHC will use the proceeds from this debt issuance to partially fund the purchase of the 3 -- 137 million shares from the parent company. SHC will then use a combination of cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings to finance the difference between the proceeds received from the issuance of these notes and the cash required to complete the Cameron merger.  As a result of this debt issuance, Schlumberger's pretax interest expense will increase approximately $40 million in Q1 as compared to Q4.
As we close the Cameron transaction, we will begin to incur merger and integration-related costs. These will include transaction costs, the cost of the integration team, one-off purchase accounting adjustment as well as one-off costs to achieve the synergies. These amounts will be most significant in the quarter the transaction closes and the quarters immediately following the merger. We will separately call out these charges for you as they are incurred.
And now I will turn the conference over to Paal."

Negative market sentiments intensified in the fourth quarter with global oil production of oil continuing, extending the bearish trend in global oil inventories and causing a further fall in oil prices, whic",2203,"Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. 
Negative market sentiments intensified in the fourth quarter with global oil production of oil continuing, extending the bearish trend in global oil inventories and causing a further fall in oil prices, which reached a 12-year low in December.
The worsening market conditions added further pressure to the deep financial crisis throughout the oil and gas value chain and prompted operators to make further cuts to the already low E&P investment levels.
For many of our customers, available cash and annual budgets were exhausted well before the halfway point of the fourth quarter, leading to unscheduled and abrupt activity cancelations, creating an operating environment that is increasingly complex to navigate and where the traditional year-end product and multiclient seismic sales were largely muted.
As planned, we implemented another significant adjustment to our cost and resource base during the fourth quarter, including the release of 10,000 employees as well as further streamlining of our overheads, infrastructure and asset base.
In spite of these significant structural adjustments, our overall fourth quarter results were, in some areas, impacted by events that were either outside of our control, or where we chose to maintain cost and resource levels, pending availability of additional customer budgets in the new year. However, as we exited the fourth quarter, I believe we are making necessary adjustments to our cost and resource base and that we are well positioned to continue to deliver solid financial results in both the first quarter and throughout 2016, which will clearly be another very challenging year for our industry. 
Looking closer at our fourth quarter results. Global revenues fell 9% sequentially, driven by a continuing decline in rig activity and persistent tightening pressure throughout our global operations, together with a broad range of activity disruptions, project delays and cancelations. In North America, revenue was down 14% sequentially, which is in line with the reduction in the drilling rig counts and driven by exhausted customer budgets and cash flows, together with the extended holiday period.
Our North American pretax operating margins remained very resilient at 7.1%, driven by proactive cost and resource management, excellent performance from our supply chain and distribution organization, strong execution and new technology sales from our operations, all of which were further supported by our transformation program.
On land, in both the U.S. and Canada, the weakening activity resulted in additional commercial pressure for all product lines, and in particular, in pressure pumping, where pricing levels dropped further into unsustainable territory for both operating margins and cash flow.
We also saw continued pricing pressure and activity reductions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as the drilling rig count dropped by another 2% sequentially and where year-end multiclient seismic sales were largely muted.
Turning to the international markets. Revenue was 6% lower sequentially as customer budget cuts, the start of the seasonal winter slowdown and the absence of the traditional year-end product and multiclient seismic sales all impacted results. Our fourth quarter international operating margins dropped to 22%, driven by further pricing pressure and unfavorable revenue mix and a significant impact of activity disruptions, particularly in the Middle East & Asia.
In Latin America, revenue declined 1% sequentially, with pretax operating margin improving by 229 basis points to 23%. 
In terms of revenue, solid activity in Mexico and Ecuador was offset by further budget reductions in Colombia and Brazil, while the weakening of the peso had a negative impact on our fourth quarter revenue in Argentina. 
Margins remained resilient across the area, as the cost and resource base adjustments made during the previous quarter took full effect and as we continue to leverage our transformation program. This combination more than offset the persistent pricing pressure we saw throughout our customer base.
In Europe/CIS & Africa, revenue fell 9% sequentially, while pretax operating margins dropped 138 basis points to 20.8%. The drop in revenue was led by Russia and Central Asia, where a further weakening of the ruble, the start of the seasonal winter slowdown in Russia and a noticeable reduction in activity throughout the Caspian region all impacted the results. 
In Europe, activity in Norway was resilient, but this was more than offset by a significant reduction in Continental Europe and the U.K., while in Africa, solid activity in Nigeria and Algeria was not enough to offset the further weakening in Central and West Africa. 
In the Middle East & Asia, revenue declined by 5% sequentially, while pretax operating margin decreased by 448 basis points to 22.5%. The sequential drop in revenue was led by Asia, where we saw a general weakening in activity throughout the region, which was most pronounced in Malaysia and Australia, where projects ended and customer budgets were cut further.
Fourth quarter revenue was also down in the Middle East, where a solid activity in Kuwait and Iraq was more than offset by reductions in the rest of the region.
In terms of operating margins, pricing pressure across the area was only partially offset by adjustments to our cost and resource base, and where project cancelations, delayed startup of new projects and activity disruptions due to 2015 budget limitations all contributed to the sequential reduction in operating margins.
Our fourth quarter results cap a year where we have faced the most severe industry downturn in 30 years, but where we, through rapid management and strong execution, have shown that we can navigate the challenging operating environment better than most, and produce solid financial results while maintaining the bandwidth to pursue and capitalize on opportunities that strengthen the competitive position of the company. So as we prepare for another very challenging year, I would like to summarize what we have delivered in 2015, as this sets a very good benchmark for our expectations and ambitions for the year to come. 
Looking first at the top line. Full year revenue dropped by 27% in 2015, driven by a 39% drop in North America, where we have further strengthened our market position in spite of our decision not to pursue work that falls outside of our financial return requirements.
Our international revenue fell by 21% in 2015, which is comparable to the drop in E&P investments. 
Included in this revenue drop is both the impact of our higher leverage towards the exploration, deepwater and seismic markets, where E&P investments saw significantly higher reductions, and also include the impact of the strong dollar against a number of foreign currencies.
These revenue mix headwinds are fully absorbed in our results at this stage, which makes our international business a highly compressed coil spring, which we will capitalize on when E&P investments and customer activity starts recovering. In addition to this, we have, in the past year, significantly increased our tender win rate, which further strengthens our very solid contracts portfolio and puts us in a great position to increase market share going forward. 
Looking at the 2015 profitability. Full year global operating margins fell by only 342 basis points to 18.4%, as we maintained our wide margin lead in the international markets and as we now are also approaching a similar margin gap in North America. We have managed to protect our margins due to a very practical approach to cost and resource management and by further accelerating our corporate transformation program. Together, these actions have delivered decremental margins of 31% in 2015, which is about half the level seen in previous downturns.
Turning next to cash. Our free cash flow in 2015 was about $5 billion, which represents a net income conversion rate of 114%. This includes CapEx of $2.4 billion, which is now down to 59% of D&A, in addition to investments of $1.4 billion in future revenue streams in the areas of SPM and multiclient seismic.
Our ability to generate free cash in this part of the cycle is unmatched in the oil field services industry and gives us a unique ability to capitalize on the significant business opportunities that the current market conditions present.  From our free cash flow, we have returned $4.6 billion of cash to our shareholders through $2.4 billion in dividend payments and $2.2 billion worth of stock buybacks. In addition to this, we have spent about $500 million on M&A, where we continue to target smaller, disruptive technology companies that we can integrate into our existing and future workflows and deploy through our extensive global organization.
The strength of our free cash flow can also be seen from our net debt level, which has only increased by $160 million on a full year basis, driven by the financial performance I have just described.
With respect to the pending Cameron transaction, the integration plans are now largely completed, and we are fully ready for day 1. We still expect to close the transaction during the first quarter of 2016, and we have already received antitrust approvals from the U.S., Canada, Russia and Brazil.
The fact that we structured the deal to include 78% of stock provides us with the necessary insulation from the ongoing market turmoil, and during the fourth quarter, we also secured the required financing for our U.S. entity that will make the acquisition.
Turning next to people. We have, in the past year, unfortunately, had to release more than 34,000 employees, which represents an unprecedented number for the company and where we all have been impacted as we are going through this disheartening process of letting colleagues and friends go in all parts of the company. I am, at this stage, optimistic that we have completed the workforce reductions required in this downturn, and I look forward to be able to shift focus throughout our organization from the negative sentiments of the past year towards a brighter future as we work through the remaining challenges of this downturn.
In terms of R&D, we did reduce investment levels in 2015, but we were still able to protect our capabilities and ensure the progress of all our key projects. In the past year, we made solid advances on several new technology fronts through a combination of organic and inorganic efforts, and we look forward to update you further on this in our external communications in the coming year. 
And lastly, in 2015, we significantly accelerated our corporate transformation program, stepping up both investment levels and the detailed engagement of our global organization. 
As part of this, we prepared a comprehensive and granular 3-year transformation plan covering each of our 600 business units, with specific deliverables and business impact goals set at all levels in our organization.
In parallel with this, we have delivered noticeable cost savings and efficiency gains that can be seen in our 2015 financial results. Together, we had 23% reduction in our customer NPT rate, which is the largest annual improvement we have ever achieved. 
In summary, while 2015 has been an extremely challenging year for the industry and for Schlumberger, we have clearly demonstrated our ability to navigate a complex landscape and capitalize on the opportunities the current business environment presents. And we are fully prepared to repeat these efforts and achievements in 2016.
So while we all look forward to a recovery in the oil price and the market conditions in our industry, it is evident that the longer the current market environment continues, the stronger we will emerge as a company relative to our competitors when the upturn ultimately comes.
Turning next to the market outlook. We still believe that the underlying balance of supply and demand continues to tighten, driven by both solid growth in demand and by weakening supply, as the dramatic cuts in E&P investments are starting to take effect. 
In North America, shale oil production is declining more or less as we expected, and was in December below the levels from 1 year ago. The apparent resilience in production outside of OPEC and North America is, in many cases, driven by producers opening the taps wide open to maximize cash flow, which also means that we will likely see higher decline rates after these short-term actions are exhausted.  So while the global oil market is still being weighed down by tales of reduced growth in Chinese demand, the magnitude of additional uranium exports and the continued bearish trend in global oil inventories, we still expect a positive movement in oil prices during 2016, with specific timing being a function of the shape of the non-OPEC decline rates.  This means that the market outlook for oil field services in the coming quarters will remain challenging, as the pressure on activity and service pricing is set to continue.  It also means that 2016 E&P investment levels will fall for a second successive year, and that any significant recovery in our activity levels will be a 2017 event.
Still at Schlumberger, we remain confident in our ability to weather this downturn much better than our surroundings. And through our global reach, the strength of our technology offering and our corporate transformation program, we are currently creating a considerable leverage that will enable us to increase revenue market share, deliver superior earnings and margin, and continue to generate unmatched levels of free cash flow. 
Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions."

In 2016, we are going to keep CapEx flat with 2015, and that's -- you may ask why. If you look at the base business, it is indeed coming down, but we have certain new activities that we are looking to invest into, in particular, the land drilling markets for the rig of the future, and there is a few other strategic investments that we are looking to make when it comes to our internal CapEx.

If you're looking for an indication of how we -- what we plan for and how we see Q1 shaping up, it's going to be another very challenging quarter, both from an activity and a pricing standpoint. The recent new lows in oil prices is going to be reflected in lower rig counts and more activity disruptions, we believe. This is going to be continued budget pressure throughout the first half from all customer groups, where they now have to operate within cash flow. In addition, we're going to see the winter slowdown in the Northern Hemisphere in Q1, which is going to be another activity headwind, right? So I would say that rather than going into margin and revenues, if we focus in on EPS, I would say that the current Q1 EPS consensus is probably a best-case scenario from what we can see today in terms of Q1 earnings."

We reviewed all the plans in December, and they have been approved. And we are basically ready for day 1 at this stage. Closing is now basically pending a few more countries in terms of antitrust approvals. And we do expect that we will close during the year, during the first quarter. In terms of synergies, the detailed work that we've done has really confirmed the numbers that we put up at the announcement, lots of opportunities, which initially going to be cost focused, but this transaction is largely a revenue transaction, and we are very excited about what we can do by joining the R&D forces of the 2 companies and creating the integrated drilling and production systems that we have laid out earlier. In terms of integrating Cameron as an organization, it will actually be a fairly simple task because Cameron, as it is today, will become the fourth product group of Schlumberger, together with Characterization, Drilling and Production. And Scott Rowe, the CEO of Cameron, is going to join us and continue to head up Cameron in its present form. So the main thing we are focusing on in terms of integration initially is going to be to coordinate the customer interface and to streamline the back-office, and also then morph or merge over time the R&D organization. So it is a relatively simple integration because Cameron will slide in, in its present form, into Schlumberger as a fourth group."

So with only a few years left and the oil price being at the very low level, this is what caused the impairment of the remaining balance we have. If you look at the rest of the portfolio and the new contract that we've entered into in recent years, these are all fee-per-barrel type of contracts, where obviously the project economics are linked to the oil price, but where our compensation is basically an isolated fee-per-barrel setup. So as with any of these projects, they do carry a higher risk than what our base business does. But we are, I would say, very comfortable with being able to, I would say, identify and manage these risks.

Now we have -- we added tools in our toolkit for just the transformation. On top of that, a very, very solid management team that is excellent at executing. But it's tough to maintain margins at the levels that we currently see. I'm very pleased with how the North America team has managed and navigated in the past year. And 7.1% in Q4, I think, is excellent. It's going to be tough to continue to keep it at these levels, but with the energy and the focus our team on the ground in North America has, I'm optimistic that we will continue to significantly outperform the rest of the field there. Now if you look at the international margins, they are actually holding up reasonably well. We are now 6 quarters into the downturn internationally, and we are only 253 basis points down, which is basically half what we saw in 2009, in the last downturn. But it's a very dynamic environment, and there's always going to be quarterly variations driven by unplanned events. And if you look at LAM for an example, we had a big drop in Q3, and we managed to claw that back in Q4 as some of the actions that we put in place in the third quarter took full effect. Now in Q4, we did see a significant impact on our M&A margins, and part of this is pricing and part of it is permanent activity reduction. But there is also a significant part which is temporary, which is down to delays and stoppages. And if you look at the team we have on the ground, we have a long list of actions in place to address what they can in order to offset some of these margin headwinds. So I can't promise you that we're going to get all the margins back in MEA, but I would say that the MEA team is clearly unhappy, having been surpassed by the LAM team as the most profitable area. So I really look forward to the internal competition between these two."

There are more customers that are coming to us now that have these type of fields and are interested in doing these type of business models with us. So there's not a dramatic shift in the type of assets that we are looking at, but it's generally just more of them. And for the fields that we enter into contracts on, obviously, we will have to look at the total economics of the fee for the lifetime of the contract, which is generally, I would say, at least 15 years. So in that, it's obviously important that the total project is economical. And then the way we set up our contracts is today generally on the fee-per-barrel, where we are, I would say, insulated against variations in oil price. That means that if it goes down, we don't get hit at all. But again, we are leaving the upside to our customers if oil prices are higher than what is in the assumption.

And there are also some customers that stopped activity during the quarter because they were running out of annual budgets. And these budgets are going to be replenished now in January. In which case, we decided to carry the cost on the resources. So I cannot promise you that we will regain all the losses in Q4, in terms of margins, but lots of actions in place to try to repeat what we've done in LAM over the course of 2015."

But also I think while we look at full year numbers, I think it's also important to keep in mind the, what, 5- or 6-quarter slide we have seen now in international E&P spend, where we have had a significant drop in our revenue from Q4 of 2014 working down to Q4 of this year and into Q1 of '16. So while year-over-year numbers for full year matters, I think it's also important to look at the quarter levels we have now, which is obviously significantly down. And actually, if you do the Q1 revenue consensus for us, based on what you guys as analysts have done, 4x that is already 17% down overall in revenue for us.

Last question. Let me just take overall the currency situation. As far as our international operation, overall, we have a natural hedge, which -- what it means is basically we match the revenue that we get in local currency if it is in line with our local cost and local currencies. It varies between jurisdictions. So in some areas, we lose a bit on the currency, but then gains in other places compensate for it. In 2015, we've seen the numbers. We've lost a lot of revenue because of currency. And almost 20% of the reduction of revenue between 2014 to 2015 was currency, but actually did not impact the margin significantly. So it is all international, yes. There is a bit of Canada, but the rest is outside NAM, and we manage it. As I said, it is natural hedge. We prevent ourselves from taking more local currency than we consume locally for local cost. As far as SPM is concerned, normally, most of our SPM projects actually are dollar-based revenue-wise. And those that have local currency, they will basically reflect the same policy that I just mentioned to you, that we don't take more than what we locally require for our cost, and the third party that it is also bigger in SPM project.

So before we close this morning, I'd just like to summarize the 3 most important points that we have discussed. First, the business environment in the oil industry weakened further in the fourth quarter, leading to additional reductions in both activity and pricing levels and making 2015 the worst industry downturn since 1986. In spite of this, we delivered strong full year performance compared to previous downturns, generating $5 billion in free cash flow and returning $4.6 billion in cash to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In addition, we spent $500 million on technology acquisitions that further broadened our portfolio, and yet we increased our net debt by only $160 million. Second, 2016 will be another challenging year during which we will aim to continue to deliver superior financial results in parallel with pursuing and capitalizing on the broad opportunity set the current market environment presents. We remain constructive in our view on the market outlook for the medium term, and continue to believe that the underlying balance of supply and demand is tightening, driven by growth in demand weakening supply as the massive cuts in E&P investments take further effect and by the size of the annual supply replacement challenge. Lastly, we look forward to closing our merger with Cameron International during the first quarter, where the integration planning is largely complete for day 1, and with antitrust approvals all progressing on track. We are excited about what the combination of our 2 companies will bring and look forward to joining forces with the more than 20,000 Cameron employees. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to continue to weather this downturn better than our surroundings through our global reach, the strength of our technology offering and the extent of our corporate transformation program.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call.First quarter earnings per share was $0.40. Excluding charges recorded in the first and fourth quarters of last year, this represents decreases of $0.25 sequenti",981,"Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call.
First quarter earnings per share was $0.40. Excluding charges recorded in the first and fourth quarters of last year, this represents decreases of $0.25 sequentially and $0.66 when compared to the same quarter last year.
Our first quarter revenue of $6.5 billion decreased 16% sequentially, while pretax operating margin decreased 281 basis points to 14%. These decreases, which were driven by continued activity decline and pricing pressures, resulted in decremental margins of 32%. 
Highlights by product group were as follows: first quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.7 billion decreased 20% sequentially, while margins decreased 480 basis points to 19%, resulting in decremental margins of 43%. These decreases were largely due to seasonally lower software sales and the fall in higher-margin exploration activity. 
Drilling Group revenue of $2.5 billion decreased 16% sequentially, while margin declined 183 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by activity declines across all areas. Despite these declines, decremental margins were limited to 27% on strong cost controls.
Production Group revenue of $2.3 billion decreased 11% sequentially, and margins fell by 335 basis points, primarily on lowered pressure pumping activity and further pricing erosion in North America land. These declines, offset in part by strong contributions from SBM, resulted in decremental margins of 33%.
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 16% in the first quarter compared to 18% in the previous quarter. This decrease was largely driven by the significant sequential drop in pretax operating income we experienced in our North America business.
With these reduced overall levels of pretax income that we are currently experiencing, relatively small changes in our tax expense line will have a disproportionate impact on our ETR. This can make our ETR more volatile as compared to prior years.
Looking forward, the acquisition of Cameron is not expected to have a material impact on our overall ETR. However, due to the sensitivity of the overall geographic earnings mix of the combined business, we do expect an increase in the ETR for the rest of the year as compared to the first quarter.
We generated $1.2 billion of cash flow from operations. This is despite the consumption of working capital that we typically experience during Q1, which is driven by the annual payments associated with employee compensation, as well, the payment of $260 million in severance during the quarter.
Our net debt increased $1.1 billion during the quarter to $6.7 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $14.8 billion.
Cameron had $2.1 billion -- $2.2 billion of cash at closing, and we paid Cameron shareholders $2.8 billion in connection with the transaction. Therefore, we effectively started off the quarter with $14.2 billion of total cash and investments.
During the quarter, we spent $475 million to repurchase 7.1 million shares at an average price of $67.43. 
Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included roughly $550 million on CapEx, $600 million of SBM investments, $170 million of multiclient and $630 million of dividend payments. 
Excluding the impact of Cameron, full year 2015 CapEx is now expected to be approximately $2 billion. This amount does not include investments in SBM for multiclient. Cameron's full year 2016 CapEx is expected to be approximately $200 million, of which $37 million was spent during the first quarter.
Let me take a few minutes to provide some additional financial details relating to the Cameron acquisition, which, as you know, closed on April 1.
In connection with the closing of the transaction, we assumed gross debt with a carrying value of $2.8 billion. During April, we repurchased approximately $1.2 billion of this debt. This, combined with the effect of the purchase accounting adjustment to fair value of the debt, would result in Schlumberger's pretax net interest costs increasing by approximately $13 million third quarter starting in Q2. We still expect pretax synergies to be approximately $300 million over the next 12 months and $600 million in the second year. These numbers consist primarily of costs as opposed to revenue synergies in the first couple of years. However, we remain most excited about the opportunities for revenue synergy, which are very significant or expected to grow considerably in the future year.
Although we are in the process of finalizing our purchase accounting, we estimate that the pretax amortization expense, as a result of fair value adjustment to the acquired assets, will add approximately $65 million on a quarterly basis to our corporate and other expense line. The transaction will be accretive on both an EPS and cash flow basis within the current year. 
As a reminder, going forward, we will be incurring merger and integration-related charges. These will include transaction costs, the cost of integration team, one-off purchase accounting adjustments as well as costs to achieve synergies. This will be most significant in Q2, but they will continue toward the rest of 2016 and into 2017. We will separately call out these charges for you as they are incurred. 
One last item is how we will report Cameron going forward. Since the acquisition of Smith 5 years ago, our groups have served as the primary reporting for SEC purposes. 
Starting in Q2, Cameron will become the fourth [ph] group in this structure, along with our existing Reservoir Characterization, Drilling and Production Groups. Additionally, the revenue of these 4 groups will be combined and reported consistent with Schlumberger's current area structure. However, this will only be revenue reporting, as we will no longer report operating income by area. Paal will further elaborate on the rationale for this change.
Shortly after this call, we will be posting pro forma quarterly financial information in this format, going back to Q1 2013, taking you through Q1 of 2016.
And now I will turn the conference over to Paal."
301966,326965809,961735,"Schlumberger Limited, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Activity fell sharply in the first quarter, as the industry displayed clear signs of facing a full scale cash crisis. We experienced activity reductions worldwide, with the rate of disruption reaching unpreced",2359,"Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Activity fell sharply in the first quarter, as the industry displayed clear signs of facing a full scale cash crisis. We experienced activity reductions worldwide, with the rate of disruption reaching unprecedented levels. The start of a new year and a new budget cycle represented a further fall in customer E&P spend, and we expect the continued weakness in the second quarter, given the magnitude and the erratic nature of the ongoing activity disruptions.
This outlook is backed by the latest 2016 E&P spending surveys, which indicate sharper falls than earlier figures. 
Global spending reductions in 2016 are now approaching 25%, corresponding to a fall of 40% to 50% in North America and around 20% in the International markets.
Our first quarter revenue fell 16% sequentially, a figure that represents the second deepest quarter decline we are seeing in this downturn that has now persisted for 6 straight quarters.
Rig activity fell in all parts of the world, as customers further reduced budgets and continued to exert pressure on product and service pricing, while operations also suffered from project delays and job cancellations.
In North America, revenue fell 25% sequentially, as the U.S. Land rig recount declined by 31%. By the end of the quarter, the U.S. Land rig recount had fallen to around 400, representing a drop of 80% from the peak of October 2014 and marking its third phase of a downturn that is the most severe the industry has seen in 30 years.
The latest fall in activity has been particularly steep, as seen by our North America land revenue, which is 29% lower sequentially on reduced activity and increased pricing pressure, together with the early onset of the Canadian spring breakup.
In spite of this downward acceleration in activity, our new technology sales remain solid, and we also see growing customer recognition for the value of our integrated technology offering. 
North America offshore revenue was down 18% sequentially, driven by lower rig activity and project delays and cancellations. In addition, multiclient seismic sales saw unprecedented low levels, resulting in a negative operating income of $36 million in the first quarter, due to the ongoing amortization of our multiclient library. These loads, combined with the dramatic drop in activity and continued pricing pressure, caused our overall operating margins in North America to fall into negative territories.
Throughout the quarter, we maintained our focus on tailoring costs and resources to activity levels while safeguarding our operational infrastructure and technical capabilities. Needless to say, this approach further reduced the profitability levels. However, our cash flow in North America still remained positive.
Turning to the International markets. Revenue was 13% lower sequentially, as customer budget cuts, project cancellations, seasonal winter slowdowns and foreign exchange weakness versus the U.S. dollar all impacted results. 
Fourth quarter International operating margins slipped to 21%, driven by the significant activity reductions and persisting pricing pressure. 
Europe/CIS & Africa area was the worst affected, while the Latin America and the Middle East & Asia areas were able to maintain flat margins compared to the fourth quarter.
And in total, our International sequential decremental margins improved in the first quarter to 27%.
Looking at the International Areas in more detail. Revenue in Latin America declined 9% sequentially, while pretax operating margins remained steady at 23%, driven by proactive cost management initiated in the previous quarter and the startup of a new integrated project. 
In Argentina, activity softened further in the first quarter, and revenue was also negatively impacted by the weakening of the peso. 
Activity in Brazil and Colombia continues to be in free fall and was, in the first quarter, down 50% and 75%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of last year.
In Ecuador, we are executing well on our SBM projects, with production in Shushufindi exceeding 90,000 barrels per day during the first quarter of. And we continue to invest actively in our integration project in the country.
Revenue in Venezuela was down sequentially, but we did see higher activity in the Faja joint ventures compared to the fourth quarter. 
In Venezuela, the rate of cash collections has been insufficient in recent quarters. And in spite of concerted efforts, together with our main customer, we have been unable to establish new mechanisms that address this issue. Therefore, as we have already announced, we have decided that we would not increase our accounts receivable balance beyond the level reached at the end of the first quarter. This means that activity levels in Venezuela going forward will be aligned with the rate of cash collections from our customers in the country. In doing this, we are working in close coordination with all customers in Venezuela to continue to serve the ones that with available cash flow and to ensure a safe and orderly wind-down of operations for the others.
We have been working in Venezuela since 1929. And in spite of this temporary reduction in activity, we remain committed to the oil and gas industry in the country going forward.
In Europe/CIS & Africa, revenue fell 18% sequentially, while pretax operating margins dropped by 194 basis points to 19%. The drop in revenue was led by Russia and Central Asia, where a further weakening of the ruble and the seasonal winter slowdown, both on land and offshore, impacted results. 
In the North Sea, revenue was also lower due to customer budget cuts, seasonal reductions in activity and also severe weather conditions, while widespread project delays and job cancellations in Sub-Saharan Africa contributed to another significant sequential reduction in revenue in this region.
In the Middle East & Asia, revenue declined by 11% sequentially, while pretax operating margins remained flat at 22%. The sequential drop in revenue was led by Asia, with lower activity in China from the seasonal winter slowdown and also by weaker activity in Australia and the Asia Pacific region as a result of continued customer budget cuts.
First quarter revenue was also down in the Middle East region, where solid activity in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt was more than offset by reductions in the rest of the region. 
In terms of operating margins, the lower activity and pricing pressure seen throughout the area was offset by adjustments to our cost and resource base as well as by further implementation of our transformation program.
Turning now to our technology offering. The Cameron transaction closed on April 1, 2016, and on this date, Cameron became the fourth Schlumberger product group joining our Reservoir Characterization, Drilling and Production Groups.
We are very excited and pleased to welcome the Cameron employees under the leadership of Scott Rowe to Schlumberger. And we are already in full implementation mode of the detailed integration plans we have jointly prepared over the past 7 months.
In terms of financial reporting, Simon has already explained that we will report Cameron financial results as the fourth global group, and also that Cameron's revenue will be consolidated with the rest of the company on a geographical basis under the 4 reporting areas we currently disclose. While we, at the same time, will discontinue the geographical reporting of pretax operating income.
So let me explain the reasoning behind this change.
First, the Cameron Group is a centrally run manufacturing business, built around large plants that address global markets and where customer billings around the world is largely separated from where the costs are incurred. 
Combining the Cameron Group revenue with the rest of the company will therefore give a good representation of customer activity for the entire company. However, Cameron has historically not allocated out the large central cost base because managing these allocations are associated with significant extra workload.
At the same time, the traditional Schlumberger business, although different in nature from Cameron, is also evolving towards a more regional and central setup as part of our ongoing corporate transformation. Our geographical presence from both the customer interaction and welfare execution standpoint will never change and will always remain central to how we run the company. However, the overhead structure that is employed to support our day-to-day customer operations represents a significant part of our cost base, which can be dramatically seemed and reduced through the centralization drive of the transformation program.
Schlumberger is therefore on the a path where there is a growing distance between where we bill our customers and where we incur a large part of our costs. Based on this, we have therefor decided to discontinue the reporting of pretax operating income by the geographical areas.
Beyond this, we will continue to report orders and backlog for the Cameron long-cycle businesses of OneSubsea and drilling and for the West and eco- seismic business.
Next let's move on from financial reporting to new technology. The technical driver behind the Cameron transaction is our belief that the Cameron technologies will be critical enablers in the development of a new generation of integrated surface and subsurface systems that have the potential to make a step change in both drilling and production performance. One example of this is our land drilling system of the future that brings together purpose-built surface and down whole hardware, which is ready to be integrated into a complete drilling system, overseeing and managed by common optimization software that will deliver a step change in operational efficiency.
Cameron brings expertise and technology in the areas of top drives, pipe handling systems and blower preventers, we'll the new system will also draw on the rig design acquisition and rig manufacturing JV we made last year.
5 engineering prototypes of the new system will be ready for field testing in 2016 in Ecuador and the U.S., with full commercial introduction on track for 2017.
Another example is our new hydraulic fracturing system, which will be introduced in 2017, where we will bring together new hardware technologies and significant process reengineering as well as a common operating and optimization software.
This system will span the complete range of service components, such as Cameron's CAMSHALE pressure control and systems, together with our own perforating, fracturing, cleanup and flowback services as well as our latest download completion technology and fracturing fluids.
Both of these systems will initially be deployed within our current CapEx budget of $2 billion for 2016, which itself has been reduced by $400 million from our initial guidance.
Our ability to invest through this unprecedented industry downturn on the back of a strong cash flow and balance sheet enables us to capitalize on the current market conditions to gain significant relative strength compared to our surrounding.
In addition to our traditional CapEx investments, we also continue to invest in new production management projects, leveraging our broad subsurface and integration capabilities. An example of this is the project we started up in Ecuador during the first quarter, where we are building further on the highly successful Shushufindi project, which is now on its fifth year of operation.
Multiclient seismic surveys is another line of business opportunities we continue to invest in, where our current focus is on the exciting basis in Mexico and the largely unexplored areas offshore Mozambique and South Africa. 
As we have in the second quarter, we have a total of 8 3D vessels active and with 3 of these using our unique IsoMetrix technology.
We also continue to make M&A investments in niche technologies that fill gaps in our portfolio or in our ability to develop specific, new services. We mentioned 2 of these in today's release, with one being a noble down Gold Medal metal technology for using our Completions product line, while the other brings expert consulting ability in support of the expansion of our integrated project portfolio.
And finally, we continue to focus on returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks, which combined amounted to $1.1 billion in the first quarter.
Turning now to the short-term outlook. We expect market conditions to worsen further in the second quarter, as customers continue to reduce activities. Excluding the addition of revenue from Cameron, this market outlook, together with our decision to reduce activity in Venezuela, could lead to a sequential percentage fall in revenue for the second quarter, similar to what we saw in Q1. 
Cameron revenue, on the other hand, is expected to be flat sequentially. In this environment, we will continue to tailor service capacity and overhead costs to activity levels while preserving long-term operational and technical capabilities, which will represent a further burden on our operating margins going forward, in particular, in North America. 
Our overall view of the oil markets, however, remains unchanged, where a steady tightening of the supply and demand balance is taking place. 
The latest reports confirm that 2016 demand growth remains solid, while OPEC production levels have been largely tapped since the mid of 2015.
Production in North America continues to fall, as decline rates are becoming more pronounced, while the mature non-OPEC production is now falling in a number of regions. As we navigate this landscape, a number of positive factors make me optimistic and confident with respect to Schlumberger's future. First, the magnitude of the E&P investment cuts are now so severe that it can only accelerate production decline and the consequent upward movement in oil price. 
Second, our financial strength enables us to continue to invest in a range of opportunities across a number of our businesses. 
Third, the master capacity reductions in the service industry will help restore a good part of the international pricing concessions we have made once oil prices and activity levels start to normalize.
And last, while we have reduced capacity significantly, we are safeguarding the core expertise and capabilities of the company beyond our immediate operational requirements. We therefore remain confident in our ability to weather this downturn much better than our surroundings. Through our global reach, the strength of our technology offering, the strategic moves we have made and our corporate transformation program, we are creating the leverage that will enable us to increase revenue market share and continue to produce superior earnings and margins.
Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions."

If you look at non-OPEC production overall, it droid by 930,000 barrels over the course of Q1. About 50% of this was North America, and the other half was International and OPEC. The leading driver outside of the U.S. in terms of this production drop is seen in Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, the U.K. and in China. So 930,000 barrels of drop over the course of Q1 is quite significant. And non-OPEC production is now already 400,000 barrels a day, down year-over-year. So based on this, we believe that the current oversupply is expected to shrink to almost 0 by the end of 2016. And in Q4 this year, non-OPEC production is now forecasted to be down 1 million barrels per day year-over-year. So that basically increases the call on OPEC from today's level to Q4 by 1.8 million barrels a day, which is quite a significant increase. So yes, we believe, and I think we agree with you that the oil market is in the process of balancing."

It is going to be conventional land international, and it's going to be the unconventional land in North America. Both of these resource types are relatively short-cycle businesses.

So the delta here is that we are now counting around 5,500 contractors, which was previously not considered part of our permanent headcount. So our drop was 8,000 in Q1. To your question around how we are managing this, we are obviously rightsizing field capacity continuously. This capacity, we can build back relatively quickly, probably within 12 months. But even in the field capacity, we have introduced a program called Incentivized Leave of Absence. And here, for our senior field engineers and for key operational people, we are dealing them basically half an annual salary, paid 20% upfront when they take this leave of absence and 30% of the salaries paid when they return back after 12 months. And we have several batches of this incentivized leave of absence, where we can call people back in the coming 12 to 18 months. So that's a key part of how we preserve some of our core operational expertise. And then on the overhead and support structure, we continue to look at rightsizing that.

I think if you go on historical ways of responding, I think it's right to say that in previous small and large downturn, the North American players have been quicker and had more investment appetite to grow fast. I think the situation at this stage is somewhat different. There is a potential significant supply challenge over the next couple of years. And part of this will have to be addressed through international increased supply. So I think a number of the players within the Middle East, I think, Russia land, in Western Siberia, all have the capacity, I think, to invest more and have a short-cycle impact on production. Now whether they would do that or not, I think, is still to be seen. But I think given the potential challenges of supply, I don't think North America by itself is going to be able to handle it. It will have to come from other sources as well, in which case, I think, this time around, you will probably see a faster response, in my view, from the International conventional land business as well."

And I think our customers will take a cautiously view in how much they're going to spend as well, given the balance sheet state of many of them, and also the significant kind of volatility that you might also see going forward. So I think you'll see a gradual comeback of investments as oil prices increase, we believe, over the course of the second half of this year. And then it's going to be, I think, a function maybe of how severe the supply situation is going to be. I think that might be a good guide in addition to the movement of the oil price because if supply is clearly weakening, I think it's going to be much safer to increase investments going forward as well, in which case, the appetite might come up together with the oil price. So I think our customers will take a balance but conservative new initially.

So before we close this morning, I would like to summarize the most important points that we have discussed. First, our industry is now in the deepest financial crisis on record, with profitability and cash flow at unsustainable levels for most oil and gas operators. This has created an equally dramatic situation for the service industry. Each successfully reported for the past 18 months has brought increasing customer E&P spend that the productivity and lower demand for oil products and services. This is a tougher environment you've seen for 30 years, and it is like the to get before the market turns. 
Second, so far in this downturn, we have successfully managed the very challenging commercial landscape by balancing margins against market share and busily reducing capacity and overhead costs. In parallel, we continue to focus on how to best preserve the long-term technical capabilities of the company. This approach, together with the benefits of our ongoing conservation program, has enabled us to outperform our surroundings and protect our financials spend. 
And third, the current market presents significant opportunities for companies that have both the required capital and strategic bandwidth that enables them to invest. In this respect so far in this downturn, we have closed our largest-ever acquisition, series of small but very significant investments in specific technology missions and invested in integrated services and projects that will boost our financial performance going forward.
We are also actively investing in prefunded multiclient segment surveys that will underpin the return to solid exploration activity in several regions around the world. 
And we also regard the protection of our technical capabilities at both our immediate operational need as an investment in our future growth. 
In summary, we are convinced of that tightening of the supply-demand balance is well underway. And while the operating environment remains tough, the market presents a range of opportunities, which we will continue to actively pursue. Thank you very much for listening in today."

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call.First quarter earnings per share was $0.40. Excluding charges recorded in the first and fourth quarters of last year, this represents decreases of $0.25 sequenti",979,"Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call.
First quarter earnings per share was $0.40. Excluding charges recorded in the first and fourth quarters of last year, this represents decreases of $0.25 sequentially and $0.66 when compared to the same quarter last year.
Our first quarter revenue of $6.5 billion decreased 16% sequentially, while pretax operating margin decreased 281 basis points to 14%. These decreases, which were driven by continued activity decline and pricing pressures, resulted in decremental margins of 32%. 
Highlights by product group were as follows: First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.7 billion decreased 20% sequentially, while margins decreased 480 basis points to 19%, resulting in decremental margins of 43%. These decreases were largely due to seasonally lower software sales and a fall in higher-margin exploration activity. 
Drilling Group revenue of $2.5 billion decreased 16% sequentially, while margin declined 183 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by activity declines across all areas. Despite these declines, decremental margins were limited to 27% on strong cost controls.
Production Group revenue of $2.3 billion decreased 11% sequentially, and margins fell by 335 basis points, primarily on lowered pressure pumping activity and further pricing erosion in North America land. These declines, offset in part by strong contributions from SPM, resulted in decremental margins of 33%.
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 16% in the first quarter compared to 18% in the previous quarter. This decrease was largely driven by the significant sequential drop in pretax operating income we experienced in our North America business. With these reduced overall levels of pretax income that we are currently experiencing, relatively small changes in our tax expense line will have a disproportionate impact on our ETR. This can make our ETR more volatile as compared to prior years.
Looking forward, the acquisition of Cameron is not expected to have a material impact on our overall ETR. However, due to the sensitivity of the overall geographic earning mix of the combined business, we do expect an increase in the ETR for the rest of the year as compared to the first quarter.
We generated $1.2 billion of cash flow from operations. This is despite the consumption of working capital that we typically experience during Q1, which is driven by the annual payments associated with employee compensation as well the payment of $260 million in severance during the quarter.
Our net debt increased $1.1 billion during the quarter to $6.7 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $14.8 billion.
Cameron had $2.2 billion of cash at closing, and we paid the Cameron shareholders $2.8 billion in connection with the transaction. Therefore, we effectively started off the quarter with $14.2 billion of total cash and investments.
During the quarter, we spent $475 million to repurchase 7.1 million shares at an average price of $67.43 (sic) [$67.34]. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included roughly $550 million on CapEx, $600 million of SPM investments, $170 million of multiclient and $630 million of dividend payments. 
Excluding the impact of Cameron, full year 2015 CapEx is now expected to be approximately $2 billion. This amount does not include investments in SPM for multiclient. Cameron's full year 2016 CapEx is expected to be approximately $200 million, of which $37 million was spent during the first quarter.
Let me take a few minutes to provide some additional financial details relating to the Cameron acquisition, which, as you know, closed on April 1. In connection with the closing of the transaction, we assumed gross debt with a carrying value of $2.8 billion. During April, we repurchased approximately $1.2 billion of this debt. This, combined with the effect of the purchase accounting adjustment to fair value the debt, would result in Schlumberger's pretax net interest cost increasing by approximately $13 million per quarter starting in Q2. We still expect pretax synergies to be approximately $300 million over the next 12 months and $600 million in the second year. These numbers consist primarily of cost as opposed to revenue synergies in the first couple of years. However, we remain most excited about the opportunities for revenue synergies, which are very significant, are expected to grow considerably in the future year.
Although we are in the process of finalizing our purchase accounting, we estimate that the pretax amortization expense, as a result of fair value adjustment to the acquired assets, will add approximately $65 million on a quarterly basis to our corporate and other expense line. The transaction will be accretive on both an EPS and cash flow basis within the current year. 
As a reminder, going forward, we will be incurring merger and integration-related charges. These will include transaction costs, the cost of integration team, one-off purchase accounting adjustments as well as costs to achieve synergies. This will be most significant in Q2, but they will continue for the rest of 2016 and into 2017. We will separately call out these charges for you as they are incurred.
One last item is how we will report Cameron going forward. Since the acquisition of Smith 5 years ago, our groups have served as the primary reporting for SEC purposes. Starting in Q2, Cameron will become the fourth group in this structure, along with our existing Reservoir Characterization, Drilling and Production Groups. Additionally, the revenue of these 4 groups will be combined and reported consistent with Schlumberger's current area structure. However, this will only be revenue reporting as we will no longer report operating income by area. Paal will further elaborate on the rationale for this change. Shortly after this call, we will be posting pro forma quarterly financial information in this format, going back to Q1 2013, taking you through Q1 of 2016.
And now I will turn the conference over to Paal."
301966,326965809,961954,"Schlumberger Limited, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Activity fell sharply in the first quarter, as the industry displayed clear signs of facing a full-scale cash crisis. We experienced activity reductions worldwide, with the rate of disruption reaching unpreced",2357,"Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Activity fell sharply in the first quarter, as the industry displayed clear signs of facing a full-scale cash crisis. We experienced activity reductions worldwide, with the rate of disruption reaching unprecedented levels. The start of a new year and a new budget cycle represented a further fall in customer E&P spend, and we expect a continued weakening in the second quarter, given the magnitude and the erratic nature of the ongoing activity disruptions. 
This outlook is backed by the latest 2016 E&P spending surveys, which indicate sharper falls than earlier figures. Global spending reductions in 2016 are now approaching 25%, corresponding to a fall of 40% to 50% in North America and around 20% in the international markets.
Our first quarter revenue fell 16% sequentially, a figure that represents the second steepest quarter decline we have seen in this downturn that has now persisted for 6 straight quarters. Rig activity fell in all parts of the world, as customers further reduced budgets and continued to exert pressure on product and service pricing, while operations also suffered from project delays and job cancellations.
In North America, revenue fell 25% sequentially, as the U.S. land rig recount declined by 31%. By the end of the quarter, the U.S. land rig count had fallen to around 400, representing a drop of 80% from the peak of October 2014 and marking a third phase of a downturn that is the most severe the industry has seen in 30 years.
The latest fall in activity has been particularly steep, as seen by our North America land revenue, which is 29% lower sequentially on reduced activity and increased pricing pressure, together with the early onset of the Canadian spring break-up. In spite of this downward acceleration in activity, our new technology sales remain solid, and we also see growing customer recognition for the value of our integrated technology offering. 
North America offshore revenue was down 18% sequentially, driven by lower rig activity and project delays and cancellations. In addition, multiclient seismic sales saw unprecedented low levels, resulting in a negative operating income of $36 million in the first quarter due to the ongoing amortization of our multiclient library. This loss, combined with the dramatic drop in activity and continued pricing pressure, caused our overall operating margins in North America to fall into negative territory.
Throughout the quarter, we maintained our focus on tailoring costs and resources to activity levels while safeguarding our operational infrastructure and technical capabilities. Needless to say, this approach further reduced our profitability levels. However, our cash flow in North America still remained positive.
Turning to the international markets. Revenue was 13% lower sequentially, as customer budget cuts, project cancellations, seasonal winter slowdowns and foreign exchange weakness versus the U.S. dollar all impacted results. Fourth quarter international operating margins slipped to 21%, driven by the significant activity reductions and persisting pricing pressure. Europe/CIS and Africa area was the worst affected, while the Latin America and the Middle East & Asia Areas were able to maintain flat margins compared to the fourth quarter. And in total, our international sequential decremental margins improved in the first quarter to 27%.
Looking at the International Areas in more detail. Revenue in Latin America declined 9% sequentially, while pretax operating margins remained steady at 23%, driven by proactive cost management initiated in the previous quarter and the startup of a new integrated project. In Argentina, activity softened further in the first quarter, and revenue was also negatively impacted by the weakening of the peso. Activity in Brazil and Colombia continues to be in free fall and was, in the first quarter, down 50% and 75%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of last year. In Ecuador, we are executing well on our SPM projects, with production in Shushufindi exceeding 90,000 barrels per day during the first quarter, and we continue to invest actively in our integration projects in the country. Revenue in Venezuela was down sequentially, but we did see higher activity in the Faja joint ventures compared to the fourth quarter. 
In Venezuela, the rate of cash collections has been insufficient in recent quarters. And in spite of concerted efforts, together with our main customer, we have been unable to establish new mechanisms that address this issue. Therefore, as we have already announced, we have decided that we would not increase our accounts receivable balance beyond the level reached at the end of the first quarter. This means that activity levels in Venezuela going forward will be aligned with the rate of cash collections from our customers in the country. In doing this, we are working in close coordination with all customers in Venezuela to continue to serve the ones with available cash flow and to ensure a safe and orderly wind down of operations for the others. We have been working in Venezuela since 1929. And in spite of this temporary reduction in activity, we remain committed to the oil and gas industry in the country going forward.
In Europe/CIS and Africa, revenue fell 18% sequentially, while pretax operating margins dropped by 194 basis points to 19%. The drop in revenue was led by Russia and Central Asia, where a further weakening of the ruble and the seasonal winter slowdown, both on land and offshore, impacted results. In the North Sea, revenue was also lower due to customer budget cuts, seasonal reductions in activity and also severe weather conditions, while widespread project delays and job cancellations in Sub-Saharan Africa contributed to another significant sequential reduction in revenue in this region.
In the Middle East & Asia, revenue declined by 11% sequentially, while pretax operating margins remained flat at 22%. The sequential drop in revenue was led by Asia, with lower activity in China from the seasonal winter slowdown and also by weaker activity in Australia and the Asia Pacific region as a result of continued customer budget cuts. First quarter revenue was also down in the Middle East region, where solid activity in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt was more than offset by reductions in the rest of the region. In terms of operating margin, the lower activity and pricing pressure seen throughout the area was offset by adjustments to our cost and resource base as well as by further implementation of our transformation program.
Turning now to our technology offering. The Cameron transaction closed on April 1, 2016, and on this date, Cameron became the fourth Schlumberger product group, joining our Reservoir Characterization, Drilling and Production Groups. We are very excited and pleased to welcome the Cameron employees, under the leadership of Scott Rowe, to Schlumberger. And we are already in full implementation mode of the detailed integration plans we have jointly prepared over the past 7 months.
In terms of financial reporting, Simon has already explained that we will report Cameron financial results as a fourth global group, and also that Cameron's revenue will be consolidated with the rest of the company on a geographical basis under the 4 reporting areas we currently disclose. While we, at the same time, will discontinue the geographical reporting of pretax operating income. So let me explain the reasoning behind this change.
First, the Cameron Group is a centrally run manufacturing business, built around large plants that address global markets and where customer billings around the world is largely separated from where the costs are incurred. Combining the Cameron Group revenue with the rest of the company will, therefore, give a good representation of customer activity for the entire company. However, Cameron has historically not allocated out the large central cost base because managing these allocations are associated with significant extra workload.
At the same time, the traditional Schlumberger business, although different in nature from Cameron, is also evolving towards a more regional and central setup as part of our ongoing corporate transformation. Our geographical presence from both a customer interaction and welfare execution standpoint will never change and will always remain central to how we run the company. However, the overhead structure that is employed to support our day-to-day customer operations represents a significant part of our cost base, which can be dramatically streamlined and reduced through the centralization drive of the transformation program.
Schlumberger is, therefore, also on a path where there is a growing distance between where we bill our customers and where we incur a large part of our costs. Based on this, we have, therefore, decided to discontinue the reporting of pretax operating income by the geographical areas. Beyond this, we will continue to report orders and backlog for the Cameron long-cycle businesses of OneSubsea and drilling and for the WesternGeco seismic business.
Next, let's move on from financial reporting to new technology. The technical driver behind the Cameron transaction is our belief that the Cameron technologies will be critical enablers in the development of a new generation of integrated surface and subsurface systems that have the potential to make a step change in both drilling and production performance. One example of this is our land drilling system of the future that brings together purpose-built surface and downhole hardware, which is ready to be integrated into a complete drilling system, overseen and managed by a common optimization software that will deliver a step change in operational efficiency. Cameron brings expertise and technology in the areas of topdrives, pipe handling systems and blowout preventers, while the new system will also draw on the rig design acquisition and rig manufacturing JV we made last year. Five engineering prototypes of the new system will be ready for field testing in 2016 in Ecuador and the U.S., with full commercial introduction on track for 2017.
Another example is our new hydraulic fracturing system, which will be introduced in 2017, where we will bring together new hardware technologies and significant process reengineering as well as a common operating and optimization software. This system will span the complete range of surface components, such as Cameron's CAMSHALE pressure control and wellhead systems, together with our own perforating, fracturing, cleanup and flowback services as well as our latest downhole completion technology and fracturing fluids. Both of these systems will initially be deployed within our current CapEx budget of $2 billion for 2016, which itself has been reduced by $400 million from our initial guidance.
Our ability to invest through this unprecedented industry downturn on the back of a strong cash flow and balance sheet enables us to capitalize on the current market conditions to gain significant relative strength compared to our surrounding. In addition to our traditional CapEx investments, we also continue to invest in new production management projects, leveraging our broad subsurface and integration capabilities. An example of this is the Auca project we started up in Ecuador during the first quarter, where we are building further on the highly successful Shushufindi project, which is now on its fifth year of operation.
Multiclient seismic surveys is another line of business opportunities we continue to invest in, where our current focus is on the exciting Campeche Basin in Mexico and the largely unexplored areas offshore Mozambique and South Africa. As we have in the second quarter, we have a total of 8 3D vessels active and with 3 of these using our unique IsoMetrix technology.
We also continue to make M&A investments in niche technologies that fill gaps in our portfolio or in our ability to develop specific new services. We mentioned 2 of these in today's release, with one being a novel downhole metal-to-metal seal technology for use in our completions product line, while the other brings expert consulting ability in support of the expansion of our integrated project portfolio. And finally, we continue to focus on returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks, which combined, amounted to $1.1 billion in the first quarter.
Turning now to the short-term outlook. We expect market conditions to worsen further in the second quarter, as customers continue to reduce activity. Excluding the addition of revenue from Cameron, this market outlook, together with our decision to reduce activity in Venezuela, could lead to a sequential percentage fall in revenue for the second quarter, similar to what we saw in Q1. Cameron revenue, on the other hand, is expected to be flat sequentially. In this environment, we will continue to tailor service capacity and overhead costs to activity levels while preserving long-term operational and technical capabilities, which will represent a further burden on our operating margins going forward, in particular, in North America. Our overall view of the oil markets, however, remain unchanged, where a steady tightening of the supply and demand balance is taking place. 
The latest reports confirm that 2016 demand growth remains solid, while OPEC production levels have been largely flat since the mid of 2015. Production in North America continues to fall, as decline rates are becoming more pronounced, while the mature non-OPEC production is now falling in a number of regions. 
As we navigate this landscape, a number of positive factors make me optimistic and confident with respect to Schlumberger's future. First, the magnitude of the E&P investment cuts are now so severe that it can only accelerate production decline and the consequent upward movement in oil price. Second, our financial strength enables us to continue to invest in a range of opportunities across a number of our businesses. Third, the massive capacity reductions in the service industry will help restore a good part of the international pricing concessions we have made once oil prices and activity levels start to normalize. And last, while we have reduced capacity significantly, we are safeguarding the core expertise and capabilities of the company beyond our immediate operational requirements. We, therefore, remain confident in our ability to weather this downturn much better than our surroundings. Through our global reach, the strength of our technology offering, the strategic moves we have made and our corporate transformation program, we are creating the leverage that will enable us to increase revenue market share and continue to produce superior earning and margins.
Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions."

If you look at non-OPEC production overall, it dropped by 930,000 barrels over the course of Q1. About 50% of this was North America, and the other half was international and OPEC. The leading driver outside of the U.S. in terms of this production drop is seen in Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, the U.K. and in China. So 930,000 barrels of drop over the course of Q1 is quite significant. And non-OPEC production is now already 400,000 barrels a day, down year-over-year. So based on this, we believe that the current oversupply is expected to shrink to almost 0 by the end of 2016. And in Q4 this year, non-OPEC production is now forecasted to be down 1 million barrels per day year-over-year. So that basically increases the call on OPEC from today's level to Q4 by 1.8 million barrels a day, which is quite a significant increase. So yes, we believe, and I think we agree with you, that the oil market is in the process of balancing."

Maybe I can just clarify one thing first. So if you look at our reported headcount numbers, we had -- we reported at the end of Q4 95,000 people, and we reported 93,000 people at this stage, which indicates that we let go another 2,000 people during Q1. We actually released another 8,000 people during the first quarter. So we have now reduced our workforce by around 42,000 people from the peak in 2014. So the delta here is that we are now counting around 5,500 contractors, which was previously not considered part of our permanent headcount. So our drop was 8,000 in Q1. Now to your question around how we are managing this, we are obviously rightsizing field capacity continuously. This capacity, we can build back relatively quickly, probably within 12 months. But even in the field capacity, we have introduced a program called incentivized leave of absence. And here, for our senior field engineers and for key operational people, we are dealing them basically half an annual salary, paid 20% upfront when they take this leave of absence, and 30% of the salary is paid when they return back after 12 months. And we have several batches of this incentivized leave of absence, where we can call people back in the coming 12 to 18 months. So that's a key part of how we preserve some of our core operational expertise. And then on the overhead and support structure, we continue to look at rightsizing that. But in this, our technical support organization, which takes a long time to develop, we are also ring fencing that to make sure that we have these people available as we get back into growth mode."

What we see in certain markets, certain basins in North America and also certain markets in international, that activity is coming down to basically critical-mark type of levels. And at that stage, it is not only about focusing in on cost reductions and managing margins. We are also considering what the startup costs again would be in the event we have to shut everything up. So in certain cases, we are carrying, I would say, contracts and operations losses for certain regions, where we believe that's a better investment than actually shutting down and then having the lag in time and significant costs to start things back up again.

So in that environment, there is still a big job for the industry to make sure that we can bring cost per barrel down to make projects viable in these pricing ranges as well as having enough projects to generate supply that can meet future demand. So it is an opportunity for companies like ourselves to work closely with our customers in collaborative ways, where we look at jointly with them, driving costs out of the system and production up from the assets that they have. And I think by having this focus, there is an opportunity for the industry to be quite successful in the ""medium-for-longer"" scenario, but we cannot continue to operate in the same way that we have done in the past.

It still means that we have offsite potential when these investments start, but we also have a very good presence, both in North America land and even more so in the international land conventional market. So in any situation where the investments are coming, and they will have to come, we are very well positioned to capture our share of them and generate earnings growth from the onset of the increase.

We would have to reactivate new capacity in order to take on significantly more work. 
Thank you very much. So before we close this morning, I would like to summarize the most important points that we've discussed. First, our industry is now in the deepest financial crisis on record, with profitability and cash flow at unsustainable levels for most oil and gas operators. This has created an equally dramatic situation for the service industry. Each successive quarter for the past 18 months has brought increasing cuts in E&P spend that have led to falling activity and lower demand for oilfield products and services. This is the toughest environment we have seen for 30 years, and it is likely to get even tougher before the market turns. 
Second, so far in this downturn, we have successfully managed the very challenging commercial landscape by balancing margins against market share and aggressively reducing capacity and overhead costs. In parallel, we continue to focus on how to best preserve the long-term technical capabilities of the company. This approach, together with the benefits of our ongoing conservation program, has enabled us to outperform our surroundings and protect our financial strength. 
And third, the current market presents significant opportunities for companies that has both the required capital and strategic bandwidth that enables them to invest. In this respect so far in this downturn, we have closed our largest-ever acquisition, made a series of small but very significant investments in specific technology niches and invested in integrated services and projects that will boost our financial performance going forward. We are also actively investing in prefunded multiclient seismic surveys that will underpin a return to solid exploration activity in several regions around the world. And we also regard the protection of our technical capabilities above our immediate operational need as an investment in our future growth. 
In summary, we remain convinced that the tightening of the supply-demand balance is well underway. And while the operating environment remains tough, the market presents a range of opportunities, which we will continue to actively pursue. Thank you very much for listening in today."

Excluding charges recorded in the first and fourth quarters of last year, this represents decreases of $0.25 sequenti",979,"Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call.
First quarter earnings per share was $0.40. Excluding charges recorded in the first and fourth quarters of last year, this represents decreases of $0.25 sequentially and $0.66 when compared to the same quarter last year.
Our first quarter revenue of $6.5 billion decreased 16% sequentially, while pretax operating margin decreased 281 basis points to 14%. These decreases, which were driven by continued activity decline and pricing pressures, resulted in decremental margins of 32%. 
Highlights by product group were as follows: First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.7 billion decreased 20% sequentially, while margins decreased 480 basis points to 19%, resulting in decremental margins of 43%. These decreases were largely due to seasonally lower software sales and a fall in higher-margin exploration activity. 
Drilling Group revenue of $2.5 billion decreased 16% sequentially, while margin declined 183 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by activity declines across all areas. Despite these declines, decremental margins were limited to 27% on strong cost controls.
Production Group revenue of $2.3 billion decreased 11% sequentially, and margins fell by 335 basis points, primarily on lowered pressure pumping activity and further pricing erosion in North America land. These declines, offset in part by strong contributions from SPM, resulted in decremental margins of 33%.
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 16% in the first quarter compared to 18% in the previous quarter. This decrease was largely driven by the significant sequential drop in pretax operating income we experienced in our North America business. With these reduced overall levels of pretax income that we are currently experiencing, relatively small changes in our tax expense line will have a disproportionate impact on our ETR. This can make our ETR more volatile as compared to prior years.
Looking forward, the acquisition of Cameron is not expected to have a material impact on our overall ETR. However, due to the sensitivity of the overall geographic earning mix of the combined business, we do expect an increase in the ETR for the rest of the year as compared to the first quarter.
We generated $1.2 billion of cash flow from operations. This is despite the consumption of working capital that we typically experience during Q1, which is driven by the annual payments associated with employee compensation as well the payment of $260 million in severance during the quarter.
Our net debt increased $1.1 billion during the quarter to $6.7 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $14.8 billion.
Cameron had $2.2 billion of cash at closing, and we paid the Cameron shareholders $2.8 billion in connection with the transaction. Therefore, we effectively started off the quarter with $14.2 billion of total cash and investments.
During the quarter, we spent $475 million to repurchase 7.1 million shares at an average price of $67.43 (sic) [$67.34]. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included roughly $550 million on CapEx, $600 million of SPM investments, $170 million of multiclient and $630 million of dividend payments. 
Excluding the impact of Cameron, full year 2015 CapEx is now expected to be approximately $2 billion. This amount does not include investments in SPM for multiclient. Cameron's full year 2016 CapEx is expected to be approximately $200 million, of which $37 million was spent during the first quarter.
Let me take a few minutes to provide some additional financial details relating to the Cameron acquisition, which, as you know, closed on April 1. In connection with the closing of the transaction, we assumed gross debt with a carrying value of $2.8 billion. During April, we repurchased approximately $1.2 billion of this debt. This, combined with the effect of the purchase accounting adjustment to fair value the debt, would result in Schlumberger's pretax net interest cost increasing by approximately $13 million per quarter starting in Q2. We still expect pretax synergies to be approximately $300 million over the next 12 months and $600 million in the second year. These numbers consist primarily of cost as opposed to revenue synergies in the first couple of years. However, we remain most excited about the opportunities for revenue synergies, which are very significant, are expected to grow considerably in the future year.
Although we are in the process of finalizing our purchase accounting, we estimate that the pretax amortization expense, as a result of fair value adjustment to the acquired assets, will add approximately $65 million on a quarterly basis to our corporate and other expense line. The transaction will be accretive on both an EPS and cash flow basis within the current year. 
As a reminder, going forward, we will be incurring merger and integration-related charges. These will include transaction costs, the cost of integration team, one-off purchase accounting adjustments as well as costs to achieve synergies. This will be most significant in Q2, but they will continue for the rest of 2016 and into 2017. We will separately call out these charges for you as they are incurred.
One last item is how we will report Cameron going forward. Since the acquisition of Smith 5 years ago, our groups have served as the primary reporting for SEC purposes. Starting in Q2, Cameron will become the fourth group in this structure, along with our existing Reservoir Characterization, Drilling and Production Groups. Additionally, the revenue of these 4 groups will be combined and reported consistent with Schlumberger's current area structure. However, this will only be revenue reporting as we will no longer report operating income by area. Paal will further elaborate on the rationale for this change. Shortly after this call, we will be posting pro forma quarterly financial information in this format, going back to Q1 2013, taking you through Q1 of 2016.
And now I will turn the conference over to Paal."
301966,326965809,962042,"Schlumberger Limited, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Activity fell sharply in the first quarter, as the industry displayed clear signs of facing a full-scale cash crisis.

Activity fell sharply in the first quarter, as the industry displayed clear signs of facing a full-scale cash crisis. We experienced activity reductions worldwide, with the rate of disruption reaching unprecedented levels. The start of a new year and a new budget cycle represented a further fall in customer E&P spend, and we expect a continued weakening in the second quarter, given the magnitude and the erratic nature of the ongoing activity disruptions. 
This outlook is backed by the latest 2016 E&P spending surveys, which indicate sharper falls than earlier figures. Global spending reductions in 2016 are now approaching 25%, corresponding to a fall of 40% to 50% in North America and around 20% in the international markets.
Our first quarter revenue fell 16% sequentially, a figure that represents the second steepest quarter decline we have seen in this downturn that has now persisted for 6 straight quarters. Rig activity fell in all parts of the world, as customers further reduced budgets and continued to exert pressure on product and service pricing, while operations also suffered from project delays and job cancellations.
In North America, revenue fell 25% sequentially, as the U.S. land rig count declined by 31%. By the end of the quarter, the U.S. land rig count had fallen to around 400, representing a drop of 80% from the peak of October 2014 and marking a third phase of a downturn that is the most severe the industry has seen in 30 years.
The latest fall in activity has been particularly steep, as seen by our North America land revenue, which is 29% lower sequentially on reduced activity and increased pricing pressure, together with the early onset of the Canadian spring break-up. In spite of this downward acceleration in activity, our new technology sales remain solid, and we also see growing customer recognition for the value of our integrated technology offering. 
North America offshore revenue was down 18% sequentially, driven by lower rig activity and project delays and cancellations. In addition, multiclient seismic sales saw unprecedented low levels, resulting in a negative operating income of $36 million in the first quarter due to the ongoing amortization of our multiclient library. This loss, combined with the dramatic drop in activity and continued pricing pressure, caused our overall operating margins in North America to fall into negative territory.
Throughout the quarter, we maintained our focus on tailoring costs and resources to activity levels while safeguarding our operational infrastructure and technical capabilities. Needless to say, this approach further reduced our profitability levels. However, our cash flow in North America still remained positive.
Turning to the international markets. Revenue was 13% lower sequentially, as customer budget cuts, project cancellations, seasonal winter slowdowns and foreign exchange weakness versus the U.S. dollar all impacted results. Fourth quarter international operating margins slipped to 21%, driven by the significant activity reductions and persisting pricing pressure. Europe/CIS and Africa area was the worst affected, while the Latin America and the Middle East & Asia Areas were able to maintain flat margins compared to the fourth quarter. And in total, our international sequential decremental margins improved in the first quarter to 27%.
Looking at the International Areas in more detail. Revenue in Latin America declined 9% sequentially, while pretax operating margins remained steady at 23%, driven by proactive cost management initiated in the previous quarter and the startup of a new integrated project. In Argentina, activity softened further in the first quarter, and revenue was also negatively impacted by the weakening of the peso. Activity in Brazil and Colombia continues to be in free fall and was, in the first quarter, down 50% and 75%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of last year. In Ecuador, we are executing well on our SPM projects, with production in Shushufindi exceeding 90,000 barrels per day during the first quarter, and we continue to invest actively in our integration projects in the country. Revenue in Venezuela was down sequentially, but we did see higher activity in the Faja joint ventures compared to the fourth quarter. 
In Venezuela, the rate of cash collections has been insufficient in recent quarters. And in spite of concerted efforts, together with our main customer, we have been unable to establish new mechanisms that address this issue. Therefore, as we have already announced, we have decided that we will not increase our accounts receivable balance beyond the level reached at the end of the first quarter. This means that activity levels in Venezuela going forward will be aligned with the rate of cash collections from our customers in the country. In doing this, we are working in close coordination with all customers in Venezuela to continue to serve the ones with available cash flow and to ensure a safe and orderly wind down of operations for the others. We have been working in Venezuela since 1929. And in spite of this temporary reduction in activity, we remain committed to the oil and gas industry in the country going forward.
In Europe/CIS and Africa, revenue fell 18% sequentially, while pretax operating margins dropped by 194 basis points to 19%. The drop in revenue was led by Russia and Central Asia, where a further weakening of the ruble and the seasonal winter slowdown, both on land and offshore, impacted results. In the North Sea, revenue was also lower due to customer budget cuts, seasonal reductions in activity and also severe weather conditions, while widespread project delays and job cancellations in Sub-Saharan Africa contributed to another significant sequential reduction in revenue in this region.
In the Middle East & Asia, revenue declined by 11% sequentially, while pretax operating margins remained flat at 22%. The sequential drop in revenue was led by Asia, with lower activity in China from the seasonal winter slowdown and also by weaker activity in Australia and the Asia Pacific region as a result of continued customer budget cuts. First quarter revenue was also down in the Middle East region, where solid activity in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt was more than offset by reductions in the rest of the region. In terms of operating margins, the lower activity and pricing pressure seen throughout the area was offset by adjustments to our cost and resource base as well as by further implementation of our transformation program.
Turning now to our technology offering. The Cameron transaction closed on April 1, 2016, and on this date, Cameron became the fourth Schlumberger product group, joining our Reservoir Characterization, Drilling and Production Groups. We are very excited and pleased to welcome the Cameron employees, under the leadership of Scott Rowe, to Schlumberger. And we are already in full implementation mode of the detailed integration plans we have jointly prepared over the past 7 months.
In terms of financial reporting, Simon has already explained that we will report Cameron financial results as a fourth global group, and also that Cameron's revenue will be consolidated with the rest of the company on a geographical basis under the 4 reporting areas we currently disclose. While we, at the same time, will discontinue the geographical reporting of pretax operating income. So let me explain the reasoning behind this change.
First, the Cameron Group is a centrally run manufacturing business, built around large plants that address global markets and where customer billings around the world is largely separated from where the costs are incurred. Combining the Cameron Group revenue with the rest of the company will, therefore, give a good representation of customer activity for the entire company. However, Cameron has historically not allocated out the large central cost base because managing these allocations are associated with significant extra workload.
At the same time, the traditional Schlumberger business, although different in nature from Cameron, is also evolving towards a more regional and central setup as part of our ongoing corporate transformation. Our geographical presence from both a customer interaction and welfare execution standpoint will never change and will always remain central to how we run the company. However, the overhead structure that is employed to support our day-to-day customer operations represents a significant part of our cost base, which can be dramatically streamlined and reduced through the centralization drive of the transformation program.
Schlumberger is, therefore, also on a path where there is a growing distance between where we bill our customers and where we incur a large part of our costs. Based on this, we have, therefore, decided to discontinue the reporting of pretax operating income by the geographical areas. Beyond this, we will continue to report orders and backlog for the Cameron long-cycle businesses of OneSubsea and drilling and for the WesternGeco seismic business.
Next, let's move on from financial reporting to new technology. The technical driver behind the Cameron transaction is our belief that the Cameron technologies will be critical enablers in the development of a new generation of integrated surface and subsurface systems that have the potential to make a step change in both drilling and production performance. One example of this is our land drilling system of the future that brings together purpose-built surface and downhole hardware, which is ready to be integrated into a complete drilling system, overseen and managed by a common optimization software that will deliver a step change in operational efficiency. Cameron brings expertise and technology in the areas of topdrives, pipe handling systems and blowout preventers, while the new system will also draw on the rig design acquisition and rig manufacturing JV we made last year. Five engineering prototypes of the new system will be ready for field testing in 2016 in Ecuador and the U.S., with full commercial introduction on track for 2017.
Another example is our new hydraulic fracturing system, which will be introduced in 2017, where we will bring together new hardware technologies and significant process reengineering as well as a common operating and optimization software. This system will span the complete range of surface components, such as Cameron's CAMSHALE pressure control and wellhead systems, together with our own perforating, fracturing, cleanup and flowback services as well as our latest downhole completion technology and fracturing fluids. Both of these systems will initially be deployed within our current CapEx budget of $2 billion for 2016, which itself has been reduced by $400 million from our initial guidance.
Our ability to invest through this unprecedented industry downturn on the back of a strong cash flow and balance sheet enables us to capitalize on the current market conditions to gain significant relative strength compared to our surroundings. In addition to our traditional CapEx investments, we also continue to invest in new production management projects, leveraging our broad subsurface and integration capabilities. An example of this is the Auca project we started up in Ecuador during the first quarter, where we are building further on the highly successful Shushufindi project, which is now on its fifth year of operation.
Multiclient seismic surveys is another line of business opportunities we continue to invest in, where our current focus is on the exciting Campeche Basin in Mexico and the largely unexplored areas offshore Mozambique and South Africa. As we have in the second quarter, we have a total of 8 3D vessels active and with 3 of these using our unique IsoMetrix technology.
We also continue to make M&A investments in niche technologies that fill gaps in our portfolio or in our ability to develop specific new services. We mentioned 2 of these in today's release, with one being a novel downhole metal-to-metal seal technology for use in our completions product line, while the other brings expert consulting ability in support of the expansion of our integrated project portfolio. And finally, we continue to focus on returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks, which combined, amounted to $1.1 billion in the first quarter.
Turning now to the short-term outlook. We expect market conditions to worsen further in the second quarter, as customers continue to reduce activity. Excluding the addition of revenue from Cameron, this market outlook, together with our decision to reduce activity in Venezuela, could lead to a sequential percentage fall in revenue for the second quarter, similar to what we saw in Q1. Cameron revenue, on the other hand, is expected to be flat sequentially. In this environment, we will continue to tailor service capacity and overhead costs to activity levels while preserving long-term operational and technical capabilities, which will represent a further burden on our operating margins going forward, in particular, in North America. Our overall view of the oil markets, however, remain unchanged, where a steady tightening of the supply and demand balance is taking place. 
The latest reports confirm that 2016 demand growth remains solid, while OPEC production levels have been largely flat since the mid of 2015. Production in North America continues to fall, as decline rates are becoming more pronounced, while the mature non-OPEC production is now falling in a number of regions. 
As we navigate this landscape, a number of positive factors make me optimistic and confident with respect to Schlumberger's future. First, the magnitude of the E&P investment cuts are now so severe that it can only accelerate production decline and the consequent upward movement in oil price. Second, our financial strength enables us to continue to invest in a range of opportunities across a number of our businesses. Third, the massive capacity reductions in the service industry will help restore a good part of the international pricing concessions we have made once oil prices and activity levels start to normalize. And last, while we have reduced capacity significantly, we are safeguarding the core expertise and capabilities of the company beyond our immediate operational requirements. We, therefore, remain confident in our ability to weather this downturn much better than our surroundings. Through our global reach, the strength of our technology offering, the strategic moves we have made and our corporate transformation program, we are creating the leverage that will enable us to increase revenue market share and continue to produce superior earnings and margins.
Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions."

If you look at non-OPEC production overall, it dropped by 930,000 barrels over the course of Q1. About 50% of this was North America, and the other half was international and OPEC. The leading driver outside of the U.S. in terms of this production drop is seen in Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, the U.K. and in China. So 930,000 barrels of drop over the course of Q1 is quite significant. And non-OPEC production is now already 400,000 barrels a day, down year-over-year. So based on this, we believe that the current oversupply is expected to shrink to almost 0 by the end of 2016. And in Q4 of this year, non-OPEC production is now forecasted to be down 1 million barrels per day year-over-year. So that basically increases the call on OPEC from today's level to Q4 by 1.8 million barrels a day, which is quite a significant increase. So yes, we believe, and I think we agree with you, that the oil market is in the process of balancing."

And if you look at new investments that are relatively short cycle, there are 2 sources of that. It is going to be conventional land international, and it's going to be the unconventional land in North America. Both of these resource types are relatively short-cycle businesses, and production coming out of them is just going to be a function of the investment appetite. So I think the sources of additional production for 2017 is limited to these items that I just mentioned. And beyond that, I think we need a widespread, significant increase in E&P investments to get supply back to where it can meet growing demand."

So the delta here is that we are now counting around 5,500 contractors, which was previously not considered part of our permanent headcount. So our drop was 8,000 in Q1. Now to your question around how we are managing this, we are obviously rightsizing field capacity continuously. This capacity, we can build back relatively quickly, probably within 12 months. But even in the field capacity, we have introduced a program called incentivized leave of absence. And here, for our senior field engineers and for key operational people, we are giving them basically half an annual salary, paid 20% upfront when they take this leave of absence, and 30% of the salary is paid when they return back after 12 months. And we have several batches of this incentivized leave of absence, where we can call people back in the coming 12 to 18 months. So that's a key part of how we preserve some of our core operational expertise. And then on the overhead and support structure, we continue to look at rightsizing that.

And then it's going to be, I think, a function maybe of how severe the supply situation is going to be. I think that might be a good guide in addition to the movement of the oil price. Because if supply is clearly weakening, I think it's going to be much safer to increase investments going forward as well, in which case, the appetite might come up together with the oil price. So I think our customers will take a balanced but conservative view initially. And I think the appetite might increase as we see how severe the impact on supply is going to be as the rest of this year evolves."

We would have to reactivate new capacity in order to take on significantly more work. 
Thank you very much. So before we close this morning, I would like to summarize the most important points that we've discussed. First, our industry is now in the deepest financial crisis on record, with profitability and cash flow at unsustainable levels for most oil and gas operators. This has created an equally dramatic situation for the service industry. Each successive quarter for the past 18 months has brought increasing cuts in E&P spend that have led to falling activity and lower demand for oilfield products and services. This is the toughest environment we have seen for 30 years, and it is likely to get even tougher before the market turns. 
Second, so far in this downturn, we have successfully managed the very challenging commercial landscape by balancing margins against market share and aggressively reducing capacity and overhead costs. In parallel, we continue to focus on how to best preserve the long-term technical capabilities of the company. This approach, together with the benefits of our ongoing transformation program, has enabled us to outperform our surroundings and protect our financial strength. 
And third, the current market presents significant opportunities for companies that has both the required capital and strategic bandwidth that enables them to invest. In this respect so far in this downturn, we have closed our largest-ever acquisition, made a series of smaller but still very significant investments in specific technology niches and invested in integrated services and projects that will boost our financial performance going forward. We are also actively investing in prefunded multiclient seismic surveys that will underpin a return to solid exploration activity in several regions around the world. And we also regard the protection of our technical capabilities above our immediate operational need as an investment in our future growth. 
In summary, we remain convinced that the tightening of the supply-demand balance is well underway. And while the operating environment remains tough, the market presents a range of opportunities, which we will continue to actively pursue. Thank you very much for listening in today."

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.23.

Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.23. This represent decreases of $0.17 sequentially and $0.65 when compared to the same quarter last year. 
During the second quarter, we recorded $2.9 billion of pretax charges. This consisted of $1.9 billion of asset impairments, $646 million relating to workforce reductions and $335 million of merger and integration charges associated with the acquisition of Cameron, which closed on April 1, 2016. 
The asset impairments are a result of the challenging market condition that continued to deteriorate during the first half of 2016. These impairments will not result in any cash outflows. As we indicated last quarter, we continued to tailor our resources to activity levels. Unfortunately, this resulted in additional workforce reductions. 
The $335 million of merger and integration charges consist of $150 million noncash inventory-related purchase accounting item, with the balance relating to transaction costs as well as the dedicated integration team and other cost to achieve synergies. We will continue to incur merger and integration charges for the rest of 2016 and into 2017. 
Our second quarter revenue was $7.2 billion. This included a full quarter of activity from Cameron, which added $1.5 billion to our top line. Excluding the impact of Cameron, revenue decreased 14% sequentially, reflecting continued activity declines, pricing pressure and the reduction of activity in Venezuela to better match cash collections. Pretax operating margins, including the effects of Cameron, decreased 404 basis points sequentially to 10.4%. Cameron was accretive to Schlumberger's pretax operating margin as well as earning per share and cash flow. 
Highlights per product group were as follows. Second quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 9% sequentially while margin decreased 228 basis points to 16.7%. These decreases were largely driven by Wireline and Testing Services activity declines across all of the International Areas, most notably in Latin America. 
Drilling Group revenue of $2 billion decreased 18% sequentially while margin declined 649 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by significant rig count reductions and pricing pressure across all areas. The largest declines were experienced in Latin America and North America. 
Production Group revenue of $2.1 billion decreased 11% sequentially and margins fell by 459 basis points, primarily on lower pressure pumping activity and further pricing pressure in North America land. Latin America also saw significant activity declines. 
As previously mentioned, the Cameron Group contributed revenue of $1.5 billion while generating pretax operating margin of 15.8%. On a pro forma basis, this represent a 6% sequential revenue decline and 130 basis points margin improvement. The decrease in revenue was largely driven by a declining project backlog as well as the further slowdown in U.S. land that impacted the shorter-cycle businesses. The margin improvement was driven by strong project execution, offset, in part, by the effects of the activity decline in U.S. land. 
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. Our corporate and other expense line has increased $69 million sequentially. This increase is driven by the $63 million of quarterly amortization expense from the intangible assets recorded in connection with the Cameron purchase accounting. 
The Schlumberger effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 16% in the second quarter, essentially the same as Q1. As I highlighted last quarter, with these reduced overall levels of pretax income that we are experiencing, relatively small changes in our tax line will have a disproportionate impact on our ETR, potentially resulting in volatility going forward. Our tax rate will continue to be very sensitive to the overall geographic mix of earnings. 
We generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations. This is despite paying approximately $285 million in severance and $100 million in one-off transaction-related fees during the quarter. 
Our net debt increased $3.4 billion during the quarter to $10 billion. This expected increase was driven by the $2.8 billion of cash we paid the Cameron shareholders and the $785 million of net debt we assumed in connection with the transaction. We ended the quarter with total cash and investment of $11.6 billion. 
During the quarter, we spent $31 million to repurchase 428,000 shares at an average price of $72.77. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included approximately $450 million on CapEx, $130 million of SPM investments, $170 million of multiclient and $630 million of dividend payments. Our CapEx on a year-to-date basis was $1 billion, which includes 1 quarter of Cameron. CapEx for the second half of 2016 is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion. These amounts do not include investment in SPM or multiclient. 
And now I will turn the conference call over to Scott."

This is the first earnings conference call that I have participated in since the announcement of Schlumberger and Cameron combination in August of last year. So I'm going to provide an update on Cameron key developments",958,"Thanks, Simon, and hello, everyone. This is the first earnings conference call that I have participated in since the announcement of Schlumberger and Cameron combination in August of last year. So I'm going to provide an update on Cameron key developments in 2016 and provide you with some color on how the integration is progressing. 
The Cameron business has continued to perform well in light of the current market conditions. The margin progression journey that we started in 2014 has continued in our long-cycle businesses with strong execution of our backlog in our drilling, OneSubsea and process systems business units. We have continued to deliver our backlog while driving cost out of the system, generating enhanced margins through the cycle. 
For example, drilling margins were significantly accretive, and subsea margins were at the Cameron Group margin level. As you can imagine, our shorter-cycle businesses, Surface and Valves & Measurement, are being impacted by both volume and significant pricing pressure. Despite these pressures, both Valves & Measurement and surface have positive operating income and are delivering solid cash flow. 
Overall, the Cameron Group was able to deliver healthy cash flow and operating margins of 15.8% in the quarter, which is nearly an all-time high for Cameron. However, the Cameron Group is not immune to the downturn, as you can see in our second quarter book-to-bill ratio of 0.68. This will have a continued impact on revenue in 2017 as our longer-cycle businesses continue to move downward and our backlog reduce to $3.7 billion in these businesses at the end of the quarter. 
Let's switch to our business-unit-level details, starting with OneSubsea. OneSubsea continues to build on the vision that we created when forming the venture in 2013. In fact, we have just been awarded Woodside's Greater Enfield development, which is truly the first award that brings together the full capabilities that OneSubsea has to offer. This will be booked in July. We have been working closely with Woodside since we are awarded their subsea frame agreement in 2014. Our success in the frame agreement evolved to an integrated FEED study, which led to project award. In this project, we used our integrated solutions expertise, including flow assurance capabilities, our systems engineering to best configure the C4 architecture, our C4 boosting capabilities, our standardized horizontal SpoolTree and subsea landing string. 
We are very pleased to be working with Woodside and finding cost-effective solutions to move deepwater developments from concept to reality. 
With these engagements, the OneSubsea team continues to move up the learning curve on how to find deepwater solutions that are, one, cost enabling; two, deliver more production at a higher recovery factor; three, bring projects to market significantly faster; and, ultimately, improve the financial returns of deepwater developments. 
We are also working on the SPS and SURF interface, where we believe there are cost and efficiency gains. We now have 3 paid FEED studies for our OneSubsea and Subsea 7 alliance, and we are working on another 20-plus engagements currently. Other recent activities include the 6 tree award for Petrobel Zohr gas development in Egypt, which utilized a quick FEED approach and a supplier-led solution to meet a very aggressive time line at a significantly reduced cost. 
Additionally, OneSubsea has successfully commissioned 2 boosting systems in the Gulf of Mexico. OneSubsea continues to have 100% of the working C4 boosting systems in the world. Our leadership and history in boosting positions OneSubsea extremely well to capitalize on the smaller developments that tie back to existing infrastructure and host facilities. Our unique offering of a single-well boosting system, combined with a standard subsea tree, works perfectly for this growing market. 
Each of the Cameron businesses are handling this cycle well and executing on our downturn playbook, which focused on cost reduction, market share preservation and price optimization. As we move into Schlumberger, we are sharpening our focus on our service offering to capitalize on our large global installed base of equipment, and we continue to enhance our portfolio with a renewed commitment to technology. I can't tell you how proud I am of the Cameron employees as we continue to perform exceptionally well despite the industry's worst downturn and while executing a major corporate integration. 
Now I'd like to turn to the integration of Cameron into Schlumberger. To start, I think it can be best summarized as a successful continuation of the collaboration and partnership that we started in OneSubsea. The Cameron and Schlumberger teams continue to work together in an impressive manner, and I'm happy to report that the progress in the first 3 months has exceeded all of our expectations. 
In the second quarter, we booked $125 million of synergy-related business, which was significantly ahead of our original plan. We are also on track to deliver the $300 million of synergies in the first 12 months from closing. We continue to find unexpected opportunities across all of the Cameron businesses, including Valves & Measurement and processing, as we leverage the Schlumberger -- sorry, as we leverage the substantial capabilities of Schlumberger's vast geographic organization. 
Additionally, we continue to build on the concept of integrating the subsurface capabilities of Schlumberger with the surface pressure control and processing capabilities of Cameron. We started this in OneSubsea, and we are now seeing opportunities in drilling, unconventional production and production and processing facilities. 
Finally, we have started over 30 new technology development programs as part of the integration. And we are confident that these programs will deliver significant revenue synergies and growth opportunities when the markets do recover. Overall, the integration is progressing very well, and the combination and collaboration has been positively received by the Cameron employees, the Schlumberger employees and our customers. 
Now I'll turn it over to Paal."

In the second quarter, market condition worsened further in most parts of our global operations. But in spite of the continuing operational and commercial headwinds, we have now reached the bottom of the cycle",2393,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, market condition worsened further in most parts of our global operations. But in spite of the continuing operational and commercial headwinds, we have now reached the bottom of the cycle. 
In line with the previous 6 quarters of this downturn, we continue to navigate the challenging environment with an unwavering focus on protecting the overall financial health of the company. This enabled us to generate a positive operating income of $747 million, excluding credits and charges; maintain operating margins north of 10%; and, more importantly, produce a positive operating cash flow of $1.6 billion. This solid financial performance came as a result of strong execution and, in some cases, at the expense of revenue as we now have started to shift focus onto recovering our pricing concessions and high-grading our contract portfolio. 
Second quarter revenue increased 10% sequentially, boosted by the inclusion of a full quarter's activity for the Cameron Group, which amounted to $1.5 billion. However, activity for all groups decreased in the quarter as E&P budgets were further reduced. The revenue headwinds were most pronounced in North America and further exacerbated by a decision to reduce our operations in Venezuela to fall in line with cash collections, which had a significant impact on our Latin America results. 
In terms of pretax operating income, close to 75% of our sequential drop was caused by North America and Venezuela. 
As I review the second quarter geographical trends, I will use pro forma numbers for the sequential comparison while I focus my comments on the characterization, Drilling and Production groups, as Scott has already covered the Cameron Group in detail. In North America, revenue declined 20% sequentially against an average drop in the U.S. land rig count of 25% as the activity slide now have reached bottom. The doubling in the WTI oil price since the lows seen in January of this year has also led some customers to start moving drilled but uncompleted shale wells out of inventory and into production, with the associated increase in hydraulic fracturing activity. 
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, activity was weaker as additional deepwater exploration rigs were released and the move to development activity slowed. Pricing remain under massive pressure in all land and offshore markets in North America. However, signs have started to emerge of customers recognizing that pricing levels have now fallen to unsustainable levels, leading to a growing risk of destroying capabilities and capacity required in the future. 
Within our North America business, the Drilling Group was the hardest hit in the second quarter, with Drilling & Measurements, Bits & Drilling Tools and M-I SWACO seeing the greatest activity declines. In Reservoir Characterization, however, lower revenue for Wireline and Testing Services was partly offset by sequentially stronger WesternGeco seismic work in both Canada and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
In the international markets, customer budget cuts, activity disruptions, seasonal variations and persisting pricing pressure impacted our results in most basins and market segments around the world. In Latin America, revenue declined 26% sequentially as activity in Venezuela fell significantly, following our decision to reduce operations to fall in line with cash collections. This program is managed in close coordination with all customers in the country, and operations are continuing for the Faja IOC joint ventures and for some specific PDVSA operations. Activity also decreased in Mexico and Brazil as customer budgets were curtailed further, leaving the remaining activity rig count in these 2 countries at very low levels. 
From a technology standpoint, the Drilling Group saw the largest drop in revenue with significant reductions in all product lines. In the Production Group, lower revenue from our traditional product lines was offset by robust integration-related performance, with all our projects in the region progressing well. 
In Reservoir Characterization, our multiclient seismic program in Mexico continued in advance of the upcoming deepwater license rounds. So far, we have delivered more than 40,000 square kilometers of high-resolution wide-azimuth seismic data, and early evaluation of the data is already leading to clearer identification of new exploration plays in the Gulf of Campeche Basin. 
Revenue in Europe, CIS and Africa declined 7% sequentially as widespread activity reductions throughout our Sub-Saharan Africa operations had a significant impact on our results. Nigeria and the Gulf of Guinea saw the largest fall, but the rig count in Angola also fell sharply, together with Central and West Africa, where a key exploration campaign was completed. 
In the North Sea, rig-related activity in the U.K. increased while revenue was lower in Norway as seasonal shutdowns and a changing job mix impacted results. These negative factors affected all parts of our business in the area and particularly the Drilling and Production Groups. Within Reservoir Characterization, lower revenue for Wireline and Testing Services was partially offset by improving seismic revenues from WesternGeco. 
In Russia, revenue increased as the summer season ramped up in line with expectations and was further supported by the appreciation of the Russian ruble. Activity was strongest for Drilling & Measurements and Well Services, driven by solid drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity, both on land and shallow offshore. 
In the Middle East & Asia, revenue declined by 2% sequentially as lower activity in Asia more than offset strong activity in the Middle East. In Asia, activity was weakest in the Malaysia and Australia GeoMarkets as projects were canceled or completed, and the offshore rig count dropped further. The Drilling Group was most affected by this through lower demand for Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO technologies while Reservoir Characterization was also lower on weaker Wireline exploration activity. 
In the Middle East, strength in the GCC countries offset weakness in the Iraq, Oman and Egypt GeoMarkets. In Kuwait, increased rig count, continued progress on the early production facilities we are building for the Jurassic project, together with higher Artificial Lift and Completions product sales, drove revenue higher while in Saudi Arabia, activity also increased, driven by market share gains from the latest rig allocations as well as higher hydraulic fracturing activity. 
I would now like to turn to the state of our industry and also how we continue to position Schlumberger in the forefront of a challenging and evolving operating environment. We are now 7 quarters into the most severe industry downturn on record, which saw oil prices tumbling to $27 this January. Since then, we have seen a slow but steady increase in oil prices as market data continues to show a tightening of the supply and demand balance and with the outlook clearly suggesting that these trends will further accelerate going forward. 
While the current level of oil prices has created unprecedented turmoil throughout our industry, the financial challenges that have now become very visible are really nothing new. For some time, there has been a growing shortfall of both profits and cash flow for many oil producers around the world as the cost of developing increasingly complex oil resources has outgrown the value created, which could be seen even when oil prices were at $100 per barrel. The dramatic restructuring of the supply side we are currently experiencing has just accelerated and amplified the cost, quality and efficiency problems of the industry and led to a more acute cash and profitability crisis. 
The operators have reacted to this crisis by initiating a massive reduction in oilfield activity and by sending unsustainable pricing shock throughout the entire oil industry supply chain. In addition, there is currently also a widespread high-grading of activity taking place in the industry aimed at maximizing short-term production and cash flow. 
Adding up all of this, the current cost per barrel for the oil producers now appears to be significantly lower than what was the case 7 quarters ago. However, this should not be confused with a permanent improvement in the underlying industry performance as there has been little to no fundamental change in technology, quality or efficiency, no major step change in industry collaboration and no general transformation of the industry business model. What has taken place over the past 20 -- 21 months is instead a redistribution of the profit and cash flow shortfall from previously existing mostly with the oil producers to now representing an unsustainable burden for the supplier industry even after a massive reduction of cost and capacity. 
So where does this leave the industry? First of all, assuming that we continue to see a steady growth in demand, we are heading towards a significant global supply deficit as the E&P spend rate now is down by more than 50%. The effect of the reduced E&P spend is already clearly visible in the 2016 non-OPEC production numbers, which are set to drop by 900,000 barrels per day versus last year, and can also be seen by the weakness in the OPEC production outside of the Gulf countries. And as the opportunities for activity high-grading are exhausted, we should see a further acceleration in the global production decline. 
In addition, the market is also underestimating the potential reaction from the supplier industry, which has temporarily accepted financially unviable contracts to support the operators and to keep their options open as the downturn has deepened and extended into uncharted territory. This is seen by the service industry profit levels and also from their ballooning receivables balances, caused by operators who are unable or unwilling to provide timely payments. It also means that, inevitably, service industry pricing has to recover. And as it does, this will consume a large part of the E&P investment increases intended for additional activity, which will further amplify the pending oil supply deficit. 
So how are we navigating this challenging industry environment? To start with, we believe that the chronic shortfall in profits and cash flow throughout the oil industry value chain can only be permanently addressed by a dramatic step change in industry performance. This has to begin with a transformation of the intrinsic quality and efficiency of each industry player but would also require the design of much broader technology systems, including both innovative hardware as well as high-level software control systems. In addition, we believe that the future industry winners will be the companies that can more effectively integrate the entire industry value chain through an open and collaborative business model with much better commercial alignment between the key contributing parties. 
After 7 quarters of managing our business in an increasingly complex industry environment, where we have made a series of strategic and tactical moves, we are well advanced in shaping and positioning our company for future success, as can be seen by the following facts. First, our balance sheet remains strong with more than $11 billion in cash and short-term investments, and we are also one of the few companies in the industry that still generates a positive free cash flow after actively reinvesting in our business and steadily returning cash to our shareholders in form of dividends and stock buybacks. 
Second, we have an unprecedented global technology offering that we have significantly expanded in the past 21 months through the purchase of a number of smaller technology companies as well as the major acquisition of Cameron. Third, the addition of the Cameron Group to our technology portfolio will enable the development of major integrated technology systems, including our land drilling system, a future hydraulic fracturing system and a new surface production system that combines processing, measurements and control. 
Fourth, we have established a range of tiered integration business models that enable us to evolve our customer engagements as well as the type of contracts we take on. And last, the benefits we are seeing from our transformation program are creating a significant and long-term competitive advantage through a steady improvement in our internal, intrinsic performance. 
In Schlumberger, we continue to have a stated goal of serving all customers in all basins and countries around the world, provided it is permissible by local and international law, that it's safe for our people and assets and that it is financially viable. And as oil prices have doubled since the lows in January, we have now shifted our focus from decremental margins and increasing our tender win rates over to our contract portfolio, where we are looking to recover the temporary pricing concessions we have made or renegotiate those contracts which, at present, show no promise of becoming financially viable. 
As we now enter a new phase of the cycle, oilfield activity has to increase in most countries around the world for the industry to meet the growing supply deficit. The sustainably of this activity recovery will be defined by the financial viability of the entire oil industry value chain, which will vary significantly from country to country. And in places where the total value chain remains in a chronic financial shortfall, the increase in activity will not be sustainable. 
A key question in this respect is the sustainability of a North American land recovery, where the cumulative industry earnings and free cash flow was negative over the last cycle. And given the resulting financial state of the value chain in this commoditized market, a large wave of cost inflation from every part of the supplier industry is now building, which the E&P companies will have to absorb in parallel with implementing their activity growth plans. As we now enter the next phase of the cycle, the breadth and depth of our technology offering, together with our geographical scale and our knowledge of the financial viability of the industry value chain in each operating country, will clearly set us apart and further enable us to deliver differentiated financial results going forward. 
In preparation for the next phase, we have already reenergized our management team and formulated detailed plans for how we will navigate this new environment. And as part of this, we have set ourselves a company-wide goal of delivering incremental margins higher than 65% on the forthcoming activity growth. The combination of the technical and strategic moves we have made and are continuing to make has enabled us to navigate the challenging industry environment better than most and, above all, will ensure that Schlumberger continues to remain at the absolute forefront of an industry that is set to undergo significant change in the coming years. 
That concludes my remarks. We will now open up for questions."

You talk about pricing and sustainability and the unsustainable pricing that we have. Investor focus today seems definitely to be on North America because of the expectation it's going to recover first. And in North America, the biggest concern still seems to be on pressure pumping. And historically, you guys would improve your margins by increasing utilization of equipment. And that would be the first big run in improving your margins, and then pricing would follow at some point in the future as utilization got higher. You talk about how things are different this time. Can you talk about your outlook for what happens in the U.S. pressure pumping market, how fast pricing comes back, how you will be able to get pricing and what will cause that pricing improvement ahead of some of your peers? I guess that's more of a technology versus commodity discussion. But can you walk us through, just on a regional basis, if you would, your outlook on how pressure pumping utilization and pricing evolve over the next year or 2?"

But I'll -- I will say that we are clear that we have reached the bottom of activity in North America land and that activity will increase not in a V shape dramatic fashion, but I think there will be steady increase in rig count and associated frac activity both from the rigs as from wells coming out of the dock inventory. Now again I think the activity will be more slow and steady. And obviously, with higher utilization, there is some contribution to margins, but margins are deeply negative, and I would say at this stage, more activity at the current margin level, it's just going to be dilutive to earnings. So I think most companies now will be looking for price increases and in fact, significant price increases actually to bring profitability back to break even and into positive territory before that activity is particularly attractive in terms of driving earnings back to previous year levels. So how do we get to pricing? I think, obviously, technology efficiency, managing the supply chain is going to be important, but I think overall, the entire value chain in North America is highly stressed. As I indicated in the previous cycle, it is cumulatively negative, both on profits and free cash flow. So I don't think there is an open-ended, dramatic improvement at hand without doing anything. I think technology has to play a very important role in this. We've said in many fora that if you look at the cost per well, I think we are in late innings. But in terms of production per well, we are in very early innings. And if you want to drive down cost per barrel, we have to look at ways of getting more production in -- out of each well, but overall utilization will help. But given the pain that the entire industry value chain is in, there's going to be a mounting wave of cost inflation from every supplier in that chain, which I think is going to put significant pressure on how quickly activity can recover."

So we have not gained any pricing. So we have very little pricing to give up. Now in a dramatic downturn as we have been experiencing over the past 7 quarters, there is a need to align with the customer base, which, obviously, has the immediate oil price exposure, and we have done that. And the vast majority of the pricing concessions we have made to existing and valid contracts are temporary in nature. They're either time bound or they are linked to some kind of oil price trigger, and that's why we have aligned with our customers on the down of the cycle, and we now expect that, that will be returned to us as oil prices start to increase.

And I think those 4 models are applicable in pretty much every country and basin around the world depending on the state of the customer, the interest of the customer and what kind of resources they are developing, right? But we see a general, I would say, adaptation of all aspects of integration taking place all around the world. The least impact of integration so far, if I just look at the high level, has been in North America, where it's still rather fragmented in between the rig and the various parts of the drilling process as well as in the production and completion part of the work. So we are continuing to drive forward our offering around creating a total drilling system and a total completion system, including fracking, for the land market, and I'm quite optimistic that these should have significant uptake even in places like U.S. land or some of the other unconventional basins around the world. But the general adaptation of more integration we are seeing, and we continue to invest into that, both from a hardware and software process control standpoint."

So in terms of timing of it, Ole, it's difficult to say that you're going to see kind of major impact in one particular quarter. I think the level of integration-related activity has held up well, I would say, during this downturn. It is down in percentage terms, which you would expect. But it has held up well as well as our new technology sales has also held up well during this cycle. So I think we're very well positioned. And as activity starts to increase and resources, both on the customer side as well as on the service industry side, becomes shorter, then I think the multiskilling and presenting one package with simpler interfaces is going to be quite appealing for the customers."

But what we've done here is essentially provide relative relatively standard horizontal trees combined with the boosting system, and then the real technology is with the unified control system that will span both the boosting system and the subsea architecture as well as the completion with a landing stream. And so now we've got a unified control system that controls all aspects that sit on the seafloor, and you can imagine the cost savings for the customer when you bring all of that together.

And as you know, it's one of the highest quarters we've ever had. The forward look is a little bit complicated because what's happening is we've got really strong execution in both drilling OneSubsea and process systems, and those are a longer or bigger backlog and longer cycle businesses, and those are going to start to come down. And so -- and now you've got a lot of pricing pressure that we've seen in 2015 start to come into the mix, and so we think 15.8% is a very high level. That will start to taper it down here in the quarters to come. And then where we really start to see some uplift, and it's just it's a matter of timing here, but as Paal described, right, we do believe we're going to get pricing in the shorter cycle businesses. So both surface and valves and measurement, and then in addition to that, you start to layer in the synergies of -- from the integration itself. And so I don't expect us to exceed the 15.8% here in the short term. I think that comes down steadily over time, but then as we get pricing traction in those short-cycle businesses begin to pick up, we could, indeed, see those margins come back up into a higher territory. And then in terms of booking outlook, I'll start with deepwater and what I'll say is it is in a very bad state in terms of progressing and moving projects forward. And we're very fortunate to work with Woodside and get one past FID, but we don't see any major projects here for the remainder of the year. In fact, our estimates for trees this year are less than 100. There are a few projects out there next year that are relatively large in size. We feel good about our ability to work with our operators and achieve those. But, at the same time, the industry's got significant capacity, and those are going to be incredibly competitive. And so I feel -- I'm also concerned about the outlook with deepwater. Now, however, the counter to that is we have a very strong belief in what we're doing with OneSubsea. And like I described in the opening comments, right, the ability to tie the reservoir to what we're doing, drive cost out of the system through our standardized approach and then get more out of production, we feel very good about that. On the other businesses, surface and V&M are tied to rig count, and they have a significant North American exposure. And as Paal described, we think those markets start to increase here going forward, and so that's going to be the big kind of flux position for us, if you will, if those start to come back faster then our outlook starts to look pretty good."

And if you can double the incremental from that decremental rate, that means you should be able to restore 2014 earnings, which is the place we want to be as quickly as possible to continue to deliver on the plan we laid out in the 2014 Investor Conference. We can actually recover 2014 earnings by only 50% recovery in the revenue drop that we've seen since 2014. Now there is a lot of work behind the number in terms of how achievable it is. But as an example, in 2014, in the international markets, on the pretty low revenue growth rate of 3%, 4%, we actually lived at [ph] 69% incrementals without any price in international markets. So the other precedence for doing it is obviously going to be challenging to do that also in North America and in particular North America land.

So in terms of the charge that we've taken, this is basically catching up and finalizing the resizing of the company, which is now been dropping in activity levels over the past 7 quarters. So this charge is linked to a number of things that we have been executing in the second quarter and should bring the company into the shape where we are well positioned to navigate the bottom of the market and also a position to start growing again going forward. So we put a lot of details and scrutiny into any kind of impairment charge that we take, and we have done so as well in the charge for Q2, which is sizable, but we believe is as prudent. This is right, and it's justified to do what we've done, and that's why we did it. Now in terms of the outlook like I said, we are at the bottom, but we are not expecting an immediate and sharp recovery. If you look at North America versus international, some of the moving parts going into Q3, North America still have a significant overcapacity at this stage in terms of services, and the low barrier to entry is also going to continue to be major headwind, right? So we expect modest increase in land activity, but this is going to be partially offset by lower offshore work. We are significantly down in Alaska, in Eastern Canada as well as in the Gulf of Mexico. We expect some improvement in pricing, but it's going to be way short of the level required to break even in Q3. So we don't expect any major positive earnings improvement from North America in Q3, but it shouldn't get much worse either, right? So fairly, fairly stable earnings from North America in the third quarter, and fairly similar in the international market. There's less overcapacity there due to the higher barrier of entry, and there is also quite narrowing competitive landscape. So in principle, it should be easier to recover some of the temporary pricing concessions that we have made and which in most cases in international market is also time bound or linked to oil price. But given the limited increase in activity we see for Q3, again we don't expect any significant positive sequential earnings contribution from international. So overall, we expect flattish EPS in Q3."

Or how much of this is due just the fact that there's really only you and one other globally now that participate in the market, and you've seen a lot of your competitors just drop out?"

So the position we have in terms of strength, both in footprint, scale, local knowledge as well as the overall contract portfolio we have, allows us to be quite competitive in these tenders. And I think very importantly as well is to look at the difference between the contracts portfolio and maybe the immediate revenue translation of these contracts. In international markets, it's very important to have the contracts, and we have a range of contracts today that we have won with very little activity in them, but they have potential for significant increases in activity in terms of rig additions and so forth going forward. So what is very important over the past year, which we have had a lot of focus on, has been the tender win rate and then having the contracts and then being able to translate that into revenue in the coming 1 to 2 years."

Now in North America, you better separate the industry view from just how Schlumberger navigates in this system, and I think the industry -- I think there are some questions and challenges to be asked, right? How is the industry in the next upcoming cycle going to be able to operate where the entire value chain ends up being cash flow and profit positive as we enter into a complete new cycle? That was not the case in the previous cycle, and I don't think we can go on for many cycles in a similar type of fashion. Now there is a part of North America land, which is viable even at lower prices, but how big that is and how much you can step up from the core acreage, I think, is to be seen. Now how we operate in that, we are aiming to be very competitive on efficiency. And in addition to that, bring new technologies, continue to bring new technologies into play, which can help our customers drive up production per well. And we have a very good offering already in place for that. So we will continue to operate the way we have been with a focus in both of these dimensions, but I think that at this stage, if you look at the state of the industry value chain, I can't tell you that we are going to get back to previous peak margins in North America or North America land because at this stage, I just don't see how that can be funded in the entire value chain."

So before we close this morning, I would like to summarize the 4 most important points that we've discussed. First, we believe that we reached the bottom of the cycle and that E&P investments now have to increase in order for the industry to meet the growing supply deficit. As E&P investment starts growing, a large part will initially had to be consumed on supplier industry price increases in order for capacity and capabilities to be available and for operating standards to be met. Second, most basins around the world are today at unprecedented low levels of activity, and we expect to see a broad-based increase in investments going forward, funded by higher oil prices. The magnitude and sustainability of the investment increase will, however, be funded of the financial viability of the entire oil industry value chain in each basin and country, which will vary significantly. Third, our deep local knowledge, the breadth and depth of our technology offering, together with our geographical scale, will clearly set us apart and further enable us to deliver differentiated financial results going forward. And fourth, the shortfall in profits and cash flow throughout the entire industry value chain can only be permanently addressed by a dramatic step change in industry performance, including intrinsic quality and efficiency, technology system innovations and more aligned and collaborative business models, and Schlumberger is and will remain at the absolute forefront of this industry transformation.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.23.

Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.23. This represent decreases of $0.17 sequentially and $0.65 when compared to the same quarter last year. 
During the second quarter, we recorded $2.9 billion of pretax charges. This consisted of $1.9 billion of asset impairments, $646 million relating to workforce reductions and $335 million of merger and integration charges associated with the acquisition of Cameron, which closed on April 1, 2016. 
The asset impairments are a result of the challenging market condition that continued to deteriorate during the first half of 2016. These impairments will not result in any cash outflows. As we indicated last quarter, we continued to tailor our resources to activity levels. Unfortunately, this resulted in additional workforce reductions. 
The $335 million of merger and integration charges consist of $150 million noncash inventory-related purchase accounting item, with the balance relating to transaction costs as well as the dedicated integration team and other cost to achieve synergies. We will continue to incur merger and integration charges for the rest of 2016 and into 2017. 
Our second quarter revenue was $7.2 billion. This included a full quarter of activity from Cameron, which added $1.5 billion to our top line. Excluding the impact of Cameron, revenue decreased 14% sequentially, reflecting continued activity declines, pricing pressure and the reduction of activity in Venezuela to better match cash collections. Pretax operating margins, including the effects of Cameron, decreased 404 basis points sequentially to 10.4%. Cameron was accretive to Schlumberger's pretax operating margin as well as earning per share and cash flow. 
Highlights per product group were as follows. Second quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 9% sequentially while margin decreased 228 basis points to 16.7%. These decreases were largely driven by Wireline and Testing Services activity declines across all of the International Areas, most notably in Latin America. 
Drilling Group revenue of $2 billion decreased 18% sequentially while margin declined 649 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by significant rig count reductions and pricing pressure across all areas. The largest declines were experienced in Latin America and North America. 
Production Group revenue of $2.1 billion decreased 11% sequentially and margins fell by 459 basis points, primarily on lower pressure pumping activity and further pricing pressure in North America land. Latin America also saw significant activity declines. 
As previously mentioned, the Cameron Group contributed revenue of $1.5 billion while generating pretax operating margin of 15.8%. On a pro forma basis, this represent a 6% sequential revenue decline and 130 basis points margin improvement. The decrease in revenue was largely driven by a declining project backlog as well as the further slowdown in U.S. land that impacted the shorter-cycle businesses. The margin improvement was driven by strong project execution, offset, in part, by the effects of the activity decline in U.S. land. 
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. Our corporate and other expense line has increased $69 million sequentially. This increase is driven by the $63 million of quarterly amortization expense from the intangible assets recorded in connection with the Cameron purchase accounting. 
The Schlumberger effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 16% in the second quarter, essentially the same as Q1. As I highlighted last quarter, with these reduced overall levels of pretax income that we are experiencing, relatively small changes in our tax line will have a disproportionate impact on our ETR, potentially resulting in volatility going forward. Our tax rate will continue to be very sensitive to the overall geographic mix of earnings. 
We generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations. This is despite paying approximately $285 million in severance and $100 million in one-off transaction-related fees during the quarter. 
Our net debt increased $3.4 billion during the quarter to $10 billion. This expected increase was driven by the $2.8 billion of cash we paid the Cameron shareholders and the $785 million of net debt we assumed in connection with the transaction. We ended the quarter with total cash and investment of $11.6 billion. 
During the quarter, we spent $31 million to repurchase 428,000 shares at an average price of $72.77. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included approximately $450 million on CapEx, $130 million of SPM investments, $170 million of multiclient and $630 million of dividend payments. Our CapEx on a year-to-date basis was $1 billion, which includes 1 quarter of Cameron. CapEx for the second half of 2016 is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion. These amounts do not include investment in SPM or multiclient. 
And now I will turn the conference call over to Scott."

This is the first earnings conference call that I have participated in since the announcement of Schlumberger and Cameron combination in August of last year. So I'm going to provide an update on Cameron key developments",958,"Thanks, Simon, and hello, everyone. This is the first earnings conference call that I have participated in since the announcement of Schlumberger and Cameron combination in August of last year. So I'm going to provide an update on Cameron key developments in 2016 and provide you with some color on how the integration is progressing. 
The Cameron business has continued to perform well in light of the current market conditions. The margin progression journey that we started in 2014 has continued in our long-cycle businesses with strong execution of our backlog in our drilling, OneSubsea and process systems business units. We have continued to deliver our backlog while driving cost out of the system, generating enhanced margins through the cycle. 
For example, drilling margins were significantly accretive, and subsea margins were at the Cameron Group margin level. As you can imagine, our shorter-cycle businesses, Surface and Valves & Measurement, are being impacted by both volume and significant pricing pressure. Despite these pressures, both Valves & Measurement and surface have positive operating income and are delivering solid cash flow. 
Overall, the Cameron Group was able to deliver healthy cash flow and operating margins of 15.8% in the quarter, which is nearly an all-time high for Cameron. However, the Cameron Group is not immune to the downturn, as you can see in our second quarter book-to-bill ratio of 0.68. This will have a continued impact on revenue in 2017 as our longer-cycle businesses continue to move downward and our backlog reduce to $3.7 billion in these businesses at the end of the quarter. 
Let's switch to our business-unit-level details, starting with OneSubsea. OneSubsea continues to build on the vision that we created when forming the venture in 2013. In fact, we have just been awarded Woodside's Greater Enfield development, which is truly the first award that brings together the full capabilities that OneSubsea has to offer. This will be booked in July. We have been working closely with Woodside since we are awarded their subsea frame agreement in 2014. Our success in the frame agreement evolved to an integrated FEED study, which led to project award. In this project, we used our integrated solutions expertise, including flow assurance capabilities, our systems engineering to best configure the C4 architecture, our C4 boosting capabilities, our standardized horizontal SpoolTree and subsea landing string. 
We are very pleased to be working with Woodside and finding cost-effective solutions to move deepwater developments from concept to reality. 
With these engagements, the OneSubsea team continues to move up the learning curve on how to find deepwater solutions that are, one, cost enabling; two, deliver more production at a higher recovery factor; three, bring projects to market significantly faster; and, ultimately, improve the financial returns of deepwater developments. 
We are also working on the SPS and SURF interface, where we believe there are cost and efficiency gains. We now have 3 paid FEED studies for our OneSubsea and Subsea 7 alliance, and we are working on another 20-plus engagements currently. Other recent activities include the 6 tree award for Petrobel Zohr gas development in Egypt, which utilized a quick FEED approach and a supplier-led solution to meet a very aggressive time line at a significantly reduced cost. 
Additionally, OneSubsea has successfully commissioned 2 boosting systems in the Gulf of Mexico. OneSubsea continues to have 100% of the working C4 boosting systems in the world. Our leadership and history in boosting positions OneSubsea extremely well to capitalize on the smaller developments that tie back to existing infrastructure and host facilities. Our unique offering of a single-well boosting system, combined with a standard subsea tree, works perfectly for this growing market. 
Each of the Cameron businesses are handling this cycle well and executing on our downturn playbook, which focused on cost reduction, market share preservation and price optimization. As we move into Schlumberger, we are sharpening our focus on our service offering to capitalize on our large global installed base of equipment, and we continue to enhance our portfolio with a renewed commitment to technology. I can't tell you how proud I am of the Cameron employees as we continue to perform exceptionally well despite the industry's worst downturn and while executing a major corporate integration. 
Now I'd like to turn to the integration of Cameron into Schlumberger. To start, I think it can be best summarized as a successful continuation of the collaboration and partnership that we started in OneSubsea. The Cameron and Schlumberger teams continue to work together in an impressive manner, and I'm happy to report that the progress in the first 3 months has exceeded all of our expectations. 
In the second quarter, we booked $125 million of synergy-related business, which was significantly ahead of our original plan. We are also on track to deliver the $300 million of synergies in the first 12 months from closing. We continue to find unexpected opportunities across all of the Cameron businesses, including Valves & Measurement and processing, as we leverage the Schlumberger -- sorry, as we leverage the substantial capabilities of Schlumberger's vast geographic organization. 
Additionally, we continue to build on the concept of integrating the subsurface capabilities of Schlumberger with the surface pressure control and processing capabilities of Cameron. We started this in OneSubsea, and we are now seeing opportunities in drilling, unconventional production and production and processing facilities. 
Finally, we have started over 30 new technology development programs as part of the integration. And we are confident that these programs will deliver significant revenue synergies and growth opportunities when the markets do recover. Overall, the integration is progressing very well, and the combination and collaboration has been positively received by the Cameron employees, the Schlumberger employees and our customers. 
Now I'll turn it over to Paal."
301966,333381173,1010657,"Schlumberger Limited, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, market condition worsened further in most parts of our global operations. But in spite of the continuing operational and commercial headwinds, we have now reached the bottom of the cycle",2393,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, market condition worsened further in most parts of our global operations. But in spite of the continuing operational and commercial headwinds, we have now reached the bottom of the cycle. 
In line with the previous 6 quarters of this downturn, we continue to navigate the challenging environment with an unwavering focus on protecting the overall financial health of the company. This enabled us to generate a positive operating income of $747 million, excluding credits and charges; maintain operating margins north of 10%; and, more importantly, produce a positive operating cash flow of $1.6 billion. This solid financial performance came as a result of strong execution and, in some cases, at the expense of revenue as we now have started to shift focus onto recovering our pricing concessions and high-grading our contract portfolio. 
Second quarter revenue increased 10% sequentially, boosted by the inclusion of a full quarter's activity for the Cameron Group, which amounted to $1.5 billion. However, activity for all groups decreased in the quarter as E&P budgets were further reduced. The revenue headwinds were most pronounced in North America and further exacerbated by a decision to reduce our operations in Venezuela to fall in line with cash collections, which had a significant impact on our Latin America results. 
In terms of pretax operating income, close to 75% of our sequential drop was caused by North America and Venezuela. 
As I review the second quarter geographical trends, I will use pro forma numbers for the sequential comparison while I focus my comments on the characterization, Drilling and Production groups, as Scott has already covered the Cameron Group in detail. In North America, revenue declined 20% sequentially against an average drop in the U.S. land rig count of 25% as the activity slide now have reached bottom. The doubling in the WTI oil price since the lows seen in January of this year has also led some customers to start moving drilled but uncompleted shale wells out of inventory and into production, with the associated increase in hydraulic fracturing activity. 
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, activity was weaker as additional deepwater exploration rigs were released and the move to development activity slowed. Pricing remain under massive pressure in all land and offshore markets in North America. However, signs have started to emerge of customers recognizing that pricing levels have now fallen to unsustainable levels, leading to a growing risk of destroying capabilities and capacity required in the future. 
Within our North America business, the Drilling Group was the hardest hit in the second quarter, with Drilling & Measurements, Bits & Drilling Tools and M-I SWACO seeing the greatest activity declines. In Reservoir Characterization, however, lower revenue for Wireline and Testing Services was partly offset by sequentially stronger WesternGeco seismic work in both Canada and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
In the international markets, customer budget cuts, activity disruptions, seasonal variations and persisting pricing pressure impacted our results in most basins and market segments around the world. In Latin America, revenue declined 26% sequentially as activity in Venezuela fell significantly, following our decision to reduce operations to fall in line with cash collections. This program is managed in close coordination with all customers in the country, and operations are continuing for the Faja IOC joint ventures and for some specific PDVSA operations. Activity also decreased in Mexico and Brazil as customer budgets were curtailed further, leaving the remaining activity rig count in these 2 countries at very low levels. 
From a technology standpoint, the Drilling Group saw the largest drop in revenue with significant reductions in all product lines. In the Production Group, lower revenue from our traditional product lines was offset by robust integration-related performance, with all our projects in the region progressing well. 
In Reservoir Characterization, our multiclient seismic program in Mexico continued in advance of the upcoming deepwater license rounds. So far, we have delivered more than 40,000 square kilometers of high-resolution wide-azimuth seismic data, and early evaluation of the data is already leading to clearer identification of new exploration plays in the Gulf of Campeche Basin. 
Revenue in Europe, CIS and Africa declined 7% sequentially as widespread activity reductions throughout our Sub-Saharan Africa operations had a significant impact on our results. Nigeria and the Gulf of Guinea saw the largest fall, but the rig count in Angola also fell sharply, together with Central and West Africa, where a key exploration campaign was completed. 
In the North Sea, rig-related activity in the U.K. increased while revenue was lower in Norway as seasonal shutdowns and a changing job mix impacted results. These negative factors affected all parts of our business in the area and particularly the Drilling and Production Groups. Within Reservoir Characterization, lower revenue for Wireline and Testing Services was partially offset by improving seismic revenues from WesternGeco. 
In Russia, revenue increased as the summer season ramped up in line with expectations and was further supported by the appreciation of the Russian ruble. Activity was strongest for Drilling & Measurements and Well Services, driven by solid drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity, both on land and shallow offshore. 
In the Middle East & Asia, revenue declined by 2% sequentially as lower activity in Asia more than offset strong activity in the Middle East. In Asia, activity was weakest in the Malaysia and Australia GeoMarkets as projects were canceled or completed, and the offshore rig count dropped further. The Drilling Group was most affected by this through lower demand for Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO technologies while Reservoir Characterization was also lower on weaker Wireline exploration activity. 
In the Middle East, strength in the GCC countries offset weakness in the Iraq, Oman and Egypt GeoMarkets. In Kuwait, increased rig count, continued progress on the early production facilities we are building for the Jurassic project, together with higher Artificial Lift and Completions product sales, drove revenue higher while in Saudi Arabia, activity also increased, driven by market share gains from the latest rig allocations as well as higher hydraulic fracturing activity. 
I would now like to turn to the state of our industry and also how we continue to position Schlumberger in the forefront of a challenging and evolving operating environment. We are now 7 quarters into the most severe industry downturn on record, which saw oil prices tumbling to $27 this January. Since then, we have seen a slow but steady increase in oil prices as market data continues to show a tightening of the supply and demand balance and with the outlook clearly suggesting that these trends will further accelerate going forward. 
While the current level of oil prices has created unprecedented turmoil throughout our industry, the financial challenges that have now become very visible are really nothing new. For some time, there has been a growing shortfall of both profits and cash flow for many oil producers around the world as the cost of developing increasingly complex oil resources has outgrown the value created, which could be seen even when oil prices were at $100 per barrel. The dramatic restructuring of the supply side we are currently experiencing has just accelerated and amplified the cost, quality and efficiency problems of the industry and led to a more acute cash and profitability crisis. 
The operators have reacted to this crisis by initiating a massive reduction in oilfield activity and by sending unsustainable pricing shock throughout the entire oil industry supply chain. In addition, there is currently also a widespread high-grading of activity taking place in the industry aimed at maximizing short-term production and cash flow. 
Adding up all of this, the current cost per barrel for the oil producers now appears to be significantly lower than what was the case 7 quarters ago. However, this should not be confused with a permanent improvement in the underlying industry performance as there has been little to no fundamental change in technology, quality or efficiency, no major step change in industry collaboration and no general transformation of the industry business model. What has taken place over the past 20 -- 21 months is instead a redistribution of the profit and cash flow shortfall from previously existing mostly with the oil producers to now representing an unsustainable burden for the supplier industry even after a massive reduction of cost and capacity. 
So where does this leave the industry? First of all, assuming that we continue to see a steady growth in demand, we are heading towards a significant global supply deficit as the E&P spend rate now is down by more than 50%. The effect of the reduced E&P spend is already clearly visible in the 2016 non-OPEC production numbers, which are set to drop by 900,000 barrels per day versus last year, and can also be seen by the weakness in the OPEC production outside of the Gulf countries. And as the opportunities for activity high-grading are exhausted, we should see a further acceleration in the global production decline. 
In addition, the market is also underestimating the potential reaction from the supplier industry, which has temporarily accepted financially unviable contracts to support the operators and to keep their options open as the downturn has deepened and extended into uncharted territory. This is seen by the service industry profit levels and also from their ballooning receivables balances, caused by operators who are unable or unwilling to provide timely payments. It also means that, inevitably, service industry pricing has to recover. And as it does, this will consume a large part of the E&P investment increases intended for additional activity, which will further amplify the pending oil supply deficit. 
So how are we navigating this challenging industry environment? To start with, we believe that the chronic shortfall in profits and cash flow throughout the oil industry value chain can only be permanently addressed by a dramatic step change in industry performance. This has to begin with a transformation of the intrinsic quality and efficiency of each industry player but would also require the design of much broader technology systems, including both innovative hardware as well as high-level software control systems. In addition, we believe that the future industry winners will be the companies that can more effectively integrate the entire industry value chain through an open and collaborative business model with much better commercial alignment between the key contributing parties. 
After 7 quarters of managing our business in an increasingly complex industry environment, where we have made a series of strategic and tactical moves, we are well advanced in shaping and positioning our company for future success, as can be seen by the following facts. First, our balance sheet remains strong with more than $11 billion in cash and short-term investments, and we are also one of the few companies in the industry that still generates a positive free cash flow after actively reinvesting in our business and steadily returning cash to our shareholders in form of dividends and stock buybacks. 
Second, we have an unprecedented global technology offering that we have significantly expanded in the past 21 months through the purchase of a number of smaller technology companies as well as the major acquisition of Cameron. Third, the addition of the Cameron Group to our technology portfolio will enable the development of major integrated technology systems, including our land drilling system, a future hydraulic fracturing system and a new surface production system that combines processing, measurements and control. 
Fourth, we have established a range of tiered integration business models that enable us to evolve our customer engagements as well as the type of contracts we take on. And last, the benefits we are seeing from our transformation program are creating a significant and long-term competitive advantage through a steady improvement in our internal, intrinsic performance. 
In Schlumberger, we continue to have a stated goal of serving all customers in all basins and countries around the world, provided it is permissible by local and international law, that it's safe for our people and assets and that it is financially viable. And as oil prices have doubled since the lows in January, we have now shifted our focus from decremental margins and increasing our tender win rates over to our contract portfolio, where we are looking to recover the temporary pricing concessions we have made or renegotiate those contracts which, at present, show no promise of becoming financially viable. 
As we now enter a new phase of the cycle, oilfield activity has to increase in most countries around the world for the industry to meet the growing supply deficit. The sustainably of this activity recovery will be defined by the financial viability of the entire oil industry value chain, which will vary significantly from country to country. And in places where the total value chain remains in a chronic financial shortfall, the increase in activity will not be sustainable. 
A key question in this respect is the sustainability of a North American land recovery, where the cumulative industry earnings and free cash flow was negative over the last cycle. And given the resulting financial state of the value chain in this commoditized market, a large wave of cost inflation from every part of the supplier industry is now building, which the E&P companies will have to absorb in parallel with implementing their activity growth plans. As we now enter the next phase of the cycle, the breadth and depth of our technology offering, together with our geographical scale and our knowledge of the financial viability of the industry value chain in each operating country, will clearly set us apart and further enable us to deliver differentiated financial results going forward. 
In preparation for the next phase, we have already reenergized our management team and formulated detailed plans for how we will navigate this new environment. And as part of this, we have set ourselves a company-wide goal of delivering incremental margins higher than 65% on the forthcoming activity growth. The combination of the technical and strategic moves we have made and are continuing to make has enabled us to navigate the challenging industry environment better than most and, above all, will ensure that Schlumberger continues to remain at the absolute forefront of an industry that is set to undergo significant change in the coming years. 
That concludes my remarks. We will now open up for questions."

You talk about pricing and sustainability and the unsustainable pricing that we have. Investor focus today seems definitely to be on North America because of the expectation it's going to recover first. And in North America, the biggest concern still seems to be on pressure pumping. And historically, you guys would improve your margins by increasing utilization of equipment. And that would be the first big run in improving your margins, and then pricing would follow at some point in the future as utilization got higher. You talk about how things are different this time. Can you talk about your outlook for what happens in the U.S. pressure pumping market, how fast pricing comes back, how you will be able to get pricing and what will cause that pricing improvement ahead of some of your peers? I guess that's more of a technology versus commodity discussion. But can you walk us through, just on a regional basis, if you would, your outlook on how pressure pumping utilization and pricing evolve over the next year or 2?"

And that activity will increase not in a V-shaped, dramatic fashion, but I think there will be a steady increase in rig count and associated frac activity both from the rigs as from wells coming out of the dock inventory. Now again, I think the activity will be more slow and steady. And obviously, with higher utilization, there is some contribution to margins. But margins are deeply negative, and I would say, at this stage, more activity at the current margin level is just going to be dilutive to earnings. So I think most companies now will be looking for price increases and, in fact, significant price increases actually to bring profitability back to breakeven and into positive territory before that activity is particularly attractive in terms of driving earnings back to previous year levels. So how do we get the  pricing? I think, obviously, technology efficiency, managing the supply chain is going to be important. But I think, overall, the entire value chain in North America is highly stressed. As I indicated, in the previous cycle, it is cumulatively negative both on profits and free cash flow, so I don't think there is an open-ended, dramatic improvement at hand without doing anything. I think technology has to play a very important role in this. We've said in many fora that if you look at the cost per well, I think we are in late innings. But in terms of production per well, we are in very early innings. And if you want to drive down cost per barrel, we have to look at ways of getting more production out of each well. But overall utilization will help. But given the pain that the entire industry value chain is in, there's going to be a mounting wave of cost inflation from every supplier in that chain, which I think is going to put significant pressure on how quickly activity can recover."

Profitability for the more profitable companies have come through internal transformations and through significant investments in technology like for our -- in our case. So we have not gained any pricing, so we have very little pricing to give up. Now in a dramatic downturn as we have been experiencing over the past 7 quarters, there is a need to align with the customer base, which, obviously, has the immediate oil price exposure, and we have done that. And the vast majority of the pricing concessions we have made to existing and valid contracts are temporary in nature. They're either time-bound or they are linked to some kind of oil price trigger. And that's why we have aligned with our customers on the down of the cycle, and we now expect that, that will be returned to us as oil prices start to increase.

But we see a general, I would say, adaptation of all aspects of integration taking place all around the world. The least impact of integration so far, if I just look at the high level, has been in North America, where it's still rather fragmented in between the rig and the various parts of the drilling process as well as in the production and completion part of the work. So we are continuing to drive forward our offering around creating a total drilling system and a total completion system, including fracking, for the land  markets, and I'm quite optimistic that these should have significant uptake even in places like U.S. land or some of the other unconventional basins around the world.

Look, the 15.8% that we are able to achieve in the quarter was exceptional. And as you know, it's one of the highest quarters we've ever had. The forward look is a little bit complicated because what's happening is we've got really strong execution in both drilling OneSubsea and process systems. And those are a longer -- or bigger backlog and longer-cycle businesses, and those are going to start to come down. And so -- and now you've got a lot of pricing pressure that we've seen in 2015 start to come into the mix, and so we think 15.8% is a very high level. That will start to taper down here in the quarters to come. And then where we really start to see some uplift, and it's just -- it's a matter of timing here, but as Paal described, right, we do believe we're going to get pricing in the shorter-cycle businesses, so both Surface and Valves & Measurement. And then in addition to that, you start to layer in the synergies from the integration itself. And so I don't expect us to exceed the 15.8% here in the short term. I think that comes down steadily over time, but then as we get pricing traction in those short-cycle businesses begin to pick up, we could, indeed, see those margins come back up into a higher territory. And then in terms of booking outlook, I'll start with deepwater, and what I'll say is it is in a very bad state in terms of progressing and moving projects forward. And we're very fortunate to work with Woodside and get one past FID, but we don't see any major projects here for the remainder of the year. And in fact, our estimates for trees this year are less than 100. There are a few projects out there next year that are relatively large in size. We feel good about our ability to work with operators and achieve those. But at the same time, the industry has got significant capacity, and those are going to be incredibly competitive. And so I feel -- I'm a little concerned about the outlook with deepwater. Now however, the counter to that is we have a very strong belief in what we're doing with OneSubsea. And like I described in the opening comments, right, the ability to tie the reservoir to what we're doing, drive cost out of the system through our standardized approach and then get more out of production, we feel very good about that. On the other businesses, Surface and V&M are tied to rig count, and they have a significant North American exposure. And as Paal described, we think those markets start to increase here going forward. And so that's going to be the big kind of flux [ph] position for us, if you will. If those start to come back faster, then our outlook starts to look pretty good."

So our Drilling Group and our Production Group, I think, are the ones that will see the quickest impact of higher E&P investments. Now with that said, at some stage, the industry will need to start exploring again, and the level of exploration-related activity is at unprecedented low. So obviously, a huge growth runway for our characterization group going forward when that starts to kick in. But I think you're right in assuming that, that will be after the initial uptick in well-related development type of activity. And I think Scott has described very well the impact on Cameron. The long-cycle businesses, I think, will follow after the short-cycle ones. So I think that's a good set of assumptions."

And I think, first of all, our decrementals for the -- for 2015 and so far in 2016 is in the range of 30% to 32%. And if you can double the incremental from that decremental rate, that means that you should be able to restore 2014 earnings, which is the place we want to be as quickly as possible to continue to deliver on the plan we laid out in the 2014 Investor Conference. We can actually recover 2014 earnings by only a 50% recovery in the revenue drop that we've seen since 2014. Now there is a lot of work behind the number in terms of how achievable it is. But as an example, in 2014, in the international market, on a pretty low revenue growth rate of 3%, 4%, we actually delivered 69% incrementals without any price in international market. So the other precedence for doing it is obviously going to be challenging to do that also in North America and in particular North America land. But with the impact we will have to have from price on this, we are, for sure, going to try to deliver incrementals north of 65%, yes."

So in terms of the charge that we've taken, this is basically catching up and finalizing the resizing of the company, which has now been dropping in activity levels over the past 7 quarters. So this charge is linked to a number of things that we have been executing in the second quarter and should bring the company into the shape where we are well positioned to navigate the bottom of the market and also well positioned to start growing again going forward. So we put a lot of details and scrutiny into any kind of impairment charge that we take, and we have done so as well in the charge for Q2, which is sizable. But we believe this is prudent, this is right, and it's justified to do what we've done. And that's why we did it. Now in terms of the outlook, like I said, we are at the bottom but we are not expecting an immediate and sharp recovery. If you look at North America versus international, some of the moving parts going into Q3, North America still has significant overcapacity at this stage in terms of services. And the low barrier to entry is also going to continue to be a major headwind, right? So we expect modest increase in land activity, but this is going to be partially offset by lower offshore work. We are significantly down in Alaska, in Eastern Canada as well as in the Gulf of Mexico. We expect some improvement in pricing, but it's going to be way short of the level required to breakeven in Q3. So we don't expect any major positive earnings improvement from North America in Q3, but it shouldn't get much worse either, right? So fairly, fairly stable earnings from North America in the third quarter and fairly similar in the international market. There is less overcapacity there due to the higher barrier of entry, and it's also quite a narrowing competitive landscape. So in principle, it should be easier to recover some of the temporary pricing concessions that we have made and -- which, in most cases, in international market is also time-bound or linked to oil price. But given the limited increase in activity we see for Q3, again, we don't expect any significant positive sequential earnings contribution from international. So overall, we expect flattish EPS in Q3."

This is not a -- it is not a surprising playbook. At some stage, when you do approach bottom, this is the shift that you need to make. But we have, I would say, done this in a concerted fashion during the second quarter. We have had very good discussions with the senior management team and laid our plans for how we're going to now shift the focus on how we navigate the next phase. And as I said earlier on, the understanding of the viability and state of the industry value chain in each of the 80 countries we operate in is extremely important to make sure that you are optimally positioned to capture the market in the countries which we believe are going to see a sustainable increase in activity, where we can also generate sustainable earnings going forward, right? So we have spent a lot of time internally with the team to lay out these plans and put this methodology in place. So we are in good shape there. We are already in execution mode of it. And in terms of the engagement with the customers, it started. It's still at a fairly, I will say, low frequency, but that is now what people do, much more widespread as we enter the third quarter here. But obviously, a lot of these discussions are going to be challenging. There is not a lot of surplus in any situation, but we believe that the temporary concessions we have made, at least part of that, will need to be returned to us. But in return for that, we are very open to engage in different types of collaborations, where we, through better management of the interface and better commercial alignment, can together drive unnecessary costs out of the system so that we can make more of the industry value chain viable in many countries around the world.

Now in North America, I think you got to separate the industry view from just how Schlumberger navigates in this system. And I think the industry -- I think there are some questions and challenges to be asked, right? How is the industry in the next upcoming cycle going to be able to operate where the entire value chain ends up being cash flow and profit positive as we enter into a complete new cycle? That was not the case in the previous cycle, and I don't think we can go on for many cycles in a similar type of fashion. Now there is a part of North America land which is viable even at lower prices, but how big that is and how much you can step up from the core acreage, I think, is to be seen. Now how we operate in that, we are aiming to be very competitive on efficiency and, in addition to that, bring new technologies -- continue to bring new technology into play, which can help our customers drive up production per well. And we have a very good offering already in place for that. So we will continue to operate the way we have been with a focus in both these dimensions. But I think at this stage, if you look at the state of the industry value chain, I can't tell you that we are going to get back to previous peak margins in North America or North America land because, at this stage, I just don't see how that can be funded in the entire value chain."

So we took a decision to slow down the buyback, sit back, reassess our need of cash, given all the opportunities we have in front of us, and we will go back into the market. We're always on the market. Our policy, we will continue to be in the market. But it is not going to be evenly spread going forward.

So before we close this morning, I would like to summarize the 4 most important points that we've discussed. 
First, we believe that we have reached the bottom of the cycle and that E&P investments now have to increase in order for the industry to meet the growing supply deficit. As E&P investment starts growing, a large part will initially have to be consumed on supplier industry price increases in order for capacity and capabilities to be available and for operating standards to be met. Second, most basins around the world are today at unprecedented low levels of activity, and we expect to see a broad-based increase in investments going forward, funded by higher oil prices. The magnitude and sustainability of the investment increase will, however, be a function of the financial viability of the entire oil industry value chain in each basin and country, which will vary significantly. 
Third, our deep local knowledge, the breadth and depth of our technology offering, together with our geographical scale, will clearly set us apart and further enable us to deliver differentiated financial results going forward. And fourth, the shortfall in profits and cash flow throughout the entire industry value chain can only be permanently addressed by a dramatic step change in industry performance, including intrinsic quality and efficiency, technology system innovations and more aligned and collaborative business models, and Schlumberger is and will remain at the absolute forefront of this industry transformation.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.23.

Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.23. This represent decreases of $0.17 sequentially and $0.65 when compared to the same quarter last year. 
During the second quarter, we recorded $2.9 billion of pretax charges. This consisted of $1.9 billion of asset impairments, $646 million relating to workforce reductions and $335 million of merger and integration charges associated with the acquisition of Cameron, which closed on April 1, 2016. 
The asset impairments are a result of the challenging market condition that continued to deteriorate during the first half of 2016. These impairments will not result in any cash outflows. As we indicated last quarter, we continued to tailor our resources to activity levels. Unfortunately, this resulted in additional workforce reductions. 
The $335 million of merger and integration charges consist of $150 million noncash inventory-related purchase accounting item, with the balance relating to transaction costs as well as the dedicated integration team and other cost to achieve synergies. We will continue to incur merger and integration charges for the rest of 2016 and into 2017. 
Our second quarter revenue was $7.2 billion. This included a full quarter of activity from Cameron, which added $1.5 billion to our top line. Excluding the impact of Cameron, revenue decreased 14% sequentially, reflecting continued activity declines, pricing pressure and the reduction of activity in Venezuela to better match cash collections. Pretax operating margins, including the effects of Cameron, decreased 404 basis points sequentially to 10.4%. Cameron was accretive to Schlumberger's pretax operating margin as well as earning per share and cash flow. 
Highlights per product group were as follows. Second quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 9% sequentially while margin decreased 228 basis points to 16.7%. These decreases were largely driven by Wireline and Testing Services activity declines across all of the International Areas, most notably in Latin America. 
Drilling Group revenue of $2 billion decreased 18% sequentially while margin declined 649 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by significant rig count reductions and pricing pressure across all areas. The largest declines were experienced in Latin America and North America. 
Production Group revenue of $2.1 billion decreased 11% sequentially and margins fell by 459 basis points, primarily on lower pressure pumping activity and further pricing pressure in North America land. Latin America also saw significant activity declines. 
As previously mentioned, the Cameron Group contributed revenue of $1.5 billion while generating pretax operating margin of 15.8%. On a pro forma basis, this represents a 6% sequential revenue decline and 130 basis points margin improvement. The decrease in revenue was largely driven by a declining project backlog as well as the further slowdown in U.S. land that impacted the shorter-cycle businesses. The margin improvement was driven by strong project execution, offset, in part, by the effects of the activity decline in U.S. land. 
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. Our corporate and other expense line has increased $69 million sequentially. This increase is driven by the $63 million of quarterly amortization expense from the intangible assets recorded in connection with the Cameron purchase accounting. 
The Schlumberger effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 16% in the second quarter, essentially the same as Q1. As I highlighted last quarter, with these reduced overall levels of pretax income that we are experiencing, relatively small changes in our tax line will have a disproportionate impact on our ETR, potentially resulting in volatility going forward. Our tax rate will continue to be very sensitive to the overall geographic mix of earnings. 
We generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations. This is despite paying approximately $285 million in severance and $100 million in one-off transaction-related fees during the quarter. 
Our net debt increased $3.4 billion during the quarter to $10 billion. This expected increase was driven by the $2.8 billion of cash we paid the Cameron shareholders and the $785 million of net debt we assumed in connection with the transaction. We ended the quarter with total cash and investment of $11.6 billion. 
During the quarter, we spent $31 million to repurchase 428,000 shares at an average price of $72.77. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included approximately $450 million on CapEx, $130 million of SPM investments, $170 million of multiclient and $630 million of dividend payments. Our CapEx on a year-to-date basis was $1 billion, which includes 1 quarter of Cameron. CapEx for the second half of 2016 is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion. These amounts do not include investment in SPM or multiclient. 
And now I will turn the conference call over to Scott."
301966,333381173,1010963,"Schlumberger Limited, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thanks, Simon, and hello, everyone. This is the first earnings conference call that I have participated in since the announcement of Schlumberger and Cameron combination in August of last year. So I'm going to provide an update on Cameron key developments",958,"Thanks, Simon, and hello, everyone. This is the first earnings conference call that I have participated in since the announcement of Schlumberger and Cameron combination in August of last year. So I'm going to provide an update on Cameron key developments in 2016 and provide you with some color on how the integration is progressing. 
The Cameron business has continued to perform well in light of the current market conditions. The margin progression journey that we started in 2014 has continued in our long-cycle businesses with strong execution of our backlog in our drilling, OneSubsea and process systems business units. We have continued to deliver our backlog while driving cost out of the system, generating enhanced margins through the cycle. 
For example, drilling margins were significantly accretive, and subsea margins were at the Cameron Group margin level. As you can imagine, our shorter-cycle businesses, Surface and Valves & Measurement, are being impacted by both volume and significant pricing pressure. Despite these pressures, both Valves & Measurement and surface have positive operating income and are delivering solid cash flow. 
Overall, the Cameron Group was able to deliver healthy cash flow and operating margins of 15.8% in the quarter, which is nearly an all-time high for Cameron. However, the Cameron Group is not immune to the downturn, as you can see in our second quarter book-to-bill ratio of 0.68. This will have a continued impact on revenue in 2017 as our longer-cycle businesses continue to move downward and our backlog reduce to $3.7 billion in these businesses at the end of the quarter. 
Let's switch to our business-unit-level details, starting with OneSubsea. OneSubsea continues to build on the vision that we created when forming the venture in 2013. In fact, we have just been awarded Woodside's Greater Enfield development, which is truly the first award that brings together the full capabilities that OneSubsea has to offer. This will be booked in July. We have been working closely with Woodside since we were awarded their subsea frame agreement in 2014. Our success in the frame agreement evolved to an integrated FEED study, which led to project award. In this project, we used our integrated solutions expertise, including flow assurance capabilities, our systems engineering to best configure the C4 architecture, our C4 boosting capabilities, our standardized horizontal SpoolTree and Subsea Landing String. 
We are very pleased to be working with Woodside in finding cost-effective solutions to move deepwater developments from concept to reality. 
With these engagements, the OneSubsea team continues to move up the learning curve on how to find deepwater solutions that are, one, cost enabling; two, deliver more production at a higher recovery factor; three, bring projects to market significantly faster; and, ultimately, improve the financial returns of deepwater developments. 
We are also working on the SPS and SURF interface, where we believe there are cost and efficiency gains. We now have 3 paid FEED studies for our OneSubsea and Subsea 7 alliance, and we are working on another 20-plus engagements currently. Other recent activities include the 6 tree award for Petrobel Zohr gas development in Egypt, which utilized a quick FEED approach and a supplier-led solution to meet a very aggressive time line at a significantly reduced cost. 
Additionally, OneSubsea has successfully commissioned 2 boosting systems in the Gulf of Mexico. OneSubsea continues to have 100% of the working C4 boosting systems in the world. Our leadership and history in boosting positions OneSubsea extremely well to capitalize on the smaller developments that tie back to existing infrastructure and host facilities. Our unique offering of a single-well boosting system, combined with a standard subsea tree, works perfectly for this growing market. 
Each of the Cameron businesses are handling this cycle well and executing on our downturn playbook, which focused on cost reduction, market share preservation and price optimization. As we move into Schlumberger, we are sharpening our focus on our service offering to capitalize on our large global installed base of equipment, and we continue to enhance our portfolio with a renewed commitment to technology. I can't tell you how proud I am of the Cameron employees as we continue to perform exceptionally well despite the industry's worst downturn and while executing a major corporate integration. 
Now I'd like to turn to the integration of Cameron into Schlumberger. To start, I think it can be best summarized as a successful continuation of the collaboration and partnership that we started in OneSubsea. The Cameron and Schlumberger teams continue to work together in an impressive manner, and I'm happy to report that the progress in the first 3 months has exceeded all of our expectations. 
In the second quarter, we booked $125 million of synergy-related business, which was significantly ahead of our original plan. We are also on track to deliver the $300 million of synergies in the first 12 months from closing. We continue to find unexpected opportunities across all of the Cameron businesses, including Valves & Measurement and processing, as we leverage the Schlumberger -- sorry, as we leverage the substantial capabilities of Schlumberger's vast geographic organization. 
Additionally, we continue to build on the concept of integrating the subsurface capabilities of Schlumberger with the surface pressure control and processing capabilities of Cameron. We started this in OneSubsea, and we are now seeing opportunities in drilling, unconventional production and production and processing facilities. 
Finally, we have started over 30 new technology development programs as part of the integration. And we are confident that these programs will deliver significant revenue synergies and growth opportunities when the markets do recover. Overall, the integration is progressing very well, and the combination and collaboration has been positively received by the Cameron employees, the Schlumberger employees and our customers. 
Now I'll turn it over to Paal."
301966,333381173,1010963,"Schlumberger Limited, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, market condition worsened further in most parts of our global operations. But in spite of the continuing operational and commercial headwinds, we have now reached the bottom of the cycle",2392,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, market condition worsened further in most parts of our global operations. But in spite of the continuing operational and commercial headwinds, we have now reached the bottom of the cycle. 
In line with the previous 6 quarters of this downturn, we continue to navigate the challenging environment with an unwavering focus on protecting the overall financial health of the company. This enabled us to generate a positive operating income of $747 million, excluding credits and charges; maintain operating margins north of 10%; and, more importantly, produce a positive operating cash flow of $1.6 billion. This solid financial performance came as a result of strong execution and, in some cases, at the expense of revenue as we now have started to shift focus onto recovering our pricing concessions and high-grading our contract portfolio. 
Second quarter revenue increased 10% sequentially, boosted by the inclusion of a full quarter's activity for the Cameron Group, which amounted to $1.5 billion. However, activity for all groups decreased in the quarter as E&P budgets were further reduced. The revenue headwinds were most pronounced in North America and further exacerbated by a decision to reduce our operations in Venezuela to fall in line with cash collections, which had a significant impact on our Latin America results. In terms of pretax operating income, close to 75% of our sequential drop was caused by North America and Venezuela. 
As I review the second quarter geographical trends, I will use pro forma numbers for the sequential comparison while I focus my comments on the characterization, Drilling and Production groups, as Scott has already covered the Cameron Group in detail. 
In North America, revenue declined 20% sequentially against an average drop in the U.S. land rig count of 25% as the activity slide now have reached bottom. The doubling in the WTI oil price since the lows seen in January of this year has also led some customers to start moving drilled but uncompleted shale wells out of inventory and into production, with the associated increase in hydraulic fracturing activity. 
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, activity was weaker as additional deepwater exploration rigs were released and the move to development activity slowed. Pricing remained under massive pressure in all land and offshore markets in North America. However, signs have started to emerge of customers recognizing that pricing levels have now fallen to unsustainable levels, leading to a growing risk of destroying capabilities and capacity required in the future. 
Within our North America business, the Drilling Group was the hardest hit in the second quarter, with Drilling & Measurements, Bits & Drilling Tools and M-I SWACO seeing the greatest activity declines. In Reservoir Characterization, however, lower revenue for Wireline and Testing Services was partly offset by sequentially stronger WesternGeco seismic work in both Canada and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
In the international markets, customer budget cuts, activity disruptions, seasonal variations and persisting pricing pressure impacted our results in most basins and market segments around the world. In Latin America, revenue declined 26% sequentially as activity in Venezuela fell significantly, following our decision to reduce operations to fall in line with cash collections. This program is managed in close coordination with all customers in the country, and operations are continuing for the Faja IOC joint ventures and for some specific PDVSA operations. Activity also decreased in Mexico and Brazil as customer budgets were curtailed further, leaving the remaining activity rig count in these 2 countries at very low levels. 
From a technology standpoint, the Drilling Group saw the largest drop in revenue with significant reductions in all product lines. In the Production Group, lower revenue from our traditional product lines was offset by robust integration-related performance, with all our projects in the region progressing well. 
In Reservoir Characterization, our multiclient seismic program in Mexico continued in advance of the upcoming deepwater license rounds. So far, we have delivered more than 40,000 square kilometers of high-resolution wide-azimuth seismic data, and early evaluation of the data is already leading to clearer identification of new exploration plays in the Gulf of Campeche Basin. 
Revenue in Europe, CIS and Africa declined 7% sequentially as widespread activity reductions throughout our Sub-Saharan Africa operations had a significant impact on our results. Nigeria and the Gulf of Guinea saw the largest fall, but the rig count in Angola also fell sharply, together with Central West Africa, where a key exploration campaign was completed. 
In the North Sea, rig-related activity in the U.K. increased while revenue was lower in Norway as seasonal shutdowns and a changing job mix impacted results. These negative factors affected all parts of our business in the area and particularly the Drilling and Production Groups. Within Reservoir Characterization, lower revenue for Wireline and Testing Services was partially offset by improving seismic revenues from WesternGeco. 
In Russia, revenue increased as the summer season ramped up in line with expectations and was further supported by the appreciation of the Russian ruble. Activity was strongest for Drilling & Measurements and Well Services, driven by solid drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity, both on land and shallow offshore. 
In the Middle East & Asia, revenue declined by 2% sequentially as lower activity in Asia more than offset strong activity in the Middle East. In Asia, activity was weakest in the Malaysia and Australia GeoMarkets as projects were canceled or completed, and the offshore rig count dropped further. The Drilling Group was most affected by this through lower demand for Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO technologies while Reservoir Characterization was also lower on weaker Wireline exploration activity. 
In the Middle East, strength in the GCC countries offset weakness in the Iraq, Oman and Egypt GeoMarkets. In Kuwait, increased rig count, continued progress on the early production facilities we are building for the Jurassic project, together with higher Artificial Lift and Completions product sales, drove revenue higher while in Saudi Arabia, activity also increased, driven by market share gains from the latest rig allocations as well as higher hydraulic fracturing activity. 
I would now like to turn to the state of our industry and also how we continue to position Schlumberger in the forefront of a challenging and evolving operating environment. We are now 7 quarters into the most severe industry downturn on record, which saw oil prices tumbling to $27 this January. Since then, we have seen a slow but steady increase in oil prices as market data continues to show a tightening of the supply and demand balance and with the outlook clearly suggesting that these trends will further accelerate going forward. 
While the current level of oil prices has created unprecedented turmoil throughout our industry, the financial challenges that have now become very visible are really nothing new. For some time, there has been a growing shortfall of both profits and cash flow for many oil producers around the world as the cost of developing increasingly complex oil resources has outgrown the value created, which could be seen even when oil prices were at $100 per barrel. The dramatic restructuring of the supply side we are currently experiencing has just accelerated and amplified the cost, quality and efficiency problems of the industry and led to a more acute cash and profitability crisis. 
The operators have reacted to this crisis by initiating a massive reduction in oilfield activity and by sending unsustainable pricing shock throughout the entire oil industry supply chain. In addition, there is currently also a widespread high-grading of activity taking place in the industry aimed at maximizing short-term production and cash flow. 
Adding up all of this, the current cost per barrel for the oil producers now appears to be significantly lower than what was the case 7 quarters ago. However, this should not be confused with a permanent improvement in the underlying industry performance as there has been little to no fundamental change in technology, quality or efficiency, no major step change in industry collaboration and no general transformation of the industry business model. What has taken place over the past 20 -- 21 months is instead a redistribution of the profit and cash flow shortfall from previously existing mostly with the oil producers to now representing an unsustainable burden for the supplier industry even after a massive reduction of cost and capacity. 
So where does this leave the industry? First of all, assuming that we continue to see a steady growth in demand, we are heading towards a significant global supply deficit as the E&P spend rate now is down by more than 50%. The effect of the reduced E&P spend is already clearly visible in the 2016 non-OPEC production numbers, which are set to drop by 900,000 barrels per day versus last year, and can also be seen by the weakness in the OPEC production outside of the Gulf countries. And as the opportunities for activity high-grading are exhausted, we should see a further acceleration in the global production decline. 
In addition, the market is also underestimating the potential reaction from the supplier industry, which has temporarily accepted financially unviable contracts to support the operators and to keep their options open as the downturn has deepened and extended into uncharted territory. This is seen by the service industry profit levels and also from their ballooning receivables balances, caused by operators who are unable or unwilling to provide timely payments. It also means that, inevitably, service industry pricing has to recover. And as it does, this will consume a large part of the E&P investment increases intended for additional activity, which will further amplify the pending oil supply deficit. 
So how are we navigating this challenging industry environment? To start with, we believe that the chronic shortfall in profits and cash flow throughout the oil industry value chain can only be permanently addressed by a dramatic step change in industry performance. This has to begin with a transformation of the intrinsic quality and efficiency of each industry player but would also require the design of much broader technology systems, including both innovative hardware as well as high-level software control systems. In addition, we believe that the future industry winners will be the companies that can more effectively integrate the entire industry value chain through an open and collaborative business model with much better commercial alignment between the key contributing parties. 
After 7 quarters of managing our business in an increasingly complex industry environment, where we have made a series of strategic and tactical moves, we are well advanced in shaping and positioning our company for future success, as can be seen by the following facts. First, our balance sheet remains strong with more than $11 billion in cash and short-term investments, and we are also one of the few companies in the industry that still generates a positive free cash flow after actively reinvesting in our business and steadily returning cash to our shareholders in form of dividends and stock buybacks. 
Second, we have an unprecedented global technology offering that we have significantly expanded in the past 21 months through the purchase of a number of smaller technology companies as well as the major acquisition of Cameron. Third, the addition of the Cameron Group to our technology portfolio will enable the development of major integrated technology systems, including our land drilling system, a future hydraulic fracturing system and a new surface production system that combines processing, measurements and control. 
Fourth, we have established a range of tiered integration business models that enable us to evolve our customer engagements as well as the type of contracts we take on. And last, the benefits we are seeing from our transformation program are creating a significant and long-term competitive advantage through a steady improvement in our internal, intrinsic performance. 
In Schlumberger, we continue to have a stated goal of serving all customers in all basins and countries around the world, provided it is permissible by local and international law, that is safe for our people and assets and that it is financially viable. And as oil prices have doubled since the lows in January, we have now shifted our focus from decremental margins and increasing our tender win rates over to our contracts portfolio, where we are looking to recover the temporary pricing concessions we have made or renegotiate those contracts which, at present, show no promise of becoming financially viable. 
As we now enter a new phase of the cycle, oilfield activity has to increase in most countries around the world for the industry to meet the growing supply deficit. The sustainably of this activity recovery will be defined by the financial viability of the entire oil industry value chain, which will vary significantly from country to country. And in places where the total value chain remains in a chronic financial shortfall, the increase in activity will not be sustainable. 
A key question in this respect is the sustainability of a North American land recovery, where the cumulative industry earnings and free cash flow was negative over the last cycle. And given the resulting financial state of the value chain in this commoditized market, a large wave of cost inflation from every part of the supplier industry is now building, which the E&P companies will have to absorb in parallel with implementing their activity growth plans. 
As we now enter the next phase of the cycle, the breadth and depth of our technology offering, together with our geographical scale and our knowledge of the financial viability of the industry value chain in each operating country will clearly set us apart and further enable us to deliver differentiated financial results going forward. 
In preparation for the next phase, we have already reenergized our management team and formulated detailed plans for how we will navigate this new environment. And as part of this, we have set ourselves a company-wide goal of delivering incremental margins higher than 65% on the forthcoming activity growth. The combination of the technical and strategic moves we have made and are continuing to make has enabled us to navigate the challenging industry environment better than most and, above all, will ensure that Schlumberger continues to remain at the absolute forefront of an industry that is set to undergo significant change in the coming years. 
That concludes my remarks. We will now open up for questions."

You talk about pricing and sustainability and the unsustainable pricing that we have. Investor focus today seems definitely to be on North America because of the expectation it's going to recover first. And in North America, the biggest concern still seems to be on pressure pumping. And historically, you guys would improve your margins by increasing utilization of equipment. And that would be the first big run in improving your margins, and then pricing would follow at some point in the future as utilization got higher. You talk about how things are different this time. Can you talk about your outlook for what happens in the U.S. pressure pumping market, how fast pricing comes back, how you will be able to get pricing and what will cause that pricing improvement ahead of some of your peers? I guess that's more of a technology versus commodity discussion. But can you walk us through, just on a regional basis, if you would, your outlook on how pressure pumping utilization and pricing evolve over the next year or 2?"

And that activity will increase not in a V-shaped, dramatic fashion, but I think there will be a steady increase in rig count and associated frac activity both from the rigs as from wells coming out of the dock inventory. Now again, I think the activity will be more slow and steady. And obviously, with higher utilization, there is some contribution to margins. But margins are deeply negative, and I would say, at this stage, more activity at the current margin level is just going to be dilutive to earnings. So I think most companies now will be looking for price increases and, in fact, significant price increases actually to bring profitability back to breakeven and into positive territory before that activity is particularly attractive in terms of driving earnings back to previous year levels. So how do we get the pricing? I think, obviously, technology efficiency, managing the supply chain is going to be important. But I think, overall, the entire value chain in North America is highly stressed. As I indicated, in the previous cycle, it is cumulatively negative both on profits and free cash flow, so I don't think there is an open-ended, dramatic improvement at hand without doing anything. I think technology has to play a very important role in this. We've said in many fora that if you look at the cost per well, I think we are in late innings. But in terms of production per well, we are in very early innings. And if you want to drive down cost per barrel, we have to look at ways of getting more production out of each well. But overall utilization will help. But given the pain that the entire industry value chain is in, there's going to be a mounting wave of cost inflation from every supplier in that chain, which I think is going to put significant pressure on how quickly activity can recover."

Profitability for the more profitable companies have come through internal transformations and through significant investments in technology like for our -- in our case. So we have not gained any pricing, so we have very little pricing to give up. Now in a dramatic downturn as we have been experiencing over the past 7 quarters, there is a need to align with the customer base, which, obviously, has the immediate oil price exposure, and we have done that. And the vast majority of the pricing concessions we have made to existing and valid contracts are temporary in nature. They're either time-bound or they are linked to some kind of oil price trigger. And that's why we have aligned with our customers on the down of the cycle, and we now expect that, that will be returned to us as oil prices start to increase.

But we see a general, I would say, adaptation of all aspects of integration taking place all around the world. The least impact of integration so far, if I just look at the high level, has been in North America, where it's still rather fragmented in between the rig and the various parts of the drilling process as well as in the production and completion part of the work. So we are continuing to drive forward our offering around creating a total drilling system and a total completion system, including fracking, for the land markets, and I'm quite optimistic that these should have significant uptake even in places like U.S. land or some of the other unconventional basins around the world.

It is down in percentage terms, which you would expect, but it has held up well as well as our new technology sales has held up well also during the cycle. So I think we're very well positioned.

Look, the 15.8% that we are able to achieve in the quarter was exceptional. And as you know, it's one of the highest quarters we've ever had. The forward look is a little bit complicated because what's happening is we've got really strong execution in both drilling OneSubsea and process systems. And those are a longer -- or bigger backlog and longer-cycle businesses, and those are going to start to come down. And so -- and now you've got a lot of pricing pressure that we've seen in 2015 start to come into the mix, and so we think 15.8% is a very high level. That will start to taper down here in the quarters to come. And then where we really start to see some uplift, and it's just -- it's a matter of timing here, but as Paal described, right, we do believe we're going to get pricing in the shorter-cycle businesses, so both Surface and Valves & Measurement. And then in addition to that, you start to layer in the synergies from the integration itself. And so I don't expect us to exceed the 15.8% here in the short term. I think that comes down steadily over time, but then as we get pricing traction and those short-cycle businesses begin to pick up, we could, indeed, see those margins come back up into a higher territory. And then in terms of booking outlook, I'll start with deepwater, and what I'll say is it is in a very bad state in terms of progressing and moving projects forward. And we're very fortunate to work with Woodside and get one past FID, but we don't see any major projects here for the remainder of the year. And in fact, our estimates for trees this year are less than 100. There are a few projects out there next year that are relatively large in size. We feel good about our ability to work with operators and achieve those. But at the same time, the industry has got significant capacity, and those are going to be incredibly competitive. And so I feel -- I'm a little concerned about the outlook with deepwater. Now however, the counter to that is we have a very strong belief in what we're doing with OneSubsea. And like I described in the opening comments, right, the ability to tie the reservoir to what we're doing, drive cost out of the system through our standardized approach and then get more out of production, we feel very good about that. On the other businesses, Surface and V&M are tied to rig count, and they have a significant North American exposure. And as Paal described, we think those markets start to increase here going forward. And so that's going to be the big kind of flux position for us, if you will. If those start to come back faster, then our outlook starts to look pretty good."

But I'm not ready to sort of break it down for you in any more geographical granularity other than it is a high-level goal. It's an ambitious goal, but the -- there is a logic behind it. I think, first of all, our decrementals for the -- for 2015 and so far in 2016 is in the range of 30% to 32%. And if you can double the incremental from that decremental rate, that means that you should be able to restore 2014 earnings, which is the place we want to be as quickly as possible to continue to deliver on the plan we laid out in the 2014 Investor Conference. We can actually recover 2014 earnings by only a 50% recovery in the revenue drop that we've seen since 2014. Now there is a lot of work behind the number in terms of how achievable it is. But as an example, in 2014, in the international market, on a pretty low revenue growth rate of 3%, 4%, we actually delivered 69% incrementals without any price in international market. So we have a precedent in this world [ph] for doing it. It's obviously going to be challenging to do that also in North America and in particular North America land. But with the impact we will have to have from price on this, we are, for sure, going to try to deliver incrementals north of 65%, yes."

So in terms of the charge that we've taken, this is basically catching up and finalizing the resizing of the company, which has now been dropping in activity levels over the past 7 quarters. So this charge is linked to a number of things that we have been executing in the second quarter and should bring the company into the shape where we are well positioned to navigate the bottom of the market and also well positioned to start growing again going forward. So we put a lot of details and scrutiny into any kind of impairment charge that we take, and we have done so as well in the charge for Q2, which is sizable. But we believe this is prudent, this is right, and it's justified to do what we've done. And that's why we did it. Now in terms of the outlook, like I said, we are at the bottom but we are not expecting an immediate and sharp recovery. If you look at North America versus international, some of the moving parts going into Q3, North America still has significant overcapacity at this stage in terms of services. And the low barrier to entry is also going to continue to be a major headwind, right? So we expect modest increase in land activity, but this is going to be partially offset by lower offshore work. We are significantly down in Alaska, in Eastern Canada as well as in the Gulf of Mexico. We expect some improvement in pricing, but it's going to be way short of the level required to breakeven in Q3. So we don't expect any major positive earnings improvement from North America in Q3, but it shouldn't get much worse either, right? So fairly, fairly stable earnings from North America in the third quarter and fairly similar in the international market. There is less overcapacity there due to the higher barrier of entry, and it's also quite a narrowing competitive landscape. So in principle, it should be easier to recover some of the temporary pricing concessions that we have made and -- which, in most cases, in international market is also time-bound or linked to oil price. But given the limited increase in activity we see for Q3, again, we don't expect any significant positive sequential earnings contribution from international. So overall, we expect flattish EPS in Q3."

This is not a -- it is not a surprising playbook. At some stage, when you do approach bottom, this is the shift that you need to make. But we have, I would say, done this in a concerted fashion during the second quarter. We have had very good discussions with the senior management team and laid our plans for how we're going to now shift the focus on how we navigate the next phase. And as I said earlier on, the understanding of the viability and state of the industry value chain in each of the 80 countries we operate in is extremely important to make sure that you are optimally positioned to capture the market in the countries which we believe are going to see a sustainable increase in activity, where we can also generate sustainable earnings going forward, right? So we have spent a lot of time internally with the team to lay out these plans and put this methodology in place. So we are in good shape there. We are already in execution mode of it. And in terms of the engagement with the customers, it started. It's still at a fairly, I will say, low frequency, but that is now what people do, much more widespread as we enter the third quarter here. But obviously, a lot of these discussions are going to be challenging. There is not a lot of surplus in any situation, but we believe that the temporary concessions we have made, at least part of that, will need to be returned to us. But in return for that, we are very open to engage in different types of collaborations, where we, through better management of the interface and better commercial alignment, can together drive unnecessary costs out of the system so that we can make more of the industry value chain viable in many countries around the world.

In international markets, it's very important to have the contracts. And we have a range of contracts today that we have won with very little activity in them, but they have potential for significant increases in activity in terms of rig additions and so forth going forward. And so what is very important over the past year, which we have had a lot of focus on, has been the tender win rate and then having the contracts and then being able to translate that into revenue in the coming 1 to 2 years."

But I think at this stage, if you look at the state of the industry value chain, I can't tell you that we are going to get back to previous peak margins in North America or North America land because, at this stage, I just don't see how that can be funded in the entire value chain."

The $11.6 billion that we have in cash, obviously, do reflect excess cash, but excess cash should not be looked at on a one given period. We have to project several quarters in advance. And during the quarter, there were major cash movements in relation to the Cameron acquisition, the cash we paid to the shareholders, we bought back some of the debt of Cameron. So we took a decision to slow down the buyback, sit back, reassess our need of cash, given all the opportunities we have in front of us, and we will go back into the market. We're always in the market. Our policy, we will continue to be in the market. But it is not going to be evenly spread going forward. It is an exceptional period during the quarter due to the acquisition and, basically, a reassessment of how we're going to use the cash. But buyback will always be a part of our plan."

So before we close this morning, I would like to summarize the 4 most important points that we've discussed. 
First, we believe that we have reached the bottom of the cycle and that E&P investments now have to increase in order for the industry to meet the growing supply deficit. As E&P investment starts growing, a large part will initially have to be consumed on supplier industry price increases in order for capacity and capabilities to be available and for operating standards to be met. Second, most basins around the world are today at unprecedented low levels of activity, and we expect to see a broad-based increase in investments going forward, funded by higher oil prices. The magnitude and sustainability of the investment increase will, however, be a function of the financial viability of the entire oil industry value chain in each basin and country, which will vary significantly. 
Third, our deep local knowledge, the breadth and depth of our technology offering, together with our geographical scale, will clearly set us apart and further enable us to deliver differentiated financial results going forward. And fourth, the shortfall in profits and cash flow throughout the entire industry value chain can only be permanently addressed by a dramatic step change in industry performance, including intrinsic quality and efficiency, technology system innovations and more aligned and collaborative business models, and Schlumberger is and will remain at the absolute forefront of this industry transformation.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.23. This represent decreases of $0.17 sequentially and $0.65 when compared to the same",779,"Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. 
Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.23. This represent decreases of $0.17 sequentially and $0.65 when compared to the same quarter last year. 
During the second quarter, we recorded $2.9 billion of pretax charges. This consisted of $1.9 billion of asset impairments, $646 million relating to workforce reductions and $335 million of merger and integration charges associated with the acquisition of Cameron, which closed on April 1, 2016. 
The asset impairments are a result of the challenging market condition that continued to deteriorate during the first half of 2016. These impairments will not result in any cash outflows. As we indicated last quarter, we continued to tailor our resources to activity levels. Unfortunately, this resulted in additional workforce reductions. 
The $335 million of merger and integration charges consist of $150 million noncash inventory-related purchase accounting item, with the balance relating to transaction costs as well as the dedicated integration team and other cost to achieve synergies. We will continue to incur merger and integration charges for the rest of 2016 and into 2017. 
Our second quarter revenue was $7.2 billion. This included a full quarter of activity from Cameron, which added $1.5 billion to our top line. Excluding the impact of Cameron, revenue decreased 14% sequentially, reflecting continued activity declines, pricing pressure and the reduction of activity in Venezuela to better match cash collections. Pretax operating margins, including the effects of Cameron, decreased 404 basis points sequentially to 10.4%. Cameron was accretive to Schlumberger's pretax operating margin as well as earning per share and cash flow. 
Highlights per product group were as follows. Second quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 9% sequentially while margin decreased 228 basis points to 16.7%. These decreases were largely driven by Wireline and Testing Services activity declines across all of the International Areas, most notably in Latin America. 
Drilling Group revenue of $2 billion decreased 18% sequentially while margin declined 649 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by significant rig count reductions and pricing pressure across all areas. The largest declines were experienced in Latin America and North America. 
Production Group revenue of $2.1 billion decreased 11% sequentially and margins fell by 459 basis points, primarily on lower pressure pumping activity and further pricing pressure in North America land. Latin America also saw significant activity declines. 
As previously mentioned, the Cameron Group contributed revenue of $1.5 billion while generating pretax operating margin of 15.8%. On a pro forma basis, this represents a 6% sequential revenue decline and 130 basis points margin improvement. The decrease in revenue was largely driven by a declining project backlog as well as the further slowdown in U.S. land that impacted the shorter-cycle businesses. The margin improvement was driven by strong project execution, offset, in part, by the effects of the activity decline in U.S. land. 
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. Our corporate and other expense line has increased $69 million sequentially. This increase is driven by the $63 million of quarterly amortization expense from the intangible assets recorded in connection with the Cameron purchase accounting. 
The Schlumberger effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 16% in the second quarter, essentially the same as Q1. As I highlighted last quarter, with these reduced overall levels of pretax income that we are experiencing, relatively small changes in our tax line will have a disproportionate impact on our ETR, potentially resulting in volatility going forward. Our tax rate will continue to be very sensitive to the overall geographic mix of earnings. 
We generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations. This is despite paying approximately $285 million in severance and $100 million in one-off transaction-related fees during the quarter. 
Our net debt increased $3.4 billion during the quarter to $10 billion. This expected increase was driven by the $2.8 billion of cash we paid the Cameron shareholders and the $785 million of net debt we assumed in connection with the transaction. We ended the quarter with total cash and investment of $11.6 billion. 
During the quarter, we spent $31 million to repurchase 428,000 shares at an average price of $72.77. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included approximately $450 million on CapEx, $130 million of SPM investments, $170 million of multiclient and $630 million of dividend payments. Our CapEx on a year-to-date basis was $1 billion, which includes 1 quarter of Cameron. CapEx for the second half of 2016 is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion. These amounts do not include investment in SPM or multiclient. 
And now I will turn the conference call over to Scott."
301966,333381173,1011063,"Schlumberger Limited, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thanks, Simon, and hello, everyone. This is the first earnings conference call that I have participated in since the announcement of Schlumberger and Cameron combination in August of last year. So I'm going to provide an update on Cameron key developments",958,"Thanks, Simon, and hello, everyone. This is the first earnings conference call that I have participated in since the announcement of Schlumberger and Cameron combination in August of last year. So I'm going to provide an update on Cameron key developments in 2016 and provide you with some color on how the integration is progressing. 
The Cameron business has continued to perform well in light of the current market conditions. The margin progression journey that we started in 2014 has continued in our long-cycle businesses with strong execution of our backlog in our drilling, OneSubsea and process systems business units. We have continued to deliver our backlog while driving cost out of the system, generating enhanced margins through the cycle. 
For example, drilling margins were significantly accretive, and subsea margins were at the Cameron Group margin level. As you can imagine, our shorter-cycle businesses, Surface and Valves & Measurement, are being impacted by both volume and significant pricing pressure. Despite these pressures, both Valves & Measurement and surface have positive operating income and are delivering solid cash flow. 
Overall, the Cameron Group was able to deliver healthy cash flow and operating margins of 15.8% in the quarter, which is nearly an all-time high for Cameron. However, the Cameron Group is not immune to the downturn, as you can see in our second quarter book-to-bill ratio of 0.68. This will have a continued impact on revenue in 2017 as our longer-cycle businesses continue to move downward and our backlog reduce to $3.7 billion in these businesses at the end of the quarter. 
Let's switch to our business-unit-level details, starting with OneSubsea. OneSubsea continues to build on the vision that we created when forming the venture in 2013. In fact, we have just been awarded Woodside's Greater Enfield development, which is truly the first award that brings together the full capabilities that OneSubsea has to offer. This will be booked in July. We have been working closely with Woodside since we were awarded their subsea frame agreement in 2014. Our success in the frame agreement evolved to an integrated FEED study, which led to project award. In this project, we used our integrated solutions expertise, including flow assurance capabilities, our systems engineering to best configure the C4 architecture, our C4 boosting capabilities, our standardized horizontal SpoolTree and Subsea Landing String. 
We are very pleased to be working with Woodside in finding cost-effective solutions to move deepwater developments from concept to reality. 
With these engagements, the OneSubsea team continues to move up the learning curve on how to find deepwater solutions that are, one, cost enabling; two, deliver more production at a higher recovery factor; three, bring projects to market significantly faster; and, ultimately, improve the financial returns of deepwater developments. 
We are also working on the SPS and SURF interface, where we believe there are cost and efficiency gains. We now have 3 paid FEED studies for our OneSubsea and Subsea 7 alliance, and we are working on another 20-plus engagements currently. Other recent activities include the 6 tree award for Petrobel Zohr gas development in Egypt, which utilized a quick FEED approach and a supplier-led solution to meet a very aggressive time line at a significantly reduced cost. 
Additionally, OneSubsea has successfully commissioned 2 boosting systems in the Gulf of Mexico. OneSubsea continues to have 100% of the working C4 boosting systems in the world. Our leadership and history in boosting positions OneSubsea extremely well to capitalize on the smaller developments that tie back to existing infrastructure and host facilities. Our unique offering of a single-well boosting system, combined with a standard subsea tree, works perfectly for this growing market. 
Each of the Cameron businesses are handling this cycle well and executing on our downturn playbook, which focused on cost reduction, market share preservation and price optimization. As we move into Schlumberger, we are sharpening our focus on our service offering to capitalize on our large global installed base of equipment, and we continue to enhance our portfolio with a renewed commitment to technology. I can't tell you how proud I am of the Cameron employees as we continue to perform exceptionally well despite the industry's worst downturn and while executing a major corporate integration. 
Now I'd like to turn to the integration of Cameron into Schlumberger. To start, I think it can be best summarized as a successful continuation of the collaboration and partnership that we started in OneSubsea. The Cameron and Schlumberger teams continue to work together in an impressive manner, and I'm happy to report that the progress in the first 3 months has exceeded all of our expectations. 
In the second quarter, we booked $125 million of synergy-related business, which was significantly ahead of our original plan. We are also on track to deliver the $300 million of synergies in the first 12 months from closing. We continue to find unexpected opportunities across all of the Cameron businesses, including Valves & Measurement and processing, as we leverage the Schlumberger -- sorry, as we leverage the substantial capabilities of Schlumberger's vast geographic organization. 
Additionally, we continue to build on the concept of integrating the subsurface capabilities of Schlumberger with the surface pressure control and processing capabilities of Cameron. We started this in OneSubsea, and we are now seeing opportunities in drilling, unconventional production and production and processing facilities. 
Finally, we have started over 30 new technology development programs as part of the integration. And we are confident that these programs will deliver significant revenue synergies and growth opportunities when the markets do recover. Overall, the integration is progressing very well, and the combination and collaboration has been positively received by the Cameron employees, the Schlumberger employees and our customers. 
Now I'll turn it over to Paal."

In the second quarter, market condition worsened further in most parts of our global operations. But in spite of the continuing operational and commercial headwinds, we have now reached the bottom of the cycle",2392,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, market condition worsened further in most parts of our global operations. But in spite of the continuing operational and commercial headwinds, we have now reached the bottom of the cycle. 
In line with the previous 6 quarters of this downturn, we continue to navigate the challenging environment with an unwavering focus on protecting the overall financial health of the company. This enabled us to generate a positive operating income of $747 million, excluding credits and charges; maintain operating margins north of 10%; and, more importantly, produce a positive operating cash flow of $1.6 billion. This solid financial performance came as a result of strong execution and, in some cases, at the expense of revenue as we now have started to shift focus onto recovering our pricing concessions and high-grading our contract portfolio. 
Second quarter revenue increased 10% sequentially, boosted by the inclusion of a full quarter's activity for the Cameron Group, which amounted to $1.5 billion. However, activity for all groups decreased in the quarter as E&P budgets were further reduced. The revenue headwinds were most pronounced in North America and further exacerbated by a decision to reduce our operations in Venezuela to fall in line with cash collections, which had a significant impact on our Latin America results. In terms of pretax operating income, close to 75% of our sequential drop was caused by North America and Venezuela. 
As I review the second quarter geographical trends, I will use pro forma numbers for the sequential comparison while I focus my comments on the characterization, Drilling and Production groups, as Scott has already covered the Cameron Group in detail. 
In North America, revenue declined 20% sequentially against an average drop in the U.S. land rig count of 25% as the activity slide now have reached bottom. The doubling in the WTI oil price since the lows seen in January of this year has also led some customers to start moving drilled but uncompleted shale wells out of inventory and into production, with the associated increase in hydraulic fracturing activity. 
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, activity was weaker as additional deepwater exploration rigs were released and the move to development activity slowed. Pricing remained under massive pressure in all land and offshore markets in North America. However, signs have started to emerge of customers recognizing that pricing levels have now fallen to unsustainable levels, leading to a growing risk of destroying capabilities and capacity required in the future. 
Within our North America business, the Drilling Group was the hardest hit in the second quarter, with Drilling & Measurements, Bits & Drilling Tools and M-I SWACO seeing the greatest activity declines. In Reservoir Characterization, however, lower revenue for Wireline and Testing Services was partly offset by sequentially stronger WesternGeco seismic work in both Canada and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
In the international markets, customer budget cuts, activity disruptions, seasonal variations and persisting pricing pressure impacted our results in most basins and market segments around the world. In Latin America, revenue declined 26% sequentially as activity in Venezuela fell significantly, following our decision to reduce operations to fall in line with cash collections. This program is managed in close coordination with all customers in the country, and operations are continuing for the Faja IOC joint ventures and for some specific PDVSA operations. Activity also decreased in Mexico and Brazil as customer budgets were curtailed further, leaving the remaining activity rig count in these 2 countries at very low levels. 
From a technology standpoint, the Drilling Group saw the largest drop in revenue with significant reductions in all product lines. In the Production Group, lower revenue from our traditional product lines was offset by robust integration-related performance, with all our projects in the region progressing well. 
In Reservoir Characterization, our multiclient seismic program in Mexico continued in advance of the upcoming deepwater license rounds. So far, we have delivered more than 40,000 square kilometers of high-resolution wide-azimuth seismic data, and early evaluation of the data is already leading to clearer identification of new exploration plays in the Gulf of Campeche Basin. 
Revenue in Europe, CIS and Africa declined 7% sequentially as widespread activity reductions throughout our Sub-Saharan Africa operations had a significant impact on our results. Nigeria and the Gulf of Guinea saw the largest fall, but the rig count in Angola also fell sharply, together with Central West Africa, where a key exploration campaign was completed. 
In the North Sea, rig-related activity in the U.K. increased while revenue was lower in Norway as seasonal shutdowns and a changing job mix impacted results. These negative factors affected all parts of our business in the area and particularly the Drilling and Production Groups. Within Reservoir Characterization, lower revenue for Wireline and Testing Services was partially offset by improving seismic revenues from WesternGeco. 
In Russia, revenue increased as the summer season ramped up in line with expectations and was further supported by the appreciation of the Russian ruble. Activity was strongest for Drilling & Measurements and Well Services, driven by solid drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity, both on land and shallow offshore. 
In the Middle East & Asia, revenue declined by 2% sequentially as lower activity in Asia more than offset strong activity in the Middle East. In Asia, activity was weakest in the Malaysia and Australia GeoMarkets as projects were canceled or completed, and the offshore rig count dropped further. The Drilling Group was most affected by this through lower demand for Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO technologies while Reservoir Characterization was also lower on weaker Wireline exploration activity. 
In the Middle East, strength in the GCC countries offset weakness in the Iraq, Oman and Egypt GeoMarkets. In Kuwait, increased rig count, continued progress on the early production facilities we are building for the Jurassic project, together with higher Artificial Lift and Completions product sales, drove revenue higher while in Saudi Arabia, activity also increased, driven by market share gains from the latest rig allocations as well as higher hydraulic fracturing activity. 
I would now like to turn to the state of our industry and also how we continue to position Schlumberger in the forefront of a challenging and evolving operating environment. We are now 7 quarters into the most severe industry downturn on record, which saw oil prices tumbling to $27 this January. Since then, we have seen a slow but steady increase in oil prices as market data continues to show a tightening of the supply and demand balance and with the outlook clearly suggesting that these trends will further accelerate going forward. 
While the current level of oil prices has created unprecedented turmoil throughout our industry, the financial challenges that have now become very visible are really nothing new. For some time, there has been a growing shortfall of both profits and cash flow for many oil producers around the world as the cost of developing increasingly complex oil resources has outgrown the value created, which could be seen even when oil prices were at $100 per barrel. The dramatic restructuring of the supply side we are currently experiencing has just accelerated and amplified the cost, quality and efficiency problems of the industry and led to a more acute cash and profitability crisis. 
The operators have reacted to this crisis by initiating a massive reduction in oilfield activity and by sending unsustainable pricing shock throughout the entire oil industry supply chain. In addition, there is currently also a widespread high-grading of activity taking place in the industry aimed at maximizing short-term production and cash flow. 
Adding up all of this, the current cost per barrel for the oil producers now appears to be significantly lower than what was the case 7 quarters ago. However, this should not be confused with a permanent improvement in the underlying industry performance as there has been little to no fundamental change in technology, quality or efficiency, no major step change in industry collaboration and no general transformation of the industry business model. What has taken place over the past 20 -- 21 months is instead a redistribution of the profit and cash flow shortfall from previously existing mostly with the oil producers to now representing an unsustainable burden for the supplier industry even after a massive reduction of cost and capacity. 
So where does this leave the industry? First of all, assuming that we continue to see a steady growth in demand, we are heading towards a significant global supply deficit as the E&P spend rate now is down by more than 50%. The effect of the reduced E&P spend is already clearly visible in the 2016 non-OPEC production numbers, which are set to drop by 900,000 barrels per day versus last year, and can also be seen by the weakness in the OPEC production outside of the Gulf countries. And as the opportunities for activity high-grading are exhausted, we should see a further acceleration in the global production decline. 
In addition, the market is also underestimating the potential reaction from the supplier industry, which has temporarily accepted financially unviable contracts to support the operators and to keep their options open as the downturn has deepened and extended into uncharted territory. This is seen by the service industry profit levels and also from their ballooning receivables balances, caused by operators who are unable or unwilling to provide timely payments. It also means that, inevitably, service industry pricing has to recover. And as it does, this will consume a large part of the E&P investment increases intended for additional activity, which will further amplify the pending oil supply deficit. 
So how are we navigating this challenging industry environment? To start with, we believe that the chronic shortfall in profits and cash flow throughout the oil industry value chain can only be permanently addressed by a dramatic step change in industry performance. This has to begin with a transformation of the intrinsic quality and efficiency of each industry player but would also require the design of much broader technology systems, including both innovative hardware as well as high-level software control systems. In addition, we believe that the future industry winners will be the companies that can more effectively integrate the entire industry value chain through an open and collaborative business model with much better commercial alignment between the key contributing parties. 
After 7 quarters of managing our business in an increasingly complex industry environment, where we have made a series of strategic and tactical moves, we are well advanced in shaping and positioning our company for future success, as can be seen by the following facts. First, our balance sheet remains strong with more than $11 billion in cash and short-term investments, and we are also one of the few companies in the industry that still generates a positive free cash flow after actively reinvesting in our business and steadily returning cash to our shareholders in form of dividends and stock buybacks. 
Second, we have an unprecedented global technology offering that we have significantly expanded in the past 21 months through the purchase of a number of smaller technology companies as well as the major acquisition of Cameron. Third, the addition of the Cameron Group to our technology portfolio will enable the development of major integrated technology systems, including our land drilling system, a future hydraulic fracturing system and a new surface production system that combines processing, measurements and control. 
Fourth, we have established a range of tiered integration business models that enable us to evolve our customer engagements as well as the type of contracts we take on. And last, the benefits we are seeing from our transformation program are creating a significant and long-term competitive advantage through a steady improvement in our internal, intrinsic performance. 
In Schlumberger, we continue to have a stated goal of serving all customers in all basins and countries around the world, provided it is permissible by local and international law, that is safe for our people and assets and that it is financially viable. And as oil prices have doubled since the lows in January, we have now shifted our focus from decremental margins and increasing our tender win rates over to our contracts portfolio, where we are looking to recover the temporary pricing concessions we have made or renegotiate those contracts which, at present, show no promise of becoming financially viable. 
As we now enter a new phase of the cycle, oilfield activity has to increase in most countries around the world for the industry to meet the growing supply deficit. The sustainably of this activity recovery will be defined by the financial viability of the entire oil industry value chain, which will vary significantly from country to country. And in places where the total value chain remains in a chronic financial shortfall, the increase in activity will not be sustainable. 
A key question in this respect is the sustainability of a North American land recovery, where the cumulative industry earnings and free cash flow was negative over the last cycle. And given the resulting financial state of the value chain in this commoditized market, a large wave of cost inflation from every part of the supplier industry is now building, which the E&P companies will have to absorb in parallel with implementing their activity growth plans. 
As we now enter the next phase of the cycle, the breadth and depth of our technology offering, together with our geographical scale and our knowledge of the financial viability of the industry value chain in each operating country will clearly set us apart and further enable us to deliver differentiated financial results going forward. 
In preparation for the next phase, we have already reenergized our management team and formulated detailed plans for how we will navigate this new environment. And as part of this, we have set ourselves a company-wide goal of delivering incremental margins higher than 65% on the forthcoming activity growth. The combination of the technical and strategic moves we have made and are continuing to make has enabled us to navigate the challenging industry environment better than most and, above all, will ensure that Schlumberger continues to remain at the absolute forefront of an industry that is set to undergo significant change in the coming years. 
That concludes my remarks. We will now open up for questions."

And that would be the first big run in improving your margins, and then pricing would follow at some point in the future as utilization got higher. You talk about how things are different this time. Can you talk about your outlook for what happens in the U.S. pressure pumping market, how fast pricing comes back, how you will be able to get pricing and what will cause that pricing improvement ahead of some of your peers? I guess that's more of a technology versus commodity discussion. But can you walk us through, just on a regional basis, if you would, your outlook on how pressure pumping utilization and pricing evolve over the next year or 2?"

And that activity will increase not in a V-shaped, dramatic fashion, but I think there will be a steady increase in rig count and associated frac activity both from the rigs as from wells coming out of the dock inventory. Now again, I think the activity will be more slow and steady. And obviously, with higher utilization, there is some contribution to margins. But margins are deeply negative, and I would say, at this stage, more activity at the current margin level is just going to be dilutive to earnings. So I think most companies now will be looking for price increases and, in fact, significant price increases actually to bring profitability back to breakeven and into positive territory before that activity is particularly attractive in terms of driving earnings back to previous year levels. So how do we get the pricing? I think, obviously, technology efficiency, managing the supply chain is going to be important. But I think, overall, the entire value chain in North America is highly stressed. As I indicated, in the previous cycle, it is cumulatively negative both on profits and free cash flow, so I don't think there is an open-ended, dramatic improvement at hand without doing anything. I think technology has to play a very important role in this. We've said in many fora that if you look at the cost per well, I think we are in late innings. But in terms of production per well, we are in very early innings. And if you want to drive down cost per barrel, we have to look at ways of getting more production out of each well. But overall utilization will help. But given the pain that the entire industry value chain is in, there's going to be a mounting wave of cost inflation from every supplier in that chain, which I think is going to put significant pressure on how quickly activity can recover."

So we are in a very different situation industry-wide at this stage, where the service industry hasn't had a price increase in the period in between now and 2009. So there isn't that much to give. Profitability for the more profitable companies have come through internal transformations and through significant investments in technology like for our -- in our case. So we have not gained any pricing, so we have very little pricing to give up. Now in a dramatic downturn as we have been experiencing over the past 7 quarters, there is a need to align with the customer base, which, obviously, has the immediate oil price exposure, and we have done that. And the vast majority of the pricing concessions we have made to existing and valid contracts are temporary in nature. They're either time-bound or they are linked to some kind of oil price trigger. And that's why we have aligned with our customers on the down of the cycle, and we now expect that, that will be returned to us as oil prices start to increase.

But we see a general, I would say, adaptation of all aspects of integration taking place all around the world. The least impact of integration so far, if I just look at the high level, has been in North America, where it's still rather fragmented in between the rig and the various parts of the drilling process as well as in the production and completion part of the work. So we are continuing to drive forward our offering around creating a total drilling system and a total completion system, including fracking, for the land markets, and I'm quite optimistic that these should have significant uptake even in places like U.S. land or some of the other unconventional basins around the world. But the general adaptation of more integration we are seeing, and we continue to invest into that, both from a hardware and software process control standpoint."

So in terms of timing of it, Ole, it's difficult to say that you're going to see some kind of major impact in one particular quarter. I think the level of integration-related activity has held up well, I would say, during this downturn. It is down in percentage terms, which you would expect, but it has held up well as well as our new technology sales has held up well also during the cycle. So I think we're very well positioned.

Look, the 15.8% that we are able to achieve in the quarter was exceptional. And as you know, it's one of the highest quarters we've ever had. The forward look is a little bit complicated because what's happening is we've got really strong execution in both drilling OneSubsea and process systems. And those are a longer -- or bigger backlog and longer-cycle businesses, and those are going to start to come down. And so -- and now you've got a lot of pricing pressure that we've seen in 2015 start to come into the mix, and so we think 15.8% is a very high level. That will start to taper down here in the quarters to come. And then where we really start to see some uplift, and it's just -- it's a matter of timing here, but as Paal described, right, we do believe we're going to get pricing in the shorter-cycle businesses, so both Surface and Valves & Measurement. And then in addition to that, you start to layer in the synergies from the integration itself. And so I don't expect us to exceed the 15.8% here in the short term. I think that comes down steadily over time, but then as we get pricing traction and those short-cycle businesses begin to pick up, we could, indeed, see those margins come back up into a higher territory. And then in terms of booking outlook, I'll start with deepwater, and what I'll say is it is in a very bad state in terms of progressing and moving projects forward. And we're very fortunate to work with Woodside and get one past FID, but we don't see any major projects here for the remainder of the year. And in fact, our estimates for trees this year are less than 100. There are a few projects out there next year that are relatively large in size. We feel good about our ability to work with operators and achieve those. But at the same time, the industry has got significant capacity, and those are going to be incredibly competitive. And so I feel -- I'm a little concerned about the outlook with deepwater. Now however, the counter to that is we have a very strong belief in what we're doing with OneSubsea. And like I described in the opening comments, right, the ability to tie the reservoir to what we're doing, drive cost out of the system through our standardized approach and then get more out of production, we feel very good about that. On the other businesses, Surface and V&M are tied to rig count, and they have a significant North American exposure. And as Paal described, we think those markets start to increase here going forward. And so that's going to be the big kind of flux position for us, if you will. If those start to come back faster, then our outlook starts to look pretty good."

We can actually recover 2014 earnings by only a 50% recovery in the revenue drop that we've seen since 2014. Now there is a lot of work behind the number in terms of how achievable it is. But as an example, in 2014, in the international market, on a pretty low revenue growth rate of 3%, 4%, we actually delivered 69% incrementals without any price in international market. So we have a precedent in this world [ph] for doing it. It's obviously going to be challenging to do that also in North America and in particular North America land.

And specifically, can we talk about Q3 in terms of what the sequential headwinds and tailwinds are and whether you think earnings per share, flat, up or down quarter-on-quarter?"

So in terms of the charge that we've taken, this is basically catching up and finalizing the resizing of the company, which has now been dropping in activity levels over the past 7 quarters. So this charge is linked to a number of things that we have been executing in the second quarter and should bring the company into the shape where we are well positioned to navigate the bottom of the market and also well positioned to start growing again going forward. So we put a lot of details and scrutiny into any kind of impairment charge that we take, and we have done so as well in the charge for Q2, which is sizable. But we believe this is prudent, this is right, and it's justified to do what we've done. And that's why we did it. Now in terms of the outlook, like I said, we are at the bottom but we are not expecting an immediate and sharp recovery. If you look at North America versus international, some of the moving parts going into Q3, North America still has significant overcapacity at this stage in terms of services. And the low barrier to entry is also going to continue to be a major headwind, right? So we expect modest increase in land activity, but this is going to be partially offset by lower offshore work. We are significantly down in Alaska, in Eastern Canada as well as in the Gulf of Mexico. We expect some improvement in pricing, but it's going to be way short of the level required to breakeven in Q3. So we don't expect any major positive earnings improvement from North America in Q3, but it shouldn't get much worse either, right? So fairly, fairly stable earnings from North America in the third quarter and fairly similar in the international market. There is less overcapacity there due to the higher barrier of entry, and it's also quite a narrowing competitive landscape. So in principle, it should be easier to recover some of the temporary pricing concessions that we have made and -- which, in most cases, in international market is also time-bound or linked to oil price. But given the limited increase in activity we see for Q3, again, we don't expect any significant positive sequential earnings contribution from international. So overall, we expect flattish EPS in Q3."

This is not a -- it is not a surprising playbook. At some stage, when you do approach bottom, this is the shift that you need to make. But we have, I would say, done this in a concerted fashion during the second quarter. We have had very good discussions with the senior management team and laid our plans for how we're going to now shift the focus on how we navigate the next phase. And as I said earlier on, the understanding of the viability and state of the industry value chain in each of the 80 countries we operate in is extremely important to make sure that you are optimally positioned to capture the market in the countries which we believe are going to see a sustainable increase in activity, where we can also generate sustainable earnings going forward, right? So we have spent a lot of time internally with the team to lay out these plans and put this methodology in place. So we are in good shape there. We are already in execution mode of it. And in terms of the engagement with the customers, it started. It's still at a fairly, I will say, low frequency, but that is now what people do, much more widespread as we enter the third quarter here. But obviously, a lot of these discussions are going to be challenging. There is not a lot of surplus in any situation, but we believe that the temporary concessions we have made, at least part of that, will need to be returned to us. But in return for that, we are very open to engage in different types of collaborations, where we, through better management of the interface and better commercial alignment, can together drive unnecessary costs out of the system so that we can make more of the industry value chain viable in many countries around the world. So that's certainly the objective."

So the position we have in terms of strength, both in footprint, scale, local knowledge as well as the overall contract portfolio we have allows us to be quite competitive in these tenders. And I think very importantly as well is to look at the difference between the contracts portfolio and maybe the immediate revenue translation of these contracts. In international markets, it's very important to have the contracts. And we have a range of contracts today that we have won with very little activity in them, but they have potential for significant increases in activity in terms of rig additions and so forth going forward. And so what is very important over the past year, which we have had a lot of focus on, has been the tender win rate and then having the contracts and then being able to translate that into revenue in the coming 1 to 2 years."

How is the industry in the next upcoming cycle going to be able to operate where the entire value chain ends up being cash flow and profit positive as we enter into a complete new cycle? That was not the case in the previous cycle, and I don't think we can go on for many cycles in a similar type of fashion. Now there is a part of North America land which is viable even at lower prices, but how big that is and how much you can step up from the core acreage, I think, is to be seen. Now how we operate in that, we are aiming to be very competitive on efficiency and, in addition to that, bring new technologies -- continue to bring new technology into play, which can help our customers drive up production per well. And we have a very good offering already in place for that. So we will continue to operate the way we have been with a focus in both these dimensions.

So before we close this morning, I would like to summarize the 4 most important points that we've discussed. 
First, we believe that we have reached the bottom of the cycle and that E&P investments now have to increase in order for the industry to meet the growing supply deficit. As E&P investment starts growing, a large part will initially have to be consumed on supplier industry price increases in order for capacity and capabilities to be available and for operating standards to be met. Second, most basins around the world are today at unprecedented low levels of activity, and we expect to see a broad-based increase in investments going forward, funded by higher oil prices. The magnitude and sustainability of the investment increase will, however, be a function of the financial viability of the entire oil industry value chain in each basin and country, which will vary significantly. 
Third, our deep local knowledge, the breadth and depth of our technology offering, together with our geographical scale, will clearly set us apart and further enable us to deliver differentiated financial results going forward. And fourth, the shortfall in profits and cash flow throughout the entire industry value chain can only be permanently addressed by a dramatic step change in industry performance, including intrinsic quality and efficiency, technology system innovations and more aligned and collaborative business models, and Schlumberger is and will remain at the absolute forefront of this industry transformation.

301966,378013058,1058517,"Schlumberger Limited, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2016",2016-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.25. This represents an increase of $0.02 sequentially and a decrease of $0.53 when compared",640,"Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.25. This represents an increase of $0.02 sequentially and a decrease of $0.53 when compared to the same quarter of last year. 
During the quarter, we recorded $237 million of pretax merger and integration charges associated with the acquisition of Cameron. This consisted of $149 million noncash inventory purchase accounting item that will not recur. The balance relates to transaction costs as well as the dedicated integration team and other costs to achieve synergies. We will continue to incur merger and integration charges for the rest of 2016 and into 2017. 
Our third quarter revenue of $7 billion decreased 2% sequentially. This decrease was entirely driven by reduced activity in the Cameron Group due to its declining backlog. Excluding the impact of Cameron Group, third quarter revenue actually increased 1% sequentially. 
Pretax operating margins increased 119 basis points sequentially to 11.6%. Margins increased sequentially in each group except for Cameron. These increases reflect the benefits from cost-reduction initiatives as well as the effects of last quarter's itemized asset write-downs, which contributed to approximately 50% of the reduction in depreciation. 
Operational highlights by product group were as follows. Third quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.7 billion increased 5% sequentially while margin increased 292 basis points to 19.1%. The revenue growth was primarily driven by increased Testing Services and WesternGeco activities.  Margins improved sequentially across all the Reservoir Characterization technologies but most noticeably in Wireline and Testing Services. 
Drilling Group revenue of $2 billion was essentially flat sequentially while margins increased by 241 basis points. The margin expansion was largely due to the benefit of cost initiatives and the reduced losses in Venezuela due to further alignment of our resources in the GeoMarket to match the reduced level of activity. 
Production Group revenue of $2.1 billion was also essentially flat sequentially while margin improved 41 basis points, largely due to strong SPM activity. 
Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 12% sequentially. Despite the 12% reduction in revenue, pretax operating margin only declined 34 basis points to 16%. The revenue decline was driven by the decreasing backlog that has significantly impacted the Drilling Group line. However, strong project execution in OneSubsea, combined with cost-control initiatives across the group, limited the margin decline. 
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 16% in the third quarter, essentially the same as Q2. Going forward, our tax rate will be driven by the overall geographic mix of earnings. 
During the third quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of cash flow from operations. During the first 3 quarters of 2016, we have generated $4.2 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $117 million during the third quarter and paying $800 million of severance and one-off Cameron-related transaction payments during the first 9 months of the year. Our net debt increased $122 million during the quarter to $10.2 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $11.1 billion. 
During the quarter, we spent $156 million to repurchase 2 million shares at an average price of $77. On a year-to-date basis, we have spent $662 million to repurchase 9.5 million shares at an average price of $69.64 per share. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included approximately $400 million on CapEx, $140 million on SPM investments, $160 million of multiclient and $700 million of dividend payments. 
Our CapEx on a year-to-date basis was $1.4 billion, which includes 2 quarters of Cameron. CapEx for the full year of 2016 is now expected to be approximately $2 billion. These amounts do not include SPM or multiclient. 
And now I will turn the conference call over to Scott."

I am pleased to provide an update on the progress of the Cameron Group now that we are 6 months into the combination with Schlumberger. Cameron continue to have good operating results in the third quarter despite the challenges in the glo",849,"Hello, everyone. I am pleased to provide an update on the progress of the Cameron Group now that we are 6 months into the combination with Schlumberger. Cameron continue to have good operating results in the third quarter despite the challenges in the global marketplace and the contraction of our backlog, driven by this prolonged downturn. 
In Q3, our revenue reduced by 12% sequentially to $1.3 billion. Despite this drop, we were able to successfully hold operating margins at 16%, which is 19% decrementals off a nearly all-time high-margin performance in the second quarter of this year. The higher margins are a result of relentless cost reductions combined with excellent project execution in our longer-cycle businesses. We have now experienced 7 straight quarters of reduced activity and pricing pressure in the marketplace. 
And Cameron shorter-cycle Surface and Valves & Measurement businesses have experienced the full effect of the reduced activity, spending cuts and pricing pressure but are now positioned to rebound with any incremental activity. Despite the duration of the downturn, these 2 businesses continue to be profitable and have strong cash flow as we have managed our cost structure and working capital well throughout the cycle. Typical lead times in these businesses range from 3 weeks to 9 months, and we expect to see revenue flatten in future quarters and begin to grow again in mid-2017 as onshore activity picks up around the world. 
In our longer-cycle businesses, OneSubsea and drilling systems, we have been extremely successful in expanding margins throughout the cycle. OneSubsea and drilling remained accretive to the overall margins of the Cameron Group. In fact, OneSubsea had record profitability at 23.5% this quarter. The profitability improvements and the market share gains over the last 2 years validate the vision we had when we created OneSubsea. 
The drilling and OneSubsea teams have done an excellent job improving our project delivery processes, driving cost out of projects and products and capitalizing on our installed base by expanding our service and aftermarket offering. Going forward, these improvements will be partly offset by extremely competitive pricing and lower volumes. 
These 2 businesses are now entering a period of revenue decline as our backlog has fallen for 7 straight quarters. We are now entering the phase of the downturn that the other Schlumberger businesses have experienced over the past 18 months. 
On a brighter note, our book-to-bill ratio for these 2 businesses was 0.8 in the third quarter, which was the highest ratio we have seen since the downturn began. This gives us visibility to revenue growth in 2018. 
The drilling systems business will contract the most as new equipment orders for floating and jack-up rigs are nearly nonexistent. And our focus has now shifted to land rigs and capitalizing on our market-leading installed base of pressure-control equipment. 
Before I transition to the integration, I want to spend a minute on how we are positioning OneSubsea. We now have 8 paid FEED studies, and we are working on 30 customer engagements on our OneSubsea and Subsea 7 alliance. I fully expect to win a small tieback award that utilizes OneSubsea's equipment and Subsea 7's installation capability before the year is over. We see the tieback market as an area of growth in the deepwater sector. Operators are looking to spend significantly less and drive higher returns by capitalizing on existing host facilities. 
OneSubsea is uniquely positioned with our standardized subsea tree, our single-well boosting system, our unified control system and our partnership with Subsea 7 to capitalize on this growth opportunity. We also have the capability to integrate this further with the deepwater drilling and production teams of Schlumberger to provide further turnkey solutions to operators who are looking to tie back these assets. 
The success of the integration of Cameron into Schlumberger continues to exceed our expectations. I would like to confirm that the transaction is again accretive in the third quarter as well as confirm that we will achieve the $300 million synergy target in the first year of the combination. In the third quarter, we booked $139 million of synergy-related work, which landed in every business segment in the Cameron Group. 
One notable award in the quarter was an integration project for Chevron in Thailand that consisted of surface wellheads and trees, wireline logging services, M-I SWACO drilling fluids and services as well as the supply of barite. This is a great example of subsurface and surface integration across 3 different Schlumberger groups. 
While there is still more cost savings to be had, our integration will focus -- will shift focus to driving revenue synergies and capitalizing on the vast geographic network of Schlumberger. We see significant growth opportunities for Cameron in the Middle East, Russia, Latin America and India, where Cameron can leverage the substantial presence and relationships that Schlumberger has in these geographies. In summary, I could not be more pleased with how our group is performing in the down cycle and how we are capitalizing on the opportunities that the combination of Schlumberger and Cameron has created. 
I'll now turn it over to Paal."
301966,378013058,1058517,"Schlumberger Limited, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2016",2016-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. After 7 quarters of unprecedented activity decline, the business environment stabilized as expected in the third quarter, confirming that we have, indeed, reached the bottom of this cycle. Our third quarter",2757,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. After 7 quarters of unprecedented activity decline, the business environment stabilized as expected in the third quarter, confirming that we have, indeed, reached the bottom of this cycle. 
Our third quarter revenues still decreased 2% sequentially, but this was largely driven by the anticipated reduction in activity at Cameron as the product backlog continued to decline. Excluding Cameron, revenue increased 1% sequentially driven by higher activity in North America land, Middle East, Russia and Australia. 
Since the start of this downturn and as it deepened into uncharted territory, our entire management team has worked relentlessly to protect the financial strength of the company. This includes carefully navigating the commercial landscape by balancing pricing concessions and market share and also by proactively removing a staggering $6 billion of quarterly costs through headcount reductions, internal efficiency improvements and strong supply chain management. This has enabled us to deliver unmatched financial results by maintaining pretax operating margins well above 10% and delivering sufficient free cash flow to cover a range of strategic CapEx investments as well as our ongoing dividend commitments. 
We continue to carry forward this strong financial focus as seen in our third quarter results, where we delivered 19% decremental margins in the Cameron Group and incremental margins north of 65% for the other 3 groups combined, excluding any tailwind from previous impairment charges. These results, which represent a small step on our path towards, first, restoring and, subsequently, exceeding our pre-downturn earnings per share and financial returns, are mostly driven by internal cost and efficiency improvements with so far only a minor impact from pricing increases and high-grading of our contracts portfolio. 
Going forward, it is critical for us to recover the large pricing concessions we have made over the past 2 years to allow us to restore investment levels in technology innovation, system integration and operational quality and efficiency, which are all key enablers of our customers' project performance. 
As indicated in July, we have, during this quarter, started pricing recovery discussions with a large part of our global customer base. While there is a general understanding from our customers that pricing will have to increase, there were no material movements during quarter. But with the recent increase in oil prices, the basis for these discussions has now strengthened. 
Looking forward to the activity recovery phase, we will only allocate investments, operating capacity and expertise to contracts in basins that meet our financial return expectations in the same way our customers allocate capital to projects in their portfolios. Currently, a noticeable part of our contracts do not meet these financial return criteria, and this is our starting point for reestablishing sustainable customer relationships that will warrant allocation of our capital, capacity and expertise. 
In addition to our focus on pricing recovery, we will, in the coming quarters, also aim to restore proper payment schedules from our customers, in line with the terms and conditions in our contracts, to address the payment delays we today are seeing from many customers around the world. Still, in spite of these payment delays, free cash flow generation in the third quarter remained solid at $700 million as inventory and CapEx investments was again tightly managed. 
Next, I will review the third quarter trends from our geographical operations, and I will focus my comments on the characterization, drilling and production groups as Scott has already covered the performance of the Cameron Group. In North America, revenue for the characterization, Drilling and Production Groups increased 3% sequentially as solid growth on land was largely offset by a further revenue reduction in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and Eastern Canada, impacting all product groups. The strong growth on land was driven by the U.S., where the Q3 rig count increased significantly and with more than half of the rigs being added in the Permian Basin. 
The increased drilling activity is reflected in our Drilling & Measurements product line, which posted 31% revenue growth in U.S. land compared to the second quarter. At this stage, we are seeing a growing trend in U.S. land towards even longer horizontal laterals or super laterals, aiming at further increasing reservoir contact. One example of this is a well we drilled for Eclipse Resources with a record lateral length of 18,500 feet using our industry-leading PowerDrive Orbit rotary steerable system. 
This emerging trend has already created a significant increase in the offtake of our high-end drilling technologies and has also provided our Drilling Group with a clear path towards profitability on land. We have, therefore, shifted focus from maintaining presence to now gaining market share for our drilling business in North America land. 
In the hydraulic fracturing market, the stage count increased by 17% sequentially, driven by higher drilling activity and also by customers now actively depleting their DUC well inventory. Still, the fracturing market continues to be completely commoditized than significantly oversupplied with a large number of very hungry players. In addition, these significant increase in sand volume pumped per stage is already starting to create inflation on both product and distribution costs, which will further obstruct and delay the hydraulic fracturing industry's path towards restoring profitability. 
Today, the North America fracturing business continues to be highly dilutive to our financial performance, and this, combined with a short-term market outlook, means that we have not yet shifted focus towards gaining market share. Instead, we continue to maintain our market presence while further concentrating activity around our core operating areas. Still, we continue to monitor the fracturing market closely, and we are ready to deploy our significant stacked capacity on short notice but only when the market environment can support positive contributions to our earnings.
So the main takeaway for us from North America land is the emerging technology trend linked to drilling longer and more complex horizontal sections or so-called super laterals. This trend is already creating significantly higher demand for our unique drilling technologies, and we are, at this stage, sold out of PowerDrive Orbit and in the process of adding further capacity from overseas and from manufacturing. This drilling technology trend will also add to the opportunity set for our rig of the future, where we plan to have 2 first-generation rigs in operation in U.S. land in the fourth quarter. 
In the international markets, our revenue excluding Cameron was down 1% sequentially as increasing activity in key countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Russia and Australia was offset by continued weakness in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Far East and Latin America. As we now prepare for the recovery also in the international markets, several trends have emerged over the past 2 years, adding further complexity to these already technically challenging markets. 
First, in pursuit of improving project performance, many customers are now more actively pursuing the technical limit of the equipment and workflows we deploy in our operations. This poses additional challenges with respect to the expertise and technology we use in both the planning and execution phase of our work and further elevates the importance of our global support network, including engineering, maintenance and distribution. While we are well prepared for these additional technical demands, this trend is clearly redefining and elevating customer expectations, and we see this as an excellent opportunity to further extend our market leadership position in the international market. 
The second trend emerging in our international customer base is the growing interest in more commercially aligned business models from time-based performance contracts for individual wells all the way to production incentive contracts based on a fee per barrel. As an example, we are today engaged in various stages of SPM discussions in 20 countries around the world, spanning all customer groups and all 4 operating areas, which clearly demonstrates the momentum this contract model now has within our overall offering. While this trend is very encouraging, I would like to stress that these new contract models are only an addition to our offering and that we will continue to actively pursue traditional models for customers who prefers this type of engagement. 
As we now look to further capitalize on these emerging trends in the international market, we have 2 major advantages: first, our unmatched scale in terms of people, equipment and infrastructure, which allow us to quickly adjust to the increasing technical complexity and additional demands from our customers while ensuring safe and consistent quality in our operations; and second, by having been present in all parts of the world for the past 80 to 90 years, we have established deep industry relationships and unprecedented local credibility, which makes us a natural partner to explore new contract models and translate these into successful business relationships. 
With that, let's take a closer look at the trends we are seeing in the 3 international operating areas. In Latin America, the combined revenue for the characterization, Drilling and Production Groups declined by 5% sequentially due to continued reductions in E&P spend and activity throughout the region. However, the 2-year activity side was clearly slowing during the quarter, and we believe we have now reached the bottom of the cycle also in Latin America. 
The sequential revenue drop came entirely from the Drilling and Production Groups while the characterization group posted a 2% increase, driven by solid multiclient seismic sales in Mexico. Here, WesternGeco has shot 80,000 square kilometers of marine surveys in the prime deepwater acreage that will be included in the upcoming bid rounds, with the first taking place December 5 of this year. 
In Mexico, drilling activity is also expected to pick up in early parts of 2017, driven by both PEMEX and the successful players from the shallow water big rounds that has already taken place. In Ecuador, activity remained solid, driven by our SPM projects, and we continue to progress in line with our FEED development plans, both with respect to work scope and production levels. Elsewhere in the region, activity remains subdued due to severe budget constraints for most customers. 
However, we are seeing early signs of recovery in several countries. In Argentina, there is clear optimism amongst the industry players that the new government will take the required steps to further encourage E&P investments in the country as they seek to reduce their oil-import dependency, which should have a positive impact on E&P investments in 2017. In Brazil, Petrobras continues to focus on arresting the decline in the mature Campos basin and is considering opening up for new and more commercially aligned business models with the service industry, which could include fee-per-barrel contract. 
In Venezuela, our operations remain largely shut down outside the work we do for the IOC JVs in the Faja. However, we are in discussions with PDVSA on a new contract model, which will include a payment assurance mechanism, and we are optimistic that this contract will be finalized in the coming months and that operations could start in Q1. And in Colombia, with oil prices around $50, activity is expected to increase in the coming quarters as Ecopetrol and several other players are preparing for offshore drilling campaigns in 2017. 
Revenue in Europe, CIS and Africa declined 3% sequentially, excluding the Cameron Group, while strong sequential growth in Russia and flat activity in the North Sea and North Africa was more than offset by a further reduction in activity throughout Sub-Sahara Africa. The drop in revenue was driven by the Drilling and Production Groups while the characterization group posted solid sequential growth. A large part of the growth in the characterization group came from Russia as summer season activity peaked, both on land and offshore and with revenue growth further supported by a stronger ruble. Looking forward to Q4, we expect to see the normal seasonal slowdown in Russia due to winter weather while the outlook for 2017 activity continues to be strong. 
The North Sea posted flat sequential revenue following a solid summer season, where activity in Norway was particularly strong. Looking forward to Q4, we expect to see the normal decline in activity as summer projects conclude and winter weather sets in. Still, exploration success in Norway and several large project start-ups indicate stronger 2017 activity in the North Sea. 
Revenue in continental Europe was up 19% sequentially on strong integrated project performance and deepwater exploration activity in Bulgaria. Higher oil prices will lead to increased production-related activity in this region with a 5% rig count increase expected in Q4, further supported by the restart of offshore activity in the Eastern Med in the early parts of 2017. 
North Africa activity remains stable with flat revenue sequentially while we expect moderate growth in activity in Q4, partly supported by increased market share from recent tender wins for summer [ph] fracs. The market challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa continued in Q3, with yet another significant drop in activity and with the rig count now down by 75% compared to Q4 2014. However, with this latest drop, we do believe we have reached the bottom of the cycle also in this region and expect modest activity increases in most countries in Q4 with the exception of Angola. 
In the Middle East & Asia, characterization, Drilling and Production Group revenue grew 2% sequentially as strength in the Middle East and Australia was partly offset by continued weakness in Asia. Both the characterization and Drilling Groups posted growth in the third quarter while Production Group revenue was slightly down due to a temporary reduction in fracturing activity in the Middle East. 
In the GCC, the underlying drilling and rigless activity remained strong with solid revenues reported in all countries. In addition to this, we continue to progress on our early production facility project in Kuwait, which represents another exciting growth opportunity for us. In Australia, revenue increased in the third quarter after 7 quarters of decline, driven by additional land activity for the Drilling Group as well as higher offshore exploration activity for the characterization group while in China, Indonesia and the rest of Southeast Asia, the revenue decline continued in the third quarter and, at present, there are no signs of any imminent activity recovery in this region. 
Turning now to the oil macro. The supply and demand of crude is now more or less in balance as seen by the flattening global petroleum inventories and the start of consistent growth towards the end of the quarter, in particular in North America. In addition, oil demand was again revised upwards in September and is now forecasted to be around 1.2 million barrels per day for both 2016 and 2017. 
At the same time, global supply is plateauing as non-OPEC production continues to experience significant declines and even offsetting record production levels from OPEC in September. Based on current investment levels, we believe that 2017 non-OPEC production will at best be flat as any production upside from the U.S., Canada and Brazil will be offset by further declines in the rest of the global production base. 
Given the projected demand growth, this means that the call on OPEC will increase from the current record production levels, suggesting that the production upside from Nigeria, Libya and Iran may be needed to keep the markets in balance. All of this means that the period of oversupply and inventory build is over and that market sentiments should soon change, paving the way for an increase in oil prices and, subsequently, E&P investments. There is also a case to be made for a more rapid growth on the global oil inventories and a more bullish outlook for the oil price in the event of a lower production upside from Libya, Nigeria and Iran, OPEC and Russia implementation of production cuts or a steeper decline in non-OPEC production. 
In terms of 2017 E&P investments, details are still limited. However, we maintain that a V-shaped recovery is unlikely, given the fragile financial state of the industry. Still, we do see upside in 2017 in North America land, the Middle East and Russia, and we are making sure we are optimally placed to capture a large share of this upside and, importantly, turn this additional activity into positive earnings contributions. 
With the unparalleled cost and cash discipline we have established, we are confident in our ability to deliver incremental margins north of 65% and a free cash flow conversion rate above 75%, which, going forward, will give us significant flexibility to both reinvest in our business as well as steadily return cash to our shareholders. 
Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions."

We indicated in July that we are firmly putting this on the agenda, and we have done so in the third quarter. We've had engagement and discussions with most customers around the world. I think there is a general acceptance from the customer base that ultimately, prices are going to have to come up. Not a lot of movement as we expected in the third quarter, but I would say given the increase we've seen in oil price over the past month or so and the potential trajectory we could see going forward, I think there is a much a stronger basis for having these discussions at this stage. And then we will have discussions individually with our customers depending on the contract, the model and the contract situation we have with them. It could be at some stage that some of these contracts will be rebid. And if that's so, then we will obviously participate in that. But I think, in many cases, there is room to negotiate within the existing contract framework to come into a, I would say, mutually agreeable solution, which will be acceptable both for us and for our customers."

I said on the fracturing side, still there's no clear path towards profitability, and this is why we're still maintaining presence and basically holding the fort until we believe we can justify putting more capacity into play going forward."

But we also see, I would say, an uptick in investment in activity in Latin America and in Europe, Africa. The only place where we don't see any sense of recovery at this stage is in Asia, but I will say the uptake in Latin America and Europe, Africa is more going to be from current, current Q3 activity levels. It might not be a significant increase on a full year basis, but I think we have reached bottom in both of those regions, which would warrant higher activities. So I'm not contradicting what the IOCs are saying, and we welcome obviously more activity and higher investments from them. It's just that the main kind of the very clear investment increases we are seeing are still going to be in Russia and the Middle East.

So actually, OneSubsea is higher than that, and we're just below 1 on the OneSubsea side. But on the 2018 kind of general guidance for revenue and growth for the Cameron Group, it really depends on those short-cycle businesses and when activity returns, and so there is a path for growth in '18, but it depends on that land business in V&M and in the Surface segment. We're highly focused on growing in the Middle East. We're highly focused on growing in Midcontinent in the United States. And if we can see continued rig count increase, then we do have a path for growth. Know obviously, the drilling business with backlog number there will continue to decline. And OneSubsea, quite frankly, has been relatively flat since the beginning of the deepwater downturn, which started in 2014, and so we won't lose a lot of revenue traction on OneSubsea. It'll really come from drilling and then the offset is the shorter-cycle business growth on land markets."

These are fairly predictable plans that we have in place. We also expect to see modest growth from the current levels, not necessarily on a full year basis but from current levels in Europe, Africa and Latin America, and the reason for this is that there are many significant oil-producing countries in these 2 regions, which have record low investment levels at this stage, and we see signs that at least we are going to come off the bottom here, whether that's going to translate into year-over-year growth is too early to say but at least, an increase from where we are today.

But as these big rounds for acreage now has progressed and with the deepwater run coming up, the first deepwater run coming up now in December, we see drilling activity picking up in 2017. Again it might not be a dramatic comeback, and we won't be back to I would say 2013 levels or 2014 levels anytime soon, but I think there is a momentum shift coming in Mexico. It's partly linked to the seismic work that we're doing and the related exploration activity with that, but I think also activity linked to the previous rounds that we've seen both in shallow water and on land as well as the basic PEMEX activity should pick up in 2017."

At the same time, as our customers can also meet theirs. So I think these are the discussions that now are taking place.

But our focus really now has shifted to the tieback market, and we do see a lot of opportunities on that. I mentioned our 8 paid FEED studies with Subsea 7, where we're doing a lot of work on the tieback side and what we think there is that with a standardized subsea tree, which is significantly reduced cost, a single well boosting system, which we're the only ones right now that have that single well boosting system, and then combine that with our unified control system and the installation from Subsea 7, we think we've got very economical package to tieback 1 and 2 wells into existing host facilities.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.25. This represents an increase of $0.02 sequentially and a decrease of $0.53 when compared",640,"Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.25. This represents an increase of $0.02 sequentially and a decrease of $0.53 when compared to the same quarter of last year. 
During the quarter, we recorded $237 million of pretax merger and integration charges associated with the acquisition of Cameron. This consisted of $149 million noncash inventory purchase accounting item that will not recur. The balance relates to transaction costs as well as the dedicated integration team and other costs to achieve synergies. We will continue to incur merger and integration charges for the rest of 2016 and into 2017. 
Our third quarter revenue of $7 billion decreased 2% sequentially. This decrease was entirely driven by reduced activity in the Cameron Group due to its declining backlog. Excluding the impact of Cameron Group, third quarter revenue actually increased 1% sequentially. 
Pretax operating margins increased 119 basis points sequentially to 11.6%. Margins increased sequentially in each group except for Cameron. These increases reflect the benefits from cost-reduction initiatives as well as the effects of last quarter's itemized asset write-downs, which contributed to approximately 50% of the reduction in depreciation. 
Operational highlights by product group were as follows. Third quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.7 billion increased 5% sequentially while margin increased 292 basis points to 19.1%. The revenue growth was primarily driven by increased Testing Services and WesternGeco activities.  Margins improved sequentially across all the Reservoir Characterization technologies but most noticeably in Wireline and Testing Services. 
Drilling Group revenue of $2 billion was essentially flat sequentially while margins increased by 241 basis points. The margin expansion was largely due to the benefit of cost initiatives and the reduced losses in Venezuela due to further alignment of our resources in the GeoMarket to match the reduced level of activity. 
Production Group revenue of $2.1 billion was also essentially flat sequentially while margin improved 41 basis points, largely due to strong SPM activity. 
Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 12% sequentially. Despite the 12% reduction in revenue, pretax operating margin only declined 34 basis points to 16%. The revenue decline was driven by the decreasing backlog that has significantly impacted the Drilling Group line. However, strong project execution in OneSubsea, combined with cost-control initiatives across the group, limited the margin decline. 
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 16% in the third quarter, essentially the same as Q2. Going forward, our tax rate will be driven by the overall geographic mix of earnings. 
During the third quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of cash flow from operations. During the first 3 quarters of 2016, we have generated $4.2 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $117 million during the third quarter and paying $800 million of severance and one-off Cameron-related transaction payments during the first 9 months of the year. Our net debt increased $122 million during the quarter to $10.2 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $11.1 billion. 
During the quarter, we spent $156 million to repurchase 2 million shares at an average price of $77. On a year-to-date basis, we have spent $662 million to repurchase 9.5 million shares at an average price of $69.64 per share. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included approximately $400 million on CapEx, $140 million on SPM investments, $160 million of multiclient and $700 million of dividend payments. 
Our CapEx on a year-to-date basis was $1.4 billion, which includes 2 quarters of Cameron. CapEx for the full year of 2016 is now expected to be approximately $2 billion. These amounts do not include SPM or multiclient. 
And now I will turn the conference call over to Scott."

I am pleased to provide an update on the progress of the Cameron Group now that we are 6 months into the combination with Schlumberger.

I am pleased to provide an update on the progress of the Cameron Group now that we are 6 months into the combination with Schlumberger. Cameron continue to have good operating results in the third quarter despite the challenges in the global marketplace and the contraction of our backlog, driven by this prolonged downturn. 
In Q3, our revenue reduced by 12% sequentially to $1.3 billion. Despite this drop, we were able to successfully hold operating margins at 16%, which is 19% decrementals off a nearly all-time high-margin performance in the second quarter of this year. The higher margins are a result of relentless cost reductions combined with excellent project execution in our longer-cycle businesses. We have now experienced 7 straight quarters of reduced activity and pricing pressure in the marketplace. 
And Cameron shorter-cycle Surface and Valves & Measurement businesses have experienced the full effect of the reduced activity, spending cuts and pricing pressure but are now positioned to rebound with any incremental activity. Despite the duration of the downturn, these 2 businesses continue to be profitable and have strong cash flow as we have managed our cost structure and working capital well throughout the cycle. Typical lead times in these businesses range from 3 weeks to 9 months, and we expect to see revenue flatten in future quarters and begin to grow again in mid-2017 as onshore activity picks up around the world. 
In our longer-cycle businesses, OneSubsea and drilling systems, we have been extremely successful in expanding margins throughout the cycle. OneSubsea and drilling remained accretive to the overall margins of the Cameron Group. In fact, OneSubsea had record profitability at 23.5% this quarter. The profitability improvements and the market share gains over the last 2 years validate the vision we had when we created OneSubsea. 
The drilling and OneSubsea teams have done an excellent job improving our project delivery processes, driving cost out of projects and products and capitalizing on our installed base by expanding our service and aftermarket offering. Going forward, these improvements will be partly offset by extremely competitive pricing and lower volumes. 
These 2 businesses are now entering a period of revenue decline as our backlog has fallen for 7 straight quarters. We are now entering the phase of the downturn that the other Schlumberger businesses have experienced over the past 18 months. 
On a brighter note, our book-to-bill ratio for these 2 businesses was 0.8 in the third quarter, which was the highest ratio we have seen since the downturn began. This gives us visibility to revenue growth in 2018. 
The drilling systems business will contract the most as new equipment orders for floating and jack-up rigs are nearly nonexistent. And our focus has now shifted to land rigs and capitalizing on our market-leading installed base of pressure-control equipment. 
Before I transition to the integration, I want to spend a minute on how we are positioning OneSubsea. We now have 8 paid FEED studies, and we are working on 30 customer engagements on our OneSubsea and Subsea 7 alliance. I fully expect to win a small tieback award that utilizes OneSubsea's equipment and Subsea 7's installation capability before the year is over. We see the tieback market as an area of growth in the deepwater sector. Operators are looking to spend significantly less and drive higher returns by capitalizing on existing host facilities. 
OneSubsea is uniquely positioned with our standardized subsea tree, our single-well boosting system, our unified control system and our partnership with Subsea 7 to capitalize on this growth opportunity. We also have the capability to integrate this further with the deepwater drilling and production teams of Schlumberger to provide further turnkey solutions to operators who are looking to tie back these assets. 
The success of the integration of Cameron into Schlumberger continues to exceed our expectations. I would like to confirm that the transaction is again accretive in the third quarter as well as confirm that we will achieve the $300 million synergy target in the first year of the combination. In the third quarter, we booked $139 million of synergy-related work, which landed in every business segment in the Cameron Group. 
One notable award in the quarter was an integration project for Chevron in Thailand that consisted of surface wellheads and trees, wireline logging services, M-I SWACO drilling fluids and services as well as the supply of barite. This is a great example of subsurface and surface integration across 3 different Schlumberger groups. 
While there is still more cost savings to be had, our integration will focus -- will shift focus to driving revenue synergies and capitalizing on the vast geographic network of Schlumberger. We see significant growth opportunities for Cameron in the Middle East, Russia, Latin America and India, where Cameron can leverage the substantial presence and relationships that Schlumberger has in these geographies. In summary, I could not be more pleased with how our group is performing in the down cycle and how we are capitalizing on the opportunities that the combination of Schlumberger and Cameron has created. 
I'll now turn it over to Paal."
301966,378013058,1058616,"Schlumberger Limited, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2016",2016-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. After 7 quarters of unprecedented activity decline, the business environment stabilized as expected in the third quarter, confirming that we have, indeed, reached the bottom of this cycle. Our third quarter",2755,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. After 7 quarters of unprecedented activity decline, the business environment stabilized as expected in the third quarter, confirming that we have, indeed, reached the bottom of this cycle. 
Our third quarter revenues still decreased 2% sequentially, but this was largely driven by the anticipated reduction in activity at Cameron as the product backlog continued to decline. Excluding Cameron, revenue increased 1% sequentially driven by higher activity in North America land, Middle East, Russia and Australia. 
Since the start of this downturn and as it deepened into uncharted territory, our entire management team has worked relentlessly to protect the financial strength of the company. This includes carefully navigating the commercial landscape by balancing pricing concessions and market share and also by proactively removing a staggering $6 billion of quarterly costs through headcount reductions, internal efficiency improvements and strong supply chain management. This has enabled us to deliver unmatched financial results by maintaining pretax operating margins well above 10% and delivering sufficient free cash flow to cover a range of strategic CapEx investments as well as our ongoing dividend commitments. 
We continue to carry forward this strong financial focus as seen in our third quarter results, where we delivered 19% decremental margins in the Cameron Group and incremental margins north of 65% for the other 3 groups combined, excluding any tailwind from previous impairment charges. These results, which represent a small step on our path towards, first, restoring and, subsequently, exceeding our pre-downturn earnings per share and financial returns, are mostly driven by internal cost and efficiency improvements with so far only a minor impact from pricing increases and high-grading of our contracts portfolio. 
Going forward, it is critical for us to recover the large pricing concessions we have made over the past 2 years to allow us to restore investment levels in technology innovation, system integration and operational quality and efficiency, which are all key enablers of our customers' project performance. 
As indicated in July, we have, during this quarter, started pricing recovery discussions with a large part of our global customer base. While there is a general understanding from our customers that pricing will have to increase, there were no material movements during quarter. But with the recent increase in oil prices, the basis for these discussions has now strengthened. 
Looking forward to the activity recovery phase, we will only allocate investments, operating capacity and expertise to contracts in basins that meet our financial return expectations in the same way our customers allocate capital to projects in their portfolios. Currently, a noticeable part of our contracts do not meet these financial return criteria, and this is our starting point for reestablishing sustainable customer relationships that will warrant allocation of our capital, capacity and expertise. 
In addition to our focus on pricing recovery, we will, in the coming quarters, also aim to restore proper payment schedules from our customers, in line with the terms and conditions in our contracts, to address the payment delays we today are seeing from many customers around the world. Still, in spite of these payment delays, free cash flow generation in the third quarter remained solid at $700 million as inventory and CapEx investments was again tightly managed. 
Next, I will review the third quarter trends from our geographical operations, and I will focus my comments on the characterization, drilling and production groups as Scott has already covered the performance of the Cameron Group. In North America, revenue for the characterization, Drilling and Production Groups increased 3% sequentially as solid growth on land was largely offset by a further revenue reduction in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and Eastern Canada, impacting all product groups. The strong growth on land was driven by the U.S., where the Q3 rig count increased significantly and with more than half of the rigs being added in the Permian Basin. 
The increased drilling activity is reflected in our Drilling & Measurements product line, which posted 31% revenue growth in U.S. land compared to the second quarter. At this stage, we are seeing a growing trend in U.S. land towards even longer horizontal laterals or super laterals, aiming at further increasing reservoir contact. One example of this is a well we drilled for Eclipse Resources with a record lateral length of 18,500 feet using our industry-leading PowerDrive Orbit rotary steerable system. 
This emerging trend has already created a significant increase in the offtake of our high-end drilling technologies and has also provided our Drilling Group with a clear path towards profitability on land. We have, therefore, shifted focus from maintaining presence to now gaining market share for our drilling business in North America land. 
In the hydraulic fracturing market, the stage count increased by 17% sequentially, driven by higher drilling activity and also by customers now actively depleting their DUC well inventory. Still, the fracturing market continues to be completely commoditized than significantly oversupplied with a large number of very hungry players. In addition, these significant increase in sand volume pumped per stage is already starting to create inflation on both product and distribution costs, which will further obstruct and delay the hydraulic fracturing industry's path towards restoring profitability. 
Today, the North America fracturing business continues to be highly dilutive to our financial performance, and this, combined with a short-term market outlook, means that we have not yet shifted focus towards gaining market share. Instead, we continue to maintain our market presence while further concentrating activity around our core operating areas. Still, we continue to monitor the fracturing market closely, and we are ready to deploy our significant stacked capacity on short notice but only when the market environment can support positive contributions to our earnings.
So the main takeaway for us from North America land is the emerging technology trend linked to drilling longer and more complex horizontal sections or so-called super laterals. This trend is already creating significantly higher demand for our unique drilling technologies, and we are, at this stage, sold out of PowerDrive Orbit and in the process of adding further capacity from overseas and from manufacturing. This drilling technology trend will also add to the opportunity set for our rig of the future, where we plan to have 2 first-generation rigs in operation in U.S. land in the fourth quarter. 
In the international markets, our revenue excluding Cameron was down 1% sequentially as increasing activity in key countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Russia and Australia was offset by continued weakness in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Far East and Latin America. As we now prepare for the recovery also in the international markets, several trends have emerged over the past 2 years, adding further complexity to these already technically challenging markets. 
First, in pursuit of improving project performance, many customers are now more actively pursuing the technical limit of the equipment and workflows we deploy in our operations. This poses additional challenges with respect to the expertise and technology we use in both the planning and execution phase of our work and further elevates the importance of our global support network, including engineering, maintenance and distribution. While we are well prepared for these additional technical demands, this trend is clearly redefining and elevating customer expectations, and we see this as an excellent opportunity to further extend our market leadership position in the international market. 
The second trend emerging in our international customer base is the growing interest in more commercially aligned business models from time-based performance contracts for individual wells all the way to production incentive contracts based on a fee per barrel. As an example, we are today engaged in various stages of SPM discussions in 20 countries around the world, spanning all customer groups and all 4 operating areas, which clearly demonstrates the momentum this contract model now has within our overall offering. While this trend is very encouraging, I would like to stress that these new contract models are only an addition to our offering and that we will continue to actively pursue traditional models for customers who prefers this type of engagement. 
As we now look to further capitalize on these emerging trends in the international market, we have 2 major advantages: first, our unmatched scale in terms of people, equipment and infrastructure, which allow us to quickly adjust to the increasing technical complexity and additional demands from our customers while ensuring safe and consistent quality in our operations; and second, by having been present in all parts of the world for the past 80 to 90 years, we have established deep industry relationships and unprecedented local credibility, which makes us a natural partner to explore new contract models and translate these into successful business relationships. 
With that, let's take a closer look at the trends we are seeing in the 3 international operating areas. In Latin America, the combined revenue for the characterization, Drilling and Production Groups declined by 5% sequentially due to continued reductions in E&P spend and activity throughout the region. However, the 2-year activity side was clearly slowing during the quarter, and we believe we have now reached the bottom of the cycle also in Latin America. 
The sequential revenue drop came entirely from the Drilling and Production Groups while the characterization group posted a 2% increase, driven by solid multiclient seismic sales in Mexico. Here, WesternGeco has shot 80,000 square kilometers of marine surveys in the prime deepwater acreage that will be included in the upcoming bid rounds, with the first taking place December 5 of this year. 
In Mexico, drilling activity is also expected to pick up in early parts of 2017, driven by both PEMEX and the successful players from the shallow water bid rounds that has already taken place. In Ecuador, activity remained solid, driven by our SPM projects, and we continue to progress in line with our FEED development plans, both with respect to work scope and production levels. Elsewhere in the region, activity remains subdued due to severe budget constraints for most customers. 
However, we are seeing early signs of recovery in several countries. In Argentina, there is clear optimism amongst the industry players that the new government will take the required steps to further encourage E&P investments in the country as they seek to reduce their oil-import dependency, which should have a positive impact on E&P investments in 2017. In Brazil, Petrobras continues to focus on arresting the decline in the mature Campos basin and is considering opening up for new and more commercially aligned business models with the service industry, which could include fee-per-barrel contract. 
In Venezuela, our operations remain largely shut down outside the work we do for the IOC JVs in the Faja. However, we are in discussions with PDVSA on a new contract model, which will include a payment assurance mechanism, and we are optimistic that this contract will be finalized in the coming months and that operations could start in Q1. And in Colombia, with oil prices around $50, activity is expected to increase in the coming quarters as Ecopetrol and several other players are preparing for offshore drilling campaigns in 2017. 
Revenue in Europe, CIS and Africa declined 3% sequentially, excluding the Cameron Group, while strong sequential growth in Russia and flat activity in the North Sea and North Africa was more than offset by a further reduction in activity throughout Sub-Sahara Africa. The drop in revenue was driven by the Drilling and Production Groups while the characterization group posted solid sequential growth. A large part of the growth in the characterization group came from Russia as summer season activity peaked, both on land and offshore and with revenue growth further supported by a stronger ruble. Looking forward to Q4, we expect to see the normal seasonal slowdown in Russia due to winter weather while the outlook for 2017 activity continues to be strong. 
The North Sea posted flat sequential revenue following a solid summer season, where activity in Norway was particularly strong. Looking forward to Q4, we expect to see the normal decline in activity as summer projects conclude and winter weather sets in. Still, exploration success in Norway and several large project start-ups indicate stronger 2017 activity in the North Sea. 
Revenue in continental Europe was up 19% sequentially on strong integrated project performance and deepwater exploration activity in Bulgaria. Higher oil prices will lead to increased production-related activity in this region with a 5% rig count increase expected in Q4, further supported by the restart of offshore activity in the Eastern Med in the early parts of 2017. 
North Africa activity remains stable with flat revenue sequentially while we expect moderate growth in activity in Q4, partly supported by increased market share from recent tender wins for Sonatrach. The market challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa continued in Q3, with yet another significant drop in activity and with the rig count now down by 75% compared to Q4 2014. However, with this latest drop, we do believe we have reached the bottom of the cycle also in this region and expect modest activity increases in most countries in Q4 with the exception of Angola. 
In the Middle East & Asia, characterization, Drilling and Production Group revenue grew 2% sequentially as strength in the Middle East and Australia was partly offset by continued weakness in Asia. Both the characterization and Drilling Groups posted growth in the third quarter while Production Group revenue was slightly down due to a temporary reduction in fracturing activity in the Middle East. 
In the GCC, the underlying drilling and rigless activity remained strong with solid revenues reported in all countries. In addition to this, we continue to progress on our early production facility project in Kuwait, which represents another exciting growth opportunity for us. In Australia, revenue increased in the third quarter after 7 quarters of decline, driven by additional land activity for the Drilling Group as well as higher offshore exploration activity for the characterization group while in China, Indonesia and the rest of Southeast Asia, the revenue decline continued in the third quarter and, at present, there are no signs of any imminent activity recovery in this region. 
Turning now to the oil macro. The supply and demand of crude is now more or less in balance as seen by the flattening global petroleum inventories and the start of consistent growth towards the end of the quarter, in particular in North America. In addition, oil demand was again revised upwards in September and is now forecasted to be around 1.2 million barrels per day for both 2016 and 2017. 
At the same time, global supply is plateauing as non-OPEC production continues to experience significant declines and even offsetting record production levels from OPEC in September. Based on current investment levels, we believe that 2017 non-OPEC production will at best be flat as any production upside from the U.S., Canada and Brazil will be offset by further declines in the rest of the global production base. 
Given the projected demand growth, this means that the call on OPEC will increase from the current record production levels, suggesting that the production upside from Nigeria, Libya and Iran may be needed to keep the markets in balance. All of this means that the period of oversupply and inventory build is over and that market sentiments should soon change, paving the way for an increase in oil prices and, subsequently, E&P investments. There is also a case to be made for a more rapid growth on the global oil inventories and a more bullish outlook for the oil price in the event of a lower production upside from Libya, Nigeria and Iran, OPEC and Russia implementation of production cuts or a steeper decline in non-OPEC production. 
In terms of 2017 E&P investments, details are still limited. However, we maintain that a V-shaped recovery is unlikely, given the fragile financial state of the industry. Still, we do see upside in 2017 in North America land, the Middle East and Russia, and we are making sure we are optimally placed to capture a large share of this upside and, importantly, turn this additional activity into positive earnings contributions. 
With the unparalleled cost and cash discipline we have established, we are confident in our ability to deliver incremental margins north of 65% and a free cash flow conversion rate above 75%, which, going forward, will give us significant flexibility to both reinvest in our business as well as steadily return cash to our shareholders. 
Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions."

But I will say the uptick in Latin America and Europe, Africa is more going to be from current kind of Q3 activity levels. It might not be a significant increase on a full year basis, but I think we have reached bottom in both of those regions, which would warrant higher activities. So I'm not contradicting what the IOCs are saying, and we welcome, obviously, more activity and higher investments from them.

But on the 2018 kind of general guidance for revenue and growth for the Cameron Group, it really depends on those short-cycle businesses and when activity returns. And so there is a path for growth in '18 but it depends on that land business in V&M and in the Surface segment. We're highly focused on growing in the Middle East. We're highly focused on growing in Mid-Continent there in the United States. And if we can see continued rig count increase, then we do have a path for growth. Now obviously, the drilling business, with the backlog number there, will continue to decline. And OneSubsea, quite frankly, has been relatively flat since the beginning of the deepwater downturn, which started in 2014, and so we won't lose a lot of revenue traction on OneSubsea. It will really come from drilling. And then the offset is the shorter-cycle business growth on land markets."

The absolute E&P investment numbers for next year, I think it's still early to comment on absolute numbers. I can give you some direction and -- I think, in terms of where we see the trends going, and what the absolute number is going to be is going to be more a function of how the numerics of these trends play out. But we do expect, on a full year basis, solid year-over-year growth in North America land, Russia and the Middle East. These are fairly predictable plans that we have in place. We also expect to see modest growth from the current levels, not necessarily on a full year basis, but from current levels in Europe, Africa and Latin America. And the reason for this is that there are many significant oil-producing countries in these 2 regions which have record-low investment levels at this stage, and we see signs that at least we're going to come off the bottom here. Whether that's going to translate into year-over-year growth is too early to say, but at least an increase from where we are today. And really, the only place where we don't see any of these recovery signs as of yet is in Asia. So all depending on what the various numbers on these 3 main trends pan out to be, there is a chance that revenue could be up. Obviously, that's what we are hoping for, and that's what we're going to work towards and, obviously, market share and some of the other things that we are working on specifically around the land rig introduction, around SPM and some of the early production facility work that we do. We have opportunities, I would say, to come in with higher revenue in 2017, but I'm not going to commit to this as of yet. I think we need to work out the details of the plans over the coming 2, 3 months, and we can give you a further update in January."

And I think on seismic, as I, again, said in July, the performance of WesternGeco in a very, very tough market is quite commendable. We do quite well on both marine and land, and we have been quite opportunistic on the multiclient side to make a significant investment in several basins around the world, in particular, Mexico, but also -- Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. part, as well as overseas. And obviously, at this stage, we are able to generate revenue and profits from these investments, which you see very clearly in our results. So there's no, I would say, significant market turnaround, but I think it's a strong performance from the exploration-related businesses that we have, including seismic and also within the Testing Services product line, which sits in Reservoir Characterization. We have won a series of early production facility projects, where we have combined the capabilities that we had within the Testing Services prior with the processing capabilities that Cameron had. And this is, again, really strengthening the offering we have in this market, and we see that also has a significant growth opportunity within characterization."

The main -- so there's really no main shift internationally. The main thing I was pointing off in North America is that the -- on the drilling side, we now have a clear path on -- in U.S. land towards profitability based on the technology uptake we're seeing linked to these super laterals. And as soon as we can turn a profit, we are very keen to grow market share. And we have basically shifted the playbook from holding the fort to going for market share in drilling in U.S. land, but we have not yet done that for fracking because, at this stage, it is highly dilutive to our earnings.

But as these bid rounds for acreage now has progressed and with the deepwater round coming up -- the first deepwater round coming up now in December, we see drilling activity picking up in 2017. Again, it might not be a dramatic comeback, and we won't be back to, I would say, 2013 levels or 2014 levels anytime soon, but I think there is a momentum shift coming in Mexico.

But what we are saying, though, is that as we now are starting to come off bottom, as oil prices are starting to move upwards, then we will need to have these discussions with the customers where we have this type of contracts and try to find a way where we can get pricing and terms and conditions and a work scope that will enable us to meet those financial return criteria at the same time as our customers can also meet theirs. So I think these are the discussions that now are taking place. This won't be resolved overnight, but we are very clear on the fact that if we are to deploy capacity investments and expertise, there has to be return in it.

So expect 2016 deepwater drilling activity as a whole to be down 33%. And when we think about that for OneSubsea and projects as we go forward, we think, this year, 3 awards is significantly under $100 million. And when you look at our project list, we're tracking between anywhere between 5 and 8 awards that could happen in 2017, and those would be the larger-style awards that we've seen traditionally. But our focus really now has shifted to the tieback market, and we do see a lot of opportunities on that. I've mentioned our 8 FEED -- 8 paid FEED studies with Subsea 7, where we're doing a lot of work on the tieback side. And what we think there is at -- with a standardized subsea tree, which is at a significantly reduced cost, a single-well boosting system, which we're the only ones right now that have that single-well boosting system and then combine that with our unified control system and the installation from Subsea 7, we think we've got a very economical package to tie back 1 and 2 wells into existing host facilities. So we're in a lot of discussions around that, and really, it's almost creating a market right now. And so we hope that we can get some more excitement and more awards around that as we transition into '17.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.25. This represents an increase of $0.02 sequentially and a decrease of $0.53 when compared",640,"Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.25. This represents an increase of $0.02 sequentially and a decrease of $0.53 when compared to the same quarter of last year. 
During the quarter, we recorded $237 million of pretax merger and integration charges associated with the acquisition of Cameron. This consisted of $149 million noncash inventory purchase accounting item that will not recur. The balance relates to transaction costs as well as the dedicated integration team and other costs to achieve synergies. We will continue to incur merger and integration charges for the rest of 2016 and into 2017. 
Our third quarter revenue of $7 billion decreased 2% sequentially. This decrease was entirely driven by reduced activity in the Cameron Group due to its declining backlog. Excluding the impact of Cameron Group, third quarter revenue actually increased 1% sequentially. 
Pretax operating margins increased 119 basis points sequentially to 11.6%. Margins increased sequentially in each group except for Cameron. These increases reflect the benefits from cost-reduction initiatives as well as the effects of last quarter's itemized asset write-downs, which contributed to approximately 50% of the reduction in depreciation. 
Operational highlights by product group were as follows. Third quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.7 billion increased 5% sequentially while margin increased 292 basis points to 19.1%. The revenue growth was primarily driven by increased Testing Services and WesternGeco activities.  Margins improved sequentially across all the Reservoir Characterization technologies but most noticeably in Wireline and Testing Services. 
Drilling Group revenue of $2 billion was essentially flat sequentially while margins increased by 241 basis points. The margin expansion was largely due to the benefit of cost initiatives and the reduced losses in Venezuela due to further alignment of our resources in the GeoMarket to match the reduced level of activity. 
Production Group revenue of $2.1 billion was also essentially flat sequentially while margin improved 41 basis points, largely due to strong SPM activity. 
Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 12% sequentially. Despite the 12% reduction in revenue, pretax operating margin only declined 34 basis points to 16%. The revenue decline was driven by the decreasing backlog that has significantly impacted the Drilling Group line. However, strong project execution in OneSubsea, combined with cost-control initiatives across the group, limited the margin decline. 
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 16% in the third quarter, essentially the same as Q2. Going forward, our tax rate will be driven by the overall geographic mix of earnings. 
During the third quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of cash flow from operations. During the first 3 quarters of 2016, we have generated $4.2 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $117 million during the third quarter and paying $800 million of severance and one-off Cameron-related transaction payments during the first 9 months of the year. Our net debt increased $122 million during the quarter to $10.2 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $11.1 billion. 
During the quarter, we spent $156 million to repurchase 2 million shares at an average price of $77. On a year-to-date basis, we have spent $662 million to repurchase 9.5 million shares at an average price of $69.64 per share. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included approximately $400 million on CapEx, $140 million on SPM investments, $160 million of multiclient and $700 million of dividend payments. 
Our CapEx on a year-to-date basis was $1.4 billion, which includes 2 quarters of Cameron. CapEx for the full year of 2016 is now expected to be approximately $2 billion. These amounts do not include SPM or multiclient. 
And now I will turn the conference call over to Scott."

I am pleased to provide an update on the progress of the Cameron Group now that we are 6 months into the combination with Schlumberger. Cameron continued to have good operating results in the third quarter despite the challenges in the gl",849,"Hello, everyone. I am pleased to provide an update on the progress of the Cameron Group now that we are 6 months into the combination with Schlumberger. Cameron continued to have good operating results in the third quarter despite the challenges in the global marketplace and the contraction of our backlog, driven by this prolonged downturn. 
In Q3, our revenue reduced by 12% sequentially to $1.3 billion. Despite this drop, we were able to successfully hold operating margins at 16%, which is 19% decrementals off a nearly all-time high-margin performance in the second quarter of this year. The higher margins are a result of relentless cost reductions combined with excellent project execution in our longer-cycle businesses. We have now experienced 7 straight quarters of reduced activity and pricing pressure in the marketplace. 
And Cameron's shorter-cycle Surface and Valves & Measurement businesses have experienced the full effect of the reduced activity, spending cuts and pricing pressure but are now positioned to rebound with any incremental activity. Despite the duration of the downturn, these 2 businesses continue to be profitable and have strong cash flow as we have managed our cost structure and working capital well throughout the cycle. Typical lead times in these businesses range from 3 weeks to 9 months, and we expect to see revenue flatten in future quarters and begin to grow again in mid-2017 as onshore activity picks up around the world. 
In our longer-cycle businesses, OneSubsea and drilling systems, we have been extremely successful in expanding margins throughout the cycle. OneSubsea and drilling remained accretive to the overall margins of the Cameron Group. In fact, OneSubsea had record profitability at 23.5% this quarter. The profitability improvements and the market share gains over the last 2 years validate the vision we had when we created OneSubsea. 
The drilling and OneSubsea teams have done an excellent job improving our project delivery processes, driving cost out of projects and products and capitalizing on our installed base by expanding our service and aftermarket offerings. Going forward, these improvements will be partly offset by extremely competitive pricing and lower volumes. 
These 2 businesses are now entering a period of revenue decline as our backlog has fallen for 7 straight quarters. We are now entering the phase of the downturn that the other Schlumberger businesses have experienced over the past 18 months. 
On a brighter note, our book-to-bill ratio for these 2 businesses was 0.8 in the third quarter, which was the highest ratio we have seen since the downturn began. This gives us visibility to revenue growth in 2018. 
The drilling systems business will contract the most as new equipment orders for floating and jack-up rigs are nearly nonexistent. And our focus has now shifted to land rigs and capitalizing on our market-leading installed base of pressure-control equipment. 
Before I transition to the integration, I want to spend a minute on how we are positioning OneSubsea. We now have 8 paid FEED studies, and we are working on 30 customer engagements on our OneSubsea and Subsea 7 alliance. I fully expect to win a small tieback award that utilizes OneSubsea's equipment and Subsea 7's installation capability before the year is over. We see the tieback market as an area of growth in the deepwater sector. Operators are looking to spend significantly less and drive higher returns by capitalizing on existing host facilities. 
OneSubsea is uniquely positioned with our standardized subsea tree, our single-well boosting system, our unified control system and our partnership with Subsea 7 to capitalize on this growth opportunity. We also have the capability to integrate this further with the deepwater drilling and production teams of Schlumberger to provide further turnkey solutions to operators who are looking to tie back these assets. 
The success of the integration of Cameron into Schlumberger continues to exceed our expectations. I would like to confirm that the transaction is again accretive in the third quarter as well as confirm that we will achieve the $300 million synergy target in the first year of the combination. In the third quarter, we booked $139 million of synergy-related work, which landed in every business segment in the Cameron Group. 
One notable award in the quarter was an integration project for Chevron in Thailand that consisted of surface wellheads and trees, wireline logging services, M-I SWACO drilling fluids and services as well as the supply of barite. This is a great example of subsurface and surface integration across 3 different Schlumberger groups. 
While there is still more cost savings to be had, our integration will focus -- will shift focus to driving revenue synergies and capitalizing on the vast geographic network of Schlumberger. We see significant growth opportunities for Cameron in the Middle East, Russia, Latin America and India, where Cameron can leverage the substantial presence and relationships that Schlumberger has in these geographies. In summary, I could not be more pleased with how our group is performing in the down cycle and how we are capitalizing on the opportunities that the combination of Schlumberger and Cameron has created. 
I'll now turn it over to Paal."
301966,378013058,1058887,"Schlumberger Limited, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2016",2016-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. After 7 quarters of unprecedented activity decline, the business environment stabilized as expected in the third quarter, confirming that we have, indeed, reached the bottom of this cycle. Our third quarter",2755,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. After 7 quarters of unprecedented activity decline, the business environment stabilized as expected in the third quarter, confirming that we have, indeed, reached the bottom of this cycle. 
Our third quarter revenues still decreased 2% sequentially, but this was largely driven by the anticipated reduction in activity at Cameron as the product backlog continued to decline. Excluding Cameron, revenue increased 1% sequentially driven by higher activity in North America land, Middle East, Russia and Australia. 
Since the start of this downturn and as it deepened into uncharted territory, our entire management team has worked relentlessly to protect the financial strength of the company. This includes carefully navigating the commercial landscape by balancing pricing concessions and market share and also by proactively removing a staggering $6 billion of quarterly costs through headcount reductions, internal efficiency improvements and strong supply chain management. This has enabled us to deliver unmatched financial results by maintaining pretax operating margins well above 10% and delivering sufficient free cash flow to cover a range of strategic CapEx investments as well as our ongoing dividend commitments. 
We continue to carry forward this strong financial focus as seen in our third quarter results, where we delivered 19% decremental margins in the Cameron Group and incremental margins north of 65% for the other 3 groups combined, excluding any tailwind from previous impairment charges. These results, which represent a small step on our path towards, first, restoring and, subsequently, exceeding our pre-downturn earnings per share and financial returns, are mostly driven by internal cost and efficiency improvements with so far only a minor impact from pricing increases and high-grading of our contracts portfolio. 
Going forward, it is critical for us to recover the large pricing concessions we have made over the past 2 years to allow us to restore investment levels in technology innovation, system integration and operational quality and efficiency, which are all key enablers of our customers' project performance. 
As indicated in July, we have, during this quarter, started pricing recovery discussions with a large part of our global customer base. While there is a general understanding from our customers that pricing will have to increase, there were no material movements during quarter. But with the recent increase in oil prices, the basis for these discussions has now strengthened. 
Looking forward to the activity recovery phase, we will only allocate investments, operating capacity and expertise to contracts in basins that meet our financial return expectations in the same way our customers allocate capital to projects in their portfolios. Currently, a noticeable part of our contracts do not meet these financial return criteria, and this is our starting point for reestablishing sustainable customer relationships that will warrant allocation of our capital, capacity and expertise. 
In addition to our focus on pricing recovery, we will, in the coming quarters, also aim to restore proper payment schedules from our customers, in line with the terms and conditions in our contracts, to address the payment delays we today are seeing from many customers around the world. Still, in spite of these payment delays, free cash flow generation in the third quarter remained solid at $700 million as inventory and CapEx investments was again tightly managed. 
Next, I will review the third quarter trends from our geographical operations, and I will focus my comments on the characterization, drilling and production groups as Scott has already covered the performance of the Cameron Group. In North America, revenue for the characterization, Drilling and Production Groups increased 3% sequentially as solid growth on land was largely offset by a further revenue reduction in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and Eastern Canada, impacting all product groups. The strong growth on land was driven by the U.S., where the Q3 rig count increased significantly and with more than half of the rigs being added in the Permian Basin. 
The increased drilling activity is reflected in our Drilling & Measurements product line, which posted 31% revenue growth in U.S. land compared to the second quarter. At this stage, we are seeing a growing trend in U.S. land towards even longer horizontal laterals or super laterals, aiming at further increasing reservoir contact. One example of this is a well we drilled for Eclipse Resources with a record lateral length of 18,500 feet using our industry-leading PowerDrive Orbit rotary steerable system. 
This emerging trend has already created a significant increase in the offtake of our high-end drilling technologies and has also provided our Drilling Group with a clear path towards profitability on land. We have, therefore, shifted focus from maintaining presence to now gaining market share for our drilling business in North America land. 
In the hydraulic fracturing market, the stage count increased by 17% sequentially, driven by higher drilling activity and also by customers now actively depleting their DUC well inventory. Still, the fracturing market continues to be completely commoditized than significantly oversupplied with a large number of very hungry players. In addition, these significant increase in sand volume pumped per stage is already starting to create inflation on both product and distribution costs, which will further obstruct and delay the hydraulic fracturing industry's path towards restoring profitability. 
Today, the North America fracturing business continues to be highly dilutive to our financial performance, and this, combined with a short-term market outlook, means that we have not yet shifted focus towards gaining market share. Instead, we continue to maintain our market presence while further concentrating activity around our core operating areas. Still, we continue to monitor the fracturing market closely, and we are ready to deploy our significant stacked capacity on short notice but only when the market environment can support positive contributions to our earnings.
So the main takeaway for us from North America land is the emerging technology trend linked to drilling longer and more complex horizontal sections or so-called super laterals. This trend is already creating significantly higher demand for our unique drilling technologies, and we are, at this stage, sold out of PowerDrive Orbit and in the process of adding further capacity from overseas and from manufacturing. This drilling technology trend will also add to the opportunity set for our rig of the future, where we plan to have 2 first-generation rigs in operation in U.S. land in the fourth quarter. 
In the international markets, our revenue excluding Cameron was down 1% sequentially as increasing activity in key countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Russia and Australia was offset by continued weakness in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Far East and Latin America. As we now prepare for the recovery also in the international markets, several trends have emerged over the past 2 years, adding further complexity to these already technically challenging markets. 
First, in pursuit of improving project performance, many customers are now more actively pursuing the technical limits of the equipment and workflows we deploy in our operations. This poses additional challenges with respect to the expertise and technology we use in both the planning and execution phase of our work and further elevates the importance of our global support network, including engineering, maintenance and distribution. While we are well prepared for these additional technical demands, this trend is clearly redefining and elevating customer expectations, and we see this as an excellent opportunity to further extend our market leadership position in the international market. 
The second trend emerging in our international customer base is the growing interest in more commercially aligned business models from time-based performance contracts for individual wells all the way to production incentive contracts based on a fee per barrel. As an example, we are today engaged in various stages of SPM discussions in 20 countries around the world, spanning all customer groups and all 4 operating areas, which clearly demonstrates the momentum this contract model now has within our overall offering. While this trend is very encouraging, I would like to stress that these new contract models are only an addition to our offering and that we will continue to actively pursue traditional models for customers who prefers this type of engagement. 
As we now look to further capitalize on these emerging trends in the international market, we have 2 major advantages: first, our unmatched scale in terms of people, equipment and infrastructure, which allow us to quickly adjust to the increasing technical complexity and additional demands from our customers while ensuring safe and consistent quality in our operations; and second, by having been present in all parts of the world for the past 80 to 90 years, we have established deep industry relationships and unprecedented local credibility, which makes us a natural partner to explore new contract models and translate these into successful business relationships. 
With that, let's take a closer look at the trends we are seeing in the 3 international operating areas. In Latin America, the combined revenue for the characterization, Drilling and Production Groups declined by 5% sequentially due to continued reductions in E&P spend and activity throughout the region. However, the 2-year activity slide was clearly slowing during the quarter, and we believe we have now reached the bottom of the cycle also in Latin America. 
The sequential revenue drop came entirely from the Drilling and Production Groups while the characterization group posted a 2% increase, driven by solid multiclient seismic sales in Mexico. Here, WesternGeco has shot 80,000 square kilometers of marine surveys in the prime deepwater acreage that will be included in the upcoming bid rounds, with the first taking place December 5 of this year. 
In Mexico, drilling activity is also expected to pick up in early parts of 2017, driven by both PEMEX and the successful players from the shallow water bid rounds that has already taken place. In Ecuador, activity remained solid, driven by our SPM projects, and we continue to progress in line with our FEED development plans, both with respect to work scope and production levels. Elsewhere in the region, activity remains subdued due to severe budget constraints for most customers. 
However, we are seeing early signs of recovery in several countries. In Argentina, there is clear optimism amongst the industry players that the new government will take the required steps to further encourage E&P investments in the country as they seek to reduce their oil-import dependency, which should have a positive impact on E&P investments in 2017. In Brazil, Petrobras continues to focus on arresting the decline in the mature Campos basin and is considering opening up for new and more commercially aligned business models with the service industry, which could include fee-per-barrel contract. 
In Venezuela, our operations remain largely shut down outside the work we do for the IOC JVs in the Faja. However, we are in discussions with PDVSA on a new contract model, which will include a payment assurance mechanism, and we are optimistic that this contract will be finalized in the coming months and that operations could start in Q1. And in Colombia, with oil prices around $50, activity is expected to increase in the coming quarters as Ecopetrol and several other players are preparing for offshore drilling campaigns in 2017. 
Revenue in Europe, CIS and Africa declined 3% sequentially, excluding the Cameron Group, while strong sequential growth in Russia and flat activity in the North Sea and North Africa was more than offset by a further reduction in activity throughout Sub-Sahara Africa. The drop in revenue was driven by the Drilling and Production Groups while the characterization group posted solid sequential growth. A large part of the growth in the characterization group came from Russia as summer season activity peaked, both on land and offshore and with revenue growth further supported by a stronger ruble. Looking forward to Q4, we expect to see the normal seasonal slowdown in Russia due to winter weather while the outlook for 2017 activity continues to be strong. 
The North Sea posted flat sequential revenue following a solid summer season, where activity in Norway was particularly strong. Looking forward to Q4, we expect to see the normal decline in activity as summer projects conclude and winter weather sets in. Still, exploration success in Norway and several large project start-ups indicate stronger 2017 activity in the North Sea. 
Revenue in continental Europe was up 19% sequentially on strong integrated project performance and deepwater exploration activity in Bulgaria. Higher oil prices will lead to increased production-related activity in this region with a 5% rig count increase expected in Q4, further supported by the restart of offshore activity in the Eastern Med in the early parts of 2017. 
North Africa activity remains stable with flat revenue sequentially while we expect moderate growth in activity in Q4, partly supported by increased market share from recent tender wins for Sonatrach. The market challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa continued in Q3, with yet another significant drop in activity and with the rig count now down by 75% compared to Q4 2014. However, with this latest drop, we do believe we have reached the bottom of the cycle also in this region and expect modest activity increases in most countries in Q4 with the exception of Angola. 
In the Middle East & Asia, characterization, Drilling and Production Group revenue grew 2% sequentially as strength in the Middle East and Australia was partly offset by continued weakness in Asia. Both the characterization and Drilling Groups posted growth in the third quarter while Production Group revenue was slightly down due to a temporary reduction in fracturing activity in the Middle East. 
In the GCC, the underlying drilling and rigless activity remained strong with solid revenues reported in all countries. In addition to this, we continue to progress on our early production facility project in Kuwait, which represents another exciting growth opportunity for us. In Australia, revenue increased in the third quarter after 7 quarters of decline, driven by additional land activity for the Drilling Group as well as higher offshore exploration activity for the characterization group, while in China, Indonesia and the rest of Southeast Asia, the revenue decline continued in the third quarter and, at present, there are no signs of any imminent activity recovery in this region. 
Turning now to the oil macro. The supply and demand of crude is now more or less in balance as seen by the flattening global petroleum inventories and the start of consistent growth towards the end of the quarter, in particular in North America. In addition, oil demand was again revised upwards in September and is now forecasted to be around 1.2 million barrels per day for both 2016 and 2017. 
At the same time, global supply is plateauing as non-OPEC production continues to experience significant declines and even offsetting record production levels from OPEC in September. Based on current investment levels, we believe that 2017 non-OPEC production will at best be flat as any production upside from the U.S., Canada and Brazil will be offset by further declines in the rest of the global production base. 
Given the projected demand growth, this means that the call on OPEC will increase from the current record production levels, suggesting that the production upside from Nigeria, Libya and Iran may be needed to keep the markets in balance. All of this means that the period of oversupply and inventory build is over and that market sentiments should soon change, paving the way for an increase in oil prices and, subsequently, E&P investments. There is also a case to be made for a more rapid growth on the global oil inventories and a more bullish outlook for the oil price in the event of a lower production upside from Libya, Nigeria and Iran, OPEC and Russia implementation of production cuts or a steeper decline in non-OPEC production. 
In terms of 2017 E&P investments, details are still limited. However, we maintain that a V-shaped recovery is unlikely, given the fragile financial state of the industry. Still, we do see upside in 2017 in North America land, the Middle East and Russia, and we are making sure we are optimally placed to capture a large share of this upside and, importantly, turn this additional activity into positive earnings contributions. 
With the unparalleled cost and cash discipline we have established, we are confident in our ability to deliver incremental margins north of 65% and a free cash flow conversion rate above 75%, which, going forward, will give us significant flexibility to both reinvest in our business as well as steadily return cash to our shareholders.

So we do that, and we also will take some from manufacturing. And this is all manufactured in the -- or partly manufactured in the U.S. as well. So in terms of the reason for mobilizing more equipment into the drilling site, it is clearly that we have a clear path towards profitability. So given the unique technology offering we have and the technical challenges of drilling these very, very long horizontals, we are able to get pricing, which is going to give us, I think, ultimately, the returns that we're looking for. And  this is why we are prepared to put more capacity into play on the drilling side of what's going on in West Texas. As I said on the fracturing side, still there's no clear path towards profitability, and this is why we are still maintaining presence and basically holding the fort until we believe we can justify putting more capacity into play going forward."

Yet, you highlight Russia and Middle East areas, where these companies are typically -- or these type of companies are typically not all that active. So does that mean that you have a different view or you don't believe that kind of the type of IOC will step it up? Or is it that they're coming from a very low base at the end of the year and sequentially will be improving from here but year-over-year be kind of flat?

But we also see, I would say, an uptick in investment and activity in Latin America and in Europe, Africa. The only place where we don't see any signs of recovery at this stage is in Asia. But I will say the uptick in Latin America and Europe, Africa is more going to be from current kind of Q3 activity levels. It might not be a significant increase on a full year basis, but I think we have reached bottom in both of those regions, which would warrant higher activities. So I'm not contradicting what the IOCs are saying, and we welcome, obviously, more activity and higher investments from them. It's just that the main kind of very clear investment increases we are seeing are still going to be in Russia and the Middle East. But there are early signs of things picking up from bottom also in the rest of the world excluding Asia."

The shorter-cycle businesses though at Cameron should be expanding at this point as well, at least that's our forecast. However, when I look back at a recent investor presentation, the high case for Cameron revenue in 2018 is actually flat and the midpoint looks like it was down a bit. Has the outlook for Cameron now improved? Is there line of sight to growth in 2018, assuming the short-cycle businesses kick in over the course of 2017?"

And what you can see there is on the book-to-bill, the 0.8 was meant to be for both drilling systems and OneSubsea. So actually, OneSubsea is higher than that, and we're just below 1 on the OneSubsea side. But on the 2018 kind of general guidance for revenue and growth for the Cameron Group, it really depends on those short-cycle businesses and when activity returns. And so there is a path for growth in '18 but it depends on that land business in V&M and in the Surface segment. We're highly focused on growing in the Middle East. We're highly focused on growing in Mid-Continent there in the United States. And if we can see continued rig count increase, then we do have a path for growth. Now obviously, the drilling business, with the backlog number there, will continue to decline. And OneSubsea, quite frankly, has been relatively flat since the beginning of the deepwater downturn, which started in 2014, and so we won't lose a lot of revenue traction on OneSubsea. It will really come from drilling. And then the offset is the shorter-cycle business growth on land markets."

I can give you some direction and -- I think, in terms of where we see the trends going, and what the absolute number is going to be is going to be more a function of how the numerics of these trends play out. But we do expect, on a full year basis, solid year-over-year growth in North America land, Russia and the Middle East. These are fairly predictable plans that we have in place. We also expect to see modest growth from the current levels, not necessarily on a full year basis, but from current levels in Europe, Africa and Latin America. And the reason for this is that there are many significant oil-producing countries in these 2 regions which have record-low investment levels at this stage, and we see signs that at least we're going to come off the bottom here. Whether that's going to translate into year-over-year growth is too early to say, but at least an increase from where we are today. And really, the only place where we don't see any of these recovery signs as of yet is in Asia. So all depending on what the various numbers on these 3 main trends pan out to be, there is a chance that revenue could be up. Obviously, that's what we are hoping for, and that's what we're going to work towards and, obviously, market share and some of the other things that we are working on specifically around the land rig introduction, around SPM and some of the early production facility work that we do.

So first of all, when you're in a cyclical business, you will have to be pragmatic when you are near or at bottom of the cycle so -- which we are, and we are basically maintaining our presence pretty much everywhere in the world at this stage even at bottom and even though we have a number of contracts which, at this stage, does not meet our medium- to long-term return criteria. But what we are saying, though, is that as we now are starting to come off bottom, as oil prices are starting to move upwards, then we will need to have these discussions with the customers where we have this type of contracts and try to find a way where we can get pricing and terms and conditions and a work scope that will enable us to meet those financial return criteria at the same time as our customers can also meet theirs. So I think these are the discussions that now are taking place. This won't be resolved overnight, but we are very clear on the fact that if we are to deploy capacity investments and expertise, there has to be return in it. And at the bottom, we are willing to compromise, but as we come off bottom, we need to basically restore the return expectations that we have as a company and that our shareholders have in order to drive the business forward."

It's continued to be challenged, and in this quarter, we saw 5 additional rigs get stacked during Q3 and deepwater rig utilization dropped to 55% in the month of September. So expect 2016 deepwater drilling activity as a whole to be down 33%. And when we think about that for OneSubsea and projects as we go forward, we think, this year, tree awards is significantly under $100 million. And when you look at our project list, we're tracking between anywhere between 5 and 8 awards that could happen in 2017, and those would be the larger-style awards that we've seen traditionally. But our focus really now has shifted to the tieback market, and we do see a lot of opportunities on that. I've mentioned our 8 FEED -- 8 paid FEED studies with Subsea 7, where we're doing a lot of work on the tieback side. And what we think there is that with a standardized subsea tree, which is at a significantly reduced cost, a single-well boosting system, which we're the only ones right now that have that single-well boosting system, and then combine that with our unified control system and the installation from Subsea 7, we think we've got a very economical package to tie back 1 and 2 wells into existing host facilities. So we're in a lot of discussions around that, and really, it's almost creating a market right now. And so we hope that we can get some more excitement and more awards around that as we transition into '17. And then as these big projects kind of progress and move forward, we're offsetting that with this expanded tieback market."

301966,378013058,1059100,"Schlumberger Limited, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2016",2016-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.25. This represents an increase of $0.02 sequentially and a decrease of $0.53 when compared",640,"Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.25. This represents an increase of $0.02 sequentially and a decrease of $0.53 when compared to the same quarter of last year. 
During the quarter, we recorded $237 million of pretax merger and integration charges associated with the acquisition of Cameron. This consisted of $149 million noncash inventory purchase accounting item that will not recur. The balance relates to transaction costs as well as the dedicated integration team and other costs to achieve synergies. We will continue to incur merger and integration charges for the rest of 2016 and into 2017. 
Our third quarter revenue of $7 billion decreased 2% sequentially. This decrease was entirely driven by reduced activity in the Cameron Group due to its declining backlog. Excluding the impact of Cameron Group, third quarter revenue actually increased 1% sequentially. 
Pretax operating margins increased 119 basis points sequentially to 11.6%. Margins increased sequentially in each group except for Cameron. These increases reflect the benefits from cost-reduction initiatives as well as the effects of last quarter's itemized asset write-downs, which contributed to approximately 50% of the reduction in depreciation. 
Operational highlights by product group were as follows. Third quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.7 billion increased 5% sequentially while margin increased 292 basis points to 19.1%. The revenue growth was primarily driven by increased Testing Services and WesternGeco activities.  Margins improved sequentially across all the Reservoir Characterization technologies but most noticeably in Wireline and Testing Services. 
Drilling Group revenue of $2 billion was essentially flat sequentially while margins increased by 241 basis points. The margin expansion was largely due to the benefit of cost initiatives and the reduced losses in Venezuela due to further alignment of our resources in the GeoMarket to match the reduced level of activity. 
Production Group revenue of $2.1 billion was also essentially flat sequentially while margin improved 41 basis points, largely due to strong SPM activity. 
Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 12% sequentially. Despite the 12% reduction in revenue, pretax operating margin only declined 34 basis points to 16%. The revenue decline was driven by the decreasing backlog that has significantly impacted the Drilling Group line. However, strong project execution in OneSubsea, combined with cost-control initiatives across the group, limited the margin decline. 
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 16% in the third quarter, essentially the same as Q2. Going forward, our tax rate will be driven by the overall geographic mix of earnings. 
During the third quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of cash flow from operations. During the first 3 quarters of 2016, we have generated $4.2 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $117 million during the third quarter and paying $800 million of severance and one-off Cameron-related transaction payments during the first 9 months of the year. Our net debt increased $122 million during the quarter to $10.2 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $11.1 billion. 
During the quarter, we spent $156 million to repurchase 2 million shares at an average price of $77. On a year-to-date basis, we have spent $662 million to repurchase 9.5 million shares at an average price of $69.64 per share. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included approximately $400 million on CapEx, $140 million on SPM investments, $160 million of multiclient and $700 million of dividend payments. 
Our CapEx on a year-to-date basis was $1.4 billion, which includes 2 quarters of Cameron. CapEx for the full year of 2016 is now expected to be approximately $2 billion. These amounts do not include SPM or multiclient. 
And now I will turn the conference call over to Scott."

I am pleased to provide an update on the progress of the Cameron Group now that we are 6 months into the combination with Schlumberger.

I am pleased to provide an update on the progress of the Cameron Group now that we are 6 months into the combination with Schlumberger. Cameron continued to have good operating results in the third quarter despite the challenges in the global marketplace and the contraction of our backlog, driven by this prolonged downturn. 
In Q3, our revenue reduced by 12% sequentially to $1.3 billion. Despite this drop, we were able to successfully hold operating margins at 16%, which is 19% decrementals off a nearly all-time high-margin performance in the second quarter of this year. The higher margins are a result of relentless cost reductions combined with excellent project execution in our longer-cycle businesses. We have now experienced 7 straight quarters of reduced activity and pricing pressure in the marketplace. 
And Cameron's shorter-cycle Surface and Valves & Measurement businesses have experienced the full effect of the reduced activity, spending cuts and pricing pressure but are now positioned to rebound with any incremental activity. Despite the duration of the downturn, these 2 businesses continue to be profitable and have strong cash flow as we have managed our cost structure and working capital well throughout the cycle. Typical lead times in these businesses range from 3 weeks to 9 months, and we expect to see revenue flatten in future quarters and begin to grow again in mid-2017 as onshore activity picks up around the world. 
In our longer-cycle businesses, OneSubsea and drilling systems, we have been extremely successful in expanding margins throughout the cycle. OneSubsea and drilling remained accretive to the overall margins of the Cameron Group. In fact, OneSubsea had record profitability at 23.5% this quarter. The profitability improvements and the market share gains over the last 2 years validate the vision we had when we created OneSubsea. 
The drilling and OneSubsea teams have done an excellent job improving our project delivery processes, driving cost out of projects and products and capitalizing on our installed base by expanding our service and aftermarket offerings. Going forward, these improvements will be partly offset by extremely competitive pricing and lower volumes. 
These 2 businesses are now entering a period of revenue decline as our backlog has fallen for 7 straight quarters. We are now entering the phase of the downturn that the other Schlumberger businesses have experienced over the past 18 months. 
On a brighter note, our book-to-bill ratio for these 2 businesses was 0.8 in the third quarter, which was the highest ratio we have seen since the downturn began. This gives us visibility to revenue growth in 2018. 
The drilling systems business will contract the most as new equipment orders for floating and jack-up rigs are nearly nonexistent. And our focus has now shifted to land rigs and capitalizing on our market-leading installed base of pressure-control equipment. 
Before I transition to the integration, I want to spend a minute on how we are positioning OneSubsea. We now have 8 paid FEED studies, and we are working on 30 customer engagements on our OneSubsea and Subsea 7 alliance. I fully expect to win a small tieback award that utilizes OneSubsea's equipment and Subsea 7's installation capability before the year is over. We see the tieback market as an area of growth in the deepwater sector. Operators are looking to spend significantly less and drive higher returns by capitalizing on existing host facilities. 
OneSubsea is uniquely positioned with our standardized subsea tree, our single-well boosting system, our unified control system and our partnership with Subsea 7 to capitalize on this growth opportunity. We also have the capability to integrate this further with the deepwater drilling and production teams of Schlumberger to provide further turnkey solutions to operators who are looking to tie back these assets. 
The success of the integration of Cameron into Schlumberger continues to exceed our expectations. I would like to confirm that the transaction is again accretive in the third quarter as well as confirm that we will achieve the $300 million synergy target in the first year of the combination. In the third quarter, we booked $139 million of synergy-related work, which landed in every business segment in the Cameron Group. 
One notable award in the quarter was an integration project for Chevron in Thailand that consisted of surface wellheads and trees, wireline logging services, M-I SWACO drilling fluids and services as well as the supply of barite. This is a great example of subsurface and surface integration across 3 different Schlumberger groups. 
While there is still more cost savings to be had, our integration will focus -- will shift focus to driving revenue synergies and capitalizing on the vast geographic network of Schlumberger. We see significant growth opportunities for Cameron in the Middle East, Russia, Latin America and India, where Cameron can leverage the substantial presence and relationships that Schlumberger has in these geographies. In summary, I could not be more pleased with how our group is performing in the down cycle and how we are capitalizing on the opportunities that the combination of Schlumberger and Cameron has created. 
I'll now turn it over to Paal."
301966,378013058,1059100,"Schlumberger Limited, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2016",2016-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Schlumberger Limited","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. After 7 quarters of unprecedented activity decline, the business environment stabilized as expected in the third quarter, confirming that we have, indeed, reached the bottom of this cycle. Our third quarter",2755,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. After 7 quarters of unprecedented activity decline, the business environment stabilized as expected in the third quarter, confirming that we have, indeed, reached the bottom of this cycle. 
Our third quarter revenues still decreased 2% sequentially, but this was largely driven by the anticipated reduction in activity at Cameron as the product backlog continued to decline. Excluding Cameron, revenue increased 1% sequentially driven by higher activity in North America land, Middle East, Russia and Australia. 
Since the start of this downturn and as it deepened into uncharted territory, our entire management team has worked relentlessly to protect the financial strength of the company. This includes carefully navigating the commercial landscape by balancing pricing concessions and market share and also by proactively removing a staggering $6 billion of quarterly costs through headcount reductions, internal efficiency improvements and strong supply chain management. This has enabled us to deliver unmatched financial results by maintaining pretax operating margins well above 10% and delivering sufficient free cash flow to cover a range of strategic CapEx investments as well as our ongoing dividend commitments. 
We continue to carry forward this strong financial focus as seen in our third quarter results, where we delivered 19% decremental margins in the Cameron Group and incremental margins north of 65% for the other 3 groups combined, excluding any tailwind from previous impairment charges. These results, which represent a small step on our path towards, first, restoring and, subsequently, exceeding our pre-downturn earnings per share and financial returns, are mostly driven by internal cost and efficiency improvements with so far only a minor impact from pricing increases and high-grading of our contracts portfolio. 
Going forward, it is critical for us to recover the large pricing concessions we have made over the past 2 years to allow us to restore investment levels in technology innovation, system integration and operational quality and efficiency, which are all key enablers of our customers' project performance. 
As indicated in July, we have, during this quarter, started pricing recovery discussions with a large part of our global customer base. While there is a general understanding from our customers that pricing will have to increase, there were no material movements during quarter. But with the recent increase in oil prices, the basis for these discussions has now strengthened. 
Looking forward to the activity recovery phase, we will only allocate investments, operating capacity and expertise to contracts in basins that meet our financial return expectations in the same way our customers allocate capital to projects in their portfolios. Currently, a noticeable part of our contracts do not meet these financial return criteria, and this is our starting point for reestablishing sustainable customer relationships that will warrant allocation of our capital, capacity and expertise. 
In addition to our focus on pricing recovery, we will, in the coming quarters, also aim to restore proper payment schedules from our customers, in line with the terms and conditions in our contracts, to address the payment delays we today are seeing from many customers around the world. Still, in spite of these payment delays, free cash flow generation in the third quarter remained solid at $700 million as inventory and CapEx investments was again tightly managed. 
Next, I will review the third quarter trends from our geographical operations, and I will focus my comments on the characterization, drilling and production groups as Scott has already covered the performance of the Cameron Group. In North America, revenue for the characterization, Drilling and Production Groups increased 3% sequentially as solid growth on land was largely offset by a further revenue reduction in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and Eastern Canada, impacting all product groups. The strong growth on land was driven by the U.S., where the Q3 rig count increased significantly and with more than half of the rigs being added in the Permian Basin. 
The increased drilling activity is reflected in our Drilling & Measurements product line, which posted 31% revenue growth in U.S. land compared to the second quarter. At this stage, we are seeing a growing trend in U.S. land towards even longer horizontal laterals or super laterals, aiming at further increasing reservoir contact. One example of this is a well we drilled for Eclipse Resources with a record lateral length of 18,500 feet using our industry-leading PowerDrive Orbit rotary steerable system. 
This emerging trend has already created a significant increase in the offtake of our high-end drilling technologies and has also provided our Drilling Group with a clear path towards profitability on land. We have, therefore, shifted focus from maintaining presence to now gaining market share for our drilling business in North America land. 
In the hydraulic fracturing market, the stage count increased by 17% sequentially, driven by higher drilling activity and also by customers now actively depleting their DUC well inventory. Still, the fracturing market continues to be completely commoditized than significantly oversupplied with a large number of very hungry players. In addition, these significant increase in sand volume pumped per stage is already starting to create inflation on both product and distribution costs, which will further obstruct and delay the hydraulic fracturing industry's path towards restoring profitability. 
Today, the North America fracturing business continues to be highly dilutive to our financial performance, and this, combined with a short-term market outlook, means that we have not yet shifted focus towards gaining market share. Instead, we continue to maintain our market presence while further concentrating activity around our core operating areas. Still, we continue to monitor the fracturing market closely, and we are ready to deploy our significant stacked capacity on short notice but only when the market environment can support positive contributions to our earnings.
So the main takeaway for us from North America land is the emerging technology trend linked to drilling longer and more complex horizontal sections or so-called super laterals. This trend is already creating significantly higher demand for our unique drilling technologies, and we are, at this stage, sold out of PowerDrive Orbit and in the process of adding further capacity from overseas and from manufacturing. This drilling technology trend will also add to the opportunity set for our rig of the future, where we plan to have 2 first-generation rigs in operation in U.S. land in the fourth quarter. 
In the international markets, our revenue excluding Cameron was down 1% sequentially as increasing activity in key countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Russia and Australia was offset by continued weakness in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Far East and Latin America. As we now prepare for the recovery also in the international markets, several trends have emerged over the past 2 years, adding further complexity to these already technically challenging markets. 
First, in pursuit of improving project performance, many customers are now more actively pursuing the technical limits of the equipment and workflows we deploy in our operations. This poses additional challenges with respect to the expertise and technology we use in both the planning and execution phase of our work and further elevates the importance of our global support network, including engineering, maintenance and distribution. While we are well prepared for these additional technical demands, this trend is clearly redefining and elevating customer expectations, and we see this as an excellent opportunity to further extend our market leadership position in the international market. 
The second trend emerging in our international customer base is the growing interest in more commercially aligned business models from time-based performance contracts for individual wells all the way to production incentive contracts based on a fee per barrel. As an example, we are today engaged in various stages of SPM discussions in 20 countries around the world, spanning all customer groups and all 4 operating areas, which clearly demonstrates the momentum this contract model now has within our overall offering. While this trend is very encouraging, I would like to stress that these new contract models are only an addition to our offering and that we will continue to actively pursue traditional models for customers who prefers this type of engagement. 
As we now look to further capitalize on these emerging trends in the international market, we have 2 major advantages: first, our unmatched scale in terms of people, equipment and infrastructure, which allow us to quickly adjust to the increasing technical complexity and additional demands from our customers while ensuring safe and consistent quality in our operations; and second, by having been present in all parts of the world for the past 80 to 90 years, we have established deep industry relationships and unprecedented local credibility, which makes us a natural partner to explore new contract models and translate these into successful business relationships. 
With that, let's take a closer look at the trends we are seeing in the 3 international operating areas. In Latin America, the combined revenue for the characterization, Drilling and Production Groups declined by 5% sequentially due to continued reductions in E&P spend and activity throughout the region. However, the 2-year activity slide was clearly slowing during the quarter, and we believe we have now reached the bottom of the cycle also in Latin America. 
The sequential revenue drop came entirely from the Drilling and Production Groups while the characterization group posted a 2% increase, driven by solid multiclient seismic sales in Mexico. Here, WesternGeco has shot 80,000 square kilometers of marine surveys in the prime deepwater acreage that will be included in the upcoming bid rounds, with the first taking place December 5 of this year. 
In Mexico, drilling activity is also expected to pick up in early parts of 2017, driven by both PEMEX and the successful players from the shallow water bid rounds that has already taken place. In Ecuador, activity remained solid, driven by our SPM projects, and we continue to progress in line with our FEED development plans, both with respect to work scope and production levels. Elsewhere in the region, activity remains subdued due to severe budget constraints for most customers. 
However, we are seeing early signs of recovery in several countries. In Argentina, there is clear optimism amongst the industry players that the new government will take the required steps to further encourage E&P investments in the country as they seek to reduce their oil-import dependency, which should have a positive impact on E&P investments in 2017. In Brazil, Petrobras continues to focus on arresting the decline in the mature Campos basin and is considering opening up for new and more commercially aligned business models with the service industry, which could include fee-per-barrel contract. 
In Venezuela, our operations remain largely shut down outside the work we do for the IOC JVs in the Faja. However, we are in discussions with PDVSA on a new contract model, which will include a payment assurance mechanism, and we are optimistic that this contract will be finalized in the coming months and that operations could start in Q1. And in Colombia, with oil prices around $50, activity is expected to increase in the coming quarters as Ecopetrol and several other players are preparing for offshore drilling campaigns in 2017. 
Revenue in Europe, CIS and Africa declined 3% sequentially, excluding the Cameron Group, while strong sequential growth in Russia and flat activity in the North Sea and North Africa was more than offset by a further reduction in activity throughout Sub-Sahara Africa. The drop in revenue was driven by the Drilling and Production Groups while the characterization group posted solid sequential growth. A large part of the growth in the characterization group came from Russia as summer season activity peaked, both on land and offshore and with revenue growth further supported by a stronger ruble. Looking forward to Q4, we expect to see the normal seasonal slowdown in Russia due to winter weather while the outlook for 2017 activity continues to be strong. 
The North Sea posted flat sequential revenue following a solid summer season, where activity in Norway was particularly strong. Looking forward to Q4, we expect to see the normal decline in activity as summer projects conclude and winter weather sets in. Still, exploration success in Norway and several large project start-ups indicate stronger 2017 activity in the North Sea. 
Revenue in continental Europe was up 19% sequentially on strong integrated project performance and deepwater exploration activity in Bulgaria. Higher oil prices will lead to increased production-related activity in this region with a 5% rig count increase expected in Q4, further supported by the restart of offshore activity in the Eastern Med in the early parts of 2017. 
North Africa activity remains stable with flat revenue sequentially while we expect moderate growth in activity in Q4, partly supported by increased market share from recent tender wins for Sonatrach. The market challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa continued in Q3, with yet another significant drop in activity and with the rig count now down by 75% compared to Q4 2014. However, with this latest drop, we do believe we have reached the bottom of the cycle also in this region and expect modest activity increases in most countries in Q4 with the exception of Angola. 
In the Middle East & Asia, characterization, Drilling and Production Group revenue grew 2% sequentially as strength in the Middle East and Australia was partly offset by continued weakness in Asia. Both the characterization and Drilling Groups posted growth in the third quarter while Production Group revenue was slightly down due to a temporary reduction in fracturing activity in the Middle East. 
In the GCC, the underlying drilling and rigless activity remained strong with solid revenues reported in all countries. In addition to this, we continue to progress on our early production facility project in Kuwait, which represents another exciting growth opportunity for us. In Australia, revenue increased in the third quarter after 7 quarters of decline, driven by additional land activity for the Drilling Group as well as higher offshore exploration activity for the characterization group, while in China, Indonesia and the rest of Southeast Asia, the revenue decline continued in the third quarter and, at present, there are no signs of any imminent activity recovery in this region. 
Turning now to the oil macro. The supply and demand of crude is now more or less in balance as seen by the flattening global petroleum inventories and the start of consistent growth towards the end of the quarter, in particular in North America. In addition, oil demand was again revised upwards in September and is now forecasted to be around 1.2 million barrels per day for both 2016 and 2017. 
At the same time, global supply is plateauing as non-OPEC production continues to experience significant declines and even offsetting record production levels from OPEC in September. Based on current investment levels, we believe that 2017 non-OPEC production will at best be flat as any production upside from the U.S., Canada and Brazil will be offset by further declines in the rest of the global production base. 
Given the projected demand growth, this means that the call on OPEC will increase from the current record production levels, suggesting that the production upside from Nigeria, Libya and Iran may be needed to keep the markets in balance. All of this means that the period of oversupply and inventory build is over and that market sentiments should soon change, paving the way for an increase in oil prices and, subsequently, E&P investments. There is also a case to be made for a more rapid growth on the global oil inventories and a more bullish outlook for the oil price in the event of a lower production upside from Libya, Nigeria and Iran, OPEC and Russia implementation of production cuts or a steeper decline in non-OPEC production. 
In terms of 2017 E&P investments, details are still limited. However, we maintain that a V-shaped recovery is unlikely, given the fragile financial state of the industry. Still, we do see upside in 2017 in North America land, the Middle East and Russia, and we are making sure we are optimally placed to capture a large share of this upside and, importantly, turn this additional activity into positive earnings contributions. 
With the unparalleled cost and cash discipline we have established, we are confident in our ability to deliver incremental margins north of 65% and a free cash flow conversion rate above 75%, which, going forward, will give us significant flexibility to both reinvest in our business as well as steadily return cash to our shareholders. 
Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions."

But I will say the uptick in Latin America and Europe, Africa is more going to be from current kind of Q3 activity levels. It might not be a significant increase on a full year basis, but I think we have reached bottom in both of those regions, which would warrant higher activities. So I'm not contradicting what the IOCs are saying, and we welcome, obviously, more activity and higher investments from them.

So actually, OneSubsea is higher than that, and we're just below 1 on the OneSubsea side. But on the 2018 kind of general guidance for revenue and growth for the Cameron Group, it really depends on those short-cycle businesses and when activity returns. And so there is a path for growth in '18 but it depends on that land business in V&M and in the Surface segment. We're highly focused on growing in the Middle East. We're highly focused on growing in Mid-Continent there in the United States. And if we can see continued rig count increase, then we do have a path for growth. Now obviously, the drilling business, with the backlog number there, will continue to decline. And OneSubsea, quite frankly, has been relatively flat since the beginning of the deepwater downturn, which started in 2014, and so we won't lose a lot of revenue traction on OneSubsea. It will really come from drilling. And then the offset is the shorter-cycle business growth on land markets."

I can give you some direction and -- I think, in terms of where we see the trends going, and what the absolute number is going to be is going to be more a function of how the numerics of these trends play out. But we do expect, on a full year basis, solid year-over-year growth in North America land, Russia and the Middle East. These are fairly predictable plans that we have in place. We also expect to see modest growth from the current levels, not necessarily on a full year basis, but from current levels in Europe, Africa and Latin America. And the reason for this is that there are many significant oil-producing countries in these 2 regions which have record-low investment levels at this stage, and we see signs that at least we're going to come off the bottom here. Whether that's going to translate into year-over-year growth is too early to say, but at least an increase from where we are today. And really, the only place where we don't see any of these recovery signs as of yet is in Asia. So all depending on what the various numbers on these 3 main trends pan out to be, there is a chance that revenue could be up.

Whatever work there is, I think, we are able to generally pick up on the exploration side. And I think on seismic, as I, again, said in July, the performance of WesternGeco in a very, very tough market is quite commendable. We do quite well on both marine and land, and we have been quite opportunistic on the multiclient side to make a significant investment in several basins around the world, in particular, Mexico, but also -- Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. part, as well as overseas. And obviously, at this stage, we are able to generate revenue and profits from these investments, which you see very clearly in our results. So there's no, I would say, significant market turnaround, but I think it's a strong performance from the exploration-related businesses that we have, including seismic and also within the Testing Services product line, which sits in Reservoir Characterization. We have won a series of early production facility projects, where we have combined the capabilities that we had within the Testing Services prior with the processing capabilities that Cameron had. And this is, again, really strengthening the offering we have in this market, and we see that also has a significant growth opportunity within characterization."

I would say in international market, we have, I would say, actively pursued market share for the past, I will say, 12 to 18 months, I think, with reasonable success. I think if you look at characterization, drilling and production combined, take away Cameron, we have pretty solid revenue evolution in all 3 international operating areas in the third quarter, and I'm quite pleased to see the progress we have made there. Whenever you start aiming to increase your tender win rate, which we now have been focusing on for a good 18 months or so, it takes a bit of time before that translates into actual revenue, but you're starting to see some impact of that. The main -- so there's really no main shift internationally. The main thing I was pointing out for North America is that the -- on the drilling side, we now have a clear path on -- in U.S. land towards profitability based on the technology uptake we're seeing linked to these super laterals. And as soon as we can turn a profit, we are very keen to grow market share. And we have basically shifted the playbook from holding the fort to going for market share in drilling in U.S. land, but we have not yet done that for fracking because, at this stage, it is highly dilutive to our earnings.

We have had -- we've seen a significant reduction in PEMEX activity over the past couple of years. And while this whole industry reform has been taking place, that reduction has not been, I would say, compensated by additional investments from the emerging international players. But as these bid rounds for acreage now has progressed and with the deepwater round coming up -- the first deepwater round coming up now in December, we see drilling activity picking up in 2017. Again, it might not be a dramatic comeback, and we won't be back to, I would say, 2013 levels or 2014 levels anytime soon, but I think there is a momentum shift coming in Mexico. It's partly linked to the seismic work that we're doing and the related exploration activity with that, but I think also activity linked to the previous rounds that we've seen both in shallow water and on land as well as the basic PEMEX activity should pick up in 2017."

But what we are saying, though, is that as we now are starting to come off bottom, as oil prices are starting to move upwards, then we will need to have these discussions with the customers where we have this type of contracts and try to find a way where we can get pricing and terms and conditions and a work scope that will enable us to meet those financial return criteria at the same time as our customers can also meet theirs. So I think these are the discussions that now are taking place. This won't be resolved overnight, but we are very clear on the fact that if we are to deploy capacity investments and expertise, there has to be return in it. And at the bottom, we are willing to compromise, but as we come off bottom, we need to basically restore the return expectations that we have as a company and that our shareholders have in order to drive the business forward."

It's continued to be challenged, and in this quarter, we saw 5 additional rigs get stacked during Q3 and deepwater rig utilization dropped to 55% in the month of September. So expect 2016 deepwater drilling activity as a whole to be down 33%. And when we think about that for OneSubsea and projects as we go forward, we think, this year, tree awards is significantly under $100 million. And when you look at our project list, we're tracking between anywhere between 5 and 8 awards that could happen in 2017, and those would be the larger-style awards that we've seen traditionally. But our focus really now has shifted to the tieback market, and we do see a lot of opportunities on that. I've mentioned our 8 FEED -- 8 paid FEED studies with Subsea 7, where we're doing a lot of work on the tieback side. And what we think there is that with a standardized subsea tree, which is at a significantly reduced cost, a single-well boosting system, which we're the only ones right now that have that single-well boosting system, and then combine that with our unified control system and the installation from Subsea 7, we think we've got a very economical package to tie back 1 and 2 wells into existing host facilities. So we're in a lot of discussions around that, and really, it's almost creating a market right now. And so we hope that we can get some more excitement and more awards around that as we transition into '17. And then as these big projects kind of progress and move forward, we're offsetting that with this expanded tieback market."
