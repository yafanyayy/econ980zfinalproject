As you saw from the release, we posted a strong close to a great year. Looking forward, we're excited about what lies ahead in 2016, which we believe will be a great year for leisure travel. 
With the wide range of places to stay, Wyndham Worldwide is uniquely positioned to welcome people to travel the way they want and where they want.
This gives us great confidence in our prospects and is reflected in our board's decision to raise our quarterly dividend by 19% and increase our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion.
Tom will focus on fourth quarter results. But first, let me summarize the year, which was terrific from both an operational and a financial perspective.
On a constant currency basis and excluding acquisitions and the divestiture, we grew revenues 6% and adjusted EBITDA 8% in 2015. 
On the same basis, adjusted EPS grew 17%, reflecting strong operating performance across the company supported by our share repurchase program.
Wyndham Hotel Group achieve 11% adjusted EBITDA growth on a constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions and including the increased license fees paid by Wyndham Vacation Ownership or 7% excluding the fee. 
We successfully acquired an integrated dolce, which significantly enhanced our presence in the managed hotel space and is performing better than our expectations. We also developed and launched a new cloud-based strategy for our property management and central reservation systems. 
Finally, we introduce the Wyndham Wizard to millions of consumers and made great progress on our new award-winning Wyndham Rewards loyalty program. 
Wyndham Rewards is one of the threads that we, Wyndham Worldwide, together, driving a powerful marketing and value proposition to consumers across our travel brands.
The newly named Wyndham Destination Network, formerly known as Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, grew adjusted EBITDA 6% on a constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions and the divestiture.
We are moving to a more expensive vision of the business, which combine offering from our Vacation Rental and timeshare exchange brands to enable our worldwide customer base to experience vacation of their dreams. 
With rising awareness of the sharing economy and increasing consumer demand for unique places to stay, we believe this new strategy will drive higher customer engagement and higher growth in years to come.
Our portfolio of managed Vacation Rental brands posted great results in 2015. While some of our largest European Vacation Rental competitors had declines in vacation volume in 2015, all our brands, both in Europe and the U.S., posted transaction increases, enabling us to achieve transaction growth on an organic basis of 7%. And RCI also had a strong years, netting 66,000 to their average member count.
Wyndham Vacation Ownership had a great year with gross of timeshares up 5% in constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA was up 6% in constant currency and including the additional license fee paid to Wyndham Hotel Group or 8% excluding that fee.
With a focus on the next generation of timeshare owners, we improved our sales process to enhance customer engagement and drive future growth.
We opened 6 new sales centers to expand our reach for new owners, and changes to our underwriting standards continue to benefit EBITDA through lower loan losses, while innovative efforts for sourcing inventory reduced our cost of goods sold.
So if all those 2015 achievements behind us, let's talk more detail about some of the initiatives that will fuel our growth in the coming years. I'll begin with Wyndham Hotel Group. 
We expect to drive growth through a renewed focus on improving the quality of our brands, redefining what technology means for economy and midscale hotels and continuing to differentiate with our Wyndham Rewards loyalty program. Our goals are to increase our value proposition to both our hotel owners and guests and to drive higher contribution across the portfolio.
The migration of our central reservation and property management systems are on schedule and we are being well received by owners and franchisees alike. The new cloud-based Property Management System with automated revenue management capabilities is now running in over 200 over North American hotels. 
But at the end of the year, we expect to have transitioned over 3,000 hotels to the new system, which is being operated and maintained and will be enhanced in the years ahead by technology leader -- leaders such as Sabre and Poor. 
In addition, we successfully transition the Trip by Wyndham brand to our new Sabre-enabled central reservation system and were already seeing a lift in our reservation contribution for the Trip brand even during the short time the new system has been in place.
We're looking forward to ruling it out to our Wyndham brand later this year and the remaining brands through 2017.
Last quarter, I was pleased to announce that U.S. news and world report named Wyndham Rewards one of the top loyalty programs in the hotel industry, jumping from seventh to second place. 
More recently, our Wyndham Rewards program received a 2 best in show platinum awards from Loyalty 3 60, a well-known loyalty marketing association with members from across a wide range of industries. These accolades are a reflection of the innovative and dedicated work of our team, which has created a program that is less complex and more rewarding than any other.
And our franchisees have never been more engaged, with property direct enrollments up over 30% since program launch. 
Our recently introduced Go Fast program, where consumers use points plus cash for a stay, has been a great success with over 300,000 room nights booked through the program last year.
We expect Wyndham Rewards members to drive over  [indiscernible] this year, delivering guest who stay more often and stay longer than nonmembers. 
Now turning to Wyndham Destination Network. As discussed on last quarter's call, we changed the name from Wyndham Exchange and Rentals to reflect our standing as the world's largest provider of professionally managed unique vacation and combinations. Anything from cottages just to castles to timeshare resorts. 
We continue to see momentum in our rental brands with strengthen our core customer source markets, which are the U.K., Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany and the U.S. 
Despite new entrants into the rental market, we've seen little impact in the competitive landscape. 
With the strength of our brands in the depth and breadth of our offerings, we provide a great value proposition to both homeowners and travelers. These attributes enable us to be largely insulated from economic as well as geopolitical risks and produce reliable consistent results.
Last year, we bolstered our strong proprietary distribution network from global partnerships with online portals, such as home way and booking.com. We continue to pursue the strategy in 2016. 
We have local presence and global leverage, which provides great -- provides strong advantages compared with the floor rent by owner option in the same channels. 
Providing the widest distribution for a property owner has been a primary strategy for the Wyndham destination network and it's working. 
For example, Novasol, our Danish brand, now sources renters from over 80 countries, that's up from 50 countries just 18 months ago.
Now let's look at RCI. This brand continues to perform well, driven by a long tradition of innovation. 
Over the past few years, we've introduced enhanced membership options and several new products that add convenience and flexibility to RCI membership. 
Last year, we launched additional new products that strengthen our members ability to enhance their trading options. All told, the products we've introduced since 2010 at an approximately $50 million to annual revenues in 2015. 
We're working on the next generation of RCI.com and look forward to updating you on our plans in the near future.
Of course, we continue to expand our global network at RCI. For example, RCI recently added a new flagship affiliation with Tokyu Corporation in Japan, netting 5 great resorts in popular Japanese destinations. 
RCI is, by far, the biggest timeshare exchange brand in the world, and its international footprint is clearly a distinguishing strength. With over 4,000 resorts worldwide to choose from, RCI provides tremendous value to its members and we expect to further expand our network in 2016.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which had another outstanding year with strong VOI sales growth. 
Last quarter, we discussed how all indications are pointing to strong long-term trends in the U.S. leisure travel market from millennials to boomers. We also highlighted our efforts to set the stage for increased sales by opening new sales centers in New York City, St. Thomas, Puerto Rico, Southern California, Colorado and Las Vegas, along with new affiliation agreements.
We're pleased with the early progress and performance of these initiatives and have recently taken additional organizational steps to best position our Vacation Ownership business for future expansion. 
Our goal is to drive consistent and profitable sales -- sales growth with tighter more focused operating regions. 
We believe this focus will help us intensify the process we started a couple of years ago to evolve timeshare sales and marketing to ensure our customer-friendly buying experience and to drive future growth.
Let me remind you of the primary initiatives, most of which we previously discussed. First, we introduced and refined a group presentation sales format for new and existing owners, ensuring that our best salespeople are in front of our customers using a proven, uniform method of telling a consistent story in producing sales.
Second, for owners who have benefited from our product for many years but are no longer actively using it, we designed a suite of programs to enable them to gracefully exit their ownership. We broadly call this program Ovation by Wyndham. It is how we applaud owners who have experienced years of great travel memories, but whose needs and circumstances have changed.
Finally, we improved the buying experience for consumers. We implemented enhanced sales training and compliance programs, and we bolstered our quality assurance regime on the contract and close process, which now includes videotaping. We're also streamlining our documentation process to make a more transparent and easier to understand for the consumer. We are piloting a program to bring greater clarity to the sale by providing contractual documents and program information in a digital format on a preloaded tablet.
We give buyers the tablet rather than a thick owners kit, enabling them to enjoy easier access to important materials regarding their purchase and use of our products.
We made great progress in these initiatives over the past 2 years and will continue our focus in the future. 
With our new sales centers, strong affiliation agreements and enhanced sales and marketing operations, we're looking forward to generating substantial long-term sales growth within our Vacation Ownership business. 
The opportunities in timeshare, a business with strong economics, are robust. 
To capture these opportunities, we're targeting 35,000 new owners in 2016, about a 15% increase over 2015. So 35,000 [ph] in 2016. 
We expect to achieve these through increased tours, primarily from new marketing alliances and a new sales office as we've opened in the past 16 to 18 months. 
We will also slightly increase financing to creditworthy new buyers true lower down payment requirements. We look forward to updating you on our progress.
Before turning over the call to Tom, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook. 
Stock market volatility aside, the operating dynamics we see across this company looks strong for 2016. The geographic and demographic diversity of our offerings, the resiliency of our fee-for-service revenue streams, the scalability of our businesses and our proven track record of strong execution provides a stable base from which to grow. It's a powerful combination.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom to walk through the fourth quarter and what we expect in detail in 2016. Tom?"
31063165,321591661,928879,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone.

Good morning, everyone. 
As Steve noted, 2015 was very good year for Wyndham Worldwide despite the fact that foreign exchange negatively affected year-over-year adjusted EBITDA by $46 million and created significant headwinds throughout the year. 
Absent the foreign exchange effect on EBITDA, we would've ended the year at the top of our long-term guidance range. 
We also enjoyed a strong fourth quarter. On a currency-neutral basis and excluding acquisitions and a divestiture, revenue increased 6% and adjusted EBITDA increased 8%. 
We also enjoyed a very strong year and cash flow generation. Free cash flow for 2015 was $769 million compared with $749 million for the 12 months of 2014. This was within our neighborhood target range of $800 million.
Remember that foreign exchange reduced free cash flow in 2015 by approximately $43 million. So on a constant currency basis, free cash flow in 2015 was $812 million, an 8% increase over 2014, growing in line with currency-neutral adjusted EBITDA. The increase reflects stronger operating results and lower capital expenditures.
In addition, you might recall from last quarter's call that we sold land and work in progress in a WAAM just-in-time transaction for $65 [ph] million in cash. 
So while not technically a part of the definition of free cash flow, it did add to overall cash flow for the company and was available to support our capital allocation decisions. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for $165 [ph] million. And over the course of the year, we repurchased 7.9 million shares for $650 million, reducing our full year weighted average share count by over 6%.
In addition, we've repurchased 1.6 million shares for $170 [ph] million so far in 2016.
Now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units. 
Our Hotel Group had a strong fourth quarter capping terrific year. On an apples to apples basis, which excludes the effect of currency, the increase in our segment licensing fee that hotel receives from Wyndham Vacation Ownership and the Dolce acquisition, fourth quarter revenues increased 6% and adjusted EBITDA increased 10%.
Results reflect an increase in royalty and hotel management fees as well as growth in our Wyndham Rewards credit card program. 
Same-store domestic RevPAR increased 4.4%, reflecting the ability of our owners to increase room rates as hotel occupancy was relatively flat. 
We achieve this growth despite continued pressure on our RevPAR growth in the oil-producing markets, which, as defined by STR, mainly includes parts of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and West Virginia.
To put this into perspective, RevPAR in the non-oil-producing markets grew 7.5% whereas RevPAR in the oil-producing markets was down 27.9%.
We were especially pleased with the performance of our managed portfolio, where domestic same-store RevPAR was up 7% from the prior year. The performance of our upper upscale Wyndham portfolio was particularly strong, with a 9% increase in RevPAR year-over-year.
Systemwide RevPAR was flat in constant currency, largely due to the continued unit growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China. 
Excluding China and in constant currency, global RevPAR was up 1.6%, which includes a 240 basis point unfavorable impact from domestic and Canadian oil markets.
Overall, net system size grew 2.6%. For the year, gross room openings of nearly 66,000 were offset by over 48,000 terminations, most of which we consider to be substandard. The result is continually improving system quality.
Our development pipeline is over 119,000 rooms, a 2.2% increase over the prior year.
Our Destination Network segment continued to perform well. Note that adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2014 included a $6 million operating loss from Canvas Holidays, a U.K.-based camping brand that we sold late in 2014. 
On a currency-neutral basis and excluding acquisitions and the Canvas Holiday's divestiture, revenues increased 5% and adjusted EBITDA increased 9%.
Results reflect growth in our portfolio of brands, particularly at our RCI and Denmark-based Novasol brands. 
EBITDA also benefited from the receipt of settlements of business disruption claims related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010. 
At RCI, exchange revenues increased 1% in constant currency. The average number of members increased 0.7% attributable to continued new member growth in the Americas.
Exchange revenue per member was flat as pricing increases offset the growth in lower transacting club members. 
Vacation Rentals revenues for the quarter was up 8% [ph] in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions in the Canvas divestiture. That increase reflects an 8.1% increase in transaction volume and flat average net price per rental.
Transaction growth occurred in all significant brands and regions. Both pricing and transaction volume were aided by our dynamic pricing initiatives.
Fourth quarter results for our Vacation Ownership business were also solid with revenues up 7% and adjusted EBITDA up 5% in constant currency and excluding a $4 million increase in the licensing fee rate paid to the Hotel Group. 
Reflecting our emphasis on sales growth, gross VOI sales were up 9% in constant currency in the fourth quarter of 2015. That growth reflected a 3.4% increase in VPG and a 4.7% increase in tour flow. 
VPG benefited from higher transaction sizes and tour flow increased primarily due to the new sales centers that Steve mentioned earlier.
The performance of the consumer loan portfolio remain solid. The provision for loan loss was $64 [ph] million compared to $60 million in the fourth quarter of last year -- excuse me, of 2014, primarily reflecting higher sales volumes in the quarter.
For the full year, the provision for loan loss was right in line with writeoffs. And writeoffs were approximately 2% in the fourth quarter and approximately 7.5% for the full year, reasonably consistent with the results in the same periods of 2014.
Company-wide, net interest expense increased by $10 million in the fourth quarter over the same period in 2014, reflecting the $350 million 5.1% bonds issued in September and the absence of the fixed-to-floating interest rate swap that we unwound during the second quarter of 2015.
Now let's turn to our 2016 outlook and guidance. As a reminder, we're going to post full guidance details to our Investor Relations website following the call. 
Revenue guidance for 2016 is $5.8 billion to $5,950,000,000. Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2016 is $1,375,000,000 to $1,400,000,000. 
As usual, we're most comfortable with the midpoint of these ranges.
Today's guidance is based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2015, which reflects $10 million of an adverse impact on our 2016 EBITDA assumptions.
While the calculated EBITDA growth range for 2016 is 6% to 8%, please take note that in constant currency, we're expecting 2016 EBITDA growth of 7% to 9%.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2016 is $5.46 to $5.60. We expect the diluted share count of 116 million shares, which per our standard guiding practice, assumes no share buybacks in 2016.
Now let's take a quick look at guidance for each of our business units. Starting with the Hotel Group, we expect another strong year. We expect revenues of $1,355,000,000 to $1,390,000,000. 
We expect room growth of 2% to 4% and global RevPAR growth of flat to up 10% [ph] or 1% to 3% in constant currency, which does incorporate 3% to 5% domestic RevPAR growth. 
Note that our January RevPAR was directionally in line with industry reports and we expect RevPAR to be below our annual guidance range in the first quarter, reflecting the Easter holiday shift and a strong first quarter 2015 comparison.
We expect Hotel Group adjusted EBITDA will be $397 million to $407 million.
At Destination Network, we expect revenues of $1,570,000,000 to $1,615,000,000 [ph] and adjusted EBITDA of $378 million to $388 million.
We expect the average number of exchange members to be flat to up 2% and exchange revenue per member to be flat or up 1% to 3% in constant currency.
We expect Vacation Rental transactions to grow 5% to 7% and average net price per rental to decline 1% to 3%, primarily reflecting foreign exchange.
For Vacation Ownership, we expect revenues of $2.9 billion to $2,980,000,000 [ph] and adjusted EBITDA of $728 million to $754 million.
Our key metric, gross VOI sales is expected to grow 5% to 7%, reflecting tour growth of 3% to 5% and flat to plus 2% VPG growth. 
As Steve noted earlier, we intend to increase our new owner target this year, which will have a dampening effect on VPG. This will be more than offset by higher tours. 
Company-wide, we expect corporate expenses of $135 million to $140 million consistent with 2015. We expect depreciation and amortization to be $245 million to $250 million as additional capital projects come online.
We expect interest expense of $131 million to $133 million, which assumes no debt new issuances in 2016. 
Interest expense is higher than 2015 primarily due to the $350 million 5.1% bond we issued last September and the elimination of the fixed-to-floating rate swap that was in place for 5 months in 2015.
Now we'll be considering ways throughout the year to reduce interest expense further.
We expect a modestly higher rate of securitization activity in 2016, but rates will be comparable. The market appears to be strong, and while spreads may be widening a bit, benchmarks are lower.
Our neighborhood target for 2016 free cash flow remains $800 million. 
As Steve discussed earlier, we expect to increase financing to creditworthy consumers to drive new owner growth, which will have an adverse short-term impact on cash, but which we believe is a great investment in the business. 
Also as always, keep in mind that there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or any given year. So we view $800 million as a neighborhood target rather than an exact figure.
Our business produces abundant free cash flow, roughly $7 a share this year, which represents compounded growth rate of 13% since 2010. 
Our capital allocation philosophies to invest in the business and then return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. 
Absent M&A opportunities, you can expect we'll return at least $600 million to shareholders this year through share repurchases. 
In addition, based on the board's decision to increase our annual dividend to $2 per share, we will return another $230 million to shareholders through dividend payments.
Now turning to the first quarter. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.08 to $1.11. And remember that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance.
To close, we are very pleased with our performance in 2015 and are looking forward to a very strong 2016. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve. Steve?"

And we're seeing result from that yield management capability, which was the first time of European rental businesses have that can of skill sets. And various other technology things for the most part that RCI's brought to the table and is kind of put into the rental business. In addition, we see an opportunity to do more cross-selling, people who are currently doing rentals of cottages to possibly renting timeshare and then maybe deciding that they want to buy timeshare at some point. So we think there is real opportunity there. And so by giving this team as one family within Destination Network, we think we can drive more of that across of the enterprise."

And so we are in constant touch with investors. I think one of the strategies that we've employed is constant marketing and discussions with interested investors.

Spreads have widened tiny bit, but we think rates would be comparable than they were last year. And so we feel -- actually, we feel very good that because of this constant marketing and because of performance of our businesses that we'll be able to get through 2016 very comfortably, and that's kind of reflected in our targets for the year. You've mentioned something about interest rate increase and whether that had any effect on pricing, on our securitizations, and the answer is none the sales to us. And so at least on this part of our business, we remain quite confident in the stability of trends as we go forward. And I'll just add one more thing. We've been at the securitization business for a long time. Investors know us. They've experienced the performance of our businesses through the tumultuous period of 29 -- 2009 and 2010.

I think they did a terrific job of resetting their brand, one of the best I've seen. So they did a great job for a very, very large brand and I applaud them on it.

We don't see a lot of correlation between consumer confidence in the timeshare business. The timeshare business, it's a sold good, it's not a sought good. It really depends on how good our marketing and sales efforts are. That's what drives that business. So if you go back to 2007, '08, '09 and you take out the fact that we took our sales down because we didn't know what the ADS market will look like, all of the metrics around our sales effort in timeshare were terrific. VPG was up. We were controlling tours perfectly. We repositioned that business. I need to tell you was one of the great repositioning some of the business I've seen and it would made the business actually stronger. So we didn't see -- we did not see a lack of people interested in buying. What we saw was our marketing efforts would bring in buyers who probably were more prone to buy because people traveling at that time when travel was down a bit were the more dedicated travelers, more inclined to buy. So we actually exceeded sales during that time. So -- and that's true of our rental businesses as well, we did extremely well. So we have a model that is extremely resilient. So do we look at consumer confidence, do we look at trends, yes. Do we look at the fact that guests -- whenever gas prices are up, people say, oh my gosh, people won't be going their cars to go rent hotel rooms. Well, that doesn't happen. And likewise, when prices are down it doesn't necessarily mean they're going to get a car and driver out. But they do have more disposable income in their pocket. And I've seen several reports that have shown that a large percentage of the additional dollars people have now that gas prices are down is going into travel and entertainment. So we feel we're extremely well-positioned and all of our tracking is looking very positive."

And we are not seeing any impact from the Zika virus. We don't have a huge presence in Latin America. We have a huge presence, but not a huge presence, so we have not seen any change in there. As for travelers coming into the U.S., there was a little bit of a downturn in Brazilian travelers to Florida. They flow into Miami and Orlando in large numbers and we do do a lot of marketing to them. We have a Portuguese sales line and Orlando, but again, it wasn't large enough to have impacted the business at all. So we don't think that the travel patterns are changing. As for the oil-producing markets, where the fracking has been occurring in the U.S. is definitely down. As Tom said, I think it's down to 27% RevPAR in those particular markets. So they have been hit very, very hard. I never thought I could say that oil-producing markets in the U.S. would have an impact in our results, but they -- frankly, they have. And so we highlighted that and pointed that out to you. As to the -- you asked about the age of the buyers of timeshare, it has trended down. It's gotten younger over the last several years. I think right now the report says that the average timeshare buyer is 51 years old, but that's the owner. So the buyer is probably younger than that. I think it's in the early 40s and actually have been looking at some of this, it's 39 years old. And so they are younger. The Gen Xers are attracted to timeshare. The average disposable income is up fairly significant. I remember it's used to be $80,000. It's up to like $95,000 now. So yes, there is a younger, more affluent person buying timeshare than there was historically."

With the wide range of places to stay, Wyndham Worldwide is uniquely positioned to welcome people to travel the way they want and where they want.
This gives us great confidence in our prospects and is reflected in our board's decision to raise our quarterly dividend by 19% and increase our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion.
Tom will focus on fourth quarter results. But first, let me summarize the year which was terrific from both an operational and a financial perspective.
On a constant currency basis and excluding acquisitions and the divestiture, we grew revenues 6% and adjusted EBITDA 8% in 2015. 
On the same basis, adjusted EPS grew 17%, reflecting strong operating performance across the company supported by our share repurchase program.
Wyndham Hotel Group achieved 11% adjusted EBITDA growth on a constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions and including the increased license fee paid by Wyndham Vacation Ownership or 7% excluding the fee. 
We successfully acquired an integrated dolce, which significantly enhanced our presence in the managed hotel space and is performing better than our expectations. We also developed and launched a new cloud-based strategy for our property management and central reservation systems. 
Finally, we introduced the Wyndham Wizard to millions of consumers and made great progress on our new award-winning Wyndham Rewards loyalty program. 
Wyndham Rewards is one of the threads that weave Wyndham Worldwide together, driving a powerful marketing and value proposition to consumers across our travel brands.
The newly named Wyndham Destination Network, formerly known as Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, grew adjusted EBITDA 6% on a constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions and a divestiture.
We are moving to a more expansive vision of the business, which combine offerings from our Vacation Rental and timeshare exchange brands to enable our Wyndham -- our worldwide customer base to experience vacation of their dreams. 
With rising awareness of the sharing economy and increasing consumer demand for unique places to stay, we believe this new strategy will drive higher customer engagement and higher growth in the years to come.
Our portfolio of managed Vacation Rental brands posted great results in 2015. While some of our largest European Vacation Rental competitors had declines in vacation volume in 2015, all our brands, both in Europe and the U.S., posted transaction increases, enabling us to achieve transaction growth on an organic basis of 7%. And RCI also had a strong year, netting 66,000 to their average member count.
Wyndham Vacation Ownership had a great year with gross of timeshares sales up 5% in constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA was up 6% in constant currency and including the additional license fee paid to Wyndham Hotel Group or 8% excluding that fee.
With a focus on the next generation of timeshare owners, we improved our sales process to enhance customer engagement and drive future growth.
We opened 6 new sales centers to expand our reach for new owners, and changes to our underwriting standards continue to benefit EBITDA through lower loan losses, while innovative methods for sourcing inventory reduced our cost of goods sold.
So with all those 2015 achievements behind us, let's talk in more detail about some of the initiatives that will fuel our growth in the coming years. I'll begin with Wyndham Hotel Group. 
We expect to drive growth through a renewed focus on improving the quality of our brands, redefining what technology means for economy and midscale hotels and continuing to differentiate with our Wyndham Rewards loyalty program. Our goals are to increase our value proposition to both our hotel owners and guests and to drive higher contribution across the portfolio.
The migration of our central reservation and property management systems are on schedule and we are -- and are being well received by owners and franchisees alike. The new cloud-based Property Management System with automated revenue management capabilities is now running in over 200 of our North American hotels. 
By the end of the year, we expect to have transitioned over 3,000 hotels to the new system, which is being operated and maintained and will be enhanced in the years ahead by technology leader -- leaders such as SABRE and Infor.
In addition, we successfully transition the Trip by Wyndham brand to our new Sabre-enabled central reservation system and we're already seeing a lift in our reservation contribution for the Trip brand even during the short time the new system has been in place.
We're looking forward to rolling it out to our Wyndham brand later this year and the remaining brands through 2017.
Last quarter, I was pleased to announce that U.S. News and World Report named Wyndham Rewards one of the top loyalty programs in the hotel industry, jumping from seventh to second place. 
More recently, our Wyndham Rewards program received 2 best-in-show Platinum awards from Loyalty 360, a well-known loyalty marketing association with members from across a wide range of industries. These accolades are a reflection of the innovative and dedicated work of our team which has created a program that is less complex and more rewarding than any other.  And our franchisees have never been more engaged with property direct enrollments up over 30% since program launch. 
Our recently introduced Go Fast program, where consumers use points plus cash for a stay, has been a great success with over 300,000 room nights booked through the program last year.
We expect Wyndham Rewards members to drive over  [indiscernible] this year, delivering guests who stay more often and stay longer than nonmembers. 
Now turning to Wyndham Destination Network. As discussed on last quarter's call, we changed the name from Wyndham Exchange and Rentals to reflect our standing as the world's largest provider of professionally-managed unique vacation accommodations. Anything from cottages to castles to timeshare resorts. 
We continue to see momentum in our rental brands with strength in our core customer source markets, which are the U.K., Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany and the U.S. 
Despite new entrants into the rental market, we've seen little impact in the competitive landscape. 
With the strength of our brands and the depth and breadth of our offerings, we provide a great value proposition to both homeowners and travelers. These attributes enable us to be largely insulated from economic as well as geopolitical risks and produce reliable, consistent results.
Last year, we bolstered our strong proprietary distribution network through global partnerships with online portals, such as HomeAway and Booking.com. We continue to pursue this strategy in 2016. 
We have local presence and global leverage, which provide greats -- provides strong advantages compared with the floor rent by owner option in the same channels. 
Providing the widest distribution for our property owners has been a primary strategy for the Wyndham destination network and it's working. 
For example, Novasol, our Danish brand, now sources renters from over 80 countries, that's up from 50 countries just 18 months ago.
Now let's look at RCI. This brand continues to perform well, driven by a long tradition of innovation.  Over the past few years, we've introduced enhanced membership options and several new products that add convenience and flexibility to RCI membership.  Last year, we launched additional new products that strengthen our members ability to enhance their trading options. All told, the products we've introduced since 2010 added approximately $50 million to annual revenues in 2015.  We're working on the next generation of RCI.com and look forward to updating you on our plans in the near future.  Of course, we continue to expand our global network at RCI. For example, RCI recently added a new flagship affiliation with Tokyu Corporation in Japan, adding 5 great resorts in popular Japanese destinations.  RCI is, by far, the biggest timeshare exchange brand in the world, and its international footprint is clearly a distinguishing strength. With over 4,000 resorts worldwide to choose from, RCI provides tremendous value to its members and we expect to further expand our network in 2016.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which had another outstanding year with strong VOI sales growth.  Last quarter, we discussed how all indications are pointing to strong long-term trends in the U.S. leisure travel market from millennials to boomers. We also highlighted our efforts to set the stage for increased sales by opening new sales centers in New York City, St. Thomas, Puerto Rico, Southern California, Colorado and Las Vegas, along with new affiliation agreements.  We're pleased with the early progress and performance of these initiatives and have recently taken additional organizational steps to best position our Vacation Ownership business for future expansion. 
Our goal is to drive consistent and profitable sales -- sales growth with tighter, more focused operating regions.  We believe this focus will help us intensify the process we started a couple of years ago to evolve timeshare sales and marketing to ensure a customer-friendly buying experience and to drive future growth.
Let me remind you of the primary initiatives, most of which we previously discussed. First, we introduced and refined a group presentation sales format for new and existing owners, ensuring that our best salespeople are in front of our customers using a proven, uniform method of telling a consistent story and producing sales.
Second, for owners who have benefited from our product for many years but are no longer actively using it, we designed a suite of programs to enable them to gracefully exit their ownership. We broadly call this program Ovation by Wyndham. It is how we applaud owners who have experienced years of great travel memories, but whose needs and circumstances have changed.
Finally, we improved the buying experience for consumers. We implemented enhanced sales training and compliance programs, and we bolstered our quality assurance regime on the contracting and close process, which now includes videotaping. We're also streamlining our documentation process to make it more transparent and easier to understand for the consumer. We are piloting a program to bring greater clarity to the sale by providing contractual documents and program information in a digital format on a preloaded tablet.
We give buyers the tablet rather than a thick owners kit, enabling them to enjoy easier access to important materials regarding their purchase and use of our products.  We made great progress in these initiatives over the past 2 years and will continue our focus in the future.  With our new sales centers, strong affiliation agreements and enhanced sales and marketing operations, we're looking forward to generating substantial long-term sales growth within our Vacation Ownership business.  The opportunities in timeshare, a business with strong economics, are robust.  To capture these opportunities, we're targeting 35,000 new owners in 2016, about a 15% increase over 2015. So 35,000 in 2016.  We expect to achieve these through increased tours, primarily from new marketing alliances and a new sales office as we've opened in the past 16 to 18 months.  We will also slightly increase financing to creditworthy new buyers through lower down payment requirements. We look forward to updating you on our progress.
Before turning over the call to Tom, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook. 
Stock market volatility aside, the operating dynamics we see across this company looks strong for 2016. The geographic and demographic diversity of our offerings, the resiliency of our fee-for-service revenue streams, the scalability of our businesses and our proven track record of strong execution provide a stable base from which to grow. It's a powerful combination.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom to walk through the fourth quarter and what we expect in detail in 2016. Tom?"
31063165,321591661,929109,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone.

Good morning, everyone. 
As Steve noted, 2015 was very good year for Wyndham Worldwide despite the fact that foreign exchange negatively affected year-over-year adjusted EBITDA by $46 million and created significant headwinds throughout the year. 
Absent [ph] the foreign exchange effect on EBITDA, we would've ended the year at the top of our long-term guidance range.  
We also enjoyed a strong fourth quarter. On a currency-neutral basis and excluding acquisitions and a divestiture, revenue increased 6% and adjusted EBITDA increased 8%. 
We also enjoyed a very strong year in cash flow generation. Free cash flow for 2015 was $769 million compared with $749 million for the 12 months of 2014. This was within our neighborhood target range of $800 million.  Remember that foreign exchange reduced free cash flow in 2015 by approximately $43 million. So on a constant currency basis, free cash flow in 2015 was $812 million, an 8% increase over 2014, growing in line with currency-neutral adjusted EBITDA. The increase reflects stronger operating results and lower capital expenditures.
In addition, you might recall from last quarter's call that we sold land and work in progress in a WAAM just-in-time transaction for $65 million in cash.  So while not technically a part of the definition of free cash flow, it did add to overall cash flow for the company and was available to support our capital allocation decisions. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for $165 million. And over the course of the year, we repurchased 7.9 million shares for $650 million, reducing our full year weighted average share count by over 6%.
In addition, we've repurchased 1.6 million shares for $107 million so far in 2016.
Now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units. 
Our Hotel Group had a strong fourth quarter capping off a terrific year. On an apples to apples basis, which excludes the effect of currency, the increased in our segment licensing fee that hotel receives from Wyndham Vacation Ownership and the Dolce acquisition, fourth quarter revenues increased 6% and adjusted EBITDA increased 10%.
Results reflect an increase in royalty and hotel management fees as well as growth in our Wyndham Rewards credit card program. 
Same-store domestic RevPAR increased 4.4%, reflecting the ability of our owners to increase room rates as hotel occupancy was relatively flat.  We achieved this growth despite continued pressure on our RevPAR growth in the oil-producing markets, which, as defined by STR, mainly includes parts of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and West Virginia.  To put this into perspective, RevPAR in the non-oil-producing markets grew 7.5% whereas RevPAR in the oil-producing markets was down 27.9%.
We were especially pleased with the performance of our managed portfolio, where domestic same-store RevPAR was up 7% from the prior year. The performance of our FelCor upper upscale Wyndham portfolio was particularly strong, with a 9% increase in RevPAR year-over-year.
Systemwide RevPAR was flat in constant currency, largely due to the continue unit growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China.  Excluding China and in constant currency, global RevPAR was up 1.6%, which includes a 240 basis point unfavorable impact from domestic and Canadian oil markets.
Overall, net system size grew 2.6%. For the year, gross room openings of nearly 66,000 were offset by over 48,000 terminations, most of which we consider to be substandard. The result is continually improving system quality.  
Our development pipeline is over 119,000 rooms, a 2.2% increase over the prior year.
Our Destination Network segment continue to perform well. Note that adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2014 included a $6 million operating loss from Canvas Holidays, a U.K.-based camping brand that we sold late in 2014.  On a currency-neutral basis and excluding acquisitions and the Canvas Holiday's divestiture, revenues increased 5% and adjusted EBITDA increased 9%.
Results reflect growth in our portfolio of brands, particularly at our RCI and Denmark-based Novasol brands. 
EBITDA also benefited from the receipt of settlements of business disruption claims related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010. 
At RCI, exchange revenues increased 1% in constant currency. The average number of members increased 0.7%, attributable to continued new member growth in the Americas.  Exchange revenue per member was flat as pricing increases offset the growth in lower transacting club members. 
Vacation Rentals revenue for the quarter was up 8% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions in the Canvas divestiture. That increase reflects an 8.1% increase in transaction volume and flat average net price per rental.
Transaction growth occurred in all significant brands and regions. Both pricing and transaction volume were aided by our dynamic pricing initiatives.
Fourth quarter results for our Vacation Ownership business were also solid with revenues up 7% and adjusted EBITDA up 5% in constant currency and excluding a $4 million increase in the licensing fee rate paid to the Hotel Group. 
Reflecting our emphasis on sales growth, gross VOI sales were up 9% in constant currency in the fourth quarter of 2015. That growth reflected a 3.4% increase in VPG and a 4.7% increase in tour flow. 
VPG benefited from higher transaction sizes and tour flow increased primarily due to the new sales centers that Steve mentioned earlier.
The performance of the consumer loan portfolio remained solid. The provision for loan loss was $64 million compared to $60 million in the fourth quarter of last year -- excuse me, of 2014, primarily reflecting higher sales volumes in the quarter.  For the full year, the provision for loan loss was right in line with writeoffs. And writeoffs were approximately 2% in the fourth quarter and approximately 7.5% for the full year, reasonably consistent with the results in the same periods of 2014.
Company-wide, net interest expense increased by $10 million in the fourth quarter over the same period in 2014, reflecting the $350 million, 5.1% bonds issued in September and the absence of the fixed-to-floating interest rate swap that we unwound during the second quarter of 2015.
Now let's turn to our 2016 outlook and guidance. As a reminder, we're going to post full guidance details to our Investor Relations website following the call. 
Revenue guidance for 2016 is $5.8 billion to $5,950,000,000. Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2016 is $1,375,000,000 to $1,400,000,000.  As usual, we're most comfortable with the midpoint of these ranges.
Today's guidance is based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2015, which reflects $10 million of an adverse impact on our 2016 EBITDA assumptions.
While the calculated EBITDA growth range for 2016 is 6% to 8%, please take note that in constant currency, we're expecting 2016 EBITDA growth of 7% to 9%.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2016 is $5.46 to $5.60. We expect a diluted share count of 116 million shares, which per our standard guidance practice, assumes no share buybacks in 2016.
Now let's take a quick look at guidance for each of our business units. Starting with the Hotel Group, we expect another strong year. We expect revenues of $1,355,000,000 to $1,390,000,000.  We expect room growth of 2% to 4% and global RevPAR growth of flat to up 2% or 1% to 3% in constant currency, which does incorporate 3% to 5% domestic RevPAR growth. 
Note that our January RevPAR was directionally in line with industry reports and we expect RevPAR to be below our annual guidance range in the first quarter, reflecting the Easter holiday shift and a strong first quarter 2015 comparison.  We expect Hotel Group adjusted EBITDA will be $397 million to $407 million.
At Destination Network, we expect revenues of $1,570,000,000 to $1,615,000,000 and adjusted EBITDA of $378 million to $388 million.  We expect the average number of exchange members to be flat to up 2% and exchange revenue per member to be flat or up 1% to 3% in constant currency.
We expect Vacation Rental transactions to grow 5% to 7% and average net price per rental to decline 1% to 3%, primarily reflecting foreign exchange.
For Vacation Ownership, we expect revenues of $2.9 billion to $2,980,000,000 and adjusted EBITDA of $728 million to $754 million.
Our key metric, gross VOI sales is expected to grow 5% to 7%, reflecting tour growth of 3% to 5% and flat to plus 2% VPG growth. 
As Steve noted earlier, we intend to increase our new owner target this year, which will have a dampening effect on VPG. This will be more than offset by higher tours. 
Company-wide, we expect corporate expenses of $135 million to $140 million consistent with 2015. We expect depreciation and amortization to be $245 million to $250 million as additional capital projects come online.
We expect interest expense of $131 million to $133 million, which assumes no new debt issuances in 2016.  Interest expense is higher than 2015 primarily due to the $350 million 5.1% bond we issued last September and the elimination of the fixed-to-floating rate swap that was in place for 5 months in 2015.
Now we'll be considering ways throughout the year to reduce interest expense further.
We expect a modestly higher rate of securitization activity in 2016, but rates will be comparable. The market appears to be strong and while spreads may be widening a bit, benchmarks are lower.
Our neighborhood target for 2016 free cash flow remains $800 million. 
As Steve discussed earlier, we expect to increase financing to creditworthy consumers to drive new owner growth, which will have an adverse short-term impact on cash, but which we believe, is a great investment in the business. 
Also as always, keep in mind that there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or any given year. So we view $800 million as a neighborhood target rather than an exact figure.
Our business produces abundant free cash flow, roughly $7 a share this year, which represents compounded growth rate of 13% since 2010. 
Our capital allocation philosophies is to invest in the business and then return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. 
Absent M&A opportunities, you can expect we'll return at least $600 million to shareholders this year through share repurchases. 
In addition, based on the board's decision to increase our annual dividend to $2 per share, we will return another $230 million to shareholders through dividend payments.
Now turning to the first quarter. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.08 to $1.11. And remember that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance.
To close, we are very pleased with our performance in 2015 and are looking forward to a very strong 2016. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve. Steve?"

It's probably less important than other hotel related companies because our -- the lot of the additions we make are new -- are conversion. And conversions tend to flip very quickly, so it may not even appear on the pipeline. The pipeline is really -- mostly made of properties that are new construction. There were some international conversions that were brought in. They're on there, they take a little bit longer to come in the domestic conversions. But it's a mix. I don't think there's anything really meaningful to be read into that change or difference.
The only other thing I would add, Joe, is that when it come to the sales offices, if we can get back to you with specific dates when things opened, we will. But bear in mind that when a sales office opens, it doesn't add -- it doesn't open initially at 100% capacity. I know I visited our New York sales office shortly after it opened and we had kind of a minimal staff there and we've been staffing up and continue to grow. And so they do ramp up a little bit. So that will happen during 2016 and into 2017."

It's -- some of it you've heard or seen, which is we brought our tremendous yield management skill set from RCI and transported it in to the rental business in Europe. And we're seeing results from that yield management capability, which is the first time a European rental business has had that kind of skill set. And various other technology things, for the most part, that RCI has brought to the table and is kind of put into the rental business. In addition, we see an opportunity to do more cross-selling of people who are currently doing rentals of cottages to possibly renting timeshare and then maybe deciding that they want to buy timeshare at some point. So we think there is real opportunity there. And so by giving this team as one family within Destination Network, we think we can drive more of that across the enterprise."

And so we are in constant touch with investors. I think one of the strategies that we've employed is constant marketing and discussions with interested investors. And it's from this constant source of intelligence that we remain very optimistic. The base rate is lower on the pricing of these types of notes. Spreads have widened a tidy bit, but we think rates will be comparable to they were last year. And so we feel -- actually, we feel very good that because of this constant marketing and because of the performance of our businesses that we'll be able to get through 2016 very comfortably, and that's kind of reflected in our targets for the year. You'd mentioned something about interest rate increase and whether that had any effect on pricing, on our securitizations, and the answer is, none that was discernable to us. And so, at least in this part of our business, we remain quite confident in the stability of trends as we go forward. And I'll just add one more thing. We've been at the securitization business for a long time. Investors know us. They've experienced the performance of our businesses through the tumultuous period of 29 -- 2009 and 2010. And I think they remain very confident in the program that we have out there. And if there's any stress in the market, I think we're going to maintain ourselves nicely, although we don't detect any stress from the market currently at all."

Chris, on free cash flow cadence, I think the only thing that will be somewhat extraordinary will be -- we know, we're going to build up our receivables balance a bit as we increase lending to creditworthy buyers of timeshare. I would expect that cash earnings will improve this year. CapEx is going to come in a little wider than it did last year. Product will be -- product investment will be in the ballpark of what we spent last year, and working capital will be a net positive. So I would say that if you were to look at the components of free cash flow, we're maintaining the $800 million neighborhood target because we are going to fund this increased lending to timeshare buyers. So I would say that that's how I see the free cash flow environment for 2016. As it relates to debt issuance, Steve and I believe, as others do in our company, that we're at the optimal point of leverage. We are at the lowest grade -- the lowest form of investment grade. We believe that's where we should be given the business composition that we have and the free cash flow dynamics of our business. We do not intend to change that unless something extraordinary and compelling comes up that we believe will lead to an expansion of the business over time. But that would have to be quite an extraordinary opportunity. So I think at this point, we're certainly comfortable where we are and don't expect that will change anytime soon."

The question about consumer confidence, and I think we've mentioned it before, we don't see a lot of correlation between consumer confidence in the timeshare business. The timeshare business, it's a sold good, it's not a sought good. It really depends on how good our marketing and sales efforts are. That's what drives that business. So if you go back to 2007, '08, '09 and you take out the fact that we took our sales down because we didn't know what the ADS market will look like, all of the metrics around our sales effort in timeshare were terrific. VPG was up. We were controlling tours perfectly. We repositioned that business. I need to tell you, it was one of the great repositioning of a business I've seen and it would -- made the business actually stronger. So we didn't see -- we did not see a lack of people interested in buying. What we saw was -- but what we saw was our marketing efforts were bringing in buyers who probably were more prone to buy because people traveling at that time when travel was down a bit were the more dedicated travelers, more inclined to buy. So we actually exceeded sales during that time. So -- and that's true of our rental businesses as well, we did extremely well. So we have a model that is extremely resilient. So do we look at consumer confidence, do we look at trends, yes. Do we look at the fact that the gas is down and whenever gas prices are up, people say, oh my gosh, people won't be going in their cars to go rent hotel rooms now. Well, that doesn't happen. And likewise, when prices are down it doesn't mean that they necessarily get in their car more to drive around. But they do have more disposable income in their pocket. And I've seen several reports that have shown that a large percentage of the additional dollars people have, now that gas prices are down, is going into travel and entertainment. So we feel we're extremely well-positioned and all of our tracking is looking very positive."

And we are not seeing any impact from the Zika virus. We don't have a huge presence in Latin America. We have a good presence, but not a huge presence. So we have not seen any change there. As for travelers coming into the U.S., there was a little bit of a downturn in Brazilian travelers to Florida. They flow into Miami and Orlando in large numbers and we do a lot of marketing to them. We have a Portuguese sales line in Orlando. But it didn't -- again, it wasn't large enough to have impacted the business at all. So we don't think that the travel patterns are changing. As for the oil-producing markets, where the fracking has been occurring in the U.S. is definitely down. As Tom said, I think it's down to 27% RevPAR in those particular markets. So they have been hit very, very hard. I never thought I would say that oil-producing markets in the U.S. would have an impact on our results, but they -- frankly, they have. And so we highlighted that and pointed that out to you. As to the -- you asked about the age of the buyers of timeshare, it has trended down. It's gotten younger over the last several years. I think right now the audit report says that the average timeshare buyer is 51 years old, but that's the owner. So the buyer is probably younger than that. It's probably -- I think it's in the early 40s and actually I have been looking at some of this, this is 39 years old. And so they are younger. The Gen Xers are attracted to timeshare. The average household income is up fairly significantly. I remember when it used to be $80,000. It's up to like $95,000 now. So yes, there is a younger, more affluent person buying timeshare than there was historically."

          Thanks, Margo. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. As you saw from the release, we posted a strong close to a great year. Looking forward, we're excited about what lies ahead in 2016, which we believe will be a great year for leisure travel. 
With the wide range of places to stay, Wyndham Worldwide is uniquely positioned to welcome people to travel the way they want and where they want.
This gives us great confidence in our prospects and is reflected in our board's decision to raise our quarterly dividend by 19% and increase our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion.
Tom will focus on fourth quarter results. But first, let me summarize the year which was terrific from both an operational and a financial perspective.
On a constant currency basis and excluding acquisitions and the divestiture, we grew revenues 6% and adjusted EBITDA 8% in 2015. 
On the same basis, adjusted EPS grew 17%, reflecting strong operating performance across the company supported by our share repurchase program.
Wyndham Hotel Group achieved 11% adjusted EBITDA growth on a constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions and including the increased license fee paid by Wyndham Vacation Ownership or 7% excluding the fee. 
We successfully acquired an integrated dolce, which significantly enhanced our presence in the managed hotel space and is performing better than our expectations. We also developed and launched a new cloud-based strategy for our property management and central reservation systems. 
Finally, we introduced the Wyndham Wizard to millions of consumers and made great progress on our new award-winning Wyndham Rewards loyalty program. 
Wyndham Rewards is one of the threads that weave Wyndham Worldwide together, driving a powerful marketing and value proposition to consumers across our travel brands.
The newly named Wyndham Destination Network, formerly known as Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, grew adjusted EBITDA 6% on a constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions and a divestiture.
We are moving to a more expansive vision of the business, which combine offerings from our Vacation Rental and timeshare exchange brands to enable our Wyndham -- our worldwide customer base to experience the vacation of their dreams. 
With rising awareness of the sharing economy and increasing consumer demand for unique places to stay, we believe this new strategy will drive higher customer engagement and higher growth in the years to come.
Our portfolio of managed Vacation Rental brands posted great results in 2015. While some of our largest European Vacation Rental competitors had declines in vacation volume in 2015, all our brands, both in Europe and the U.S., posted transaction increases, enabling us to achieve transaction growth on an organic basis of 7%. And RCI also had a strong year, netting 66,000 to their average member count.
Wyndham Vacation Ownership had a great year with gross of timeshares sales up 5% in constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA was up 6% in constant currency and including the additional license fee paid to Wyndham Hotel Group or 8% excluding that fee.
With a focus on the next generation of timeshare owners, we improved our sales process to enhance customer engagement and drive future growth.
We opened 6 new sales centers to expand our reach for new owners, and changes to our underwriting standards continue to benefit EBITDA through lower loan losses, while innovative methods for sourcing inventory reduced our cost of goods sold.
So with all those 2015 achievements behind us, let's talk in more detail about some of the initiatives that will fuel our growth in the coming years. I'll begin with Wyndham Hotel Group. 
We expect to drive growth through a renewed focus on improving the quality of our brands, redefining what technology means for economy and midscale hotels and continuing to differentiate with our Wyndham Rewards loyalty program. Our goals are to increase our value proposition to both our hotel owners and guests and to drive higher contribution across the portfolio.
The migration of our central reservation and property management systems are on schedule and we are -- and are being well received by owners and franchisees alike. The new cloud-based Property Management System with automated revenue management capabilities is now running in over 200 of our North American hotels. 
By the end of the year, we expect to have transitioned over 3,000 hotels to the new system, which is being operated and maintained and will be enhanced in the years ahead by technology leader -- leaders such as SABRE and Infor.
In addition, we successfully transition the Trip by Wyndham brand to our new Sabre-enabled central reservation system and we're already seeing a lift in our reservation contribution for the Trip brand even during the short time the new system has been in place.
We're looking forward to rolling it out to our Wyndham brand later this year and the remaining brands through 2017.
Last quarter, I was pleased to announce that U.S. News and World Report named Wyndham Rewards one of the top loyalty programs in the hotel industry, jumping from seventh to second place. 
More recently, our Wyndham Rewards program received 2 best-in-show Platinum awards from Loyalty 360, a well-known loyalty marketing association with members from across a wide range of industries. These accolades are a reflection of the innovative and dedicated work of our team which has created a program that is less complex and more rewarding than any other.  And our franchisees have never been more engaged with property direct enrollments up over 30% since program launch. 
Our recently introduced Go Fast program, where consumers use points plus cash for a stay, has been a great success with over 300,000 room nights booked through the program last year.
We expect Wyndham Rewards members to drive over  [indiscernible] this year, delivering guests who stay more often and stay longer than nonmembers. 
Now turning to Wyndham Destination Network. As discussed on last quarter's call, we changed the name from Wyndham Exchange and Rentals to reflect our standing as the world's largest provider of professionally-managed unique vacation accommodations. Anything from cottages to castles to timeshare resorts. 
We continue to see momentum in our rental brands with strength in our core customer source markets, which are the U.K., Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany and the U.S. 
Despite new entrants into the rental market, we've seen little impact in the competitive landscape. 
With the strength of our brands and the depth and breadth of our offerings, we provide a great value proposition to both homeowners and travelers. These attributes enable us to be largely insulated from economic as well as geopolitical risks and produce reliable, consistent results.
Last year, we bolstered our strong proprietary distribution network through global partnerships with online portals, such as HomeAway and Booking.com. We'll continue to pursue this strategy in 2016. 
We have local presence and global leverage, which provide greats -- provides strong advantages compared with the for-rent-by-owner option in the same channels. 
Providing the widest distribution for our property owners has been a primary strategy for the Wyndham destination network and it's working. 
For example, Novasol, our Danish brand, now sources renters from over 80 countries, that's up from 50 countries just 18 months ago.
Now let's look at RCI. This brand continues to perform well, driven by a long tradition of innovation.  Over the past few years, we've introduced enhanced membership options and several new products that add convenience and flexibility to RCI membership.  Last year, we launched additional new products that strengthen our members ability to enhance their trading options. All told, the products we've introduced since 2010 added approximately $50 million to annual revenues in 2015.  We're working on the next generation of RCI.com and look forward to updating you on our plans in the near future.  Of course, we continue to expand our global network at RCI. For example, RCI recently added a new flagship affiliation with Tokyu Corporation in Japan, adding 5 great resorts in popular Japanese destinations.  RCI is, by far, the biggest timeshare exchange brand in the world, and its international footprint is clearly a distinguishing strength. With over 4,000 resorts worldwide to choose from, RCI provides tremendous value to its members and we expect to further expand our network in 2016.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which had another outstanding year with strong VOI sales growth.  Last quarter, we discussed how all indications are pointing to strong long-term trends in the U.S. leisure travel market from millennials to boomers. We also highlighted our efforts to set the stage for increased sales by opening new sales centers in New York City, St. Thomas, Puerto Rico, Southern California, Colorado and Las Vegas, along with new affiliation agreements.  We're pleased with the early progress and performance of these initiatives and have recently taken additional organizational steps to best position our Vacation Ownership business for future expansion. 
Our goal is to drive consistent and profitable sales -- sales growth with tighter, more focused operating regions.  We believe this focus will help us intensify the process we started a couple of years ago to evolve timeshare sales and marketing to ensure a customer-friendly buying experience and to drive future growth.
Let me remind you of the primary initiatives, most of which we previously discussed. First, we introduced and refined a group presentation sales format for new and existing owners, ensuring that our best salespeople are in front of our customers using a proven, uniform method of telling a consistent story and producing sales.
Second, for owners who have benefited from our product for many years but are no longer actively using it, we designed a suite of programs to enable them to gracefully exit their ownership. We broadly call this program Ovation by Wyndham. It is how we applaud owners who have experienced years of great travel memories, but whose needs and circumstances have changed.
Finally, we improved the buying experience for consumers. We implemented enhanced sales training and compliance programs, and we bolstered our quality assurance regime on the contracting and close process, which now includes videotaping. We're also streamlining our documentation process to make it more transparent and easier to understand for the consumer. We are piloting a program to bring greater clarity to the sale by providing contractual documents and program information in a digital format on a preloaded tablet.
We give buyers the tablet rather than a thick owners kit, enabling them to enjoy easier access to important materials regarding their purchase and use of our products.  We made great progress in these initiatives over the past 2 years and will continue our focus in the future.  With our new sales centers, strong affiliation agreements and enhanced sales and marketing operations, we're looking forward to generating substantial long-term sales growth within our Vacation Ownership business.  The opportunities in timeshare, a business with strong economics, are robust.  To capture these opportunities, we're targeting 35,000 new owners in 2016, about a 15% increase over 2015. So 35,000 in 2016.  We expect to achieve these through increased tours, primarily from new marketing alliances and the new sales office as we've opened in the past 16 to 18 months.  We will also slightly increase financing to creditworthy new buyers through lower down payment requirements. We look forward to updating you on our progress.
Before turning over the call to Tom, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook. 
Stock market volatility aside, the operating dynamics we see across this company looks strong for 2016. The geographic and demographic diversity of our offerings, the resiliency of our fee-for-service revenue streams, the scalability of our businesses and our proven track record of strong execution provide a stable base from which to grow. It's a powerful combination.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom to walk through the fourth quarter and what we expect in detail in 2016. Tom?"

          Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. 
As Steve noted, 2015 was very good year for Wyndham Worldwide despite the fact that foreign exchange negatively affected year-over-year adjusted EBITDA by $46 million and created significant headwinds throughout the year. 
Absent the foreign exchange effect on EBITDA, we would've ended the year at the top of our long-term guidance range.  
We also enjoyed a strong fourth quarter. On a currency-neutral basis and excluding acquisitions and a divestiture, revenue increased 6% and adjusted EBITDA increased 8%. 
We also enjoyed a very strong year in cash flow generation. Free cash flow for 2015 was $769 million compared with $749 million for the 12 months of 2014. This was within our neighborhood target range of $800 million.  Remember that foreign exchange reduced free cash flow in 2015 by approximately $43 million. So on a constant currency basis, free cash flow in 2015 was $812 million, an 8% increase over 2014, growing in line with currency-neutral adjusted EBITDA. The increase reflects stronger operating results and lower capital expenditures.
In addition, you might recall from last quarter's call that we sold land and work in progress in a WAAM just-in-time transaction for $65 million in cash.  So while not technically a part of the definition of free cash flow, it did add to overall cash flow for the company and was available to support our capital allocation decisions. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for $165 million. And over the course of the year, we repurchased 7.9 million shares for $650 million, reducing our full year weighted average share count by over 6%.
In addition, we've repurchased 1.6 million shares for $107 million so far in 2016.
Now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units. 
Our Hotel Group had a strong fourth quarter capping off a terrific year. On an apples to apples basis, which excludes the effect of currency, the increased in our segment licensing fee that hotel receives from Wyndham Vacation Ownership and the Dolce acquisition, fourth quarter revenues increased 6% and adjusted EBITDA increased 10%.
Results reflect an increase in royalty and hotel management fees as well as growth in our Wyndham Rewards credit card program. 
Same-store domestic RevPAR increased 4.4%, reflecting the ability of our owners to increase room rates as hotel occupancy was relatively flat.  We achieved this growth despite continued pressure on our RevPAR growth in the oil-producing markets, which, as defined by STR, mainly includes parts of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and West Virginia.  To put this into perspective, RevPAR in the non-oil-producing markets grew 7.5% whereas RevPAR in the oil-producing markets was down 27.9%.
We were especially pleased with the performance of our managed portfolio, where domestic same-store RevPAR was up 7% from the prior year. The performance of our FelCor upper upscale Wyndham portfolio was particularly strong, with a 9% increase in RevPAR year-over-year.
Systemwide RevPAR was flat in constant currency, largely due to the continued unit growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China.  Excluding China and in constant currency, global RevPAR was up 1.6%, which includes a 240 basis point unfavorable impact from domestic and Canadian oil markets.
Overall, net system size grew 2.6%. For the year, gross room openings of nearly 66,000 were offset by over 48,000 terminations, most of which we consider to be substandard. The result is continually improving system quality.  
Our development pipeline is over 119,000 rooms, a 2.2% increase over the prior year.
Our Destination Network segment continue to perform well. Note that adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2014 included a $6 million operating loss from Canvas Holidays, a U.K.-based camping brand that we sold late in 2014.  On a currency-neutral basis and excluding acquisitions and the Canvas Holiday's divestiture, revenues increased 5% and adjusted EBITDA increased 9%.
Results reflect growth in our portfolio of brands, particularly at our RCI and Denmark-based Novasol brands. 
EBITDA also benefited from the receipt of settlements of business disruption claims related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010. 
At RCI, exchange revenues increased 1% in constant currency. The average number of members increased 0.7%, attributable to continued new member growth in the Americas.  Exchange revenue per member was flat as pricing increases offset the growth in lower transacting club members. 
Vacation Rentals revenue for the quarter was up 8% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions in the Canvas divestiture. That increase reflects an 8.1% increase in transaction volume and flat average net price per rental.
Transaction growth occurred in all significant brands and regions. Both pricing and transaction volume were aided by our dynamic pricing initiatives.
Fourth quarter results for our Vacation Ownership business were also solid with revenues up 7% and adjusted EBITDA up 5% in constant currency and excluding a $4 million increase in the licensing fee rate paid to the Hotel Group. 
Reflecting our emphasis on sales growth, gross VOI sales were up 9% in constant currency in the fourth quarter of 2015. That growth reflected a 3.4% increase in VPG and a 4.7% increase in tour flow. 
VPG benefited from higher transaction sizes and tour flow increased primarily due to the new sales centers that Steve mentioned earlier.
The performance of the consumer loan portfolio remained solid. The provision for loan loss was $64 million compared to $60 million in the fourth quarter of last year -- excuse me, of 2014, primarily reflecting higher sales volumes in the quarter.  For the full year, the provision for loan loss was right in line with writeoffs. And writeoffs were approximately 2% in the fourth quarter and approximately 7.5% for the full year, reasonably consistent with the results in the same periods of 2014.
Company-wide, net interest expense increased by $10 million in the fourth quarter over the same period in 2014, reflecting the $350 million, 5.1% bonds issued in September and the absence of the fixed-to-floating interest rate swap that we unwound during the second quarter of 2015.
Now let's turn to our 2016 outlook and guidance. As a reminder, we're going to post full guidance details to our Investor Relations website following the call. 
Revenue guidance for 2016 is $5.8 billion to $5,950,000,000. Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2016 is $1,375,000,000 to $1,400,000,000.  As usual, we're most comfortable with the midpoint of these ranges.
Today's guidance is based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2015, which reflects $10 million of an adverse impact on our 2016 EBITDA assumptions.
While the calculated EBITDA growth range for 2016 is 6% to 8%, please take note that in constant currency, we're expecting 2016 EBITDA growth of 7% to 9%.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2016 is $5.46 to $5.60. We expect a diluted share count of 116 million shares, which per our standard guidance practice, assumes no share buybacks in 2016.
Now let's take a quick look at guidance for each of our business units. Starting with the Hotel Group, we expect another strong year. We expect revenues of $1,355,000,000 to $1,390,000,000.  We expect room growth of 2% to 4% and global RevPAR growth of flat to up 2% or 1% to 3% in constant currency, which does incorporate 3% to 5% domestic RevPAR growth. 
Note that our January RevPAR was directionally in line with industry reports and we expect RevPAR to be below our annual guidance range in the first quarter, reflecting the Easter holiday shift and a strong first quarter 2015 comparison.  We expect Hotel Group adjusted EBITDA will be $397 million to $407 million.
At Destination Network, we expect revenues of $1,570,000,000 to $1,615,000,000 and adjusted EBITDA of $378 million to $388 million.  We expect the average number of exchange members to be flat to up 2% and exchange revenue per member to be flat or up 1% to 3% in constant currency.
We expect Vacation Rental transactions to grow 5% to 7% and average net price per rental to decline 1% to 3%, primarily reflecting foreign exchange.
For Vacation Ownership, we expect revenues of $2.9 billion to $2,980,000,000 and adjusted EBITDA of $728 million to $754 million.
Our key metric, gross VOI sales is expected to grow 5% to 7%, reflecting tour growth of 3% to 5% and flat to plus 2% VPG growth. 
As Steve noted earlier, we intend to increase our new owner target this year, which will have a dampening effect on VPG. This will be more than offset by higher tours. 
Company-wide, we expect corporate expenses of $135 million to $140 million consistent with 2015. We expect depreciation and amortization to be $245 million to $250 million as additional capital projects come online.
We expect interest expense of $131 million to $133 million, which assumes no new debt issuances in 2016.  Interest expense is higher than 2015 primarily due to the $350 million 5.1% bond we issued last September and the elimination of the fixed-to-floating rate swap that was in place for 5 months in 2015.
Now we'll be considering ways throughout the year to reduce interest expense further.
We expect a modestly higher rate of securitization activity in 2016, but rates will be comparable. The market appears to be strong and while spreads may be widening a bit, benchmarks are lower.
Our neighborhood target for 2016 free cash flow remains $800 million. 
As Steve discussed earlier, we expect to increase financing to creditworthy consumers to drive new owner growth, which will have an adverse short-term impact on cash, but which we believe, is a great investment in the business. 
Also as always, keep in mind that there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or any given year. So we view $800 million as a neighborhood target rather than an exact figure.
Our business produces abundant free cash flow, roughly $7 a share this year, which represents compounded growth rate of 13% since 2010. 
Our capital allocation philosophies is to invest in the business and then return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. 
Absent M&A opportunities, you can expect we'll return at least $600 million to shareholders this year through share repurchases. 
In addition, based on the board's decision to increase our annual dividend to $2 per share, we will return another $230 million to shareholders through dividend payments.
Now turning to the first quarter. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.08 to $1.11. And remember that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance.
To close, we are very pleased with our performance in 2015 and are looking forward to a very strong 2016. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve. Steve?"

          Yes, the pipeline is, as we've said in the past, Joe, is not a critically important thing for us. It's probably less important than other hotel related companies because our -- the lot of the additions we make are new -- are conversion. And conversions tend to flip very quickly, so it may not even appear on the pipeline. The pipeline is really -- mostly made of properties that are new construction. There were some international conversions that were brought in, that are on there, they take a little bit longer to come in the domestic conversions. But it's a mix. I don't think there's anything really meaningful to be read into that change or difference.
          The only other thing I would add, Joe, is that when it come to the sales offices, if we can get back to you with specific dates when things opened, we will. But bear in mind that when a sales office opens, it doesn't add -- it doesn't open initially at 100% capacity. I know I visited our New York sales office shortly after it opened and we had kind of a minimal staff there and we've been staffing up and continue to grow. And so they do ramp up a little bit. So that will happen during 2016 and into 2017."

          Two questions. First, on the Vacation Rental business, which was very, very strong this quarter, you sort of alluded to it, but how much of the volume was essentially same-store versus maybe some acquisitions? In fact, I think you said some part of your business actually left. So what I want to understand is, is this same-store volume increases? Is it also consolidation? Are you starting to acquire some of these vacation businesses and that's starting to gain momentum? And is that the rationale for the name change to Destination Network, meaning, are we going to see more and more from that, both on the consolidation and on the marketing front? And then, more on the numbers side. The securitization market, as you noted, continues to be robust. Can you just give us a little bit more color on that? And also, the first rate increase that we saw from the Fed, did it had to have any impact on propensity for financing or any issues on spread? I just want to understand how that's going to roll out, if, in fact, we start to see rate increases."

Yes, and that's because it really didn't fit our model as well. It was more of a camping business versus a cottage rental business. So we sold it to somebody who's more focused on that particular sector of the market. The change for Destination Network is really all about getting more out of the businesses that we already have in the family there. It's -- some of it you've heard or seen, which is we brought our tremendous yield management skill set from RCI and transported it in to the rental business in Europe. And we're seeing results from that yield management capability, which is the first time a European rental business has had that kind of skill set. And various other technology things, for the most part, that RCI has brought to the table and is kind of put into the rental business. In addition, we see an opportunity to do more cross-selling of people who are currently doing rentals of cottages to possibly renting timeshare and then maybe deciding that they want to buy timeshare at some point. So we think there is real opportunity there. And so by giving this team as one family within Destination Network, we think we can drive more of that across the enterprise."

          Steve, I think your third question, if I recall the sequencing right was around securitization. And so we are in constant touch with investors. I think one of the strategies that we've employed is constant marketing and discussions with interested investors. And it's from this constant source of intelligence that we remain very optimistic. The base rate is lower on the pricing of these types of notes. Spreads have widened a tidy bit, but we think rates will be comparable to they were last year. And so we feel -- actually, we feel very good that because of this constant marketing and because of the performance of our businesses that we'll be able to get through 2016 very comfortably, and that's kind of reflected in our targets for the year. You'd mentioned something about interest rate increase and whether that had any effect on pricing, on our securitizations, and the answer is, none that were discernable to us. And so, at least in this part of our business, we remain quite confident in the stability of trends as we go forward. And I'll just add one more thing. We've been at the securitization business for a long time. Investors know us. They've experienced the performance of our businesses through the tumultuous period of 29 -- 2009 and 2010. And I think they remain very confident in the program that we have out there. And if there's any stress in the market, I think we're going to maintain ourselves nicely, although we don't detect any stress from the market currently at all."

And so we will do transactions if they make sense and we do look at everything. So I wouldn't say we won't do anything in timeshare. But our focus tends to be more heavily on rental and hotel. And the reason for that is the synergies that we can bring to bear on a hotel transaction or a rental transaction are greater. And therefore, we can bring more value as an industry player probably than we can on the timeshare side."

          No problem, Chris. Chris, on free cash flow cadence, I think the only thing that will be somewhat extraordinary will be -- we know, we're going to build up our receivables balance a bit as we increase lending to creditworthy buyers of timeshare. I would expect that cash earnings will improve this year. CapEx is going to come in a little wider than it did last year. Product will be -- product investment will be in the ballpark of what we spent last year, and working capital will be a net positive. So I would say that if you were to look at the components of free cash flow, we're maintaining the $800 million neighborhood target because we are going to fund this increased lending to timeshare buyers. So I would say that that's how I see the free cash flow environment for 2016. As it relates to debt issuance, Steve and I believe, as others do in our company, that we're at the optimal point of leverage. We are at the lowest grade -- the lowest rung of investment grade. We believe that's where we should be given the business composition that we have and the free cash flow dynamics of our business. We do not intend to change that unless something extraordinary and compelling comes up that we believe will lead to an expansion of the business over time. But that would have to be quite an extraordinary opportunity. So I think at this point, we're certainly comfortable where we are and don't expect that will change anytime soon."

And new owners tend to run on slightly lower VPG, then upgrade sales. So it's just a -- it's almost a mix function more than anything else. Not a sign of weakness at all. In fact, a sign of strength because we see the opportunity exists to be able to go out and bring in more new owners to our system. Now these new owners to our system become upgrade owners in the next year, 3 years, 5 years."

          Got it. And if I can ask a question about the hotel business. Again taking all the information in total with a bit more focus or at least as the pipeline reflects on international, I think, Tom, you made some reference to hotels exiting the system that were sub-quality. As we look at the whole hotel landscape, we see brands investing in repositioning themselves. We see some new entrants in the price-driven segments of the market. Any thoughts at all about looking at the brands that you have and repositioning some of those in a more assertive way than what you've done so far and basically how you're thinking about that issue?"

          Well, we constantly, David, are looking at our brands. And part of the big push that we have going on is to increase the quality of those brands. So Tom referred to the substandard properties that we're kicking out. The other side of it is that the units that we're adding generally have a higher quality score, TripAdvisor score, our QA scores, than the average. So the idea is to increase the overall quality. Do I see us taking Days Inn from being a solid or superlative solid monster economy brand and moving it up to midscale? No. But we do see some terrific growth in our midscale and upper -- upscale properties of Wyndham's and Wyngates' and Wyndham Garden. So we are seeing growth in those areas. But I don't see us taking one of our economy brands and trying to reposition it to the select midscale, if that was your question."

We're probably going to have, in 2016 and 2017, a fairly significant kind of rollout of some of those prototypes, but I wouldn't consider it a repositioning like Holiday Inn did. I think they did a terrific job of resetting their brand, one of the best I've seen. So they did a great job for a very, very large brand and I applaud them on it. But I don't think that we're going to go through that type of a massive change. We're trying to make more of an evolutionary change versus a revolutionary change."

There's an awful lot of concern about the consumer confidence and consumer spending beginning to tip over. If you go back to 2007 and 2008, what are the indicators that softened first or what are the data points in your -- mainly in your timeshare business that softened first? And it was encouraging -- your comments were encouraging about you have expectations for a great year in leisure travel. But if you could give us some perspective on -- if there were to be some softness, where would that likely manifest itself? And are you not seeing any at this point?"

          Well, thanks, Harry. The question about consumer confidence, and I think we've mentioned it before, we don't see a lot of correlation between consumer confidence in the timeshare business. The timeshare business, it's a sold good, it's not a sought good. It really depends on how good our marketing and sales efforts are. That's what drives that business. So if you go back to 2007, '08, '09 and you take out the fact that we took our sales down because we didn't know what the ADS market will look like, all of the metrics around our sales effort in timeshare were terrific. VPG was up. We were controlling tours perfectly. We repositioned that business. I need to tell you, it was one of the great repositioning of a business I've seen and it would -- made the business actually stronger. So we didn't see -- we did not see a lack of people interested in buying. What we saw was -- but what we saw was our marketing efforts were bringing in buyers who probably were more prone to buy because people traveling at that time when travel was down a bit were the more dedicated travelers, more inclined to buy. So we actually exceeded sales during that time. So -- and that's true of our rental businesses as well, we did extremely well. So we have a model that is extremely resilient. So do we look at consumer confidence, do we look at trends, yes. Do we look at the fact that the gas is down and whenever gas prices are up, people say, oh my gosh, people won't be going in their cars to go rent hotel rooms now. Well, that doesn't happen. And likewise, when prices are down it doesn't mean that they necessarily get in their car more to drive around. But they do have more disposable income in their pocket. And I've seen several reports that have shown that a large percentage of the additional dollars people have, now that gas prices are down, is going into travel and entertainment. So we feel we're extremely well-positioned and all of our tracking is looking very positive."

          Okay. There was a lot in that last question, which I'll tackle first. And we are not seeing any impact from the Zika virus. We don't have a huge presence in Latin America. We have a good presence, but not a huge presence. So we have not seen any change there. As for travelers coming into the U.S., there was a little bit of a downturn in Brazilian travelers to Florida. They flow into Miami and Orlando in large numbers and we do a lot of marketing to them. We have a Portuguese sales line in Orlando. But it didn't -- again, it wasn't large enough to have impacted the business at all. So we don't think that the travel patterns are changing. As for the oil-producing markets, where the fracking has been occurring in the U.S. is definitely down. As Tom said, I think it's down to 27% RevPAR in those particular markets. So they have been hit very, very hard. I never thought I would say that oil-producing markets in the U.S. would have an impact on our results, but they -- frankly, they have. And so we highlighted that and pointed that out to you. As to the -- you asked about the age of the buyers of timeshare, it has trended down. It's gotten younger over the last several years. I think right now the audit report says that the average timeshare buyer is 51 years old, but that's the owner. So the buyer is probably younger than that. It's probably -- I think it's in the early 40s and actually I'm looking at something here that says 39 years old. And so they are younger. The Gen Xers are attracted to timeshare. The average household income is up fairly significantly. I remember when it used to be $80,000. It's up to like $95,000 now. So yes, there is a younger, more affluent person buying timeshare than there was historically."

With the wide range of places to stay, Wyndham Worldwide is uniquely positioned to welcome people to travel the way they want and where they want.
This gives us great confidence in our prospects and is reflected in our board's decision to raise our quarterly dividend by 19% and increase our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion.
Tom will focus on fourth quarter results. But first, let me summarize the year which was terrific from both an operational and a financial perspective.
On a constant currency basis and excluding acquisitions and the divestiture, we grew revenues 6% and adjusted EBITDA 8% in 2015. 
On the same basis, adjusted EPS grew 17%, reflecting strong operating performance across the company supported by our share repurchase program.
Wyndham Hotel Group achieved 11% adjusted EBITDA growth on a constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions and including the increased license fee paid by Wyndham Vacation Ownership or 7% excluding the fee. 
We successfully acquired an integrated dolce, which significantly enhanced our presence in the managed hotel space and is performing better than our expectations. We also developed and launched a new cloud-based strategy for our property management and central reservation systems. 
Finally, we introduced the Wyndham Wizard to millions of consumers and made great progress on our new award-winning Wyndham Rewards loyalty program. 
Wyndham Rewards is one of the threads that weave Wyndham Worldwide together, driving a powerful marketing and value proposition to consumers across our travel brands.
The newly named Wyndham Destination Network, formerly known as Wyndham Exchange and Rentals, grew adjusted EBITDA 6% on a constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions and a divestiture.
We are moving to a more expansive vision of the business, which combine offerings from our Vacation Rental and timeshare exchange brands to enable our Wyndham -- our worldwide customer base to experience the vacation of their dreams. 
With rising awareness of the sharing economy and increasing consumer demand for unique places to stay, we believe this new strategy will drive higher customer engagement and higher growth in the years to come.
Our portfolio of managed Vacation Rental brands posted great results in 2015. While some of our largest European Vacation Rental competitors had declines in vacation volume in 2015, all our brands, both in Europe and the U.S., posted transaction increases, enabling us to achieve transaction growth on an organic basis of 7%. And RCI also had a strong year, netting 66,000 to their average member count.
Wyndham Vacation Ownership had a great year with gross of timeshares sales up 5% in constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA was up 6% in constant currency and including the additional license fee paid to Wyndham Hotel Group or 8% excluding that fee.
With a focus on the next generation of timeshare owners, we improved our sales process to enhance customer engagement and drive future growth.
We opened 6 new sales centers to expand our reach for new owners, and changes to our underwriting standards continue to benefit EBITDA through lower loan losses, while innovative methods for sourcing inventory reduced our cost of goods sold.
So with all those 2015 achievements behind us, let's talk in more detail about some of the initiatives that will fuel our growth in the coming years. I'll begin with Wyndham Hotel Group. 
We expect to drive growth through a renewed focus on improving the quality of our brands, redefining what technology means for economy and midscale hotels and continuing to differentiate with our Wyndham Rewards loyalty program. Our goals are to increase our value proposition to both our hotel owners and guests and to drive higher contribution across the portfolio.
The migration of our central reservation and property management systems are on schedule and we are -- and are being well received by owners and franchisees alike. The new cloud-based Property Management System with automated revenue management capabilities is now running in over 200 of our North American hotels. 
By the end of the year, we expect to have transitioned over 3,000 hotels to the new system, which is being operated and maintained and will be enhanced in the years ahead by technology leader -- leaders such as SABRE and Infor.
In addition, we successfully transition the Trip by Wyndham brand to our new Sabre-enabled central reservation system and we're already seeing a lift in our reservation contribution for the Trip brand even during the short time the new system has been in place.
We're looking forward to rolling it out to our Wyndham brand later this year and the remaining brands through 2017.
Last quarter, I was pleased to announce that U.S. News and World Report named Wyndham Rewards one of the top loyalty programs in the hotel industry, jumping from seventh to second place. 
More recently, our Wyndham Rewards program received 2 best-in-show Platinum awards from Loyalty 360, a well-known loyalty marketing association with members from across a wide range of industries. These accolades are a reflection of the innovative and dedicated work of our team which has created a program that is less complex and more rewarding than any other.  And our franchisees have never been more engaged with property direct enrollments up over 30% since program launch. 
Our recently introduced Go Fast program, where consumers use points plus cash for a stay, has been a great success with over 300,000 room nights booked through the program last year.
We expect Wyndham Rewards members to drive over  [indiscernible] this year, delivering guests who stay more often and stay longer than nonmembers. 
Now turning to Wyndham Destination Network. As discussed on last quarter's call, we changed the name from Wyndham Exchange and Rentals to reflect our standing as the world's largest provider of professionally-managed unique vacation accommodations. Anything from cottages to castles to timeshare resorts. 
We continue to see momentum in our rental brands with strength in our core customer source markets, which are the U.K., Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany and the U.S. 
Despite new entrants into the rental market, we've seen little impact in the competitive landscape. 
With the strength of our brands and the depth and breadth of our offerings, we provide a great value proposition to both homeowners and travelers. These attributes enable us to be largely insulated from economic as well as geopolitical risks and produce reliable, consistent results.
Last year, we bolstered our strong proprietary distribution network through global partnerships with online portals, such as HomeAway and Booking.com. We'll continue to pursue this strategy in 2016. 
We have local presence and global leverage, which provide greats -- provides strong advantages compared with the for-rent-by-owner  option in the same channels. 
Providing the widest distribution for our property owners has been a primary strategy for the Wyndham destination network and it's working. 
For example, Novasol, our Danish brand, now sources renters from over 80 countries, that's up from 50 countries just 18 months ago.
Now let's look at RCI. This brand continues to perform well, driven by a long tradition of innovation.  Over the past few years, we've introduced enhanced membership options and several new products that add convenience and flexibility to RCI membership.  Last year, we launched additional new products that strengthen our members’ ability to enhance their trading options. All told, the products we've introduced since 2010 added approximately $50 million to annual revenues in 2015.  We're working on the next generation of RCI.com and look forward to updating you on our plans in the near future.  Of course, we continue to expand our global network at RCI. For example, RCI recently added a new flagship affiliation with Tokyu Corporation in Japan, adding 5 great resorts in popular Japanese destinations.  RCI is, by far, the biggest timeshare exchange brand in the world, and its international footprint is clearly a distinguishing strength. With over 4,000 resorts worldwide to choose from, RCI provides tremendous value to its members and we expect to further expand our network in 2016.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which had another outstanding year with strong VOI sales growth.  Last quarter, we discussed how all indications are pointing to strong long-term trends in the U.S. leisure travel market from millennials to boomers. We also highlighted our efforts to set the stage for increased sales by opening new sales centers in New York City, St. Thomas, Puerto Rico, Southern California, Colorado and Las Vegas, along with new affiliation agreements.  We're pleased with the early progress and performance of these initiatives and have recently taken additional organizational steps to best position our Vacation Ownership business for future expansion. 
Our goal is to drive consistent and profitable sales -- sales growth with tighter, more focused operating regions.  We believe this focus will help us intensify the process we started a couple of years ago to evolve timeshare sales and marketing to ensure a customer-friendly buying experience and to drive future growth.
Let me remind you of the primary initiatives, most of which we previously discussed. First, we introduced and refined a group presentation sales format for new and existing owners, ensuring that our best salespeople are in front of our customers using a proven, uniform method of telling a consistent story and producing sales.
Second, for owners who have benefited from our product for many years but are no longer actively using it, we designed a suite of programs to enable them to gracefully exit their ownership. We broadly call this program Ovation by Wyndham. It is how we applaud owners who have experienced years of great travel memories, but whose needs and circumstances have changed.
Finally, we improved the buying experience for consumers. We implemented enhanced sales training and compliance programs, and we bolstered our quality assurance regime on the contracting and close process, which now includes videotaping. We're also streamlining our documentation process to make it more transparent and easier to understand for the consumer. We are piloting a program to bring greater clarity to the sale by providing contractual documents and program information in a digital format on a preloaded tablet.
We give buyers the tablet rather than a thick owners kit, enabling them to enjoy easier access to important materials regarding their purchase and use of our products.  We made great progress in these initiatives over the past 2 years and will continue our focus in the future.  With our new sales centers, strong affiliation agreements and enhanced sales and marketing operations, we're looking forward to generating substantial long-term sales growth within our Vacation Ownership business.  The opportunities in timeshare, a business with strong economics, are robust.  To capture these opportunities, we're targeting 35,000 new owners in 2016, about a 15% increase over 2015. So 35,000 in 2016.  We expect to achieve these through increased tours, primarily from new marketing alliances and the new sales office as we've opened in the past 16 to 18 months.  We will also slightly increase financing to creditworthy new buyers through lower down payment requirements. We look forward to updating you on our progress.
Before turning over the call to Tom, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook. 
Stock market volatility aside, the operating dynamics we see across this company looks strong for 2016. The geographic and demographic diversity of our offerings, the resiliency of our fee-for-service revenue streams, the scalability of our businesses and our proven track record of strong execution provide a stable base from which to grow. It's a powerful combination.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom to walk through the fourth quarter and what we expect in detail in 2016. Tom?"
31063165,321591661,931688,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. As Steve noted, 2015 was very good year for Wyndham Worldwide despite the fact that foreign exchange negatively affected year-over-year adjusted EBITDA by $46 million and created significant headwinds throughout th",1771,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. 
As Steve noted, 2015 was very good year for Wyndham Worldwide despite the fact that foreign exchange negatively affected year-over-year adjusted EBITDA by $46 million and created significant headwinds throughout the year. 
Absent  the foreign exchange effect on EBITDA, we would've ended the year at the top of our long-term guidance range.  
We also enjoyed a strong fourth quarter. On a currency-neutral basis and excluding acquisitions and a divestiture, revenue increased 6% and adjusted EBITDA increased 8%. 
We also enjoyed a very strong year in cash flow generation. Free cash flow for 2015 was $769 million compared with $749 million for the 12 months of 2014. This was within our neighborhood target range of $800 million.  Remember that foreign exchange reduced free cash flow in 2015 by approximately $43 million. So on a constant currency basis, free cash flow in 2015 was $812 million, an 8% increase over 2014, growing in line with currency-neutral adjusted EBITDA. The increase reflects stronger operating results and lower capital expenditures.
In addition, you might recall from last quarter's call that we sold land and work in progress in a WAAM just-in-time transaction for $65 million in cash.  So while not technically a part of the definition of free cash flow, it did add to overall cash flow for the company and was available to support our capital allocation decisions. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for $165 million. And over the course of the year, we repurchased 7.9 million shares for $650 million, reducing our full year weighted average share count by over 6%.
In addition, we've repurchased 1.6 million shares for $107 million so far in 2016.
Now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units. 
Our Hotel Group had a strong fourth quarter capping off a terrific year. On an apples to apples basis, which excludes the effect of currency, the increased in our segment licensing fee that hotel receives from Wyndham Vacation Ownership and the Dolce acquisition, fourth quarter revenues increased 6% and adjusted EBITDA increased 10%.
Results reflect an increase in royalty and hotel management fees as well as growth in our Wyndham Rewards credit card program. 
Same-store domestic RevPAR increased 4.4%, reflecting the ability of our owners to increase room rates as hotel occupancy was relatively flat.  We achieved this growth despite continued pressure on our RevPAR growth in the oil-producing markets, which, as defined by STR, mainly includes parts of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and West Virginia.  To put this into perspective, RevPAR in the non-oil-producing markets grew 7.5% whereas RevPAR in the oil-producing markets was down 27.9%.
We were especially pleased with the performance of our managed portfolio, where domestic same-store RevPAR was up 7% from the prior year. The performance of our FelCor upper upscale Wyndham portfolio was particularly strong, with a 9% increase in RevPAR year-over-year.
Systemwide RevPAR was flat in constant currency, largely due to the continued unit growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China.  Excluding China and in constant currency, global RevPAR was up 1.6%, which includes a 240 basis point unfavorable impact from domestic and Canadian oil markets.
Overall, net system size grew 2.6%. For the year, gross room openings of nearly 66,000 were offset by over 48,000 terminations, most of which we consider to be substandard. The result is continually improving system quality.  
Our development pipeline is over 119,000 rooms, a 2.2% increase over the prior year.
Our Destination Network segment continue to perform well. Note that adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2014 included a $6 million operating loss from Canvas Holidays, a U.K.-based camping brand that we sold late in 2014.  On a currency-neutral basis and excluding acquisitions and the Canvas Holiday's divestiture, revenues increased 5% and adjusted EBITDA increased 9%.
Results reflect growth in our portfolio of brands, particularly at our RCI and Denmark-based Novasol brands. 
EBITDA also benefited from the receipt of settlements of business disruption claims related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010. 
At RCI, exchange revenues increased 1% in constant currency. The average number of members increased 0.7%, attributable to continued new member growth in the Americas.  Exchange revenue per member was flat as pricing increases offset the growth in lower transacting club members. 
Vacation Rentals revenue for the quarter was up 8% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions in the Canvas divestiture. That increase reflects an 8.1% increase in transaction volume and flat average net price per rental.
Transaction growth occurred in all significant brands and regions. Both pricing and transaction volume were aided by our dynamic pricing initiatives.
Fourth quarter results for our Vacation Ownership business were also solid with revenues up 7% and adjusted EBITDA up 5% in constant currency and excluding a $4 million increase in the licensing fee rate paid to the Hotel Group. 
Reflecting our emphasis on sales growth, gross VOI sales were up 9% in constant currency in the fourth quarter of 2015. That growth reflected a 3.4% increase in VPG and a 4.7% increase in tour flow. 
VPG benefited from higher transaction sizes and tour flow increased primarily due to the new sales centers that Steve mentioned earlier.
The performance of the consumer loan portfolio remained solid. The provision for loan loss was $64 million compared to $60 million in the fourth quarter of last year -- excuse me, of 2014, primarily reflecting higher sales volumes in the quarter.  For the full year, the provision for loan loss was right in line with write-offs. And write-offs were approximately 2% in the fourth quarter and approximately 7.5% for the full year, reasonably consistent with the results in the same periods of 2014.
Company-wide, net interest expense increased by $10 million in the fourth quarter over the same period in 2014, reflecting the $350 million, 5.1% bonds issued in September and the absence of the fixed-to-floating interest rate swap that we unwound during the second quarter of 2015.
Now let's turn to our 2016 outlook and guidance. As a reminder, we're going to post full guidance details to our Investor Relations website following the call. 
Revenue guidance for 2016 is $5.8 billion to $5,950,000,000. Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2016 is $1,375,000,000 to $1,400,000,000.  As usual, we're most comfortable with the midpoint of these ranges.
Today's guidance is based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2015, which reflects $10 million of an adverse impact on our 2016 EBITDA assumptions.
While the calculated EBITDA growth range for 2016 is 6% to 8%, please take note that in constant currency, we're expecting 2016 EBITDA growth of 7% to 9%.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2016 is $5.46 to $5.60. We expect a diluted share count of 116 million shares, which per our standard guidance practice, assumes no share buybacks in 2016.
Now let's take a quick look at guidance for each of our business units. Starting with the Hotel Group, we expect another strong year. We expect revenues of $1,355,000,000 to $1,390,000,000.  We expect room growth of 2% to 4% and global RevPAR growth of flat to up 2% or 1% to 3% in constant currency, which does incorporate 3% to 5% domestic RevPAR growth. 
Note that our January RevPAR was directionally in line with industry reports and we expect RevPAR to be below our annual guidance range in the first quarter, reflecting the Easter holiday shift and a strong first quarter 2015 comparison.  We expect Hotel Group adjusted EBITDA will be $397 million to $407 million.
At Destination Network, we expect revenues of $1,570,000,000 to $1,615,000,000 and adjusted EBITDA of $378 million to $388 million.  We expect the average number of exchange members to be flat to up 2% and exchange revenue per member to be flat or up 1% to 3% in constant currency.
We expect Vacation Rental transactions to grow 5% to 7% and average net price per rental to decline 1% to 3%, primarily reflecting foreign exchange.
For Vacation Ownership, we expect revenues of $2.9 billion to $2,980,000,000 and adjusted EBITDA of $728 million to $754 million.
Our key metric, gross VOI sales is expected to grow 5% to 7%, reflecting tour growth of 3% to 5% and flat to plus 2% VPG growth. 
As Steve noted earlier, we intend to increase our new owner target this year, which will have a dampening effect on VPG. This will be more than offset by higher tours. 
Company-wide, we expect corporate expenses of $135 million to $140 million consistent with 2015. We expect depreciation and amortization to be $245 million to $250 million as additional capital projects come online.
We expect interest expense of $131 million to $133 million, which assumes no new debt issuances in 2016.  Interest expense is higher than 2015 primarily due to the $350 million 5.1% bond we issued last September and the elimination of the fixed-to-floating rate swap that was in place for 5 months in 2015.
Now we'll be considering ways throughout the year to reduce interest expense further.
We expect a modestly higher rate of securitization activity in 2016, but rates will be comparable. The market appears to be strong and while spreads may be widening a bit, benchmarks are lower.
Our neighborhood target for 2016 free cash flow remains $800 million. 
As Steve discussed earlier, we expect to increase financing to creditworthy consumers to drive new owner growth, which will have an adverse short-term impact on cash, but which we believe, is a great investment in the business. 
Also as always, keep in mind that there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or any given year. So we view $800 million as a neighborhood target rather than an exact figure.
Our business produces abundant free cash flow, roughly $7 a share this year, which represents compounded growth rate of 13% since 2010. 
Our capital allocation philosophies is to invest in the business and then return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. 
Absent M&A opportunities, you can expect we'll return at least $600 million to shareholders this year through share repurchases. 
In addition, based on the board's decision to increase our annual dividend to $2 per share, we will return another $230 million to shareholders through dividend payments.
Now turning to the first quarter. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.08 to $1.11. And remember that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance.
To close, we are very pleased with our performance in 2015 and are looking forward to a very strong 2016. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve. Steve?"

The only other thing I would add, Joe, is that when it come to the sales offices, if we can get back to you with specific dates when things opened, we will. But bear in mind that when a sales office opens, it doesn't add -- it doesn't open initially at 100% capacity.

It's -- some of it you've heard or seen, which is we brought our tremendous yield management skill set from RCI and transported it in to the rental business in Europe. And we're seeing results from that yield management capability, which is the first time a European rental business has had that kind of skill set. And various other technology things, for the most part, that RCI has brought to the table and is kind of put into the rental business. In addition, we see an opportunity to do more cross-selling of people who are currently doing rentals of cottages to possibly renting timeshare and then maybe deciding that they want to buy timeshare at some point. So we think there is real opportunity there. And so by giving this team as one family within Destination Network, we think we can drive more of that across the enterprise."

And so, at least in this part of our business, we remain quite confident in the stability of trends as we go forward. And I'll just add one more thing. We've been at the securitization business for a long time. Investors know us. They've experienced the performance of our businesses through the tumultuous period of 29 -- 2009 and 2010. And I think they remain very confident in the program that we have out there. And if there's any stress in the market, I think we're going to maintain ourselves nicely, although we don't detect any stress from the market currently at all."

So I would say that if you were to look at the components of free cash flow, we're maintaining the $800 million neighborhood target because we are going to fund this increased lending to timeshare buyers. So I would say that that's how I see the free cash flow environment for 2016. As it relates to debt issuance, Steve and I believe, as others do in our company, that we're at the optimal point of leverage. We are at the lowest grade -- the lowest rung of investment grade. We believe that's where we should be given the business composition that we have and the free cash flow dynamics of our business. We do not intend to change that unless something extraordinary and compelling comes up that we believe will lead to an expansion of the business over time.

The timeshare business, it's a sold good, it's not a sought good. It really depends on how good our marketing and sales efforts are. That's what drives that business. So if you go back to 2007, '08, '09 and you take out the fact that we took our sales down because we didn't know what the ADS market will look like, all of the metrics around our sales effort in timeshare were terrific. VPG was up. We were controlling tours perfectly. We repositioned that business. I need to tell you, it was one of the great repositioning of a business I've seen and it would -- made the business actually stronger. So we didn't see -- we did not see a lack of people interested in buying. What we saw was -- but what we saw was our marketing efforts were bringing in buyers who probably were more prone to buy because people traveling at that time when travel was down a bit were the more dedicated travelers, more inclined to buy. So we actually exceeded sales during that time. So -- and that's true of our rental businesses as well, we did extremely well. So we have a model that is extremely resilient. So do we look at consumer confidence, do we look at trends, yes. Do we look at the fact that the gas is down and whenever gas prices are up, people say, oh my gosh, people won't be going in their cars to go rent hotel rooms now. Well, that doesn't happen. And likewise, when prices are down it doesn't mean that they necessarily get in their car more to drive around. But they do have more disposable income in their pocket. And I've seen several reports that have shown that a large percentage of the additional dollars people have, now that gas prices are down, is going into travel and entertainment. So we feel we're extremely well-positioned and all of our tracking is looking very positive."

You talked about, in the U.S., Texas and Oklahoma markets, maybe that's broadening Canada, also in Europe, terrorism and sort of more broadly, now the Zika concerns?"

And we are not seeing any impact from the Zika virus. We don't have a huge presence in Latin America. We have a good presence, but not a huge presence. So we have not seen any change there. As for travelers coming into the U.S., there was a little bit of a downturn in Brazilian travelers to Florida. They flow into Miami and Orlando in large numbers and we do a lot of marketing to them. We have a Portuguese sales line in Orlando. But it didn't -- again, it wasn't large enough to have impacted the business at all. So we don't think that the travel patterns are changing. As for the oil-producing markets, where the fracking has been occurring in the U.S. is definitely down. As Tom said, I think it's down to 27% RevPAR in those particular markets. So they have been hit very, very hard. I never thought I would say that oil-producing markets in the U.S. would have an impact on our results, but they -- frankly, they have. And so we highlighted that and pointed that out to you. As to the -- you asked about the age of the buyers of timeshare, it has trended down. It's gotten younger over the last several years. I think right now the audit report says that the average timeshare buyer is 51 years old, but that's the owner. So the buyer is probably younger than that. It's probably -- I think it's in the early 40s and actually I'm  looking at something here that says  39 years old. And so they are younger. The Gen Xers are attracted to timeshare. The average household income is up fairly significantly. I remember when it used to be $80,000. It's up to like $95,000 now. So yes, there is a younger, more affluent person buying timeshare than there was historically."

I'm pleased to report that we are starting the year with another solid quarter of operating performance across our businesses. Tom will walk you through the financial results in detail. First, let me give you the highlights of the quarter.
In our Hotel Group, RevPAR results are somewhat mixed. We continue to see weakness in oil producing territories, but this was offset somewhat by areas of strength such as California and Florida. Comps [indiscernible] in the second half of the year. Now Wyndham Vacation Network, our rental businesses, had the strong first quarter, with our bookings pipeline running ahead of last year, while RCI remainder consisting of a steady performer.
And Wyndham Vacation Ownership had the great operational quarter as we saw the benefits of various initiatives, new sales processes, new sales offices and intensified focus on new owners, pay off with double-digit growth in gross VOI sales.
Unfortunately, there was also an increase in the provision for loan loss, which was attributable to an increased effort by third parties to encourage customers to default on their timeshare loans. And finally, our free cash flow are strong, and continue to operate opportunistically deploy our capital.
Now I would like focus on the great progress we've made on a number of the strategic growth initiatives throughout our businesses. At the Wyndham Hotel Group, our new and award winning Wyndham Awards program continues to great results. Designed to appeal to the everyday traveler, we've made Wyndham Rewards the most generous and easiest to use program in the industry. We have 1 simple and straightforward award night redemption level. All of our rooms are now available for now only 15,000 points per night with no blackout dates and that includes our Wyndham Grand Resorts, which previously required up to 45,000 points per each night.
To make the Wyndham Rewards even more attractive, we are beginning to leverage our unique portfolio of vacation rental and vacation ownership properties. We are expanding award night redemption options across the most aspirational of our destinations. So now Wyndham Rewards members have even more exacting travel options. Staying, for example, at timeshares in Hawaii and Vacation Rentals in Aspen.
In addition to enrolling 5 million new members in the last 12 months, award night redemptions has increased 90% since the program launched last May. We have seen our member occupancy increased over 200 basis points since the launch of the program and our franchisees have never been more engaged, increasing enrollments across their front desk by 55%.
Building on this momentum, we launched our third umbrella of advertising campaign on April 18. The ads once again feature Games of Thrones star Christopher [indiscernible] as the Wyndham Rewards Wizard in new primetime network and cable TV spots. The campaign is designed to drive direct bookings by promoting our richest consumer offer ever. The offer is available only on our branded websites and call centers. Members will receive up to 25% off our best available rates along with $100 in Wyndham Rewards gift card in their second day, which can be redeemed for savings on future stays.
In the Hotel Group, our decision to exit the central reservation system and property management system development business and migrate to best-in-class cloud-based technology partners is proceeding as planned. We currently have over 450 properties live when they knew subleases them, which includes an automated revenue component. Wyndham is the first global hospitality to offer economy in midscale hotel owners a means to automatically analyze millions of historical transactions and demand trends. This enables our franchisees to set the ideal price for their property with a simple push of a button each day. The first group of hotels using this new revenue management tool is showing a 260 basis point increase in RevPAR index compared with hotels not yet on the system.
Moving on Wyndham Destination Network, which is evolving its strategy to better harness its inventory and distribution power to send more people on the vacation of their dreams. For us, the sharing economy isn't a trend. We've been in the business for decades. RCI invented the exchange concept for timeshare back in the 197os and our Vacation Rental brands includes well established businesses dating back more than 70 years. As you all know, we are the largest provider of 
[indiscernible] with over 112,000 properties [indiscernible]
As you know, we cover capabilities will continue to develop new markets. In fact our Denmark and then inadvertently this experience their best ever quarter in terms of booking your feet throughout the things business for the summer what is even more hopeless is that impact the jury despite the economic turmoil in Europe along with his third visit the refugee crisis. We have a very Brazilian business built on the strength of our report that our diversified portfolio. RCI, we're excited about this and enhancement of our product offering. RCI has long been the leader in vacation efficiencies based on our ability to consistently deliver innovation and transform our business to deliver the best experiences for our members and affiliates.
In the first quarter, we launched the multiyear business strategy that will encompass our entire core business model including our customer's experiences and our B2B relationships with timeshare affiliates. It will expand our digital capabilities to further improve our personalization. We're initially focused on our North American operations before expanding globally. The probram will leverage the ways we use our customer data, automation and content to create exceptional engaging interactions with our customers. For example, we'll be able to offer members customized products based on their travel preferences and timeshare ownership characteristics.
We'll improve both the relevance and the quality of leads to our affiliates and improve the effectiveness and efficiencies of their operations. In addition, we'll be transforming our website, mobile offering and digital marketing capabilities. We look forward to updating you about the progress in the future.
Now let's move to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. As we previously mentioned, our focus is gross VOI growth, supported by accelerated growth in new owners. I'm especially pleased to report excellent top line results in the first quarter and we're well on track to achieve our goal of increasing new owners by 15% in 2016. Our new sales centers are performing well, particularly strong performances in Las Vegas, New York, Puerto Rico and St. Thomas.
Our timeshare product delivers the ultimate in choice and flexibility that is evidenced by our industry-leading owner base of close to 900,000 families. And as our history demonstrates, we are committed to continually evolving our product offerings to meet the needs of today's consumers in an ever-changing marketplace. We believe this customer-centric approach is the foundation of our success.
First, we started a process a couple of years ago to both timeshare sales and marketing to ensure a more consumer friendly buying experience. We introduced and refined the group's presentation sales format for new and existing owners, ensuring that our best sales people are in front for customers using a proven uniform method of telling a consistent story and producing sales.  We expanded post sale surveys as well as secret shopper program, both have a vigorous multifaceted compliance and quality assurance effort. As always, our closings are led by a designated quality assurance associate to independently explain the contractual terms of each transactions.
More importantly, we ensure that owners remain satisfied with the product long after the original sale by continual surveys and feedback groups. We're tracking our owner satisfaction whether they're staying in our resorts or speaking with customer service representative or a consumer finance representative. We also continually monitor comments in social media to ensure we are getting unfiltered feedback from various survey channels. Our mission is to always keep a close watch in the sentiment and satisfaction of our owners.
We expect to continue evolving and innovating to maintain and grow our position as the market leader in this industry and that includes providing options to our long-time owners who may want to exit their contract that they no longer use or regularly using their timeshare. We first announced our Ovation by Wyndham program at this time last year. The goal of this innovative program is to ensure a simple, safe and secure exit path for owners that preserves the goodwill and strong brand loyalty we've generated over many years of providing these families with fantastic vacation experiences. There are no fees, hidden costs or additional purchase requirements to participate in the program. Just an ovation for these members for their many years of ownership. We believe this customer-centric approach benefits our customers, our brand and, in the end, our bottom line.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom for the detail on the quarter's results."
31063165,329843181,962610,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We started 2016 with a solid first quarter. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA increased 6%. We generated $218 million of free cash flow, an 11% increase over the first 3 mont",1554,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We started 2016 with a solid first quarter. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA increased 6%. We generated $218 million of free cash flow, an 11% increase over the first 3 months of 2015 due to strong operating performance and the favorable timing of capital expenditures.  These results include the negative effect of the Venezuelan currency devaluation, which reduced free cash flow by $24 million.
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $175 million. We've reduced our weighted average share count by 7% year-over-year through share repurchases made during the last 12 months.  In addition, we've repurchased 600,000 shares for $45 million so far in the second quarter of 2016.
So now, let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units. At our Hotel Group, revenues increased 1%. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6% as growth in our Wyndham Rewards credit card program, strong performance at our 2 owned hotels and cost containment measures more than offset weaker global RevPAR. These factors also led to a higher margin for the quarter.
As we have seen for the last several quarters, there were many macro economic factors impacting our Hotel Group performance. The oil-producing markets in the U.S. and Canada, foreign exchange and the growth in low RevPAR markets such as China, continued to pressure our global RevPAR growth.
Domestic RevPAR was flat as higher room rates were offset by lower occupancy. This performance reflected continued pressure on our RevPAR in the oil-producing markets, which is defined by STR mainly includes parts of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kansas and North Dakota.
To put this into perspective, performance in the oil-producing markets was down 28%, resulting in 220 basis point impact on domestic RevPAR. Excluding oil, domestic RevPAR grew 1.9%, which reflected RevPAR growth with 2.8% in our economy branded hotels and 3% in our midscale hotels.  These 2 segments make up over 90% of our portfolio.
Now domestic RevPAR growth was also adversely impacted by over 100 basis points from the loss of a few Wyndham branded properties, such as the San Francisco-based Park 55 in February 2015, and also by the timing of Easter.  Remember, first quarter performance is against a strong domestic RevPAR in quarter 1 of 2015 of almost 8%.
Systemwide RevPAR declined 1.6% in constant currency, largely due to the continued unit growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China and continued weakness in the Canadian oil markets. Excluding China and in constant currency, global RevPAR was flat, which includes 210 basis points unfavorable impact from domestic and Canadian oil markets.
Overall, net system size grew 1.8% year-over-year, which incorporates our continued focus on improving the overall quality of our system. Our development pipeline is over 124,000 rooms, that's a 7.3% increase over the prior year. And that number also includes a 20% increase in domestic new construction activity with concentration in our higher end brands.
Our Destination Network segment had a very good quarter. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, revenues increased 5% and adjusted EBITDA 3%. Additionally, excluding a $4 million benefit in the first quarter of 2015 from a value added tax reserve reversal, which we discussed last year, adjusted EBITDA would have increased 7%. 
Results benefited from the shift of the easter holiday in the  first quarter.
First quarter 2016 reported EBITDA included a $24 million foreign exchange loss associated with the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. In RCI since revenues were flat in constant currency, reflect the average number of members and revenue per member. Vacation Rental revenues were up 9% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase reflects a 7% increase in transaction volume and a 2.3% increase in the average net price per rental. Transaction growth was strongest in our [indiscernible] and Landal GreenParks brands, aided by our e-commerce and geographic expansion initiatives.
The pricing increase was primarily due to higher [indiscernible] Flambeau, which we believe also benefited from the Easter holiday shift. First quarters for vacation ownership were solid, with revenues up 4 and EBITDA up 5. In addition to strong gross VOI sales, results benefited from an increase in property management fees and higher consumer finance revenues.
As we committed to a couple of calls ago, we intensified our emphasis on growing growth VOI sales, which is now yielding excellent results. Gross VOI sales were up 10% in constant currency. The growth reflected a 3.8% increase in VPG and a 6.5% increase in flow.
VPG benefited from higher transaction sizes and improved rates while flow benefited from higher arrivals in tours at our new sales centers. Sales to new owners increased 7%, consistent with our internal plans.
The performance of the consumer loan portfolio remains solid, but it's experiencing slightly higher default rates. Our average FICO score of originations during the quarter were 727, consistent with underwriting standards of the past year.
However, we saw an increase of $12 million in loan defaults during the first quarter, resulting from higher activity by third parties that may be soliciting our owners to cancel their contracts.
This may be a variation of what we saw a few years ago with cease and desist activity. We're looking into whether there's a legal activity associated with this issue, and if so, we'll take appropriate action. Separately, we are enhancing communications to owners about options that we may have available to them should they wish to exit their timeshare ownership.
The higher defaults contributed to a higher provision for loan loss in the quarter with the provision at $63 million in the first quarter compared to $46 million in the prior period. Approximately $5 million of the increase reflects higher sales volumes. The remaining reflects increased defaults encouraged by third parties. Now remember, the provision flows through to EBITDA at an approximate 60% rate since we get about 40% of the loan value in inventory recoveries which we then of course resell.
Companywide, net interest expense increased by $8 million in the first quarter of the same period of 2015, reflecting the $350 million 5.1% bonds issued last September and the absence of the fixed floating interest rate swap we unwound during the second quarter of 2015.  Depreciation also increased as we brought new long-term projects into service.
We completed two notable markets transactions in March. At the corporate level, we closed $325 million, 5-year floating rate term loan and used the proceeds to redeem the remaining $350 million outstanding under our 6% bonds due this December. We incurred an $11 million one-time charge to pay for the related provision.  The effective of these 2 sections are included in our updated guidance.
At Vacation Ownership, we completed our first term securitization of the year of $425 million year 2016-1 transaction, had a 3.2% weighted average coupon and an 88.9% advance rate. The order book was strong as our paper continues to be well received by the market.
Now let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we're increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to $5.61 to $5.75 for the full year and a diluted share count goes to 113.2 million shares, reflecting the benefit of our first quarter share repurchases. We're adjusting our interest expense guidance to account for the previously discussed debt transactions.
We're reiterating for the company, as well as business unit revenue adjusted EBITDA and driver guidance, although our current view is that RevPAR will be at the low end of our guidance range. Our projected annual interest expense moves to $127 million to $129 million from $131 million to $133 million as a result of the previously mentioned favorable capital markets transaction.
Our neighborhood target for 2016 cash flow remains at $800 million. As always, keep in mind that there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or any given year, so we view the $800 million number as a neighborhood market rather than a precise figure.
Now turning to the second quarter. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.35 to $1.38. Remember that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance. Also note that the appreciation will be a couple million dollars higher in the quarter and sequentially, but we expect it to moderate in the second half of the year.
For the second quarter, while we expect continued momentum on the top line at Vacation Ownership, our current best view is there will be continued pressure on defaults and hence, the provision, which will reduce their EBITDA growth rates. AT the Hotel Group, we expect RevPAR in the oil regions to remain remain challenged.
Finally, a quick note on some additional disclosure. The majority of our peers have amended their definitions of adjusted EBITDA to exclude share-based compensation. While we've not formally changed that definition of adjusted EBITDA, we are now providing our quarterly share based compensation in Table 7 of our earnings release so that investors can make apples-to-apples comparisons between us and our peers. Note that our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance would increase by approximately $60 million if it were presented on a similar basis to our peers. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve. Steve?"

I think the referring to our videotaping losing is part of that before any revenue is from Tom and we started doing it because we thought we could learn more about understanding how our consumer is understanding of our product offerings to make sure that our specialist presenter programs and others are the best that they can be. So this is a constant effort on our part and we resurvey our customers, we do the video recordings and we also do the closings by the QAs.

31063165,329843181,962970,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Margo. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that we are starting the year with another solid quarter of operating performance across our businesses. Tom will walk you through the financial results in detail. First, let",1546,"Thanks, Margo. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that we are starting the year with another solid quarter of operating performance across our businesses. Tom will walk you through the financial results in detail. First, let me give you the highlights of the quarter.
In our Hotel Group, RevPAR results are somewhat mixed. We continue to see weakness in oil producing territories, but this was offset somewhat by areas of strength, such as California and Florida. Comps should get easier in the second half of the year. At Wyndham Vacation Network, our rental businesses had a strong first quarter with our bookings pipeline running ahead of last year, while RCI remains a consistent steady performer.
And Wyndham Vacation Ownership had a great operational quarter, as we saw the benefits of various initiatives, new sales processes, new sales offices and an intensified focus on new owners, pay off with double-digit growth in gross VOI sales.
Unfortunately, there was also an increase in the provision for loan loss, which was attributable to an increased effort by third parties to encourage customers to default on their timeshare loans. And finally, our free cash flow is strong, and we continue to opportunistically deploy our capital.
Now I would like focus on the great progress we've made on a number of strategic growth initiatives throughout our businesses. At the Wyndham Hotel Group, our new and award winning Wyndham Awards program continues to deliver great results. Designed to appeal to the everyday traveler, we've made Wyndham Rewards the most generous and easiest to use program in the industry. We have one simple and straightforward award night redemption level. All of our rooms are now available for only 15,000 points per night, with no blackout dates, and that includes our Wyndham Grand Resorts, which previously required up to 45,000 points for each night.
To make the Wyndham Rewards program even more attractive, we are beginning to leverage our unique portfolio of vacation rental and vacation ownership properties. We are expanding award night redemption options across the most aspirational of our destinations. So now Wyndham Rewards members have even more exciting travel options. Staying, for example, at timeshares in Hawaii and Vacation Rentals in Aspen.
In addition to enrolling 5 million new members in the last 12 months, award night redemptions have increased 90% since the program launched last May. We have seen our member occupancy increase over 200 basis points since the launch of the program. And our franchisees have never been more engaged, increasing enrollments across their front desk by 55%.
Building on this momentum, we launched our third umbrella advertising campaign on April 18th. The ads once again featured Games of Thrones star, Kristofer Hivju, as the Wyndham Rewards Wyzard in new primetime network and cable TV spots. The campaign is designed to drive direct bookings by promoting our richest consumer offer ever. The offer is available only on our branded websites and through our call centers. Members will receive up to 25% off our best available rates along with $100 in Wyndham Rewards gift cards on their second stay, which can be redeemed for savings on future stays.
In the Hotel Group, our decision to exit the central reservation system and property management system development business and migrate to best-in-class cloud-based technology partners is proceeding as planned. We currently have over 450 properties live on the new Sabre system, which includes an automated revenue management component. Wyndham is the first global hospitality company to offer economy in mid-scale hotel owners, a means to automatically analyze millions of historical transactions and demand trends. This enables our franchisees to set the ideal price for their property with a simple push of a button each day. The first group of hotels using this new revenue management tool is showing a 260 basis point increase in RevPAR index compared with hotels not yet on the system.
Moving on to Wyndham Destination Network, which is evolving its strategy to better harness its inventory and distribution power to send more people on the vacation of their dreams. For us, the sharing economy isn't a trend. We've been in the business for decades. RCI invented the exchange concept for timeshare back in the 1970s, and our Vacation Rental brands includes well-established businesses dating back more than 70 years. As you all know, we are the largest -- world's largest provider of privately owned, yet professionally managed unique vacation accommodations, with over 112,000 properties. And for us, it's about the strength of our proprietary brands and the local relationships we've built with our property owners and customers. The strength of these relationships and our value proposition is at the core of our strategy. In Vacation Rentals, we are benefiting from initiatives to expand our e-commerce and distribution capabilities, while continuing to develop new markets.
In fact our Denmark-based Novasol brand and Netherlands-based Landal GreenParks brand just experienced their best ever quarter in terms of bookings and we are seeing strong bookings throughout our business for the peak summer season. What makes us even more noteworthy is that it has happened during despite the economic turmoil in Europe along with recent terrorism and the refugee crisis. We have a very resilient business, built on the strength of our core brands and our diversified portfolio. At RCI, we're excited about the continued expansion and enhancement of our product offering. RCI has long been the leader in vacation exchange, based on our ability to consistently deliver innovations and transform our business to deliver the best experiences for our members and affiliates.
In the first quarter, we launched a multiyear business strategy that will encompass our entire core membership model, including our customer's experiences and our B2B relationships with timeshare affiliates. It will expand our digital capabilities to further improve our personalization. We're initially focused on our North American operations before expanding globally. The program will leverage the ways we use our customer data, automation and content to create exceptional engaging interactions with our customers. For example, we'll be able to offer members customized products based on their travel preferences and timeshare ownership characteristics. We'll improve both the relevance and the quality of leads to our affiliates and improve the effectiveness and efficiencies of their operations. In addition, we'll be transforming our website, mobile offering and digital marketing capabilities. We look forward to updating you about our progress in the future.
Now let's move to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. As we previously mentioned, our focus is gross VOI growth, supported by accelerated growth in new owners. I'm especially pleased to report excellent top line results in the first quarter, and we are well on track to achieve our goal of increasing new owners by 15% in 2016. Our new sales centers are performing well, particularly strong performances in Las Vegas, New York, Puerto Rico and St. Thomas.
Our timeshare product delivers the ultimate in choice and flexibility, as evidenced by our industry-leading owner base of close to 900,000 families. And as our history demonstrates, we are committed to continually evolving our product offerings to meet the needs of today's consumers in an ever-changing marketplace. We believe this customer-centric approach is the foundation of our success.
First, we started a process, a couple of years ago, to evolve timeshare sales and marketing to ensure a more consumer friendly buying experience. We introduced and refined the group's presentation sales format for new and existing owners, ensuring that our best sales people are in front for customers using a proven, uniform method of telling a consistent story and producing sales. We expanded postsales surveys as well as secret shopper program, both part of a vigorous, multifaceted, compliance and quality assurance effort. As always, our closings are led by a designated quality assurance associate to independently explain the contractual terms of each transaction.
More importantly, we ensure that owners remain satisfied with the product long after the original sale by continual surveys and feedback loops. We're tracking our owner's satisfaction whether they're staying at our resorts or speaking with a customer service representative or a consumer finance representative. We also continually monitor comments on social media to ensure we are getting unfiltered feedback from various survey channels. Our mission is to always keep a close watch on the sentiment and satisfaction of our owners.
We expect to continue evolving and innovating to maintain and grow our position as the market leader in this industry, and that includes providing options to our long-time owners who may want to exit their contract that they no longer -- regularly using their timeshare. We first announced our Ovation by Wyndham program at this time last year. The goal of this innovative program is to ensure a simple, safe and secure exit path for owners that preserves the goodwill and strong brand loyalty we've generated over many years of providing these families with fantastic vacation experiences. There are no fees, hidden costs or additional purchase requirements to participate in the program. Just an ovation for these members for their many years of ownership. We believe this customer-centric approach benefits our customers, our brand, and in the end, our bottom line.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom for the details on the quarter's results."
31063165,329843181,962970,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We started 2016 with a solid first quarter. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA increased 6%. We generated $218 million of free cash flow, an 11% increase over the first 3 mont",1565,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We started 2016 with a solid first quarter. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA increased 6%. We generated $218 million of free cash flow, an 11% increase over the first 3 months of 2015, due to strong operating performance and the favorable timing of capital expenditures. These results include the negative effect of Venezuelan currency devaluation, which reduced free cash flow by $24 million.
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $175 million. We've reduced our weighted average share count by 7% year-over-year through share repurchases made during the last 12 months. In addition, we've repurchased 600,000 shares for $45 million so far in the second quarter of 2016.
So now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units. At our Hotel Group, revenues increased 1%. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6% as growth in our Wyndham Rewards credit card program, strong performance at our 2 owned hotels and cost containment measures more than offset weaker global RevPAR. These factors also led to a higher margin for the quarter.
As we have seen for the last several quarters, there were many macroeconomic factors impacting our Hotel Group performance. The oil-producing markets in the U.S. and Canada, foreign exchange and the growth in low RevPAR markets such as China continued to pressure our global RevPAR growth.
Domestic RevPAR was flat as higher room rates were offset by lower occupancy. This performance reflected continued pressure on our RevPAR in the oil-producing markets, which is defined by STR mainly includes parts of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kansas and North Dakota.
To put this into perspective, performance in the oil-producing markets was down 28%, resulting in 220 basis point impact on domestic RevPAR. Excluding oil, domestic RevPAR grew 1.9%, which reflected RevPAR growth with 2.8% in our economy branded hotels and 3% in our mid-scale hotels. These 2 segments make up over 90% of our portfolio.
Now domestic RevPAR growth was also adversely impacted by over 100 basis points from the loss of a few Wyndham-branded properties, such as the San Francisco-based Park 55 in February 2015, and also by the timing of Easter. Remember, first quarter performance is against a strong domestic RevPAR in quarter 1 of 2015 of almost 8%.
Systemwide RevPAR declined 1.6% in constant currency, largely due to the continued unit growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China and continued weakness in the Canadian oil markets. Excluding China and in constant currency, global RevPAR was flat, which includes 210 basis point unfavorable impact from domestic and Canadian oil markets.
Overall, net system size grew 1.8% year-over-year, which incorporates our continued focus on improving the overall quality of our system. Our development pipeline is over 124,000 rooms, that's a 7.3% increase over the prior year. And that number also includes a 20% increase in domestic new construction activity with a concentration in our higher end brands.
Our Destination Network segment had a very good quarter. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, revenues increased 5% and adjusted EBITDA 3%. Additionally, excluding a $4 million benefit in the first quarter of 2015 from a value-added tax reserve reversal, which we discussed with you last year, adjusted EBITDA would have increased 7%. Results benefited marginally from the shift of the Easter holiday into the first quarter.
First quarter 2016 reported EBITDA included the $24 million foreign exchange loss associated with the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. At RCI, exchange revenues were flat in constant currency, reflecting flat average number of members and revenue per member. Vacation Rental's revenue for the quarter were up 9% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase reflects a 7% increase in transaction volume and a 2.3% increase in the average net price per rental. Transaction growth was strongest in our Novasol and Landal GreenParks brands, aided by our e-commerce and geographic expansion initiatives.
The pricing increase was primarily due to higher average seize at Landal, which we believe also benefited from the Easter holiday shift. First quarter results for vacation ownership business were solid, with revenues up 4 and EBITDA up 5. In addition to strong gross VOI sales, results benefited from an increase in property management fees and higher consumer finance revenues.
As we committed to a couple of calls ago, we intensified our emphasis on growing growth VOI sales, which is now yielding excellent results. Gross VOI sales were up 10% in constant currency. That growth reflected a 3.8% increase in VPG and a 6.5% increase in tour flow.
VPG benefited from higher transaction sizes and improved closed rates, while tour flow benefited from higher arrivals in tours at our new sales centers. Sales to new owners increased 7%, consistent with our internal plans.
The performance of the consumer loan portfolio remains solid but is experiencing slightly higher default rates. Our average FICO score of originations during the quarter was 727, consistent with underwriting standards of the past year.
However, we saw an increase of $12 million in loan defaults during the first quarter, resulting from higher activity by third parties that may be soliciting our owners to cancel their contracts.
This may be a variation of what we saw a few years ago with cease and desist activity. We're looking into whether there's a legal activity associated with this issue, and if so, we'll take appropriate action. Separately, we are enhancing communications to owners about options that we may have available to them should they wish to exit their timeshare ownership.
The higher defaults contributed to a higher provision for loan loss in the quarter with the provision at $63 million in the first quarter compared to $46 million in the prior period. Approximately $5 million of the increase reflects higher sales volumes. The remainder reflects increased defaults encouraged by third parties. Now remember, the provision flows through to EBITDA at an approximate 60% rate, since we get about 40% of the loan value in inventory recoveries which we then of course resell.
Company-wide net interest expense increased by $8 million in the first quarter of the same period of 2015, reflecting the $350 million 5.1% bonds issued last September and the absence of the fixed to floating interest rate swap we unwound during the second quarter of 2015. Depreciation also increased as we brought new long-term projects into service.
We completed 2 notable capital market's transactions in March. At the corporate level, we closed $325 million, 5-year floating rate term loan and used the proceeds to redeem the remaining $350 million outstanding under our 6% bonds due this December. We incurred an $11 million one-time charge to pay for the related make-whole provision. The effect of these 2 transactions is now included in our updated interest expense guidance.
At Vacation Ownership, we completed our first term securitization of the year of $425 million year 2016-1 transaction at a 3.2% weighted average coupon and an 88.9% advance rate. The order book was strong, as our paper continues to be well received by the market.
Now let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we're increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to $5.61 to $5.75 for the full year and diluted share count goes to 113.2 million shares, reflecting the benefit of our first quarter share repurchases. We're adjusting our interest expense guidance to account for the previously discussed debt transactions.
We're reiterating total company as well as business unit revenue adjusted EBITDA and driver guidance, although our current view is that RevPAR will be at the low end of our guidance range. Our projected annual interest expense moves to $127 million to $129 million from $131 million to $133 million, as a result of the previously mentioned favorable capital market's transactions.
Our neighborhood target for 2016 cash flow remains at $800 million. As always, keep in mind that there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or any given year. So we view the $800 million number as a neighborhood target rather than a precise figure.
Now turning to the second quarter. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.35 to $1.38. Remember that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance. Also note that depreciation will be a couple million dollars higher in the quarter sequentially, but we expect it to moderate in the second half of the year.
For the second quarter, while we expect continued momentum on the top line at Vacation Ownership, our current best view is that there will be continued pressure on defaults and hence, the provision, which will reduce their EBITDA growth rates. And at the Hotel Group, we expect RevPAR in the oil regions to remain challenged.
Finally, a quick note on some additional disclosure. The majority of our peers have amended their definitions of adjusted EBITDA to exclude share-based compensation. While we've not formally changed that definition of adjusted EBITDA, we are now providing our quarterly share-based compensation in Table 7 of our earnings release, so that investors can make apples-to-apples comparisons between us and our peers.

They are getting the benefit of it. So we've got some very happy hotel owners in the Dolce world.

I'm pleased to report that we are starting the year with another solid quarter of operating performance across our businesses. Tom will walk you through the financial results in detail. First, let me give you the highlights of the quarter.
In our Hotel Group, RevPAR results are somewhat mixed. We continued to see weakness in oil producing territories, but this was offset somewhat by areas of strength, such as California and Florida. Comps should get easier in the second half of the year. 
At Wyndham Vacation Network, our rental businesses had a strong first quarter with our bookings pipeline running ahead of last year, while RCI remains a consistent steady performer.
And Wyndham Vacation Ownership had a great operational quarter, as we saw the benefits of various initiatives, new sales processes, new sales offices and an intensified focus on new owners, pay off with double-digit growth in gross VOI sales.
Unfortunately, there was also an increase in the provision for loan loss, which was attributable to an increased effort by third parties to encourage customers to default on their timeshare loans. And finally, our free cash flow is strong. And we continue to opportunistically deploy our capital.
Now I would like focus on the great progress we've made on a number of strategic growth initiatives throughout our businesses. At the Wyndham Hotel Group, our new and award winning Wyndham Rewards program continues to deliver great results. Designed to appeal to the everyday traveler, we've made Wyndham Rewards the most generous and easiest to use program in the industry. We have one simple and straightforward award night redemption level. All of our rooms are now available for only 15,000 points per night, with no blackout dates. And that includes our Wyndham Grand Resorts, which previously required up to 45,000 points for each night.
To make the Wyndham Rewards program even more attractive, we are beginning to leverage our unique portfolio of vacation rental and vacation ownership properties. We are expanding award night redemption options across the most aspirational of our destinations. So now Wyndham Rewards members have even more exciting travel options, staying, for example, at timeshares in Hawaii and Vacation Rentals in Aspen.
In addition to enrolling 5 million new members in the last 12 months, award night redemptions have increased 90% since the program launched last May. We have seen our member occupancy increase over 200 basis points since the launch of the program. And our franchisees have never been more engaged, increasing enrollments across their front desk by 55%.
Building on this momentum, we launched our third umbrella advertising campaign on April 18. The ads once again featured Games of Thrones star, Kristofer Hivju, as the Wyndham Rewards Wyzard in new primetime network and cable TV spots. The campaign is designed to drive direct bookings by promoting our richest consumer offer ever. The offer is available only on our branded websites and through our call centers. Members will receive up to 25% off our best available rate, along with $100 in Wyndham Rewards gift cards on their second stay, which can be redeemed for savings on future stays.
In the Hotel Group, our decision to exit the central reservation system and property management system development business and migrate to best-in-class cloud-based technology partners is proceeding as planned. We currently have over 450 properties live on the new SABRE system, which includes an automated revenue management component. Wyndham is the first global hospitality company to offer economy and mid-scale hotel owners a means to automatically analyze millions of historical transactions and demand trends. This enables our franchisees to set the ideal price for their property with a simple push of a button each day. The first group of hotels using this new revenue management tool is showing a 260 basis point increase in RevPAR index compared with hotels not yet on the system.
Moving on to Wyndham Destination Network, which is evolving its strategy to better harness its inventory and distribution power to send more people on the vacation of their dreams. 
For us, the sharing economy isn't a trend. We've been in the business for decades. RCI invented the exchange concept for timeshare back in the 1970s. And our Vacation Rental brands includes well-established businesses dating back more than 70 years. 
As you all know, we are the largest -- world's largest provider of privately owned, yet professionally managed unique vacation accommodations, with over 112,000 properties. And for us, it's about the strength of our proprietary brands and the local relationships we've built with our property owners and customers. The strength of these relationships and our value proposition is at the core of our strategy. 
In Vacation Rentals, we are benefiting from initiatives to expand our e-commerce and distribution capabilities, while continuing to develop new markets.
In fact our Denmark-based Novasol brand and Netherlands-based Landal GreenParks brand just experienced their best ever quarter in terms of bookings. And we are seeing strong bookings throughout our business for the peak summer season. 
What makes this even more noteworthy is that it has happened during -- despite the economic turmoil in Europe, along with recent terrorism and the refugee crisis. We have a very resilient business, built on the strength of our core brands and our diversified portfolio. 
At RCI, we're excited about the continued expansion and enhancement of our product offering. RCI has long been the leader in vacation exchange, based on our ability to consistently deliver innovations and transform our business to deliver the best experiences for our members and affiliates.
In the first quarter, we launched a multiyear business strategy that will encompass our entire core membership model, including our customers' experiences and our B2B relationships with timeshare affiliates. It will expand our digital capabilities to further improve our personalization. We're initially focused on our North American operations before expanding globally. The program will leverage the ways we use our customer data, automation and content to create exceptional engaging interactions with our customers. 
For example, we'll be able to offer members customized products based on their travel preferences and timeshare ownership characteristics. We'll improve both the relevance and the quality of leads to our affiliates and improve the effectiveness and efficiencies of their operations. In addition, we'll be transforming our website, mobile offering and digital marketing capabilities. We look forward to updating you about our progress in the future.
Now let's move to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. As we previously mentioned, our focus is gross VOI growth, supported by accelerated growth in new owners. I'm especially pleased to report excellent top line results in the first quarter. And we are well on track to achieve our goal of increasing new owners by 15% in 2016. Our new sales centers are performing well, particularly strong performances in Las Vegas, New York, Puerto Rico and St. Thomas.
Our timeshare product delivers the ultimate in choice and flexibility, as evidenced by our industry-leading owner base of close to 900,000 families. And as our history demonstrates, we are committed to continually evolving our product offerings to meet the needs of today's consumers in an ever-changing marketplace. We believe this customer-centric approach is the foundation of our success.
First, we started a process a couple years ago to evolve timeshare sales and marketing to ensure a more consumer friendly buying experience. We introduced and refined the group's presentation sales format for new and existing owners, ensuring that our best sales people are in front of our customers, using a proven, uniform method of telling a consistent story and producing sales. We expanded post-sales surveys as well as secret shopper program, both part of a vigorous, multifaceted, compliance and quality assurance effort. As always, our closings are led by a designated quality assurance associate to independently explain the contractual terms of each transaction.
More importantly, we ensure that owners remain satisfied with the product long after the original sale by continual surveys and feedback loops. We're tracking our owners' satisfaction, whether they're staying at our resorts or speaking with a customer service representative or a consumer finance representative. We also continually monitor comments on social media to ensure that we are getting unfiltered feedback from various survey channels. Our mission is to always keep a close watch on the sentiment and satisfaction of our owners.
We expect to continue evolving and innovating to maintain and grow our position as the market leader in this industry. And that includes providing options to our long-time owners, who may want to exit their contract that they no longer are regularly using their timeshare. 
We first announced our Ovation by Wyndham program at this time last year. The goal of this innovative program is to ensure a simple, safe and secure exit path for owners that preserves the goodwill and strong brand loyalty we've generated over many years of providing these families with fantastic vacation experiences. There are no fees, hidden costs or additional purchase requirements to participate in the program. Just an ovation for these members for their many years of ownership. We believe this customer-centric approach benefits our customers, our brand, and in the end, our bottom line.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom for the details on the quarter's results."

These results include the negative effect of a Venezuelan currency devaluation, which reduced free cash flow by $24 million.
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $175 million. We've reduced our weighted average share count by 7% year-over-year through share repurchases made during the last 12 months. In addition, we've repurchased 600,000 shares for $45 million so far in the second quarter of 2016.
So now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units. At our Hotel Group, revenues increased 1%. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6%, as growth in our Wyndham Rewards credit card program, strong performance at our 2 owned hotels and cost containment measures more than offset weaker global RevPAR. These factors also led to a higher margin for the quarter.
As we have seen for the last several quarters, there were many macroeconomic factors impacting our Hotel Group performance. The oil-producing markets in the U.S. and Canada, foreign exchange and the growth in low RevPAR markets such as China continued to pressure our global RevPAR growth.
Domestic RevPAR was flat, as higher room rates were offset by lower occupancy. This performance reflected continued pressure on our RevPAR in the oil-producing markets, which, as defined by STR, mainly includes parts of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kansas and North Dakota.
To put this into perspective, performance in the oil-producing markets was down 28%, resulting in a 220 basis point impact on domestic RevPAR. Excluding oil, domestic RevPAR grew 1.9%, which reflected RevPAR growth of 2.8% in our economy branded hotels and 3% in our mid-scale hotels. These 2 segments make up over 90% of our portfolio.
Now, domestic RevPAR growth was also adversely impacted by over 100 basis points from the loss of a few Wyndham-branded properties, such as the San Francisco-based Parc 55 in February 2015, and also by the timing of Easter. Remember, first quarter performance is against a strong domestic RevPAR in quarter 1 of 2015 of almost 8%.
Systemwide, RevPAR declined 1.6% in constant currency, largely due to the continued unit growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China and continued weakness in the Canadian oil markets. Excluding China and in constant currency, global RevPAR was flat, which includes a 210 basis point unfavorable impact from domestic and Canadian oil markets.
Overall, net system size grew 1.8% year-over-year, which incorporates our continued focus on improving the overall quality of our system. Our development pipeline is over 124,000 rooms. That's a 7.3% increase over the prior year. And that number also includes a 20% increase in domestic new construction activity with the concentration in our higher end brands.
Our Destination Network segment had a very good quarter. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, revenues increased 5% and adjusted EBITDA 3%. Additionally, excluding a $4 million benefit in the first quarter of 2015 from a value-added tax reserve reversal, which we discussed with you last year, adjusted EBITDA would have increased 7%. Results benefited marginally from the shift of the Easter holiday into the first quarter.
First quarter 2016 reported EBITDA included the $24 million foreign exchange loss associated with the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. 
At RCI, exchange revenues were flat in constant currency, reflecting flat average number of members and revenue per member. 
Vacation Rentals revenue for the quarter were up 9% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase reflects a 7% increase in transaction volume and a 2.3% increase in the average net price per rental. Transaction growth was strongest in our Novasol and Landal GreenParks brands, aided by our e-commerce and geographic expansion initiatives.
The pricing increase was primarily due to higher average fees at Landal, which we believe also benefited from the Easter holiday shift. 
First quarter results for our vacation ownership business were solid, with revenues up 4 and EBITDA up 5. In addition to strong gross VOI sales, results benefited from an increase in property management fees and higher consumer finance revenues.
As we committed to a couple calls ago, we intensified our emphasis on growing gross VOI sales, which is now yielding excellent results. Gross VOI sales were up 10% in constant currency. That growth reflected a 3.8% increase in VPG and a 6.5% increase in tour flow.
VPG benefited from higher transaction sizes and improved close rates. While tour flow benefited from higher arrivals and tours at our new sales centers. Sales to new owners increased 7%, consistent with our internal plans.
The performance of the consumer loan portfolio remains solid but is experiencing slightly higher default rates. Our average FICO score of originations during the quarter was 727, consistent with underwriting standards of the past year.
However, we saw an increase of $12 million in loan defaults during the first quarter, resulting from higher activity by third parties that may be soliciting our owners to cancel their contracts.
This may be a variation of what we saw a few years ago with cease and desist activity. We're looking into whether there's a legal activity associated with this issue. And if so, we'll take appropriate action. Separately, we are enhancing communications to owners about options that we may have available to them, should they wish to exit their timeshare ownership.
The higher defaults contributed to a higher provision for loan loss in the quarter with the provision at $63 million in the first quarter, compared to $46 million in the prior period. Approximately $5 million of the increase reflects higher sales volumes. The remainder reflects increased defaults encouraged by third parties. Now remember, the provision flows through to EBITDA at an approximate 60% rate, since we get about 40% of the loan value in inventory recoveries, which we then of course resell.
Company-wide net interest expense increased by $8 million in the first quarter over the same period of 2015, reflecting the $350 million 5.1% bonds issued last September and the absence of the fixed to floating interest rate swap we unwound during the second quarter of 2015. Depreciation also increased, as we brought new long-term projects into service.
We completed 2 notable capital markets transactions in March. At the corporate level, we closed a $325 million, 5-year floating rate term loan and used the proceeds to redeem the remaining $350 million outstanding under our 6% bonds due this December. We incurred an $11 million one-time charge to pay for the related make-whole provision. The effect of these 2 transactions is now included in our updated interest expense guidance.
At Vacation Ownership, we completed our first term securitization of the year, the $425 million Sierra 2016-1 transaction at a 3.2% weighted average coupon and an 88.9% advance rate. The order book was strong, as our paper continues to be well received by the market.
Now let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we're increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to $5.61 to $5.75 for the full year and diluted share count goes to 113.2 million shares, reflecting the benefit of our first quarter share repurchases. We're adjusting our interest expense guidance to account for the previously discussed debt transactions.
We're reiterating total company as well as business unit revenue adjusted EBITDA and driver guidance, although our current view is that RevPAR will be at the low end of our guidance range. Our projected annual interest expense moves to $127 million to $129 million from $131 million to $133 million, as a result of the previously mentioned favorable capital markets transactions.
Our neighborhood target for 2016 cash flow remains at $800 million. As always, keep in mind that there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or any given year. So we view the $800 million number as a neighborhood target rather than a precise figure.
Now turning to the second quarter. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.35 to $1.38. Remember that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance. Also note that depreciation will be a couple million dollars higher in the quarter sequentially. But we expect it to moderate in the second half of the year.
For the second quarter, while we expect continued momentum on the top line at Vacation Ownership, our current best view is that there will be continued pressure on defaults, and hence, the provision, which will reduce their EBITDA growth rates. And at the Hotel Group, we expect RevPAR in the oil regions to remain challenged.
Finally, a quick note on some additional disclosure. The majority of our peers have amended their definitions of adjusted EBITDA to exclude share-based compensation. While we've not formally changed that definition of adjusted EBITDA, we are now providing our quarterly share-based compensation in Table 7 of our earnings release, so that investors can make apples-to-apples comparisons between us and our peers. Note that our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance would increase by approximately $60 million if it were presented on a similar basis to our peers.
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Steve?"

We did our strategic reviews at the end of last year and have done budget reviews. We feel like we have terrific programs in place. And a lot of the seed corn that we're planting right now is going to bear fruit in 2017 and beyond, even though we were comfortable for this year. Because things like the tremendous systems that we're rolling out in Hotel Group are going to have some really positive impacts. And those aren't felt immediately, because really we've got to -- there's a series of initiatives that we're rolling out. And we haven't even hit the big ones yet that will have the biggest impact. So revenue management for these hotels is important. But the 2-way interface, and other things that are coming out as part of the SABRE system that will come out in 2016 and '17 are going to have the bigger impact. So we feel very good. And WVO is clicking along. They've got great plans for going forward."

The new offices were one element of it. They are not completely ramped up yet. They will continue to ramp up over this year and actually into next year to a degree. Because not only do you have to open the sales centers, you then are -- you're finding your tour flow sources. You're training your sales people. So I expect to see a multiyear impact from some of these larger sales centers like New York and St. Thomas, and as well as the new center we have out in Vegas. So that is going to blend in over time. Some of the initiatives that we've talked about previously, like Norwegian Cruise Lines, that's just starting. We had our first cruise for Norwegian Cruise Line that went into St. Thomas, and then went over to our sales center on the 19th, I believe, of April. So, yes, last week. So we're just starting that program. And there's a multitude of other programs that the group is working on to continually kind of freshen the sources of our tour generation. So I think what you're seeing, I do not expect it to slow down. It was great in the first quarter. It's always difficult to predict. So I don't want to say it's going to be up every quarter like it was this quarter. But we feel very good about our marketing and sales efforts at WVO right now."

First, we are redefining what technology means for economy in midscale hotels; second, as we discussed in recent quarters, we are taking a fresh look at our brands and the guest experience; and third, we are reinventing hotel loyalty with some industry-leading improvements to Wyndham Rewards. Our goals are to continue to increase our value proposition to both our hotel owners and consumers and to drive higher contribution for our hotel owners. We are convinced that this direction is absolutely the correct path to take even though we are implementing these plans in a decelerating RevPAR environment. 
As you might recall, effective January 1 of this year, Wyndham Exchange and Rental become Wyndham Destination Network. The reflects the vision for the business. We are leveraging the strength of our portfolio of unique vacation accommodations to provide our worldwide customer base with the options to vacation the way they want. We believe that executing this vision will result in higher combined growth than exchange growth or Vacation Rental growth alone. On a practical level, that means we are enhancing technology, continuing to leverage our yield management capabilities and strengthening our marketing across brands. In addition, we recently launched a project to develop the next generation of RCI product offerings. This business continues to deliver on its strategy despite modest growth in the exchange industry and potential FX headwinds in Europe, resulting from Brexit. 
Finally, in Wyndham Vacation Ownership, we spent the past couple of years transforming our sales process to ensure a great experience for new and existing owners. We've opened new and key vacation destinations, which will be important to bring new owners into our system. That's our focus. We are increasing our new owner growth target to the mid-teens this year, and we're on track to hit that number with a 13% increase recorded in the second quarter. 
In setting this goal, we realize the short-term impact but the lifetime value of the timeshare buyer remains highly compelling. Also, as we discussed in our last call, our progress has been somewhat muted by the unexpected increase in third-party guided defaults. 
Let me take a moment to update you on that topic. We are vigorously pursuing legal alternatives against individuals and companies that might improperly be targeting our owners. We filed a lawsuit and discovery is underway. But at this point, there are no silver bullets. While we're aggressively exploring all options, we think this situation may be a situation that lap before resolved. Given its size, we believe it is manageable situation as evidenced by our maintaining EBITDA guidance for the year. So stepping back, let me say that as usual, while headwinds do exist, we believe our operational agenda establishes the correct long-term direction for our company.
Now turning to the quarter. Let me point out a few operating highlights in each of the business units. Let's start with the Hotel Group. As the world's largest hotel franchisor with a concentration in the economy segment, we see a unique opportunity to leverage our strength to enhance the economy hotel experience for both hotel owners and consumer, consumers in new ways and on an unprecedented scale. While much of the industry's recent development and innovation has been focused in the upscale -- upper upscale and luxury segments, 40% of all rooms are purchased in economy and midscale hotels. We expect this number to continue growing as the global middle class increases from $2 billion to $5 billion over the next 15 years. Many of our brands phasing, Travelodge and Super 8, have a rich heritage in U.S. brand awareness of over 90%. We are working to enhance the guest experience and tap the full potential of our brands to ensure that we resonate with the next generation of travelers. We initiated this effort a little over a year ago with the transformation of the Wyndham Rewards program. We eliminated reward tiers, blackout dates and other features that make loyalty programs frustrating, confusing and unattainable for many customers. The result of this transformation is that redemptions are up over 90% and nearly 6 million people have joined the program since its relaunch. Our goal is to create industry's top-ranked loyalty program. To support that effort, our summer umbrella marketing market campaign is underway now through the busy Labor Day week, bolstered by a $20 million national advertising campaign featuring the Wyndham Rewards Wizard. Of course, the best loyalty program in the world is irrelevant without a strong consumer value proposition. So we recently completed a global research study to help us enhance the guest experience and better define the value and positioning of each one of our hotel brands. Based on this research, we are developing new marketing campaigns, digital experiences, websites, on properties and amenities, travel perks and marketing partnerships.
On the technology front, our transformational cloud-based property management and central reservation system installations are proceeding on schedule. We recently completed a flawless migration of the Wyndham Hotel and resorts, Wyndham Garden and Wyndham Grand Hotel to the SABRE central reservation system. And our migration to the SABRE Property Management System is progressing equally well. We now have nearly 1,600 of our economy and midscale hotels operating under new PMS system, utilizing or preparing to utilize the new automated revenue management tools, the first for the economy space. 
Supporting all of this is our continued focus on quality as we work to remove properties that are no longer up to our brand's standards. These efforts have helped raise our overall customer satisfaction and net promoter scores across our brands. 
Now let's turn to Wyndham Destination Network. We continue to add to our scale, geographic reach and diversity of experiences within our portfolio. This year, RCI announced new affiliations in China, Japan, the Czech Republic, Portugal, the Canary Islands, England and Mexico. These affiliations include one-of-a-kind experiences such as the family-themed Nickelodeon hotels and resorts in and 2 resorts in the first Cirque du Soleil theme park, which is now under development in [indiscernible].
All told, Wyndham Destinations Network offers more than 112,000 properties to the everyday traveler in over 100 countries. We're seeing strong transaction growth in Croatia, Spain, Belgium and The Netherlands and the outlook is strong for the summer season with third quarter Vacation Rental bookings up 8% compared to 2015. 
Now I'd like to take a moment here to briefly comment on Brexit and why we don't expect any operational effect in our business. 13% of Wyndham Worldwide revenues comes from Europe. The majority of this from Vacation Rentals. While we are predominantly domestic drive to vacations. 90% of our Vacation Rental transactions in the U.K. are made by U.K. consumers. The same applies in Continental Europe, where over 90% of transactions are made by continental Europeans, primarily German, Dutch and Danish consumers traveling to Continental European destinations. Our rental brands have traditionally performed well in a the period of economic and political turmoil because of our outstanding drive to occasions and strong value proposition. And our large inventory in the U.K. and nearly 40,000 units positions us well should demand for U.K. vacations increase due to the depreciation of the pound. So while we may experience some additional FX headwinds resulting from the Brexit decision, which Tom will discuss in a moment, we do not expect any change in overall demand or impact on bookings.
Now moving onto Wyndham Vacation Ownership. As I mentioned earlier, the team is doing a great job of executing their plan to bring in new owners. Our new sales centers in New York, St. Thomas, Puerto Rico, Southern California and Las Vegas are performing well, generating strong growth and new owner tour flow. About half of our new owner tours are source to lower activity marketing programs and alliances, which put the Wyndham Vacation Ownership product front and center in desirable vacation locations. Our community marketing programs include local outreach in malls and represent -- where presentation of events such as NASCAR. We focus on venue and alliance partners whose customers match our timeshare owner demographics. Our alliance partners share a commitment to truly knowing their customers and providing great experiences for them. These partnerships provide Wyndham Vacation Ownership with access to potential tours while enabling existing owners to use their points for new services, benefits or products offered by our alliance partners. Our partners typically benefit from increased product exposure and incremental income while we gain scalable access to large segments of consumers. It's a win for us, for our partners and for our owners. We've enjoyed much success over the years of partnering with major brands to fuel our growth and expansion in markets such as Caesars in Las Vegas, Outrigger in Hawaii and Margaritaville in the Caribbean. Of course, we also continue to connect our hotels and vacation ownership brands through Wyndham Rewards. 
We are constantly improving and enhancing our marketing efforts for distribution and efficiency. One great recent example of a new alliance is Norwegian Cruise lines. Potential new owners can purchase land and sea vacations combining a cruise with a stay at a nearby Wyndham resort. Another is our alliance with Avis Budget Group, which includes a call transfer program and also enables our owners to rent a car using their timeshare points. And we recently signed a new alliance with a major tour operator in New York. Individually, none of these verses have intended to account more than 5% of our tour flow, but collectively, they serve to broaden our marketing reach and gror our pipeline of prospective new owners. Now let me turn the call over to Tom for details in the quarter's results. Tom?"
31063165,367636275,1013202,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. As Steve mentioned, results for the second quarter were in line with our expectations. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA increased 3% in the quarter as higher revenues at our bus",1649,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. As Steve mentioned, results for the second quarter were in line with our expectations. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA increased 3% in the quarter as higher revenues at our businesses were muted by higher provision for loan loss at Vacation Ownership, which while large, was in line with our expectations. We generated $616 million of free cash flow in the first 6 months of the year compared to $625 million over the first 6 months of 2015. Now recall that 2016 results include the negative effect of an unanticipated Venezuelan currency devaluation in the first quarter, which reduced free cash flow by $24 million. In total, our free cash flow has been adversely affected by $35 million of unexpected foreign exchange headwinds over the first 6 months of 2016, including the impact from Venezuela and an additional $11 million, primarily from the devaluation of the British pound. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of stock for $150 million. We've reduced our weighted average share count by 7% year-over-year through share repurchases made during the last 12 months. In addition, we repurchased 600,000 shares for $42 million so far in the third quarter of 2016.
Now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units. At our Hotel Group, revenues were flat, reflecting difficult year-over-year comparisons. Higher royalties and growth in the Wyndham Rewards Credit Card Program were offset by the absence of $3 million of global conference fees and $2 million in termination fees from 2 large properties that left the system in the second quarter of 2015.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 4% reflecting higher royalties and growth in the Wyndham Rewards credit card program as well as cost containment measures, offset somewhat by the lower termination fees. Domestic RevPAR increased 2%, and that increase reflects higher room rates. Excluding the oil-producing regions, domestic RevPAR actually grew 3.3%. RevPAR in the oil-producing markets was down 16%. Remember that RevPAR in these regions was down 28% in the first quarter, so we're happy to see some sequential improvement. Systemwide RevPAR was flat in constant currency, pressured by the continued unit growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China, which has also been experiencing some market softness and continued weakness in the Canadian oil markets. Excluding China and in constant currency, global RevPAR increased 1.6%, which includes about 120 basis points unfavorable impact from domestic and Canadian oil markets. Net system size grew 2.2% year-over-year, which is net of the impact of our continued focus on improving the overall quality of our system. Our development pipeline is nearly 128,000 rooms, that's a 10% increase over prior year, which includes a 21% increase in domestic new construction activity with a concentration in our higher and brands, particularly our Wyndham brand.
Moving on to our destination segment. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, revenues increased 1%; and EBITDA, 2%. At RCI, exchange revenues increased 1% in constant currency, reflecting a 0.7% increase in the average number of members and a 0.3% increase in revenue per member. Vacation Rentals revenue for the quarter was also up 1% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions. A 4% increase in volume was offset by a 3.3% decline in the average net price per rental. Transaction growth was particularly strong in the U.K. based on seasons business as well as our Denmark-based Novasol brand, and was reduced a bit to the shift of the Easter holiday into the first quarter of 2016. 
Faster growth in our more moderate product offerings adversely impacted the average net price per rental. 
At our Vacation Ownership business, revenues increased 1%; and EBITDA, 3%. Results benefited from an increase in gross VOI sales and property management fees, partially offset by a higher provision for loan losses. EBITDA further benefited from lower cost of goods sold. 
Gross VOI sales increased 3% in constant currency, and a number of new owners increased 13%, in line with our previously stated goal of increasing new owner sales. 
Sales to existing owners was flat. The growth in the gross VOI sales reflected a 3.4% increase in tour flow, offset by a 0.8% constant currency decline of VPG. Now VPG was impacted by higher sales to new owners, which are generally less sufficient than upgrade sales. While tour flow benefited from higher arrivals in tours at both our newer and existing sales centers.
Second quarter consumer finance portfolio performance was in line with our expectations at the end of the first quarter, which included the activity by third parties, encouraging our owners to cancel their contracts. 
Our average FICO score of originations during the quarter was 727, and that's consistent with our underwriting standards of the past year. 
Defaults for the quarter were $74 million, that's an increase of $14 million, which was almost entirely due to the organized third-party efforts. Both of these numbers were consistent with our expectations. The provision for loan loss was $90 million in the second quarter, resulting in an overall reserve level of 17.7%, consistent with recent levels over the past 3 years. It's worth emphasizing that the increase in the provision is in line with our expectations when we last spoke to you in April, with the breakdown as follows: $12 million from third parties causing our owners to default; $8 million from higher sales volume and financing propensity; and $10 million from comparisons to favorable performance trends in the second quarter of 2015.
Remember that the provision flow-through to EBITDA is approximately 60%. As Steve said, we're continuing to work on the third-party issue. And in the meantime, the situation is tracking to our expectations. We calculate that the EBITDA impact in the first 6 months has been around $15 million. We estimate the third quarter EBITDA effect to be $8 million.
Company-wide net interest expense increased by $4 million in the second quarter compared with the same period of 2015, reflecting higher levels of debt, including the $350 million  5.1% bond issued last September, as well as the absence of a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap that we terminated in the second quarter of 2015. Depreciation also increased as we brought new long-term projects into service. Corporate expenses increased by $2 million, largely due to higher stock-based compensation expenses, and these expenses were offset somewhat by cost-cutting initiatives.
At Vacation Ownership, we completed our second term securitization of the year in July. The $375 million Sierra 2016-2 transaction had a 90% advance rate and 2.42% weighted average coupon, that's nearly 80 business below our prior 2016-1 transaction as we benefited from lower post-Brexit interest rates and generally improved market conditions.
Now let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we're increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to $5.68 to $5.82 for the full year, and diluted share count goes to 111.8 million shares, reflecting the benefit of our second quarter share repurchases.
We're fine tuning our revenue guidance, lowering the overall range by $150 million. Approximately $50 million of the adjustment relates primarily to a forecast correction in our hotel management gross up at the Hotel Group, which has no EBITDA impact. The remainder is at Vacation Ownership and primarily reflects our best view of the impact of third-party prompted defaults. Just a reminder in timeshare accounting, the provision for anticipated defaults is a counter revenue account. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance remains unchanged at $1,375,000,000 to $1,400,000,000. Note that this guidance incorporates a negative $17 million year-over-year EBITDA impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. $6 million higher than in the full year guidance that we issued in April, largely due to the impact of Brexit on the British pound.
We expect the EBITDA impact from third-party defaults to be around $30 million this year. But we are holding our adjusted EBITDA guidance range for Vacation Ownership and the overall company. However, given these headwinds, we are more comfortable at the lower end of our EBITDA guidance range. There are no changes to drive our guidance. Although remember we said that on the last call that RevPAR would be at the lower end of our guidance range, which implies flat global RevPAR.
Our neighborhood target for 2016 free cash flow remains $800 million. As always, keep in mind that there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or any given year, so we view $800 million as a neighborhood target rather than an exact figure. In addition, we are facing 2 free cash flow headwinds this year. First, as discussed, we have $35 million of unexpected foreign exchange headwinds year-to-date. Second, remember that as part of our strategy to drive new owner growth to timeshare, we are increasing financing to creditworthy customers, which will have an adverse short-term impact on free cash flow in 2016. However, we regained around 90% of that spend in financing activities from the receivables we securitized, and that is outside of our free cash flow definition. Typically, our receivables age 4 to 5 months before they enter a term securitization. So this is a short-term investment and not a long-term investment in the business. 
Now turning to the third quarter. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.84 to $1.87, which includes an $8 million foreign exchange impact. You'll note seasonality differences between our expectations and current analyst estimates. Our results are more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter this year, reflecting expected revenue improvements in timeshare as new sale sites become fully operational and in our hotel business as the oil impact comparisons moderate. In addition, we expect increased benefit from disciplined cost management in the fourth quarter. Remember that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance either. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Steve?"

Upgrade owners produce more in a sales than a new owner does. So I think it's just us kind of getting our arms around the balancing of that and what it looks like. Again, we're not changing EBITDA because we're managing through it. But in means that each sales office might be a little bit lighter than we thought on -- as a result of the new owner generation.

We managed the amount of downpayment that we require from customers based on basically our compensation model with our salespeople. We incentivize them to get certain levels of downpayments. When we stood back and and looked at this during our strategic planning, we said, we're actually leaving a lot of money on the table because we have very good creditworthy customers that we are not allowing to borrow more than x amount of dollars. So what if we allow them to borrow a little bit more, would that give us an opportunity to actually grow our EBIT and future is we're going to be driving more interest income. And as you know, the spread there is pretty good. So this is more nothing to do with the defaults and everything. Everything to do with those strategically taking advantage of what we thought was a real opportunity. And we still feel that way, evidenced by the fact that our FICO scores were the same as they were before and they were kind of opening a little bit. This is not big moment. This is relatively small movement. And as I said, I think the last quarter, we probably wouldn't even talk about it if he didn't have a free cash flow impact. And potentially it does have a current period free cash flow impact is we don't recover those -- the cash that we put out for those receivables until [indiscernible]  Securitization, which generally takes 3 to 4 months. So it's really just -- if not for the cash flow thing, you probably wouldn't even notice it. But it's I think it's the right strategic right thing to do for us in the company for the long-term and that's why we made a decision to do it. One other thing I'd say in your first question, Harry, is don't lose sight of the fact that this business is still hitting its numbers, its EBITDA numbers despite pressure from the provisions. So these guys are really good at managing their business. They're very thoughtful. And when they see pressures like this as we did with a few years ago, we adapt and adjust and we make our numbers. And that's one thing we're very committed to do with this business, and we've done it successfully for 10 years now."

And so that is what we're delivering. We're obviously increasing our ability to do more bookings online. That something that's been very important.

Second quarter results were in line with our expectations. There is great energy across our businesses. While we execute on near-term objectives, we're also looking ahead, making sure we are continually innovating and making prudent investments to ensure strong continued growth in the years to come. Let's take a look at the key initiatives in each of our businesses. Wyndham Hotel Group is making investments in 3 key areas to ensure that business is well-positioned for the future. First, we are redefining what technology means for economy in midscale hotels; second, as we discussed in recent quarters, we are taking a fresh look at our brands and the guest experience; and third, we are reinventing hotel loyalty with some industry-leading improvements to Wyndham Rewards. Our goals are to continue to increase our value proposition to both our hotel owners and consumers and to drive higher contribution for our hotel owners. We are convinced that this direction is absolutely the correct path to take even though we are implementing these plans in a decelerating RevPAR environment. 
As you might recall, effective January 1 of this year, Wyndham Exchange & Rental become Wyndham Destination Network. The name reflects our expanded vision for the business. We are leveraging the strength of our portfolio of unique vacation accommodations to provide our worldwide customer base with the options to vacation the way they want. We believe that executing this vision will result in higher combined growth than exchange growth or Vacation Rental growth alone. On a practical level, that means we are enhancing technology, continuing to leverage our yield management capabilities and strengthening our marketing across brands. In addition, we recently launched a project to develop the next generation of RCI product offerings. This business continues to deliver on its strategy despite modest growth in the exchange industry and potential FX headwinds in Europe, resulting from Brexit. 
Finally, in Wyndham Vacation Ownership, we spent the past couple of years transforming our sales process to ensure a great experience for new and existing owners. We've opened new sales centers in key vacation destinations, which will be important to bring new owners into our system. That's our focus. We are increasing our new owner growth target to the mid-teens this year, and we're on track to hit that number with a 13% increase recorded in the second quarter. 
In setting this goal, we realized the short-term margin impact, but the lifetime value of the timeshare buyer remains highly compelling. Also, as we discussed in our last call, our progress has been somewhat muted by the unexpected increase in third-party guided defaults. 
Let me take a moment here to update you on that topic. We are vigorously pursuing legal alternatives against individuals and companies that might improperly be targeting our owners. We filed a lawsuit, and discovery is underway. But at this point, there are no silver bullets. While we're aggressively exploring all options, we think this situation may be a situation that we lap before we solve. Given its size, we believe it is manageable situation as evidenced by our maintaining EBITDA guidance for the year. So stepping back, let me say that as usual, while headwinds do exist, we believe our operational agenda establishes the correct long-term direction for our company.
Now turning to the quarter. Let me point out a few operating highlights in each of the business units. Let's start with the Hotel Group. As the world's largest hotel franchisor with a concentration in the economy segment, we see a unique opportunity to leverage our strength to enhance the economy hotel experience for both hotel owners and consumer, consumers in new ways and on an unprecedented scale. While much of the industry's recent development and innovation has been focused in the upscale -- upper upscale and luxury segments, 40% of all rooms are purchased in economy and midscale hotels. We expect this number to continue growing as the global middle class increases from $2 billion to $5 billion over the next 15 years. Many of our brands Days Inn, Ramada, Travelodge and Super 8, have a rich heritage in U.S. brand awareness of over 90%. 
We are working to enhance the guest experience and tap the full potential of our brands to ensure that we resonate with the next generation of travelers. We initiated this effort a little over a year ago with the transformation of the Wyndham Rewards program. We eliminated award tiers, blackout dates and other features that make loyalty programs frustrating, confusing and unattainable for many customers. The result of this transformation is that redemptions are up over 90% and nearly 6 million people have joined the program since its relaunch. 
Our goal is to create the industry's top-ranked loyalty program. To support that effort, our summer umbrella marketing market campaign is underway now through the busy Labor Day week, bolstered by a $20 million national advertising campaign featuring the Wyndham Rewards Wyzard. Of course, the best loyalty program in the world is irrelevant without a strong consumer value proposition. So we recently completed a global research study to help us enhance the guest experience and better define the value and positioning of each one of our hotel brands. Based on this research, we are developing new marketing campaigns, digital experiences, websites, on properties' amenities, amenities, travel perks and marketing partnerships.
On the technology front, our transformational cloud-based property management and central reservation system installations are proceeding on schedule. We recently completed a flawless migration of the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts, Wyndham Garden and Wyndham Gran Hotels to the SABRE central reservation system. And our migration to the SABRE property management system is progressing equally well. We now have nearly 1,600 of our economy and midscale hotels operating on the new PMS system, utilizing or preparing to utilize the new automated revenue management tools, the first for the economy space. 
Supporting all of this is our continued focus on quality as we work to remove properties that are no longer up to our brand's standards. These efforts have helped raise our overall customer satisfaction and net promoter scores across our brands. 
Now let's turn to Wyndham Destination Network. We continue to add to our scale, geographic reach and diversity of experiences within our portfolio. This year, RCI announced new affiliations in China, Japan, the Czech Republic, Portugal, the Canary Islands, England and Mexico. These affiliations include one-of-a-kind experiences such as the family-themed Nickelodeon hotels and resorts in Punta Cana and 2 resorts within the first Cirque du Soleil theme park, which is now under development in Nuevo Vallarta.
All told, Wyndham Destination Network offers more than 112,000 properties to the everyday traveler in over 100 countries. We're seeing strong transaction growth in Croatia, Spain, Belgium and The Netherlands, and the outlook is strong for the summer season with third quarter Vacation Rental bookings up 8% compared to 2015. 
Now I'd like to take a moment here to briefly comment on Brexit and why we don't expect any operational effect on our business. 13% of Wyndham Worldwide revenues comes from Europe. The majority of this from Vacation Rentals. While we are predominantly domestic drive to vacations. 90% of our Vacation Rental transactions in the U.K. are made by U.K. consumers. The same applies in Continental Europe, where over 90% of transactions are made by continental Europeans, primarily German, Dutch and Danish consumers traveling to Continental European destinations. Our rental brands have traditionally performed well in periods of economic and political turmoil because of our outstanding drive to locations and strong value proposition. And our large inventory in the U.K. and nearly 40,000 units positions us well should demand for U.K. vacations increase due to the depreciation of the pound. So while we may experience some additional FX headwinds resulting from the Brexit decision, which Tom will discuss in a moment, we do not expect any change in overall demand or impact on bookings.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. As I mentioned earlier, the team is doing a great job of executing their plan to bring in new owners. Our new sales centers in New York, St. Thomas, Puerto Rico, Southern California and Las Vegas are performing well, generating strong growth in new owner tour flow. About half of our new owner tours are source through our community marketing programs and alliances, which put the Wyndham Vacation Ownership product front and center in desirable vacation locations. Our community marketing programs include local outreach in malls and represent -- representation at events such as NASCAR. 
We focus on venue and alliance partners whose customers match our timeshare owner demographics. Our alliance partners share a commitment to truly knowing their customers and providing great experiences for them. These partnerships provide Wyndham Vacation Ownership with access to potential tours, while enabling existing owners to use their points for new services, benefits or products offered by our alliance partners. Our partners typically benefit from increased product exposure and incremental income while we gain scalable access to large segments of consumers. It's a win for us, for our partners and for our owners. We've enjoyed much success over the years of partnering with major brands to fuel our growth and expansion in markets such as Caesars in Las Vegas, Outrigger in Hawaii and Margaritaville in the Caribbean. Of course, we also continue to connect our hotels and vacation ownership brands through Wyndham Rewards. 
We are constantly improving and enhancing our marketing efforts for distribution and efficiency. One great recent example of a new alliance is Norwegian Cruise lines. Potential new owners can purchase land and sea vacations combining a cruise with a stay at a nearby Wyndham resort. Another is our alliance with Avis Budget Group, which includes a call transfer program and also enables our owners to rent a car using their timeshare points. And we recently signed a new alliance with a major tour operator in New York. Individually, none of these sources has intended to account more than 5% of our tour flow, but collectively, they serve to broaden our marketing reach and grow our pipeline of perspective new owners. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tom for details on the quarter's results. Tom?"
31063165,367636275,1013651,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. As Steve mentioned, results for the second quarter were in line with our expectations. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA increased 3% in the quarter as higher revenues at our bus",1882,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. As Steve mentioned, results for the second quarter were in line with our expectations. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA increased 3% in the quarter as higher revenues at our businesses were muted by higher provision for loan loss at Vacation Ownership, which while large, was in line with our expectations. We generated $616 million of free cash flow in the first 6 months of the year compared to $625 million over the first 6 months of 2015. Now recall that 2016 results include the negative effect of an unanticipated Venezuelan currency devaluation in the first quarter, which reduced free cash flow by $24 million. In total, our free cash flow has been adversely affected by $35 million of unexpected foreign exchange headwinds over the first 6 months of 2016, including the impact from Venezuela and an additional $11 million, primarily from the devaluation of the British pound. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of stock for $150 million. We've reduced our weighted average share count by 7% year-over-year through share repurchases made during the last 12 months. In addition, we repurchased 600,000 shares for $42 million so far in the third quarter of 2016.
Now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units. At our Hotel Group, revenues were flat, reflecting difficult year-over-year comparisons. Higher royalties and growth in the Wyndham Rewards Credit Card Program were offset by the absence of $3 million of global conference fees and $2 million in termination fees from 2 large properties that left the system in the second quarter of 2015.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 4% reflecting higher royalties and growth in the Wyndham Rewards credit card program as well as cost containment measures, offset somewhat by the lower termination fees. 
Domestic RevPAR increased 2%, that increase reflects higher room rates. Excluding oil-producing regions, domestic RevPAR actually grew 3.3%. RevPAR in the oil-producing markets was down 16%. Remember that RevPAR in these regions was down 28% in the first quarter, so we're happy to see some sequential improvement. Systemwide RevPAR was flat in constant currency, pressured by the continued unit growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China, which has also been experiencing some market softness and continued weakness in the Canadian oil markets. Excluding China and in constant currency, global RevPAR increased 1.6%, which includes about 120 basis points unfavorable impact from domestic and Canadian oil markets. 
Net system size grew 2.2% year-over-year, which is net of the impact of our continued focus on improving the overall quality of our system. Our development pipeline is nearly 128,000 rooms, that's a 10% increase over prior year, which includes a 21% increase in domestic new construction activity with a concentration in our higher end brands, particularly our Wyndham brand.
Moving on to our Destination segment. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, revenues increased 1%; and EBITDA 2%. At RCI, exchange revenues increased 1% in constant currency, reflecting a 0.7% increase in the average number of members and a 0.3% increase in revenue per member. Vacation Rentals revenue for the quarter was also up 1% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions. A 4% increase in volume was offset by a 3.3% decline in the average net price per rental. Transaction growth was particularly strong in the U.K. There is no seasons business as well as our Denmark-based Novasol brands, and was reduced a bit due to the shift of the Easter holiday into the first quarter of 2016. 
Faster growth in our more moderate product offerings adversely impacted the average net price per rental. 
At our Vacation Ownership business, revenues increased 1% and EBITDA 3%. Results benefited from an increase in gross VOI sales and property management fees, partially offset by a higher provision for loan losses. EBITDA further benefited from lower cost of goods sold. 
Gross VOI sales increased 3% in constant currency, and the number of new owners increased 13%, in line with our previously stated goal of increasing new owner sales. 
Sales to existing owners was flat. The growth in the gross VOI sales reflected a 3.4% increase in tour flow, offset by a 0.8% constant currency decline of VPG. Now VPG was impacted by higher sales to new owners, which are generally less sufficient than upgrade sales. While tour flow benefited from higher arrivals in tours at both our newer and existing sales centers.
Second quarter consumer finance portfolio performance was in line with our expectations at the end of the first quarter, which included the activity by third parties, encouraging our owners to cancel their contracts. 
Our average FICO score of originations during the quarter was 727, and that's consistent with our underwriting standards of the past year. 
Defaults for the quarter were $74 million, that's an increase of $14 million, which was almost entirely due to the organized third-party efforts. Both of these numbers were consistent with our expectations. The provision for loan loss was $90 million in the second quarter, resulting in an overall reserve level of 17.7%, consistent with recent levels over the past 3 years. It's worth emphasizing that the increase in the provision is in line with our expectations when we last spoke to you in April, with the breakdown as follows: $12 million from third parties causing our owners to default; $8 million from higher sales volume and financing propensity; and $10 million from comparisons to favorable performance trends in the second quarter of 2015.
Remember that the provision flow-through to EBITDA is approximately 60%. As Steve said, we're continuing to work on the third-party issue. And in the meantime, the situation is tracking to our expectations. We calculate that the EBITDA impact in the first 6 months has been around $15 million. We estimate the third quarter EBITDA effect to be $8 million.
Company-wide net interest expense increased by $4 million in the second quarter compared with the same period of 2015, reflecting higher levels of debt, including the $350 million  5.1% bonds issued last September, as well as the absence of a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap that we terminated in the second quarter of 2015. Depreciation also increased as we brought new long-term projects into service. Corporate expenses increased by $2 million, largely due to higher stock-based compensation expenses, and these expenses were offset somewhat by cost-cutting initiatives.
At Vacation Ownership, we completed our second term securitization of the year in July. The $375 million Sierra 2016-2 transaction had a 90% advance rate and 2.42% weighted average coupon, that's nearly 80 basis points below our prior 2016-1 transaction, as we benefited from lower post-Brexit interest rates and generally improved market conditions.
Now let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we're increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to $5.68 to $5.82 for the full year, and diluted share count goes to 111.8 million shares, reflecting the benefit of our second quarter share repurchases.
We're fine tuning our revenue guidance, lowering the overall range by $150 million. Approximately $50 million of the adjustment relates primarily to a forecast correction in our hotel management gross up at the Hotel Group, which has no EBITDA impact. The remainder is at Vacation Ownership and primarily reflects our best view of the impact of third-party prompted defaults. Just a reminder in timeshare accounting, the provision for anticipated defaults is a counter revenue account. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance remains unchanged at $1,375,000,000 to $1,400,000,000. Note that this guidance incorporates a negative $17 million year-over-year EBITDA impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. $6 million higher than in the full year guidance that we issued in April, largely due to the impact of Brexit on the British pound.
We expect the EBITDA impact from third-party defaults to be around $30 million this year. But we are holding our adjusted EBITDA guidance range for Vacation Ownership and the overall company. However, given these headwinds, we are more comfortable at the lower end of our EBITDA guidance range. There are no changes to drive our guidance. Although remember we said that on the last call that RevPAR would be at the lower end of our guidance range, which implies flat global RevPAR.
Our neighborhood target for our 2016 free cash flow remains $800 million. As always, keep in mind that there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or any given year, so we view $800 million as a neighborhood target rather than an exact figure. In addition, we are facing 2 free cash flow headwinds this year. First, as discussed, we have $35 million of unexpected foreign exchange headwinds year-to-date. Second, remember that as part of our strategy to drive new owner growth to timeshare, we are increasing financing to creditworthy customers, which will have an adverse short-term impact on free cash flow in 2016. However, we regained around 90% of that spend in financing activities from the receivables we securitized, and that is outside of our free cash flow definition. Typically, our receivables age 4 to 5 months before they enter a term securitization. So this is a short-term investment and not a long-term investment in the business. 
Now turning to the third quarter. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.84 to $1.87, which includes an $8 million foreign exchange impact. You'll note seasonality differences between our expectations and current analyst estimates. Our results are more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter this year, reflecting expected revenue improvements in timeshare as new sale sites become fully operational and in our hotel business as the oil impact comparisons moderate. In addition, we expect increased benefit from disciplined cost management in the fourth quarter. Remember that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance either. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Steve?  Thanks, Tom. Monday will mark our 10-year anniversary of Wyndham Worldwide's listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Before we close, I'd like to take a moment to comment on our performance since then. Between dividends and share repurchases, we have returned nearly $6 billion to our shareholders. The cumulative impact of our share repurchase activity over this period has been a 45% reduction in our share count. This, combined with a strong operating performance and growth, has driven significant increases in key metrics. Just a few -- put a few numbers around it. The adjusted EBITDA is up over 80%, and adjusted EPS is up over 225%. Looking forward, we see great opportunities in all of our businesses for future growth. We remain relentlessly focused on continuous innovation and execution of strategies that will deliver compelling value to our customers and great returns for our shareholders, both now and in the future. 
I am extremely proud of the culture we built and the team we have, delivering value to our customers and our shareholders every day. And the passion of our 39,000 associates is also a source of great pride. Thanks for your continued support. Enjoy the summer. Travel and remember to tune in to the Wyndham Championship, August 18 to 21, on the Golf Channel and CBS. 
And with that, Erika, we can now open the call for questions."

And you gave a lot of data on this call, and I just want to make sure I'm understanding this correctly. So revenues of $150 million this guidance versus the prior quarter's full year guidance. $50 million relates to hotel pass-throughs. That leaves us with $100 million. Of that $100 million, the majority of that relates to loan-loss provision in Vacation Ownership. And then you mentioned about 60% flow-through on that impact, which would generate $60 million of EBITDA. And I think you said the impact from the third-party activity is  $30 million for this year.

We are driving more new owner growth, which is what we're really focused on. And it does come at the expense of some gross VOI. If you imagine a sales center, where we have 30 sales associates, we're putting more new owners in front of those sales associates. So that means they're selling new owners versus upgrade owners. Upgrade owners produce more in a sales than a new owner does. So I think it's just us kind of getting our arms around the balancing of that and what it looks like. Again, we're not changing EBITDA because we're managing through it. But it means that each sales office might be a little bit lighter than we thought on -- as a result of the new owner generation. We like the outcome. It's what we're shooting for. It just needs a very minor modification on the top."

And when you are the largest in the industry, you obviously have the largest opportunity for people to make money based on your customer base. And so I think that we probably are a little bit more of a soft target for people because we're so much bigger. But I think everybody is seeing it. And we've had to deal with this before and we'll shut it down. I think importantly, as I said, we see it, we see as being able to tackle this problem. But we probably won't get it deep back until we start lapping it, which is next year. But we feel that even with what we're seeing, we're covering it and we're keeping our EBITDA guidance the same. The fact is, it came in this quarter right on line with our expectation. I could not have said that about the first quarter because we weren't really sure of what was going to happen. We were -- we had a broader estimate. This quarter, we're pretty accurate with what we saw coming in. So we feel like we've got our our arms around this. It's not what we would like, which for us just to go away. But these guys, they don't just go away.

We managed the amount of downpayment that we require from customers based on basically our compensation model with our salespeople. We incentivize them to get certain levels of downpayments. When we stood back and and looked at this during our strategic planning, we said, we're actually leaving a lot of money on the table because we have very good creditworthy customers that we are not allowing to borrow more than x amount of dollars. So what if we allow them to borrow a little bit more, would that give us an opportunity to actually grow our EBITDA in the future is we're going to be driving more interest income. And as you know, the spread there is pretty good. So this is more -- this had nothing to do with the default setting. This has everything to do with strategically taking advantage of what we've thought was a real opportunity. And we still feel that way, evidenced by the fact that our FICO scores were the same as they were before, and we're kind of opening this spigot a little bit. This is not big movement. This is relatively small movement. And as I said, I think the last quarter, we probably wouldn't even talk about it if he didn't have a free cash flow impact. And potentially it does have a current period free cash flow impact is we don't recover those -- the cash that we put out for those receivables until gone through a securitization, which generally takes 3 to 4 months. So it's really just -- if not for the cash flow thing, you probably wouldn't even notice it. But it's -- I think it's the right -- strategically the right thing for us to do for the company for the long term and that's why we didn't made the decision to do it. One other thing I'd say in your first question, Harry, is don't lose sight of the fact that this business is still hitting its numbers, its EBITDA numbers, despite this pressure from the provisions. So these guys are really good at managing their business. They're very thoughtful. And when they see pressures like this as we did with the seasons assist a few years ago, we adapt and adjust and we make our numbers. And that's one thing we're very committed to do with this business, and we've done it successfully for 10 years now."

If that incremental shift equates to $15,000 or whatever the number is, whereabouts, that gets defaulted, that adds up to a lot of money in a hurry. But as Steve said, the level of our owner enjoyment is exceptionally strong. And so we're talking about in sort of an incremental effect here."

Second quarter results were in line with our expectations. There is great energy across our businesses. While we execute on near-term objectives, we're also looking ahead, making sure we are continually innovating and making prudent investments to ensure strong continued growth in the years to come. Let's take a look at the key initiatives in each of our businesses. Wyndham Hotel Group is making investments in 3 key areas to ensure the business is well-positioned for the future. First, we are redefining what technology means for economy and midscale hotels; second, as we discussed in recent quarters, we are taking a fresh look at our brands and the guest experience; and third, we are reinventing hotel loyalty with some industry-leading improvements to Wyndham Rewards. Our goals are to continue to increase our value proposition to both our hotel owners and consumers and to drive higher contribution for our hotel owners. We are convinced that this direction is absolutely the correct path to take even though we are implementing these plans in a decelerating RevPAR environment. 
As you might recall, effective January 1 of this year, Wyndham Exchange & Rental become Wyndham Destination Network. The name reflects our expanded vision for the business. We are leveraging the strength of our portfolio of unique vacation accommodations to provide our worldwide customer base with the options to vacation the way they want. We believe that executing this vision will result in higher combined growth than exchange growth or Vacation Rental growth alone. On a practical level, that means we are enhancing technology, continuing to leverage our yield management capabilities and strengthening our marketing across brands. In addition, we recently launched a project to develop the next generation of RCI product offerings. This business continues to deliver on its strategy despite modest growth in the exchange industry and potential FX headwinds in Europe, resulting from Brexit. 
Finally, in Wyndham Vacation Ownership, we spent the past couple of years transforming our sales process to ensure a great experience for new and existing owners. We've opened new sales centers in key vacation destinations, which will be important to bring new owners into our system. That's our focus. We are increasing our new owner growth target to the mid-teens this year, and we're on track to hit that number with a 13% increase recorded in the second quarter. 
In setting this goal, we realized the short-term margin impact, but the lifetime value of the timeshare buyer remains highly compelling. Also, as we discussed in our last call, our progress has been somewhat muted by the unexpected increase in third-party guided defaults. 
Let me take a moment here to update you on that topic. We are vigorously pursuing legal alternatives against individuals and companies that might improperly be targeting our owners. We have filed a lawsuit, and discovery is under way. But at this point, there are no silver bullets. While we're aggressively exploring all options, we think this situation may be a situation that we lap before we solve. Given its size, we believe it is a manageable situation, as evidenced by our maintaining EBITDA guidance for the year. So stepping back, let me say that as usual, while headwinds do exist, we believe our operational agenda establishes the correct long-term direction for our company.
Now turning to the quarter. Let me point out a few operating highlights in each of the business units. Let's start with the Hotel Group. As the world's largest hotel franchisor with a concentration in the economy segment, we see a unique opportunity to leverage our strength to enhance the economy hotel experience for both hotel owners and consumers in new ways and on an unprecedented scale. While much of the industry's recent development and innovation has been focused in the upscale -- upper-upscale and luxury segments, 40% of all rooms are purchased in economy and midscale hotels. We expect this number to continue growing as the global middle class increases from 2 billion to 5 billion over the next 15 years. Many of our brands Days Inn, Ramada, Travelodge and Super 8, have a rich heritage and U.S. brand awareness of over 90%. 
We are working to enhance the guest experience and tap the full potential of our brands to ensure that we resonate with the next generation of travelers. We initiated this effort a little over a year ago with the transformation of the Wyndham Rewards program. We eliminated award tiers, blackout dates and other features that make loyalty programs frustrating, confusing and unattainable for many customers. The result of this transformation is that redemptions are up over 90%, and nearly 6 million people have joined the program since its relaunch. 
Our goal is to create the industry's top-ranked loyalty program. To support that effort, our summer umbrella marketing campaign is under way now through the busy Labor Day week, bolstered by a $20 million national advertising campaign featuring the Wyndham Rewards Wyzard. Of course, the best loyalty program in the world is irrelevant without a strong consumer value proposition. So we recently completed a global research study to help us enhance the guest experience and better define the value and positioning of each one of our hotel brands. Based on this research, we are developing new marketing campaigns, digital experiences, websites, on properties' amenities, travel perks and marketing partnerships.
On the technology front, our transformational cloud-based property management and central reservation system installations are proceeding on schedule. We recently completed a flawless migration of the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts, Wyndham Garden and Wyndham Gran Hotels to the SABRE central reservation system. And our migration to the SABRE property management system is progressing equally well. We now have nearly 1,600 of our economy and midscale hotels operating on the new PMS system, utilizing or preparing to utilize the new automated revenue management tools, the first for the economy space. 
Supporting all of this is our continued focus on quality as we work to remove properties that are no longer up to our brand's standards. These efforts have helped raise our overall customer satisfaction and net promoter scores across our brands. 
Now let's turn to Wyndham Destination Network. We continue to add to our scale, geographic reach and diversity of experiences within our portfolio. This year, RCI announced new affiliations in China, Japan, the Czech Republic, Portugal, the Canary Islands, England and Mexico. These affiliations include one-of-a-kind experiences such as the family-themed Nickelodeon hotels and resorts in Punta Cana and 2 resorts within the first Cirque du Soleil theme park, which is now under development in Nuevo Vallarta.
All told, Wyndham Destination Network offers more than 112,000 properties to the everyday traveler in over 100 countries. We're seeing strong transaction growth in Croatia, Spain, Belgium and The Netherlands, and the outlook is strong for the summer season, with third quarter Vacation Rental bookings up 8% compared to 2015. 
Now I'd like to take a moment here to briefly comment on Brexit and why we don't expect any operational effect on our business. 13% of Wyndham Worldwide revenues comes from Europe. The majority of this from Vacation Rentals. While we are predominantly domestic drive to vacations, 90% of our Vacation Rental transactions in the U.K. are made by U.K. consumers. The same applies in Continental Europe, where over 90% of transactions are made by continental Europeans, primarily German, Dutch and Danish consumers traveling to Continental European destinations. Our rental brands have traditionally performed well in periods of economic and political turmoil because of our outstanding drive-to locations and strong value proposition. And our large inventory in the U.K., at nearly 40,000 units, positions us well should demand for U.K. vacations increase due to the depreciation of the pound. So while we may experience some additional FX headwinds resulting from the Brexit decision, which Tom will discuss in a moment, we do not expect any change in overall demand or impact on bookings.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. As I mentioned earlier, the team is doing a great job of executing their plan to bring in new owners. Our new sales centers in New York, St. Thomas, Puerto Rico, Southern California and Las Vegas are performing well, generating strong growth in new owner tour flow. About half of our new owner tours are sourced through our community marketing programs and alliances, which put the Wyndham Vacation Ownership product front and center in desirable vacation locations. Our community marketing programs include local outreach in malls and represent -- representation at events such as NASCAR. 
We focus on venue and alliance partners whose customers match our timeshare-owner demographics. Our alliance partners share a commitment to truly knowing their customers and providing great experiences for them. These partnerships provide Wyndham Vacation Ownership with access to potential tours, while enabling existing owners to use their points for new services, benefits or products offered by our alliance partners. Our partners typically benefit from the increased product exposure and incremental income while we gain scalable access to large segments of consumers. It's a win for us, for our partners and for our owners. We've enjoyed much success over the years of partnering with major brands to fuel our growth and expansion in markets such as Caesars in Las Vegas, Outrigger in Hawaii and Margaritaville in the Caribbean. Of course, we also continue to connect our hotels and vacation ownership brands through Wyndham Rewards. 
We are constantly improving and enhancing our marketing efforts for distribution and efficiency. One great recent example of a new alliance is Norwegian Cruise Lines. Potential new owners can purchase land and sea vacations combining a cruise with a stay at a nearby Wyndham resort. Another is our alliance with Avis Budget Group, which includes a call transfer program and also enables our owners to rent a car using their timeshare points. And we recently signed a new alliance with a major tour operator in New York. Individually, none of these sources is intended to account more than 5% of our tour flow, but collectively, they serve to broaden our marketing reach and grow our pipeline of perspective new owners. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tom for details on the quarter's results. Tom?"
31063165,367636275,1013790,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. As Steve mentioned, results for the second quarter were in line with our expectations. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA increased 3% in the quarter as higher revenues at our bus",1879,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. As Steve mentioned, results for the second quarter were in line with our expectations. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA increased 3% in the quarter as higher revenues at our businesses were muted by a higher provision for loan loss at Vacation Ownership, which, while large, was in line with our expectations. We generated $616 million of free cash flow in the first 6 months of the year compared to $625 million over the first 6 months of 2015. Now recall that 2016 results include the negative effect of an unanticipated Venezuelan currency devaluation in the first quarter, which reduced free cash flow by $24 million. In total, our free cash flow has been adversely affected by $35 million of unexpected foreign exchange headwinds over the first 6 months of 2016, including the impact from Venezuela and an additional $11 million, primarily from a devaluation of the British pound. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of stock for $150 million. We've reduced our weighted average share count by 7% year-over-year through share repurchases made during the last 12 months. In addition, we've repurchased 600,000 shares for $42 million so far in the third quarter of 2016.
Now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units. At our Hotel Group, revenues were flat, reflecting difficult year-over-year comparisons. Higher royalties and growth in the Wyndham Rewards Credit Card Program were offset by the absence of $3 million of global conference fees and $2 million in termination fees from 2 large properties that left the system in the second quarter of 2015.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 4% reflecting higher royalties and growth in the Wyndham Rewards credit card program as well as cost containment measures, offset somewhat by the lower termination fees. 
Domestic RevPAR increased 2%.  That increase reflects higher room rates. Excluding oil-producing regions, domestic RevPAR actually grew 3.3%. RevPAR in the oil-producing markets was down 16%. Remember that RevPAR in these regions was down 28% in the first quarter, so we're happy to see some sequential improvement. Systemwide RevPAR was flat in constant currency, pressured by the continued unit growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China, which has also been experiencing some market softness and continued weakness in the Canadian oil markets. Excluding China and in constant currency, global RevPAR increased 1.6%, which includes about 120 basis points unfavorable impact from domestic and Canadian oil markets. 
Net system size grew 2.2% year-over-year, which is net of the impact of our continued focus on improving the overall quality of our system. Our development pipeline is nearly 128,000 rooms. That's a 10% increase over prior year, which includes a 21% increase in domestic new construction activity, with a concentration in our higher-end brands, particularly our Wyndham brand.
Moving on to our Destination segment. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, revenues increased 1% and EBITDA 2%. At RCI, exchange revenues increased 1% in constant currency, reflecting a 0.7% increase in the average number of members and a 0.3% increase in revenue per member. Vacation Rentals revenue for the quarter was also up 1% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions. A 4% increase in volume was offset by a 3.3% decline in the average net price per rental. Transaction growth was particularly strong in the U.K.-based Hoseasons business as well as our Denmark-based Novasol brands, and was reduced a bit due to the shift of the Easter holiday into the first quarter of 2016. 
Faster growth in our more moderate product offerings adversely impacted the average net price per rental. 
At our Vacation Ownership business, revenues increased 1% and EBITDA 3%. Results benefited from an increase in gross VOI sales and property management fees, partially offset by a higher provision for loan losses. EBITDA further benefited from lower cost of goods sold. 
Gross VOI sales increased 3% in constant currency, and the number of new owners increased 13%, in line with our previously stated goal of increasing new owner sales. 
Sales to existing owners was flat. The growth in the gross VOI sales reflected a 3.4% increase in tour flow, offset by a 0.8% constant currency decline of VPG. Now VPG was impacted by higher sales to new owners, which are generally less efficient than upgrade sales. While tour flow benefited from higher arrivals in tours at both our newer and existing sales centers.
Second quarter consumer finance portfolio performance was in line with our expectations at the end of the first quarter, which included the activity by third parties, encouraging our owners to cancel their contracts. 
Our average FICO score of originations during the quarter was 727, and that's consistent with our underwriting standards of the past year. 
Defaults for the quarter were $74 million. That's an increase of $14 million, which was almost entirely due to the organized third-party efforts. Both of these numbers were consistent with our expectations. The provision for loan loss was $90 million in the second quarter, resulting in an overall reserve level of 17.7%, consistent with recent levels over the past 3 years. It's worth emphasizing that the increase in the provision is in line with our expectations when we last spoke to you in April, with the breakdown as follows: $12 million from third parties, causing our owners to default; $8 million from higher sales volume and financing propensity; and $10 million from comparisons to favorable performance trends in the second quarter of 2015.
Remember that the provision flow-through to EBITDA is approximately 60%. As Steve said, we're continuing to work on the third-party issue. And in the meantime, the situation is tracking to our expectations. We calculate that the EBITDA impact in the first 6 months has been around $15 million. We estimate the third quarter EBITDA effect to be $8 million.
Company-wide net interest expense increased by $4 million in the second quarter compared with the same period of 2015, reflecting higher levels of debt, including the $350 million 5.1% bonds issued last September, as well as the absence of a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap that we terminated in the second quarter of 2015. Depreciation also increased as we brought new long-term projects into service. Corporate expenses increased by $2 million, largely due to higher stock-based compensation expenses, and these expenses were offset somewhat by cost-cutting initiatives.
At Vacation Ownership, we completed our second-term securitization of the year in July. The $375 million Sierra 2016-2 transaction had a 90% advance rate and a 2.42% weighted average coupon. That's nearly 80 basis points below our prior 2016-1 transaction, as we benefited from lower post-Brexit interest rates and generally improved market conditions.
Now let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we're increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to $5.68 to $5.82 for the full year, and diluted share count goes to 111.8 million shares, reflecting the benefit of our second quarter share repurchases.
We're fine tuning our revenue guidance, lowering the overall range by $150 million. Approximately $50 million of the adjustment relates primarily to a forecast correction in our hotel management gross up at the Hotel Group, which has no EBITDA impact. The remainder is at Vacation Ownership and primarily reflects our best view of the impact of third-party prompted defaults. Just a reminder in timeshare accounting, the provision for anticipated defaults is a contra revenue account. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance remains unchanged at $1,375,000,000 to $1,400,000,000. Note that this guidance incorporates a negative $17 million year-over-year EBITDA impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. $6 million higher than in the full year guidance that we issued in April, largely due to the impact of Brexit on the British pound.
We expect the EBITDA impact from third-party defaults to be around $30 million this year. But we are holding our adjusted EBITDA guidance range for Vacation Ownership and the overall company. However, given these headwinds, we are more comfortable at the lower end of our EBITDA guidance range. There are no changes to drive our guidance. Although remember we said that on the last call that RevPAR would be at the lower end of our guidance range, which implies flat global RevPAR.
Our neighborhood target for our 2016 free cash flow remains $800 million. As always, keep in mind that there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or any given year, so we view $800 million as a neighborhood target rather than an exact figure. In addition, we are facing 2 free cash flow headwinds this year. First, as discussed, we have $35 million of unexpected foreign exchange headwinds year-to-date. Second, remember that as part of our strategy to drive new owner growth at timeshare, we are increasing financing to creditworthy customers, which will have an adverse short-term impact on free cash flow in 2016. However, we regained around 90% of that spend in financing activities from the receivables we securitized, and that is outside of our free cash flow definition. Typically, our receivables age 4 to 5 months before they enter a term securitization. So this is a short-term investment and not a long-term investment in the business. 
Now turning to the third quarter. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.84 to $1.87, which includes an $8 million foreign exchange impact. You'll note seasonality differences between our expectations and current analyst estimates. Our results are more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter this year, reflecting expected revenue improvements in timeshare as new sales sites become fully operational and in our hotel business as the oil impact comparisons moderate. In addition, we expect increased benefit from disciplined cost management in the fourth quarter. Remember that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance either. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Steve?  Thanks, Tom. Monday will mark our 10-year anniversary of Wyndham Worldwide's listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Before we close, I'd like to take a moment to comment on our performance since then. Between dividends and share repurchases, we have returned nearly $6 billion to our shareholders. The cumulative impact of our share repurchase activity over this period has been a 45% reduction in our share count. This, combined with a strong operating performance and growth, has driven significant increases in key metrics. Just a few -- to put a few numbers around it, the adjusted EBITDA is up over 80%, and adjusted EPS is up over 225%. Looking forward, we see great opportunities in all of our businesses for future growth. We remain relentlessly focused on continuous innovation and execution of strategies that will deliver compelling value to our customers and great returns for our shareholders, both now and in the future. 
I am extremely proud of the culture we built and the team we have delivering value to our customers and our shareholders every day. And the passion of our 39,000 associates is also a source of great pride. Thanks for your continued support. Enjoy the summer, travel and remember to tune into the Wyndham Championship, August 18 to 21, on the Golf Channel and CBS. 
And with that, Erika, we can now open the call for questions."

If you imagine a sales center, where we have 30 sales associates, we're putting more new owners in front of those sales associates. So that means they're selling new owners versus upgrade owners. Upgrade owners produce more in a sale than a new owner does. So I think it's just us kind of getting our arms around the balancing of that and what it looks like. Again, we're not changing EBITDA because we're managing through it, but it means that each sales office might be a little bit lighter than we thought on -- as a result of the new-owner generation. We like the outcome. It's what we're shooting for. It just needs a very minor modification on the top."

And there's some other costs in one of our brands that are -- we are putting lower-cost inventory into one of our brands than we had in previous periods. It's a bit of a technical term, but that's what it basically comes down to sourcing lower-cost inventory through cycled inventory, and some of the new inventory we're putting into one of our brands is of lower costs."

We managed the amount of down payment that we require from customers based on basically our compensation model with our salespeople. We incentivize them to get certain levels of down payments. When we stood back and looked at this doing our strategic planning, we said, we're actually leaving a lot of money on the table because we have very good creditworthy customers that we are not allowing to borrow more than X amount of dollars. So what if we allow them to borrow a little bit more, would that give us an opportunity to actually grow our EBITDA in the future is we're going to be driving more interest income? And as you know, the spread there is pretty good. So this was more -- this had nothing to do with the default setting. This has everything to do with strategically taking advantage of what we thought was a real opportunity. And we still feel that way, evidenced by the fact that our FICO scores were the same as they were before, and we're kind of opening this spigot a little bit. This is not big movement. This is relatively small movement. And as I said, I think, the last quarter, we probably wouldn't even talk about it if he didn't have a free cash flow impact. It potentially does have a current-period free cash flow impact is we don't recover those -- the cash that we put out for those receivables until gone through a securitization, which generally takes 3 to 4 months. So it's really just -- if not for the cash flow thing, you probably wouldn't even notice it. But it's -- I think it's the right -- strategically the right thing for us to do for the company for the long term and that's why we didn't made the decision to do it. One other thing I'd say on your first question, Harry, is don't lose sight of the fact that this business is still hitting its numbers, its EBITDA numbers, despite this pressure from the provisions. So these guys are really good at managing their business. They're very thoughtful. And when they see pressures like this, as we did with the cease and desist a few years ago, we adapt and adjust and we make our numbers. And that's one thing we're very committed to do at this business, and we've done it successfully for 10 years now."

Well, that means that there's younger people buying the product than there used to be and yet our numbers and others in the industry continue to increase. So I think the fact is we are capturing them in our marketing net and they are buying. We do stress different things with our sales pitches. For example, we'll talk more about experiences. These millennials tend to lean towards experiences. So we make it more experiential of what you'll have with these trips and what you can take advantage of with timeshare. But that's just describing the product differently to suit the desires of the buyer. It doesn't change necessarily our product. It is just pointing out what you can do with your timeshare. And I think that the fact is the flexibility we gave timeshare buyers, both us and the rest of the industry, by going into a points-based product, really addressed much of what a millennial would want to see, which is I want more flexibility; I want more ability to make my vacations the way I want them to be. And so that is what we're delivering. We're obviously increasing our ability to do more bookings online. That's something that's been very important. We actually have been talking about this for several years. We're launching a new program called Voyager that is building that capability that will make it easier for people to go on their iPhone and make decisions about their vacation planning.

Second quarter results were in line with our expectations. There is great energy across our businesses. While we execute on near-term objectives, we're also looking ahead, making sure we are continually innovating and making prudent investments to ensure strong continued growth in the years to come. Let's take a look at the key initiatives in each of our businesses. Wyndham Hotel Group is making investments in 3 key areas to ensure the business is well-positioned for the future. First, we are redefining what technology means for economy and midscale hotels; second, as we discussed in recent quarters, we are taking a fresh look at our brands and the guest experience; and third, we are reinventing hotel loyalty with some industry-leading improvements to Wyndham Rewards. Our goals are to continue to increase our value proposition to both our hotel owners and consumers and to drive higher contribution for our hotel owners. We are convinced that this direction is absolutely the correct path to take even though we are implementing these plans in a decelerating RevPAR environment. 
As you might recall, effective January 1 of this year, Wyndham Exchange & Rental become Wyndham Destination Network. The name reflects our expanded vision for the business. We are leveraging the strength of our portfolio of unique vacation accommodations to provide our worldwide customer base with the options to vacation the way they want. We believe that executing this vision will result in higher combined growth than exchange growth or Vacation Rental growth alone. On a practical level, that means we are enhancing technology, continuing to leverage our yield management capabilities and strengthening our marketing across brands. In addition, we recently launched a project to develop the next generation of RCI product offerings. This business continues to deliver on its strategy despite modest growth in the exchange industry and potential FX headwinds in Europe, resulting from Brexit. 
Finally, in Wyndham Vacation Ownership, we spent the past couple of years transforming our sales process to ensure a great experience for new and existing owners. We've opened new sales centers in key vacation destinations, which will be important to bring new owners into our system. That's our focus. We are increasing our new owner growth target to the mid-teens this year, and we're on track to hit that number with a 13% increase recorded in the second quarter. 
In setting this goal, we realized the short-term margin impact, but the lifetime value of the timeshare buyer remains highly compelling. Also, as we discussed in our last call, our progress has been somewhat muted by the unexpected increase in third-party guided defaults. 
Let me take a moment here to update you on that topic. We are vigorously pursuing legal alternatives against individuals and companies that might improperly be targeting our owners. We have filed a lawsuit, and discovery is under way. But at this point, there are no silver bullets. While we're aggressively exploring all options, we think this situation may be a situation that we lap before we solve. Given its size, we believe it is a manageable situation, as evidenced by our maintaining EBITDA guidance for the year. So stepping back, let me say that as usual, while headwinds do exist, we believe our operational agenda establishes the correct long-term direction for our company.
Now turning to the quarter. Let me point out a few operating highlights in each of the business units. Let's start with the Hotel Group. As the world's largest hotel franchisor with a concentration in the economy segment, we see a unique opportunity to leverage our strength to enhance the economy hotel experience for both hotel owners and consumers in new ways and on an unprecedented scale. While much of the industry's recent development and innovation has been focused in the upscale -- upper-upscale and luxury segments, 40% of all rooms are purchased in economy and midscale hotels. We expect this number to continue growing as the global middle class increases from 2 billion to 5 billion over the next 15 years. Many of our brands Days Inn, Ramada, Travelodge and Super 8, have a rich heritage and U.S. brand awareness of over 90%. 
We are working to enhance the guest experience and tap the full potential of our brands to ensure that we resonate with the next generation of travelers. We initiated this effort a little over a year ago with the transformation of the Wyndham Rewards program. We eliminated award tiers, blackout dates and other features that make loyalty programs frustrating, confusing and unattainable for many customers. The result of this transformation is that redemptions are up over 90%, and nearly 6 million people have joined the program since its relaunch. 
Our goal is to create the industry's top-ranked loyalty program. To support that effort, our summer umbrella marketing campaign is under way now through the busy Labor Day week, bolstered by a $20 million national advertising campaign featuring the Wyndham Rewards Wyzard. Of course, the best loyalty program in the world is irrelevant without a strong consumer value proposition. So we recently completed a global research study to help us enhance the guest experience and better define the value and positioning of each one of our hotel brands. Based on this research, we are developing new marketing campaigns, digital experiences, websites, on properties' amenities, travel perks and marketing partnerships.
On the technology front, our transformational cloud-based property management and central reservation system installations are proceeding on schedule. We recently completed a flawless migration of the Wyndham Hotel and Resorts, Wyndham Garden and Wyndham Gran Hotels to the SABRE central reservation system. And our migration to the SABRE property management system is progressing equally well. We now have nearly 1,600 of our economy and midscale hotels operating on the new PMS system, utilizing or preparing to utilize the new automated revenue management tools, the first for the economy space. 
Supporting all of this is our continued focus on quality as we work to remove properties that are no longer up to our brand's standards. These efforts have helped raise our overall customer satisfaction and net promoter scores across our brands. 
Now let's turn to Wyndham Destination Network. We continue to add to our scale, geographic reach and diversity of experiences within our portfolio. This year, RCI announced new affiliations in China, Japan, the Czech Republic, Portugal, the Canary Islands, England and Mexico. These affiliations include one-of-a-kind experiences such as the family-themed Nickelodeon hotels and resorts in Punta Cana and 2 resorts within the first Cirque du Soleil theme park, which is now under development in Nuevo Vallarta.
All told, Wyndham Destination Network offers more than 112,000 properties to the everyday traveler in over 100 countries. We're seeing strong transaction growth in Croatia, Spain, Belgium and The Netherlands, and the outlook is strong for the summer season, with third quarter Vacation Rental bookings up 8% compared to 2015. 
Now I'd like to take a moment here to briefly comment on Brexit and why we don't expect any operational effect on our business. 13% of Wyndham Worldwide revenues comes from Europe. The majority of this from Vacation Rentals. While we are predominantly domestic drive to vacations, 90% of our Vacation Rental transactions in the U.K. are made by U.K. consumers. The same applies in Continental Europe, where over 90% of transactions are made by continental Europeans, primarily German, Dutch and Danish consumers traveling to Continental European destinations. Our rental brands have traditionally performed well in periods of economic and political turmoil because of our outstanding drive-to locations and strong value proposition. And our large inventory in the U.K., at nearly 40,000 units, positions us well should demand for U.K. vacations increase due to the depreciation of the pound. So while we may experience some additional FX headwinds resulting from the Brexit decision, which Tom will discuss in a moment, we do not expect any change in overall demand or impact on bookings.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. As I mentioned earlier, the team is doing a great job of executing their plan to bring in new owners. Our new sales centers in New York, St. Thomas, Puerto Rico, Southern California and Las Vegas are performing well, generating strong growth in new owner tour flow. About half of our new owner tours are sourced through our community marketing programs and alliances, which put the Wyndham Vacation Ownership product front and center in desirable vacation locations. Our community marketing programs include local outreach in malls and represent -- representation at events such as NASCAR. 
We focus on venue and alliance partners whose customers match our timeshare-owner demographics. Our alliance partners share a commitment to truly knowing their customers and providing great experiences for them. These partnerships provide Wyndham Vacation Ownership with access to potential tours, while enabling existing owners to use their points for new services, benefits or products offered by our alliance partners. Our partners typically benefit from the increased product exposure and incremental income while we gain scalable access to large segments of consumers. It's a win for us, for our partners and for our owners. We've enjoyed much success over the years of partnering with major brands to fuel our growth and expansion in markets such as Caesars in Las Vegas, Outrigger in Hawaii and Margaritaville in the Caribbean. Of course, we also continue to connect our hotels and vacation ownership brands through Wyndham Rewards. 
We are constantly improving and enhancing our marketing efforts for distribution and efficiency. One great recent example of a new alliance is Norwegian Cruise Lines. Potential new owners can purchase land and sea vacations combining a cruise with a stay at a nearby Wyndham resort. Another is our alliance with Avis Budget Group, which includes a call transfer program and also enables our owners to rent a car using their timeshare points. And we recently signed a new alliance with a major tour operator in New York. Individually, none of these sources is intended to account more than 5% of our tour flow, but collectively, they serve to broaden our marketing reach and grow our pipeline of perspective new owners. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tom for details on the quarter's results. Tom?"
31063165,367636275,1014596,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. As Steve mentioned, results for the second quarter were in line with our expectations. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA increased 3% in the quarter as higher revenues at our bus",1879,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. As Steve mentioned, results for the second quarter were in line with our expectations. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA increased 3% in the quarter as higher revenues at our businesses were muted by a higher provision for loan loss at Vacation Ownership, which, while large, was in line with our expectations. We generated $616 million of free cash flow in the first 6 months of the year compared to $625 million over the first 6 months of 2015. Now recall that 2016 results include the negative effect of an unanticipated Venezuelan currency devaluation in the first quarter, which reduced free cash flow by $24 million. In total, our free cash flow has been adversely affected by $35 million of unexpected foreign exchange headwinds over the first 6 months of 2016, including the impact from Venezuela and an additional $11 million, primarily from a devaluation of the British pound. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of stock for $150 million. We've reduced our weighted average share count by 7% year-over-year through share repurchases made during the last 12 months. In addition, we've repurchased 600,000 shares for $42 million so far in the third quarter of 2016.
Now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units. At our Hotel Group, revenues were flat, reflecting difficult year-over-year comparisons. Higher royalties and growth in the Wyndham Rewards Credit Card Program were offset by the absence of $3 million of global conference fees and $2 million in termination fees from 2 large properties that left the system in the second quarter of 2015.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 4% reflecting higher royalties and growth in the Wyndham Rewards credit card program as well as cost containment measures, offset somewhat by the lower termination fees. 
Domestic RevPAR increased 2%. That increase reflects higher room rates. Excluding oil-producing regions, domestic RevPAR actually grew 3.3%. RevPAR in the oil-producing markets was down 16%. Remember that RevPAR in these regions was down 28% in the first quarter, so we're happy to see some sequential improvement. Systemwide RevPAR was flat in constant currency, pressured by the continued unit growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China, which has also been experiencing some market softness and continued weakness in the Canadian oil markets. Excluding China and in constant currency, global RevPAR increased 1.6%, which includes about 120 basis points unfavorable impact from domestic and Canadian oil markets. 
Net system size grew 2.2% year-over-year, which is net of the impact of our continued focus on improving the overall quality of our system. Our development pipeline is nearly 128,000 rooms. That's a 10% increase over prior year, which includes a 21% increase in domestic new construction activity, with a concentration in our higher-end brands, particularly our Wyndham brand.
Moving on to our Destination segment. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, revenues increased 1% and EBITDA 2%. At RCI, exchange revenues increased 1% in constant currency, reflecting a 0.7% increase in the average number of members and a 0.3% increase in revenue per member. Vacation Rentals revenue for the quarter was also up 1% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions. A 4% increase in volume was offset by a 3.3% decline in the average net price per rental. Transaction growth was particularly strong in the U.K.-based Hoseasons business as well as our Denmark-based Novasol brands, and was reduced a bit due to the shift of the Easter holiday into the first quarter of 2016. 
Faster growth in our more moderate product offerings adversely impacted the average net price per rental. 
At our Vacation Ownership business, revenues increased 1% and EBITDA 3%. Results benefited from an increase in gross VOI sales and property management fees, partially offset by a higher provision for loan losses. EBITDA further benefited from lower cost of goods sold. 
Gross VOI sales increased 3% in constant currency, and the number of new owners increased 13%, in line with our previously stated goal of increasing new owner sales. 
Sales to existing owners was flat. The growth in the gross VOI sales reflected a 3.4% increase in tour flow, offset by a 0.8% constant currency decline of VPG. Now VPG was impacted by higher sales to new owners, which are generally less efficient than upgrade sales. While tour flow benefited from higher arrivals in tours at both our newer and existing sales centers.
Second quarter consumer finance portfolio performance was in line with our expectations at the end of the first quarter, which included the activity by third parties, encouraging our owners to cancel their contracts. 
Our average FICO score of originations during the quarter was 727, and that's consistent with our underwriting standards of the past year. 
Defaults for the quarter were $74 million. That's an increase of $14 million, which was almost entirely due to the organized third-party efforts. Both of these numbers were consistent with our expectations. The provision for loan loss was $90 million in the second quarter, resulting in an overall reserve level of 17.7%, consistent with recent levels over the past 3 years. It's worth emphasizing that the increase in the provision is in line with our expectations when we last spoke to you in April, with the breakdown as follows: $12 million from third parties, causing our owners to default; $8 million from higher sales volume and financing propensity; and $10 million from comparisons to favorable performance trends in the second quarter of 2015.
Remember that the provision flow-through to EBITDA is approximately 60%. As Steve said, we're continuing to work on the third-party issue. And in the meantime, the situation is tracking to our expectations. We calculate that the EBITDA impact in the first 6 months has been around $15 million. We estimate the third quarter EBITDA effect to be $8 million.
Company-wide net interest expense increased by $4 million in the second quarter compared with the same period of 2015, reflecting higher levels of debt, including the $350 million 5.1% bonds issued last September as well as the absence of a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap that we terminated in the second quarter of 2015. Depreciation also increased as we brought new long-term projects into service. Corporate expenses increased by $2 million, largely due to higher stock-based compensation expenses, and these expenses were offset somewhat by cost-cutting initiatives.
At Vacation Ownership, we completed our second-term securitization of the year in July. The $375 million Sierra 2016-2 transaction had a 90% advance rate and a 2.42% weighted average coupon. That's nearly 80 basis points below our prior 2016-1 transaction, as we benefited from lower post-Brexit interest rates and generally improved market conditions.
Now let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we're increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to $5.68 to $5.82 for the full year, and diluted share count goes to 111.8 million shares, reflecting the benefit of our second quarter share repurchases.
We're fine tuning our revenue guidance, lowering the overall range by $150 million. Approximately $50 million of the adjustment relates primarily to a forecast correction in our hotel management gross up at the Hotel Group, which has no EBITDA impact. The remainder is at Vacation Ownership and primarily reflects our best view of the impact of third-party prompted defaults. Just a reminder in timeshare accounting, the provision for anticipated defaults is a contra revenue account. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance remains unchanged at $1,375,000,000 to $1,400,000,000. Note that this guidance incorporates a negative $17 million year-over-year EBITDA impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. $6 million higher than in the full year guidance that we issued in April, largely due to the impact of Brexit on the British pound.
We expect the EBITDA impact from third-party defaults to be around $30 million this year. But we are holding our adjusted EBITDA guidance range for Vacation Ownership and the overall company. However, given these headwinds, we are more comfortable at the lower end of our EBITDA guidance range. There are no changes to drive our guidance. Although remember we said that on the last call that RevPAR would be at the lower end of our guidance range, which implies flat global RevPAR.
Our neighborhood target for our 2016 free cash flow remains $800 million. As always, keep in mind that there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or any given year, so we view $800 million as a neighborhood target rather than an exact figure. In addition, we are facing 2 free cash flow headwinds this year. First, as discussed, we have $35 million of unexpected foreign exchange headwinds year-to-date. Second, remember that as part of our strategy to drive new owner growth at timeshare, we are increasing financing to creditworthy customers, which will have an adverse short-term impact on free cash flow in 2016. However, we regained around 90% of that spend in financing activities from the receivables we securitized, and that is outside of our free cash flow definition. Typically, our receivables age 4 to 5 months before they enter a term securitization. So this is a short-term investment and not a long-term investment in the business. 
Now turning to the third quarter. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.84 to $1.87, which includes an $8 million foreign exchange impact. You'll note seasonality differences between our expectations and current analyst estimates. Our results are more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter this year, reflecting expected revenue improvements in timeshare as new sales sites become fully operational and in our hotel business as the oil impact comparisons moderate. In addition, we expect increased benefit from disciplined cost management in the fourth quarter. Remember that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance either. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Steve? Thanks, Tom. Monday will mark our 10-year anniversary of Wyndham Worldwide's listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Before we close, I'd like to take a moment to comment on our performance since then. Between dividends and share repurchases, we have returned nearly $6 billion to our shareholders. The cumulative impact of our share repurchase activity over this period has been a 45% reduction in our share count. This, combined with a strong operating performance and growth, has driven significant increases in key metrics. Just a few -- to put a few numbers around it, the adjusted EBITDA is up over 80%, and adjusted EPS is up over 225%. Looking forward, we see great opportunities in all of our businesses for future growth. We remain relentlessly focused on continuous innovation and execution of strategies that will deliver compelling value to our customers and great returns for our shareholders, both now and in the future. 
I am extremely proud of the culture we built and the team we have delivering value to our customers and our shareholders every day. And the passion of our 39,000 associates is also a source of great pride. Thanks for your continued support. Enjoy the summer, travel and remember to tune into the Wyndham Championship, August 18 to 21, on the Golf Channel and CBS. 
And with that, Erika, we can now open the call for questions."

And you gave a lot of data out on this call, and I just want to make sure I'm understanding this correctly. So revenues off $150 million this guidance versus the prior quarter's full year guidance. $50 million relates to hotel pass-throughs. That leaves us with $100 million. Of that $100 million, the majority of that relates to loan-loss provision in Vacation Ownership. And then you mentioned about 60% flow-through on that impact, which would generate $60 million of EBITDA. And I think you said the impact from the third-party activity is $30 million for this year.

We are driving more new-owner growth, which is what we're really focused on. And it does come at the expense of some gross VOI. If you imagine a sales center, where we have 30 sales associates, we're putting more new owners in front of those sales associates. So that means they're selling new owners versus upgrade owners. Upgrade owners produce more in a sale than a new owner does. So I think it's just us kind of getting our arms around the balancing of that and what it looks like. Again, we're not changing EBITDA because we're managing through it, but it means that each sales office might be a little bit lighter than we thought on -- as a result of the new-owner generation. We like the outcome. It's what we're shooting for. It just needs a very minor modification on the top."

We managed the amount of down payment that we require from customers based on basically our compensation model with our salespeople. We incentivize them to get certain levels of down payments. When we stood back and looked at this doing our strategic planning, we said, we're actually leaving a lot of money on the table because we have very good creditworthy customers that we are not allowing to borrow more than X amount of dollars. So what if we allow them to borrow a little bit more, would that give us an opportunity to actually grow our EBITDA in the future is we're going to be driving more interest income? And as you know, the spread there is pretty good. So this was more -- this had nothing to do with the default setting. This has everything to do with strategically taking advantage of what we thought was a real opportunity. And we still feel that way, evidenced by the fact that our FICO scores were the same as they were before, and we're kind of opening this spigot a little bit. This is not big movement. This is relatively small movement. And as I said, I think, the last quarter, we probably wouldn't even talk about it if he didn't have a free cash flow impact. It potentially does have a current-period free cash flow impact is we don't recover those -- the cash that we put out for those receivables until gone through a securitization, which generally takes 3 to 4 months. So it's really just -- if not for the cash flow thing, you probably wouldn't even notice it. But it's -- I think it's the right -- strategically the right thing for us to do for the company for the long term and that's why we didn't made the decision to do it. One other thing I'd say on your first question, Harry, is don't lose sight of the fact that this business is still hitting its numbers, its EBITDA numbers, despite this pressure from the provisions. So these guys are really good at managing their business. They're very thoughtful. And when they see pressures like this, as we did with the cease and desist a few years ago, we adapt and adjust and we make our numbers.

31063165,403008752,1061255,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Margo. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I will start by sharing our view of the quarter and some business unit highlights, and then Tom will go into more details.

I will start by sharing our view of the quarter and some business unit highlights, and then Tom will go into more details. As you saw in our release, revenues and constant currency and excluding acquisitions were up slightly and adjusted EBITDA grew 5%, consistent with our expectations. The hotel industry's cycle appears to be moderating to historical norms coming off years of accelerated growth starting in 2010, following the recession. Despite reported sluggish global economic growth, people around the world are committed to spending time with loved ones. They are looking for unique experiences at all price points, and we believe our diverse portfolio of travel offerings can continue to deliver on that growing demand.
On a business unit level, Wyndham Destination Network and Wyndham Hotel Group had strong quarters with 8% organic adjusted EBITDA growth in constant currency. Wyndham Destination Network achieved robust transaction growth and Wyndham Hotel Group had a solid quarter despite a softening RevPAR environment, supported by growing credit card revenue coming from our Wyndham Rewards efforts and disciplined cost control. Adjusted EBITDA results in Wyndham Vacation Ownership were weaker than we expected. Our upgrade sales were light, but new owner sales were strong. In addition, sales and marketing commissions were higher than we anticipated, primarily as a result of modifications we made to drive new owner sales. This cost overrun was inconsistent with our typical execution standards. We have made subsequent adjustments and the programs are now correctly generating appropriate incentive relative to results.
The issue of third-party-induced defaults, which we discussed in previous calls, improved slightly from the first half of the year. While we were aggressively pursuing legal options, we believe our best defense is a strong base of happy, satisfied timeshare owners. We dramatically increased our communication outreach to our customers. We know our owners are happy by surveys we regularly conduct, which include every owner touch point from sales to collections to owner stays. For example, over 80% of owners this year were satisfied with their Wyndham vacation. We want to ensure they remain happy with the product, and that we're the first to know should they become unhappy.
We believe fourth quarter defaults related to these third-party efforts will modestly improved sequentially. As you know, increasing new owners is our most important strategic initiative at WVO. Along these lines and now we're making great progress in adding new owners and in bringing in younger owners. Wyndham Vacation Ownership brought more owners into the system in the third quarter than any other quarter since the downturn. 35% of sales were new owners compared with 33% in the third quarter of last year, and we're happy to see that 25% new owners on a transactions year-to-date have been consumers under the age of 40. These are great owner results and bode well for the future. In addition, we're looking forward to opening at least 3 new sales centers next year that will further support these efforts.
Now let's turn to Wyndham Destination Network. Between our timeshare exchange and vacation rental offerings, Wyndham Destination Network is a major player  in the sharing economy. But unlike the big online marketplaces, our model goes well beyond linking supply and demand. As the world's largest provider of professionally managed private accommodations, we connect travelers seeking authenticity of homestay with owners looking to rent their property. We offer both the range of services -- we offer both of these groups or range of services to ensure a smooth experience. For owners, we offer yield management, cleaning, maintenance, billing, reservations, key handling and marketing. For consumers, we offer great travel experiences with trusted brands. We call it, Peer-to-Peer Plus. It's about making life easier for consumers and owners and creating maximum value for both.
And this is a business that continues to develop first in segment innovations to capture market share. In our rental brands, we introduced our dynamic yield management program a few years ago, driving consistent increases in revenue in some locations through optimized pricing and occupancy. Yield management helped drive an 8% increase in organic rental transaction volume this quarter. For example, we recently introduced dynamic pricing and host seasons holiday parks in the U.K. And ever business there is thriving with Q3 revenue growth of nearly 25%. Additionally, in 2017, we launched -- we will launch the next generation of timeshare exchange products, which will enable us to tier our membership offering, customize products and expand our services to new and existing RCI members.
Let me close by giving you an update on the strategic initiatives at the Hotel Group. We are solidifying our position as one of the largest and most formidable players in the hotel space through a combination of our growing loyalty program, reinvigorated focus on our hotel brands, continued commitment to quality and our implementation of a new best-in-class technology infrastructure.
Each of our iconic brands is being repositioned and strengthened. We have refreshed marketing campaigns. Our new websites are improving online conversion rates by double digits across all devices. In addition, over 30 guest-facing and revenue-generating pilot initiatives will bring customer value propositions to life for both our franchisees and the traveling guests. This is all being supported by the combined rollout of the industry's largest integrated cloud-based property and revenue management system. Our owners are beginning to see tangible bottom line benefits. In addition, we've already rolled out a new reservation system through our Wyndham and Trip brands with Dolce set for November '17 and Ramada targeted for December. All the implementations remain on schedule, and we look forward to reporting in this performance in upcoming quarters. 
As I discussed on previous calls, 24 months ago or so, our hotel division began redesigning and expanding our global loyalty program, Wyndham Rewards. We both the industry and overall loyalty trends by creating the most simple and generous redemption program -- rewards program in the hotel space. We also enhanced member levels to provide higher recognition and unique experiences from cooking classes to city tours that are included as part of our every award redemption in our top 25 destinations around the world. Since its relaunch, the results have been outstanding. The program has enrolled over 70 million new members and our hotels have seen a 200 basis points increase in member occupancy year-to-date compared to last year. Wyndham Rewards members stayed 12% longer the numbers of members and generate 64% more in revenue to our franchisees.
Wyndham Rewards was also just named the #1 Hospitality Loyalty Program by U.S. News & World Report. And earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal published a front-page story comparing industry -- the industry's hotel rewards program, which found that Wyndham Rewards delivered the strongest consumer value of all.
Building on this success, today, we're announcing the Wyndham Rewards -- Wyndham Worldwide would be t he first hospitality company to globally expand the use of its loyalty program was Vacation Ownership and Vacation Rental Properties. This will provide members with an unmatched choice of redemption options, creating an even stronger composition for guests by earning points by staying at our hotels, providing a powerful marketing platform for our WBO sales organization and help us attract and reward renters and owners in our Vacation Rental brands. We've always maintained a strategic vision to provide customers with a cohesive platform to access the widest range of places to stay. Our re-energized loyalty program is a major step in achieving that vision. We remain confident in our ability to drive continued growth and value for our shareholders. 
Before turning the call over to Tom, let me take a moment to discuss our outlook. As you know, we look for long-term EBITDA compound annual growth rate of 6% to 8%, and we have been above that for the past 5 years -- over the past 5 years. We are just starting our budget process now, and we take that process very seriously. At this time, it isn't prudent to give guidance, so like our peers, we will wait until we finish our budget process.  But be assured we'll do our best to achieve our long-term objectives next year and beyond, and as always, to deliver shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to walk you through more details in this quarter."

Adjusted EBITDA increased 5% in constant currency and excluding acquisitions. As strong results in our Destination Network and hotel businesses and company-wide expense reductions, more than offset the underperformance of our timeshare business. We generated $650 million of free cash flow in the first 9 months of the year compared with $660 million over the first 9 months of 2015. Now remember that our free cash flow has been reduced by $34 million of unexpected foreign exchange headwinds over the first 9 months of 2016, including a $24 million impact from a Venezuelan currency devaluation in the first quarter.
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of stock for $150 million. We reduced our weighted average share count by 7% year-over-year through share repurchases made during the last 12 months.
In addition, we've repurchased 700,000 shares for $50 million so far in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units. At our Hotel Group, revenues increased 2%, reflecting higher royalties, growth in Wyndham Rewards credit card program and global franchisee conference fees, partially offset by the loss of pass-through revenues from 2 managed hotels that are no longer in our system. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 8%, reflecting higher royalties and growth in the Wyndham Rewards credit card program as well as expense management initiatives. Domestic RevPAR increased 1.9%, reflecting higher room rates, partially offset by lower occupancy. Excluding oil-producing regions, domestic RevPAR grew 3.1%. RevPAR in the oil producing regions, which represent approximately 7% of our portfolio, declined 15% year-over-year, roughly consistent with 16% decline we saw in quarter 2, but a substantial improvement over the 28% decline in both quarter 1 and the fourth quarter of 2015, pointing to 1 headwind removed for the fourth quarter. Those of you who have followed us for sometime know that our systemwide RevPAR results have been negatively affected in recent years  by our rapid growth in China where our portfolio consist of us tells the generally have significantly lower room rates than our overall system average. Beginning this quarter, we will discuss global RevPAR on a same-store basis to give a more accurate reflection of our underlying RevPAR performance. So on a same-store basis, systemwide global RevPAR was up 1.4% in constant currency, reflecting flat to modest growth in most major international regions and incorporating a 120 basis point unfavorable impact from domestic and Canadian oil markets.
Net system size grew 2.7% year-over-year as we continued our focus on improving the overall quality of our system with the termination of substandard properties. Gross room additions increased 5% compared with the third quarter of last year. Our development pipeline is nearly 134,000 rooms, that's a 9% increase over the prior year, which includes a 14% increase in domestic new construction activity, with a concentration in our higher-end brands, particularly our Wyndham Brand.
Moving onto Destination Network. On a currency-neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, revenues increased 5%, and adjusted EBITDA increased 8%. 
At RCI, exchange revenues increased 2% in constant currency, reflecting a 1.4% increase in revenue per member, which benefited from higher pricing, and a 0.9% increase in the average number of members due to growth in North and South America.
Overall performance continues to benefit from innovation and product expansions. Vacation Rentals revenue for the quarter were up 6% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions. An 8% increase in transaction volume was partially offset by a 1.7% decline in the average net price per rental. Transaction growth benefited from our dynamic pricing initiative, which often results in higher occupancy due to more efficient pricing, especially during off-peak travel weeks. Transactions also benefited from capacity increases as our brands continue to expand both in existing and new markets.
Growth was strongest in our U.K.-based hotel seasons; Denmark-based Novasol; and Netherlands-based, Randolph Green Parks brands.
Our continued momentum speaks to the strength of our value proposition with consumers, especially with domestic drive to vacations. Faster growth in our more moderately priced products, reduced the average net price per rental.
At our Vacation Ownership business, total revenues and gross VOI sales were flat. As Steve noted, gross VOI sales were below our expectations. The shortfall reflects lower-than-expected upgrade tours. On earth tour flow was dampened by our focus on new owners as well as more targeted marketing efforts. As you know, coming into the year, our plan was to grow new owners substantially while keeping sales to existing owners flat. As part of that process, we refined our marketing, our owner marketing, to be more selective, ensuring that we are touring the right owner at the right time. That put a natural but healthy constraint on a number of upgrade tours, and it affected third quarter performance more than we anticipated. Year-to-date, however, sales to existing owners are tracking ahead of 2015. On the other hand, new owners are crucial to the long-term health of the business and expanding the number of new owners ranks among our most important strategic initiatives. However, bringing in new owners is more costly and takes more effort, and that is we selected in lower VPG. Since we sold proportionally more to new owners in the third quarter, it affected our overall DPG rate, which was down by 1.4%.
Year-to-date, we're tracking a little behind our aggressive goal of trickling the growth rate of new owners. But we're very pleased with our progress in adding new owners this year.
Adjusted EBITDA decreased 3%, again, below our expectations. Year-over-year results reflect a higher loan loss provision and higher sales and marketing commission plus, partially offset by higher property management fees, consumer financing interest income along with expense management initiatives. Defaults were slightly better and the provision for loan loss was in line with our expectations but worse than 2015. 
Defaults for the quarter were $70 million, an increase of $10 million, which was primarily due to the organized third-party efforts. The provision for loan loss was $104 million in the third quarter, an increase of $26 million, primarily reflecting the third-party activity and a higher level of finance sales consistent with our strategy of lower down payments.
Note that we have good visibility 4 months out into the third-party-prompted defaults. So our fourth quarter expectations for the provisions are $90 million, which assumes a year-over-year increase of approximately $25 million. Again, primarily related to the third-party issue and higher loan originations. Remember that only approximately 60% of the provision will flow through to EBITDA.
As Steve noted, sales and marketing commissions were higher than we anticipated. Coming into the year, we reworked on our commission structures to focus on new owners. And we did adequately adjust by reducing commission spend in other areas. In addition, we anticipated higher upgrade sales with lower commission rates, which did not materialize in the quarter. This execution was inconsistent with our typical standard, and we've made changes to ensure it doesn't happen again. As Steve noted, we have adjusted the commission program, and it is running at a proper level. In addition, we are instituting more centralized control over conditions going forward.
Finally, the increase in interest income relates to a higher portfolio balance resulting from our strategy to increase the percent of sales that we financed. Company-wide net interest expense increased by $1 million in the third quarter compared with the same period of 2015. Depreciation also increased $4 million as we brought new long-term projects in the service. Corporate expenses declined by $3 million due to expense management initiatives.
Reported results for the company included $14 million pretax for restructuring initiatives across our businesses to reduce operating costs and better align the organization and position us for future growth. We expect an additional $3 million charge in fourth quarter related to lease terminations from the restructuring. These efforts will result in $20 million in annual savings starting next year. 
We also booked a $70 million charge associated with the termination of an underperforming contract at our Hotel Group. Tables 7 and 8 include full reconciliations of reported to adjusted results for both periods.
At Vacation Ownership, we completed our third term securitization of the year in October. The ABS market remains robust. The $325 million  Sierra 2016-3 transaction had a 90% advance rate and a 2.47% weighted average coupon. The terms are in line with our last transaction and significantly better than our first transaction of the year.
Now let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website after the call. 
At this point of the year, we are moving to approximate projections rather than ranges on the P&L lines, except for EPS. We believe revenue will be approximately $5,650,000,000 at the low end of our previous range. Our EBITDA target for the full year will be approximately $1,375,000,000. This is consistent with our last call where we guided to the low-end of our adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $1,375,000,000 to $1,400,000,000. Note that this reflects 6% growth year-over-year or 7% in constant currency despite the impact of approximately $30 million from third-party-related defaults. 
In addition, we have fine tuned our depreciation and amortization get us to approximately $252 million. EPS guidance is $5.68 to $5.71one for the full year with a diluted share count of 111 million shares. At the business unit level, adjusted EBITDA guidance for Wyndham Vacation Ownership was reduced to approximately $710 million, which is below the bottom end of the range. This change is primarily attributable to Wyndham Vacation Ownership's third quarter adjusted EBITDA shortfall and lower expected sales in the fourth quarter due to the closure of a few sales offices as part of our third quarter restructuring activity, the temporary shutdown of 14 locations due to hurricane Matthew and the mix between new owner and upgrade sales.
Also, we've updated our full year driver guidance to reflect some of the changes and conditions we mentioned during the call. We now expect systemwide RevPAR to be flat to down 2%, down from the prior flat to up 2%, to reflect a slowing industry growth in the U.S. 
At Wyndham Vacation Ownership, our tour guidance has reduced to 2% to 3% from 3% of 5%, primarily as a result of the aforementioned sales office closings and the impact of hurricane Matthew.
Finally, reflecting great business momentum are our rental transaction guidance at Wyndham Destination Network, increases by 200 basis points to 7% to 9%. Our neighborhood target for 2016 free cash flow remains $800 million. As always, keep in mind that there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or any given year. So we view $800 million as a neighborhood target rather than an exact figure. We're confident in this target despite the fact that we are facing 2 free cash flow headwinds this year consisting of foreign exchange headwinds and the effects of lower down payments.
Now turning to the fourth quarter. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.29 to $1.32, and remember that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance. Regarding our 2017 outlook, we'll provide full 2017 guidance, including company revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow guidance as well as business unit, revenue, EBITDA and driver guidance in our February call, when we would have completed our budgeting process. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Steve?"

We -- what would change it in talking about the macro events that are happening around us, obviously, the RevPAR market is kind of going back to its normal -- more normalized level of RevPAR growth. That's put a little bit of pressure on the growth of that business. But that business is not the main driver of our company. We have a nice portfolio. So the biggest driver is timeshare. And we really don't see any change in timeshare. The change we're seeing is our intention will change the move towards new owners. And that something that most of the industry are in the process of doing now. Some stock with new owners after the downturn. But most of the players move towards more upgrade sales. Long-term, you want to keep a good firm pipeline with new orders coming in because that will give us more opportunity to grow in the future. And that's what we're committed to do. That will potentially put pressure on EBITDA margins less on new owners. But we're looking at ways to mitigate and manage through that. So  we're not moving on our long-term view."

So we'll have to adjust for it. But we do want to focus on growth just on about the hotel group for a minute. We've done a lot recently to improve our value proposition to the franchisees. So I would like to see our growth of units start picking up in our domestic growth. We really paid up a great environment for franchisees and we saw that in our conference in Las Vegas. There's a lot of excitement around our brands right now. So at times when there's RevPAR pressure for us as a conversion brand and new construction, it often increases the opportunity to sign up more franchises. So we will go after every opportunity we see and do what we can to achieve that kind of growth, and that is our goal."

Really, what we have to do is we have to improve our communications with our customers. We know, for the most part, they're very happy. As I said, 80% have enjoyed their vacations this year. I would love it if 80% of the people stayed in our hotels enjoyed their vacation because I think our timeshare satisfaction rates probably have higher or hotel satisfaction rates. But the fact is that means 80% are happy, 20% are not as thrilled. So how do we connect with them to make sure they're getting what they want out of their vacation. People love timeshare that's why, as Tom mentioned, they buy more. And half the people who owns timeshare end up buying more. But we have to work really hard to make sure that they have a great experience. If they don't, we want to hear about it. We want the feedback so that we can address them."

You need to bring on the sales people or owner sales, you have to modify things like commission program. So it's not a simple flipping of a switch. It's an effort. It's an effort across the organization. So no, I dont think that there's anything larger scale there for some reason, timeshare is less attractive. As we've seen in the past, it was sold during the downturn very effectively. And it continues to be a product that is welcomed by consumers to this day. And also notably, people have asked us about this as proven in my script, 25% of the people who bought this year are below the age of 40. So this isn't just a product for baby boomers.

It's a good question regarding what I'm referring to because really, I'm more referring to domestic RevPAR than international RevPAR.

With respect to U.S., specifically on terrorism, where the terroristic activities have occurred, we've seen immediate impact on occupancies, but then they do bounce back. So I wouldn't say that there is a continued impact from terrorist activities. And we certainly couldn't pull that out from any numbers that we look at. But -- so I'm referring more to domestic. But I think across the board, there are concerns now. Obviously, if you look at our rental business in Europe, we had a fantastic third quarter. So clearly, people in Northern Europe, which is most of our businesses are-based, they were traveling, they were going out, they were visiting families, they were having vacation. So it's very, very strong in Europe and yet you can look at some European economies and say that they're down. And yet people are still traveling. So it's not as black and white maybe is the question you asked, Mike, because it's a little bit blurred in different areas. But my remarks about softening are really just that we've had a number of years to fully terrific RevPAR growth.

I will start by sharing our view of the quarter and some business unit highlights and then Tom will go into more details. As you saw in our release, revenues in constant currency and excluding acquisitions were up slightly and adjusted EBITDA grew 5%, consistent with our expectations. The hotel industry's cycle appears to be moderating to historical norms, coming off years of accelerated growth starting in 2010, following the recession. Despite reported sluggish global economic growth, people around the world are committed to spending time with loved ones. They are looking for unique experiences at all price points, and we believe that our diverse portfolio of travel offerings can continue delivering on that growing demand.
On a business unit level, Wyndham Destination Network and Wyndham Hotel Group had strong quarters, with 8% organic adjusted EBITDA growth in constant currency. Wyndham Destination Network achieved robust transaction growth and Wyndham Hotel Group had a solid quarter despite a softening RevPAR environment, supported by growing credit card revenue, coming from our Wyndham Rewards efforts and disciplined cost control. Adjusted EBITDA results of Wyndham Vacation Ownership were weaker than we expected. Our upgrade sales were light, but new owner sales were strong. In addition, sales and marketing commissions were higher than we anticipated, primarily as a result of modifications we made to drive new owner sales. This cost overrun was inconsistent with our typical execution standards. We have made subsequent adjustments, and the programs are now correctly generating appropriate incentive relative to results.
The issue of third-party induced defaults, which we've discussed on previous calls, improved slightly from the first half of the year. While we were aggressively pursuing legal options, we believe our best defense is the strong base of happy, satisfied timeshare owners. We dramatically increased our communication outreach to our customers. We know our owners are happy by surveys we regularly conduct, which include every owner touch point from sales to collections to owner stays. For example, over 80% of owners this year were satisfied with their Wyndham vacation. We want to ensure they remain happy with the product, and that we're the first to know should they become unhappy.
We believe fourth quarter defaults related to these third-party efforts will modestly improve sequentially. As you know, increasing new owners is our most important strategic initiative at WVO. Along these lines, we're making great progress in adding new owners and in bringing in younger owners. Wyndham Vacation Ownership brought more owners into the system in the third quarter than any other quarter since the downturn. 35% of sales were the new owners compared with 33% in the third quarter of last year, and we're happy to see that 25% of new owners, owner transactions year-to-date have been to consumers under the age of 40. These are great owner results and bode well for the future. In addition, we're looking forward to opening at least 3 new sales centers next year that will further support these efforts.
Now let's turn to Wyndham Destination Network. Between our timeshare exchange and Vacation Rental offerings, Wyndham Destination Network is a major player in the sharing economy. But unlike the big online marketplaces, our model goes well beyond linking supply and demand. As the world's largest provider of professionally managed private accommodations, we connect travelers seeking the authenticity of homestay, with owners looking to rent their property. We offer both the range of services -- we offer both of these groups, a range of services to ensure a smooth experience. For owners, we offer yield management, cleaning, maintenance, billing, reservations, key handling and marketing. For consumers, we offer great travel experiences with trusted brands. We call it peer-to-peer plus. It's about making life easier for consumers and owners and creating maximum value for both.
And this is a business that continues to develop first in segment innovations to capture market share. In our rental brands, we introduced our dynamic yield management program, a few years ago, driving consistent increases in revenue at installed locations through optimized pricing and occupancy. Yield management helped drive an 8% increase in organic rental transaction volume this quarter. For example, we recently introduced dynamic pricing at Hoseasons Holiday Parks in the U.K. And our business there is thriving, with Q3 revenue growth of nearly 25%. Additionally, in 2017, we launched -- we will launch the next generation of timeshare exchange products, which will enable us to tier our membership offering, customize products and expand our services to new and existing RCI members.
Let me close by giving you an update on the strategic initiatives at the Hotel Group. We are solidifying our position as one of the largest and most formidable players in the hotel space through a combination of our growing loyalty program, reinvigorated focus on our hotel brands, continued commitment to quality and our implementation of a new best-in-class technology infrastructure.
Each of our iconic brands is being repositioned and strengthened. We have refreshed marketing campaigns. Our new websites are improving online conversion rates by double digits across all devices. In addition, over 30 guest-facing and revenue-generating pilot initiatives will bring customer value propositions to life for both our franchisees and the traveling guests. This is all being supported by the combined rollout of the industry's largest integrated cloud-based property and revenue management system. Our owners are beginning to see tangible bottom line benefits. In addition, we've already rolled out a new reservation system through our Wyndham and Trip brands, with Dolce set for November '17 and Ramada targeted for December. All the implementations remain on schedule, and we look forward to reporting in this performance in upcoming quarters. 
As I've discussed on previous calls, 24 months ago or so, our hotel division began redesigning and expanding our global loyalty program, Wyndham Rewards. We bugged the industry and overall loyalty trends by creating the most simple and generous redemption program -- rewards program in the hotel space. We also enhanced member levels to provide higher recognition and unique experiences from cooking classes to exciting city tours that are included as part of our -- of every award redemption in our top 25 destinations around the world. Since its relaunch, the results have been outstanding. The program has enrolled over 7 million new members and our hotels have seen a 200 basis point increase in member occupancy year-to-date compared to last year. Wyndham Rewards members stayed 12% longer than nonmembers and generate 64% more in revenue to our franchisees.
Wyndham Rewards was also just named the #1 Hospitality Loyalty Program by the U.S. News & World Report. And earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal published a front-page story comparing the industry -- industry's hotel reward programs, which found that Wyndham Rewards delivers the strongest consumer value of all.
Building on this success, today, we're announcing the Wyndham -- that Wyndham Worldwide will be the first hospitality company to globally expand the use of its loyalty program across Vacation Ownership and Vacation Rental Properties. This will provide members with an unmatched choice of redemption options, create an even stronger proposition for guests to earn points by staying at our hotels, provide a powerful and a cost-efficient marketing platform for our WVO sales organization and help us attract and reward renters and owners in our Vacation Rental brands. We've always maintained a strategic vision to provide customers, with a cohesive platform to access the widest range of places to stay. Our re-energized loyalty program is a major step in achieving that vision. We remain confident in our ability to drive continued growth and value for our shareholders. 
Before turning the call over to Tom, let me take a moment to discuss our outlook. As you know, we look for long-term EBITDA compound annual growth rate of 6% to 8%, and we have been above that for the past 5 years -- over the past 5 years. We are just starting our budget process now, and we take that process very seriously. At this time, it isn't prudent to give guidance, so like our peers, we will wait until we finish our budget process.  But be assured that we'll do our best to achieve our long-term objectives, next year and beyond, and as always, to deliver shareholder value. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to walk you through more details for this quarter."

As Steve noted, our overall financial performance was in line with our estimates. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5% in constant currency and excluding acquisitions. As strong results at our Destination Network and hotel b",1913,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. As Steve noted, our overall financial performance was in line with our estimates. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5% in constant currency and excluding acquisitions. As strong results at our Destination Network and hotel businesses and company-wide expense reductions more than offset the underperformance of our timeshare business. We generated $650 million of free cash flow in the first 9 months of the year compared with $660 million over the first 9 months of 2015. Now remember that our free cash flow has been reduced by $34 million of unexpected foreign exchange headwinds over the first 9 months of 2016, including a $24 million impact from the Venezuelan currency devaluation in the first quarter.
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of stock for $150 million. We reduced our weighted average share count by 7% year-over-year through share repurchases made during the last 12 months.
In addition, we've repurchased 700,000 shares for $50 million so far in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units. At our Hotel Group, revenues increased 2%, reflecting higher royalties, growth in Wyndham Rewards credit card program and global franchisee conference fees, partially offset by the loss of pass-through revenues from 2 managed hotels that are no longer in our system. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 8%, reflecting higher royalties and growth in the Wyndham Rewards credit card program as well as expense management initiatives. Domestic RevPAR increased 1.9%, reflecting higher room rates, partially offset by lower occupancy. Excluding oil-producing regions, domestic RevPAR grew 3.1%. RevPAR in the oil-producing regions, which represent approximately 7% of our portfolio, declined 15% year-over-year, roughly consistent with 16% decline we saw in quarter 2, but a substantial improvement over the 28% declines in both quarter 1 and the fourth quarter of 2015, pointing to one headwind removed for the fourth quarter. Those of you who have followed us for some time know that our systemwide RevPAR results have been negatively affected in recent years  by our rapid growth in China, where our portfolio consists of hotels that generally have significantly lower room rates than our overall system average. Beginning this quarter, we will discuss global RevPAR on a same-store basis to give a more accurate reflection of our underlying RevPAR performance. So on a same-store basis, systemwide global RevPAR was up 1.4% in constant currency, reflecting flat to modest growth in most major international regions and incorporating a 120 basis point unfavorable impact from domestic and Canadian oil markets.
Net system size grew 2.7% year-over-year as we continued our focus on improving the overall quality of our system with the termination of substandard properties. Gross room additions increased 5% compared with the third quarter of last year. Our development pipeline is nearly 134,000 rooms, that's a 9% increase over the prior year, which includes a 14% increase in domestic new construction activity, with the concentration in our higher-end brands, particularly our Wyndham Brand.
Moving on to Destination Network. On a currency-neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, revenues increased 5% and adjusted EBITDA increased 8%. 
At RCI, exchange revenues increased 2% in constant currency, reflecting a 1.4% increase in revenue per member, which benefited from higher pricing, and a 0.9% increase in the average number of members due to growth in North and South America.
Overall performance continues to benefit from innovation and product expansions. Vacation Rentals revenue for the quarter were up 6% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions. An 8% increase in transaction volume was partially offset by a 1.7% decline in the average net price per rental. Transaction growth benefited from our dynamic pricing initiative, which often results in higher occupancy due to more efficient pricing, especially during off-peak travel weeks. Transactions also benefited from capacity increases as our brands continue to expand both in existing and new markets.
Growth was strongest in our U.K.-based Hoseasons; Denmark-based Novasol; and Netherlands-based, Landal GreenParks brands.
Our continued momentum speaks to the strength of our value proposition with consumers, especially with domestic drive to vacations. Faster growth in our more moderately priced products reduced the average net price per rental.
At our Vacation Ownership business, total revenues and gross VOI sales were flat. As Steve noted, gross VOI sales were below our expectations. The shortfall reflects lower-than-expected upgrade tours. Owner tour flow was dampened by our focus on new owners as well as more targeted marketing efforts. As you know, coming into the year, our plan was to grow new owners substantially, while keeping sales to existing owners flat. As part of that process, we refined our marketing, our owner marketing, to be more selective, ensuring that we are touring the right owner at the right time. That put a natural but healthy constraint on the number of upgrade tours, and it affected third quarter performance more than we anticipated. Year-to-date, however, sales to existing owners are tracking ahead of 2015. On the other hand, new owners are crucial to the long-term health of the business and expanding the number of new owners ranks among our most important strategic initiatives. However, bringing in new owners is more costly and takes more effort, and that is reselected in lower VPG. Since we sold proportionally more to new owners in the third quarter, it affected our overall VPG rate, which was down by 1.4%.
Year-to-date, we're tracking a little behind our aggressive goal of tripling the growth rate of new owners. But we're very pleased with our progress in adding new owners this year.
Adjusted EBITDA decreased 3%, again, below our expectations. Year-over-year results reflect a higher loan loss provision and higher sales and marketing commission costs, partially offset by higher property management fees, consumer financing interest income along with expense management initiatives. Defaults were slightly better and the provision for loan loss was in line with our expectations but worse than 2015. 
Defaults for the quarter were $70 million, an increase of $10 million, which was primarily due to the organized third-party efforts. The provision for loan loss was $104 million in the third quarter, an increase of $26 million, primarily reflecting the third-party activity and a higher level of finance sales consistent with our strategy of lower down payments.
Note that we have good visibility, 4 months out, into the third-party prompted defaults. So our fourth quarter expectations for the provision are $90 million, which assumes a year-over-year increase of approximately $25 million. Again, primarily related to the third-party issue and higher loan originations. Remember that only -- approximately 60% of the provision will flow through to EBITDA.
As Steve noted, sales and marketing commissions were higher than we anticipated. Coming into the year, we reworked our commission structures to focus on new owners. And we did adequately adjust by reducing commission spend in other areas. In addition, we anticipated higher upgrade sales with lower commission rates, which did not materialize in the quarter. This execution was inconsistent with our typical standard, and we've made changes to ensure it doesn't happen again. As Steve noted, we have adjusted the commission program, and it is running at the proper level. In addition, we are instituting more centralized control over commissions going forward.
Finally, the increase in interest income relates to a higher portfolio balance, resulting from our strategy to increase the percent of sales that we finance. Company-wide net interest expense increased by $1 million in the third quarter compared with the same period of 2015. Depreciation also increased $4 million as we brought new long-term projects into service. Corporate expenses declined by $3 million due to expense management initiatives.
Reported results for the company included $14 million pretax for restructuring initiatives across our businesses to reduce operating costs and better align the organization and position us for future growth. We expect an additional $3 million charge in the fourth quarter related to lease terminations from the restructuring. These efforts will result in $20 million in annual savings starting next year. 
We also booked a $70 million charge associated with the termination of an underperforming contract at our Hotel Group. Tables 7 and 8 include full reconciliations of reported to adjusted results for both periods.
At Vacation Ownership, we completed our third term securitization of the year in October. The ABS market remains robust. The $325 million Sierra 2016-3 transaction had a 90% advance rate and a 2.47% weighted average coupon. The terms are in line with our last transaction and significantly better than our first transaction of the year.
Now let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website after the call. 
At this point in the year, we are moving to approximate projections rather than ranges on the P&L lines, except for EPS. We believe revenue will be approximately $5,650,000,000 at the low end of our previous range. Our EBITDA target for the full year will be approximately $1,375,000,000. This is consistent with our last call, where we guided to the low end of our adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $1,375,000,000 to $1,400,000,000. Note that this reflects 6% growth year-over-year or 7% in constant currency despite the impact of approximately $30 million from third-party related defaults. 
In addition, we have fine-tuned our depreciation and amortization guidance to approximately $252 million. EPS guidance is $5.68 to $5.71 for the full year, with a diluted share count of 111 million shares. At the business unit level, adjusted EBITDA guidance for Wyndham Vacation Ownership was reduced to approximately $710 million, which is below the bottom end of the range. This change is primarily attributable to Wyndham Vacation Ownership's third quarter adjusted EBITDA shortfall and lower expected sales in the fourth quarter due to the closure of a few sales offices as part of our third quarter restructuring activity, the temporary shutdown of 14 locations due to Hurricane Matthew and the mix between new owner and upgrade sales.
Also, we've updated our full year driver guidance to reflect some of the changes in conditions we mentioned during the call. We now expect systemwide RevPAR to be flat to down 2%, down from the prior flat to up 2%, to reflect the slowing industry growth in the U.S. 
At Wyndham Vacation Ownership, our tour guidance has reduced to 2% to 3% from 3% to 5%, primarily as a result of the aforementioned sales office closings and the impact of Hurricane Matthew.
Finally, reflecting great business momentum our rental transaction guidance at Wyndham Destination Network increases by 200 basis points to 7% to 9%. Our neighborhood target for 2016 free cash flow remains at $800 million. As always, keep in mind that there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or any given year. So we view $800 million as a neighborhood target rather than an exact figure. We're confident in this target despite the fact that we are facing 2 free cash flow headwinds this year, consisting of foreign exchange headwinds and the effect of lower down payments.
Now turning to the fourth quarter. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.29 to $1.32 and remember that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance. Regarding our 2017 outlook, we'll provide full 2017 guidance, including company revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow guidance as well as business unit, revenue, EBITDA and driver guidance on our February call, when we will have completed our budgeting process. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Steve?"

That does put a little bit of pressure on the growth of that business. But that business is not the main driver of our company. We have a nice portfolio. So the biggest driver is timeshare. And we really don't see any change in timeshare. The change we're seeing is our intentional change to move more towards new owners. And that's something that most in the industry are in the process of doing now. Some stuck with new owners after the downturn, but most of the players move towards more upgrade sales. Long term, you want to keep a good firm pipeline of new owners coming in because that will give us more opportunity to grow in the future. And that's what we're committed to do. That will potentially put pressure on EBITDA because the margins less on new owners. But we're looking at ways to mitigate and manage through that. So we're not moving on our long-term view."

Again, we'll manage the business to deliver as we always have on our growth objectives. If the general hotel industry is going to be at a flat to 2% growth next year, or whatever the pundits are saying that means that there will be pressure on companies that have costs that are going up faster than that. So we'll have to adjust for it. But we do want to focus on growth. Just on about the Hotel Group for a minute. We've done a lot recently to improve our value proposition to the franchisees. So I would like to see our growth of units start picking up in our domestic growth because we really teed up a great environment for franchisees, and we saw that at our conference in Las Vegas. There's a lot of excitement around our brands right now. So at times when there's RevPAR pressure for us as a conversion brand and new construction, it often increases the opportunity to sign up more franchises. So we will go after every opportunity we see and do what we can to achieve that kind of growth and that is our goal."

And so I'm not quite sure of what was working with your specific model, but let me just sort of generically comment on some of the components that are included in that provision. One is the effect of defaults directly related to PP activity. The other is the effect that, that activity might have on our curve, on our loan-loss curves. We have, as the earlier question implied, and when we decided to lower our down payment, we've increased our financing propensity. And therefore, that fact alone means for the same sales, you have to reserve a higher percentage because your financing a higher percentage. So part of it has to do with the percentage of sales finance. And then some of it is just the volume of the business, I think, was another component. And then there are small things here and there that aren't essential for me to explain. But I think those are the major categories. And I think in general, the quarter came in below what our expectations were, not substantially below but below what we believe the number was.

I'll just respond to the other question about, following up on Joe's question regarding splitting up the company. As we said in the past, we believe there are a lot of advantages to having these businesses together. The most recent and notable example of that is the Wyndham Rewards program, which is really becoming a blue thread that runs through all of our businesses. That is something that we think will drive value to all business units, and that is a powerful, powerful product. It's only been around in its current form for about 1.5 years. And it's already setting top levels in all types of ratings for loyalty programs. So we're very proud of what that group has done. And it is being, as I said in my comments, it's being embraced by the timeshare business as well as by the Vacation Rental business to drive more business between the 3 initiatives. And that is going to be a major factor going forward that we see will be a positive impactor. The other positive impact is our technology. We have a very -- we have a terrific IT group across all the business units. And they share ideas, and those ideas result in things like the yield management system at the Vacation Rental business. That came out of our exchange business. And it was kind of that technology and know-how was transferred over and applied there. So there's a lot of elements within a company that work well together.

It's an effort across the organization. So no, I don't think that there's anything larger scale that for some reason, timeshare is less attractive. As we've seen in the past, it was sold during the downturn very effectively. And it continues to be a product that is welcomed by consumers to this day.

It's a good question regarding what I'm referring to because really, I'm more referring to domestic RevPAR than international RevPAR. We've seen pockets of positive and pockets of negative RevPAR performance internationally, and that is very much driven by local economic conditions. With respect to U.S., specifically on terrorism, where the terroristic activities have occurred, we've seen immediate impact on occupancies, but then they do bounce back. So I wouldn't say that there's a continued impact from the terrorist activities. And we certainly couldn't pull that out of any numbers that we look at. But -- so I'm referring more to domestic. But I think across the board, there are concerns now. Obviously, if you look at our rental business in Europe, we had a fantastic third quarter. So clearly, people in Northern Europe, which is where most of our businesses are based, they were traveling, they were going out. They were visiting families, they were having vacation. So it was very, very strong in Europe and yet, you could look at some European economies and say that they're down. And yet people are still traveling. So it's not as black and white maybe is the question you asked, Mike, because it's a little bit blurred in different areas. But my remarks about softening are really just that we've had a number of years of really terrific RevPAR growth. And now we're getting back to that more normalized inflation-plus type levels of RevPAR growth, in my opinion."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I will start by sharing our view of the quarter and some business unit highlights and then Tom will go into more details. As you saw in our release, revenues in constant currency and excluding acq",1402,"Thanks, Margo. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I will start by sharing our view of the quarter and some business unit highlights and then Tom will go into more details. As you saw in our release, revenues in constant currency and excluding acquisitions were up slightly and adjusted EBITDA grew 5%, consistent with our expectations. The hotel industry's cycle appears to be moderating to historical norms, coming off years of accelerated growth starting in 2010, following the recession. Despite reported sluggish global economic growth, people around the world are committed to spending time with loved ones. They are looking for unique experiences at all price points, and we believe that our diverse portfolio of travel offerings can continue delivering on that growing demand.
On a business unit level, Wyndham Destination Network and Wyndham Hotel Group had strong quarters, with 8% organic adjusted EBITDA growth in constant currency. Wyndham Destination Network achieved robust transaction growth and Wyndham Hotel Group had a solid quarter despite a softening RevPAR environment, supported by growing credit card revenue coming from our Wyndham Rewards efforts and disciplined cost control. Adjusted EBITDA results of Wyndham Vacation Ownership were weaker than we expected. Our upgrade sales were light, but new owner sales were strong. In addition, sales and marketing commissions were higher than we anticipated, primarily as a result of modifications we made to drive new owner sales. This cost overrun was inconsistent with our typical execution standards. We have made subsequent adjustments, and the programs are now correctly generating appropriate incentive relative to results.
The issue of third-party induced defaults, which we've discussed on previous calls, improved slightly from the first half of the year. While we were aggressively pursuing legal options, we believe our best defense is a strong base of happy, satisfied timeshare owners. We dramatically increased our communication outreach to our customers. We know our owners are happy by surveys we regularly conduct, which include every owner touch point from sales to collections to owner stays. For example, over 80% of owners this year were satisfied with their Wyndham vacation. We want to ensure they remain happy with the product, and that we're the first to know should they become unhappy.
We believe fourth quarter defaults related to these third-party efforts will modestly improve sequentially. As you know, increasing new owners is our most important strategic initiative at WVO. Along these lines, we're making great progress in adding new owners and in bringing in younger owners. Wyndham Vacation Ownership brought more owners into the system in the third quarter than any other quarter since the downturn. 35% of sales were to new owners compared with 33% in the third quarter of last year, and we're happy to see that 25% of new owners, owner transactions year-to-date, have been to consumers under the age of 40. These are great owner results and bode well for the future. In addition, we're looking forward to opening at least 3 new sales centers next year that will further support these efforts.
Now let's turn to Wyndham Destination Network. Between our timeshare exchange and Vacation Rental offerings, Wyndham Destination Network is a major player in the sharing economy. But unlike the big online marketplaces, our model goes well beyond linking supply and demand. As the world's largest provider of professionally managed private accommodations, we connect travelers seeking the authenticity of homestay with owners looking to rent their property. We offer both the range of services -- we offer both of these groups a range of services to ensure a smooth experience. For owners, we offer yield management, cleaning, maintenance, billing, reservations, key handling and marketing. For consumers, we offer great travel experiences with trusted brands. We call it peer-to-peer plus. It's about making life easier for consumers and owners and creating maximum value for both.
And this is a business that continues to develop first-in-segment innovations to capture market share. In our rental brands, we introduced our dynamic yield management program a few years ago, driving consistent increases in revenue at installed locations through optimized pricing and occupancy. Yield management helped drive an 8% increase in organic rental transaction volume this quarter. For example, we recently introduced dynamic pricing at Hoseasons Holiday Parks in the U.K. And our business there is thriving, with Q3 revenue growth of nearly 25%. Additionally, in 2017, we launched -- we will launch the next generation of timeshare exchange products, which will enable us to tier our membership offering, customize products and expand our services to new and existing RCI members.
Let me close by giving you an update on the strategic initiatives at the Hotel Group. We are solidifying our position as one of the largest and most formidable players in the hotel space through a combination of our growing loyalty program, reinvigorated focus on our hotel brands, continued commitment to quality and our implementation of a new best-in-class technology infrastructure.
Each of our iconic brands is being repositioned and strengthened. We have refreshed marketing campaigns. Our new websites are improving online conversion rates by double digits across all devices. In addition, over 30 guest-facing and revenue-generating pilot initiatives will bring customer value propositions to life for both our franchisees and the traveling guests. This is all being supported by the combined rollout of the industry's largest integrated cloud-based property and revenue management system. Our owners are beginning to see tangible bottom line benefits. In addition, we've already rolled out a new reservation system through our Wyndham and TRYP brands, with Dolce set for November of '17 and Ramada targeted for December. All the implementations remain on schedule, and we look forward to reporting on this performance in upcoming quarters. 
As I've discussed on previous calls, 24 months ago or so, our hotel division began redesigning and expanding our global loyalty program, Wyndham Rewards. We bucked the industry and overall loyalty trends by creating the most simple and generous redemption program -- rewards program in the hotel space. We also enhanced member levels to provide higher recognition and unique experiences from cooking classes to exciting city tours that are included as part of our -- of every award redemption in our top 25 destinations around the world. Since its relaunch, the results have been outstanding. The program has enrolled over 7 million new members and our hotels have seen a 200 basis point increase in member occupancy year-to-date compared to last year. Wyndham Rewards members stay 12% longer than nonmembers and generate 64% more in revenue to our franchisees.
Wyndham Rewards was also just named the #1 Hospitality Loyalty Program by the U.S. News & World Report. And earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal published a front-page story comparing the industry's hotel reward programs, which found that Wyndham Rewards delivers the strongest consumer value of all.
Building on this success, today, we're announcing the Wyndham -- that Wyndham Worldwide will be the first hospitality company to globally expand the use of its loyalty program across Vacation Ownership and Vacation Rental Properties. This will provide members with an unmatched choice of redemption options, create an even stronger proposition for guests to earn points by staying at our hotels, provide a powerful and cost-efficient marketing platform for our WVO sales organization and help us attract and reward renters and owners in our Vacation Rental brands. We've always maintained a strategic vision to provide customers with a cohesive platform to access the widest range of places to stay. Our re-energized loyalty program is a major step in achieving that vision. We remain confident in our ability to drive continued growth and value for our shareholders. 
Before turning the call over to Tom, let me take a moment to discuss our outlook. As you know, we look for long-term EBITDA compound annual growth rate of 6% to 8%, and we have been above that for the past 5 years -- over the past 5 years. We are just starting our budget process now, and we take that process very seriously. At this time, it isn't prudent to give guidance, so like our peers, we will wait until we finish our budget process.  But be assured that we'll do our best to achieve our long-term objectives next year and beyond, and as always, to deliver shareholder value. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to walk you through more details for this quarter."
31063165,403008752,1061930,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. As Steve noted, our overall financial performance was in line with our estimates. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5% in constant currency and excluding acquisitions, as strong results at our Destination Network and hotel b",1911,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. As Steve noted, our overall financial performance was in line with our estimates. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5% in constant currency and excluding acquisitions, as strong results at our Destination Network and hotel businesses and company-wide expense reductions more than offset the underperformance of our timeshare business. We generated $650 million of free cash flow in the first 9 months of the year compared with $660 million over the first 9 months of 2015. Now remember that our free cash flow has been reduced by $34 million of unexpected foreign exchange headwinds over the first 9 months of 2016, including a $24 million impact from the Venezuelan currency devaluation in the first quarter.
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of stock for $150 million. We reduced our weighted average share count by 7% year-over-year through share repurchases made during the last 12 months.
In addition, we've repurchased 700,000 shares for $50 million so far in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units. At our Hotel Group, revenues increased 2%, reflecting higher royalties, growth in Wyndham Rewards credit card program and global franchisee conference fees, partially offset by the loss of pass-through revenues from 2 managed hotels that are no longer in our system. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 8%, reflecting higher royalties and growth in the Wyndham Rewards credit card program as well as expense management initiatives. Domestic RevPAR increased 1.9%, reflecting higher room rates, partially offset by lower occupancy. Excluding oil-producing regions, domestic RevPAR grew 3.1%. RevPAR in the oil-producing regions, which represent approximately 7% of our portfolio, declined 15% year-over-year, roughly consistent with 16% decline we saw in quarter 2, but a substantial improvement over the 28% declines in both quarter 1 and the fourth quarter of 2015, pointing to one headwind removed for the fourth quarter. Those of you who have followed us for some time know that our systemwide RevPAR results have been negatively affected in recent years by our rapid growth in China, where our portfolio consists of hotels that generally have significantly lower room rates than our overall system average. Beginning this quarter, we will disclose global RevPAR on a same-store basis to give a more accurate reflection of our underlying RevPAR performance. So on a same-store basis, systemwide global RevPAR was up 1.4% in constant currency, reflecting flat to modest growth in most major international regions and incorporating a 120 basis point unfavorable impact from domestic and Canadian oil markets.
Net system size grew 2.7% year-over-year as we continued our focus on improving the overall quality of our system with the termination of substandard properties. Gross room additions increased 5% compared with the third quarter of last year. Our development pipeline is nearly 134,000 rooms. That's a 9% increase over the prior year, which includes a 14% increase in domestic new construction activity with a concentration in our higher-end brands, particularly our Wyndham Brand.
Moving on to Destination Network. On a currency-neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, revenues increased 5% and adjusted EBITDA increased 8%. 
At RCI, exchange revenues increased 2% in constant currency, reflecting a 1.4% increase in revenue per member, which benefited from higher pricing, and a 0.9% increase in the average number of members due to growth in North and South America.
Overall performance continues to benefit from innovation and product extensions. Vacation Rentals revenue for the quarter were up 6% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions. An 8% increase in transaction volume was partially offset by a 1.7% decline in the average net price per rental. Transaction growth benefited from our dynamic pricing initiative, which often results in higher occupancy due to more efficient pricing, especially during off-peak travel weeks. Transactions also benefited from capacity increases as our brands continue to expand both in existing and new markets.
Growth was strongest in our U.K.-based Hoseasons; Denmark-based Novasol; and Netherlands-based Landal GreenParks brands.
Our continued momentum speaks to the strength of our value proposition with consumers, especially with domestic drive-to vacations. Faster growth in our more moderately priced products reduced the average net price per rental.
At our Vacation Ownership business, total revenues and gross VOI sales were flat. As Steve noted, gross VOI sales were below our expectations. The shortfall reflects lower-than-expected upgrade tours. Owner tour flow was dampened by our focus on new owners as well as more targeted marketing efforts. As you know, coming into the year, our plan was to grow new owners substantially while keeping sales to existing owners flat. As part of that process, we refined our marketing, our owner marketing, to be more selective, ensuring that we are touring the right owner at the right time. That put a natural but healthy constraint on the number of upgrade tours, and it affected third quarter performance more than we anticipated. Year-to-date, however, sales to existing owners are tracking ahead of 2015. On the other hand, new owners are crucial to the long-term health of the business and expanding the number of new owners ranks among our most important strategic initiatives. However, bringing in new owners is more costly and takes more effort, and that is reflected in lower VPG. Since we sold proportionally more to new owners in the third quarter, it affected our overall VPG rate, which was down by 1.4%.
Year-to-date, we're tracking a little behind our aggressive goal of tripling the growth rate of new owners. But we're very pleased with our progress in adding new owners this year.
Adjusted EBITDA decreased 3%, again, below our expectations. Year-over-year results reflect a higher loan loss provision and higher sales and marketing commission costs, partially offset by higher property management fees, consumer financing interest income along with expense management initiatives. Defaults were slightly better and the provision for loan loss was in line with our expectations but worse than 2015. 
Defaults for the quarter were $70 million, an increase of $10 million, which was primarily due to the organized third-party efforts. The provision for loan loss was $104 million in the third quarter, an increase of $26 million, primarily reflecting the third-party activity and a higher level of finance sales consistent with our strategy of lower down payments.
Note that we have good visibility, 4 months out, into the third-party prompted defaults. So our fourth quarter expectations for the provision are $90 million, which assumes a year-over-year increase of approximately $25 million. Again, primarily related to the third-party issue and higher loan originations. Remember that only approximately 60% of the provision will flow through to EBITDA.
As Steve noted, sales and marketing commissions were higher than we anticipated. Coming into the year, we reworked our commission structures to focus on new owners. And we didn't adequately adjust by reducing commission spend in other areas. In addition, we anticipated higher upgrade sales with lower commission rates, which did not materialize in the quarter. This execution was inconsistent with our typical standard, and we've made changes to ensure it doesn't happen again. As Steve noted, we have adjusted the commission program, and it is running at the proper level. In addition, we are instituting more centralized control over commissions going forward.
Finally, the increase in interest income relates to a higher portfolio balance resulting from our strategy to increase the percent of sales that we finance. Company-wide net interest expense increased by $1 million in the third quarter compared with the same period of 2015. Depreciation also increased $4 million as we brought new long-term projects into service. Corporate expenses declined by $3 million due to expense management initiatives.
Reported results for the company included $14 million pretax for restructuring initiatives across our businesses to reduce operating costs and better align the organization and position us for future growth. We expect an additional $3 million charge in the fourth quarter related to lease terminations from the restructuring. These efforts will result in $20 million in annual savings starting next year. 
We also booked a $7 million charge associated with the termination of an underperforming contract at our Hotel Group. Tables 7 and 8 include full reconciliations of reported to adjusted results for both periods.
At Vacation Ownership, we completed our third term securitization of the year in October. The ABS market remains robust. The $325 million Sierra 2016-3 transaction had a 90% advance rate and a 2.47% weighted average coupon. The terms are in line with our last transaction and significantly better than our first transaction of the year.
Now let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website after the call. 
At this point in the year, we are moving to approximate projections rather than ranges on the P&L lines, except for EPS. We believe revenue will be approximately $5,650,000,000 at the low end of our previous range. Our EBITDA target for the full year will be approximately $1,375,000,000. This is consistent with our last call, where we guided to the low end of our adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $1,375,000,000 to $1,400,000,000. Note that this reflects 6% growth year-over-year or 7% in constant currency despite the impact of approximately $30 million from third-party related defaults. 
In addition, we have fine-tuned our depreciation and amortization guidance to approximately $252 million. EPS guidance is $5.68 to $5.71 for the full year, with a diluted share count of 111 million shares. At the business unit level, adjusted EBITDA guidance for Wyndham Vacation Ownership was reduced to approximately $710 million, which is below the bottom end of the range. This change is primarily attributable to Wyndham Vacation Ownership's third quarter adjusted EBITDA shortfall and lower expected sales in the fourth quarter due to the closure of a few sales offices as part of our third quarter restructuring activity, the temporary shutdown of 14 locations due to Hurricane Matthew and the mix between new owner and upgrade sales.
Also, we've updated our full year driver guidance to reflect some of the changes in conditions we mentioned during the call. We now expect systemwide RevPAR to be flat to down 2%, down from the prior flat to up 2%, to reflect the slowing industry growth in the U.S. 
At Wyndham Vacation Ownership, our tour guidance has reduced to 2% to 3% from 3% to 5%, primarily as a result of the aforementioned sales office closings and the impact of Hurricane Matthew.
Finally, reflecting great business momentum, our rental transaction guidance at Wyndham Destination Network increases by 200 basis points, to 7% to 9%. Our neighborhood target for 2016 free cash flow remains at $800 million. As always, keep in mind that there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or any given year. So we view $800 million as a neighborhood target rather than an exact figure. We're confident in this target despite the fact that we are facing 2 free cash flow headwinds this year, consisting of foreign exchange headwinds and the effect of lower down payments.
Now turning to the fourth quarter. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.29 to $1.32, and remember that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance. Regarding our 2017 outlook, we'll provide full 2017 guidance, including company revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow guidance as well as business unit, revenue, EBITDA and driver guidance on our February call, when we will have completed our budgeting process. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Steve?"

Well, as you may remember, Joe, our long-term growth target is 6% to 8% for EBITDA. And we're not changing that. We feel comfortable with that. We -- what would change it in talking about the macro events that are happening around us? Obviously, the RevPAR market is kind of going back to its normal -- more normalized level of RevPAR growth. That does put a little bit of pressure on the growth of that business. But that business is not the main driver of our company. We have a nice portfolio. So the biggest driver is timeshare. And we really don't see any change in timeshare. The change we're seeing is our intentional change to move more towards new owners. And that's something that most in the industry are in the process of doing now. Some stuck with new owners after the downturn, but most of the players moved towards more upgrade sales. Long term, you want to keep a good firm pipeline of new owners coming in because that will give us more opportunity to grow in the future. And that's what we're committed to do. That will potentially put pressure on EBITDA because the margin is less on new owners. But we're looking at ways to mitigate and manage through that. So we're not moving on our long-term view."

There are pressures, obviously, that we and everybody else are seeing. And during those times of pressure, it might put more pressure on revenue growth. We may have to be more OpEx-focused. Again, we'll manage the business to deliver as we always have on our growth objectives. If the general hotel industry is going to be at a flat to 2% growth next year or whatever the pundits are saying, that means that there will be pressure on companies that have costs that are going up faster than that. So we'll have to adjust for it. But we do want to focus on growth. Just on about the Hotel Group for a minute. We've done a lot recently to improve our value proposition to the franchisees. So I would like to see our growth of units start picking up in our domestic growth because we really teed up a great environment for franchisees, and we saw that at our conference out in Las Vegas. There's a lot of excitement around our brands right now. So at times when there's RevPAR pressure for us as a conversion brand and new construction, it often increases the opportunity to sign up more franchises. So we will go after every opportunity we see and do what we can to achieve that kind of growth, and that is our goal."

But when we experience this in -- similar activity in 2012-2013, what we saw was compression of default activity early on, and then a more immediate leveling to a more normal state. We didn't say that, that was certain to happen in this case. We presented that as a scenario that could happen given what's happened previously. And so I don't think either Steve's crystal ball or my crystal ball is insightful enough for us to make an immediate statement now that, that would be the case in this situation."

The -- so look, the third quarter came in lower than our expectations for the quarter. And so I'm not quite sure what was working with your specific model, but let me just sort of generically comment on some of the components that are included in that provision. One is the effect of defaults directly related to PP activity. The other is the effect that, that activity might have on our curve, on our loan loss curves. We have, as the earlier question implied, and when we decided to lower our down payment, we've increased our financing propensity. And therefore, that fact alone means for the same sales, you have to reserve a higher percentage because you're financing a higher percentage. So part of it has to do with the percentage of sales finance. And then some of it is just the volume of the business, I think, was another component. And then there are small things here and there that aren't essential for me to explain. But I think those are the major categories. And I think in general, the quarter came in below what our expectations were, not substantially below but below what we believe the number was. We have a pretty good predictive value of this third-party related default activity because we get letters early on that we can judge or eventually are going to lead to defaults.

But we haven't reviewed budgets. So I'll just say that. But in general, over the longer term, the puts and takes are -- our CapEx is one of the factors that applies against free cash flow. And we believe we're in a comfortable CapEx zone at this point, which is in the low $200 millions. And our expectation would be -- we've talked to the business unit about down payments. That was an initiative this year as well about lowering down payments. I'm sure that'll be a discussion topic in the budget review. But other than that we expect that the free cash flow trends over the longer term should mirror the EBITDA trends. Because we feel like we've reached steady state on working capital, we've talked about how much we had invested in product. We don't have a different point of view on that as we sit here today.

I'll just respond to the other question about, following up on Joe's question regarding splitting up the company. As we said in the past, we believe there are a lot of advantages to having these businesses together. The most recent and notable example of that is the Wyndham Rewards program, which is really becoming a blue thread that runs through all of our businesses. That is something that we think will drive value to all business units, and that is a powerful, powerful product. It's only been around in its current form for about 1.5 years. And it's already setting top levels in all types of ratings for loyalty programs. So we're very proud of what that group has done. And it is being, as I said in my comments, it's being embraced by the timeshare business as well as by the Vacation Rental business to drive more business between the 3 initiatives. And that is going to be a major factor going forward that we see will be a positive impactor. The other positive impact is our technology. We have a very -- we have a terrific IT group across all the business units. And they share ideas, and those ideas result in things like the yield management system at the Vacation Rental business. That came out of our exchange business. And it was kind of that technology and know-how was transferred over and applied there. So there's a lot of elements within a company that work well together. But as I've said, we look at whatever we believe as a board will drive greatest shareholder value for the shareholders. And yes, we will look at all the options that are out there."

It's an effort across the organization. So no, I don't think that there's anything larger scale that for some reason, timeshare is less attractive. As we've seen in the past, it was sold during the downturn very effectively. And it continues to be a product that is welcomed by consumers to this day. And also notably, because people have asked us about this I've put it in my script, 25% of the people who bought this year, are below the age of 40. So this isn't just a product for baby boomers.

It's a good question regarding what I'm referring to because really, I'm more referring to domestic RevPAR than international RevPAR. We've seen pockets of positive and pockets of negative RevPAR performance internationally, and that is very much driven by local economic conditions. With respect to U.S., specifically on terrorism, where the terroristic activities have occurred, we've seen immediate impact on occupancies, but then they do bounce back. So I wouldn't say that there's a continued impact from the terrorist activities. And we certainly couldn't pull that out of any numbers that we look at. But -- so I'm referring more to domestic. But I think across the board, there are concerns now. Obviously, if you look at our rental business in Europe, we had a fantastic third quarter. So clearly, people in Northern Europe, which is where most of our businesses are based, they were traveling, they were going out. They were visiting families, they were having vacation. So it was very, very strong in Europe and yet, you could look at some European economies and say that they're down. And yet people are still traveling. So it's not as black and white maybe as the question you asked, Mike, because it's a little bit blurred in different areas. But my remarks about softening are really just that we've had a number of years of really terrific RevPAR growth. And now we're getting back to that more normalized inflation-plus type levels of RevPAR growth, in my opinion."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I will start by sharing our view of the quarter and some business unit highlights and then Tom will go into more details. As you saw in our release, revenues in constant currency and excluding acq",1402,"Thanks, Margo. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I will start by sharing our view of the quarter and some business unit highlights and then Tom will go into more details. As you saw in our release, revenues in constant currency and excluding acquisitions were up slightly and adjusted EBITDA grew 5%, consistent with our expectations. The hotel industry's cycle appears to be moderating to historical norms, coming off years of accelerated growth starting in 2010, following the recession. Despite reported sluggish global economic growth, people around the world are committed to spending time with loved ones. They are looking for unique experiences at all price points, and we believe that our diverse portfolio of travel offerings can continue delivering on that growing demand.
On a business unit level, Wyndham Destination Network and Wyndham Hotel Group had strong quarters, with 8% organic adjusted EBITDA growth in constant currency. Wyndham Destination Network achieved robust transaction growth and Wyndham Hotel Group had a solid quarter despite a softening RevPAR environment, supported by growing credit card revenue coming from our Wyndham Rewards efforts and disciplined cost control. Adjusted EBITDA results of Wyndham Vacation Ownership were weaker than we expected. Our upgrade sales were light, but new owner sales were strong. In addition, sales and marketing commissions were higher than we anticipated, primarily as a result of modifications we made to drive new owner sales. This cost overrun was inconsistent with our typical execution standards. We have made subsequent adjustments, and the programs are now correctly generating appropriate incentive relative to results.
The issue of third-party induced defaults, which we've discussed on previous calls, improved slightly from the first half of the year. While we were aggressively pursuing legal options, we believe our best defense is a strong base of happy, satisfied timeshare owners. We dramatically increased our communication outreach to our customers. We know our owners are happy by surveys we regularly conduct, which include every owner touch point from sales to collections to owner stays. For example, over 80% of owners this year were satisfied with their Wyndham vacation. We want to ensure they remain happy with the product, and that we're the first to know should they become unhappy.
We believe fourth quarter defaults related to these third-party efforts will modestly improve sequentially. As you know, increasing new owners is our most important strategic initiative at WVO. Along these lines, we're making great progress in adding new owners and in bringing in younger owners. Wyndham Vacation Ownership brought more owners into the system in the third quarter than any other quarter since the downturn. 35% of sales were to new owners compared with 33% in the third quarter of last year, and we're happy to see that 25% of new owners, owner transactions year-to-date, have been to consumers under the age of 40. These are great owner results and bode well for the future. In addition, we're looking forward to opening at least 3 new sales centers next year that will further support these efforts.
Now let's turn to Wyndham Destination Network. Between our timeshare exchange and Vacation Rental offerings, Wyndham Destination Network is a major player in the sharing economy. But unlike the big online marketplaces, our model goes well beyond linking supply and demand. As the world's largest provider of professionally managed private accommodations, we connect travelers seeking the authenticity of homestay with owners looking to rent their property. We offer both the range of services -- we offer both of these groups a range of services to ensure a smooth experience. For owners, we offer yield management, cleaning, maintenance, billing, reservations, key handling and marketing. For consumers, we offer great travel experiences with trusted brands. We call it peer-to-peer plus. It's about making life easier for consumers and owners and creating maximum value for both.
And this is a business that continues to develop first-in-segment innovations to capture market share. In our rental brands, we introduced our dynamic yield management program a few years ago, driving consistent increases in revenue at installed locations through optimized pricing and occupancy. Yield management helped drive an 8% increase in organic rental transaction volume this quarter. For example, we recently introduced dynamic pricing at Hoseasons Holiday Parks in the U.K. And our business there is thriving, with Q3 revenue growth of nearly 25%. Additionally, in 2017, we launched -- we will launch the next generation of timeshare exchange products, which will enable us to tier our membership offering, customize products and expand our services to new and existing RCI members.
Let me close by giving you an update on the strategic initiatives at the Hotel Group. We are solidifying our position as one of the largest and most formidable players in the hotel space through a combination of our growing loyalty program, reinvigorated focus on our hotel brands, continued commitment to quality and our implementation of a new best-in-class technology infrastructure.
Each of our iconic brands is being repositioned and strengthened. We have refreshed marketing campaigns. Our new websites are improving online conversion rates by double digits across all devices. In addition, over 30 guest-facing and revenue-generating pilot initiatives will bring customer value propositions to life for both our franchisees and the traveling guests. This is all being supported by the combined rollout of the industry's largest integrated cloud-based property and revenue management system. Our owners are beginning to see tangible bottom line benefits. In addition, we've already rolled out a new reservation system through our Wyndham and TRYP brands, with Dolce set for November of '17 and Ramada targeted for December. All the implementations remain on schedule, and we look forward to reporting on this performance in upcoming quarters. 
As I've discussed on previous calls, 24 months ago or so, our hotel division began redesigning and expanding our global loyalty program, Wyndham Rewards. We bucked the industry and overall loyalty trends by creating the most simple and generous redemption program -- rewards program in the hotel space. We also enhanced member levels to provide higher recognition and unique experiences from cooking classes to exciting city tours that are included as part of our -- of every award redemption in our top 25 destinations around the world. Since its relaunch, the results have been outstanding. The program has enrolled over 7 million new members and our hotels have seen a 200 basis point increase in member occupancy year-to-date compared to last year. Wyndham Rewards members stay 12% longer than nonmembers and generate 64% more in revenue to our franchisees.
Wyndham Rewards was also just named the #1 Hospitality Loyalty Program by the U.S. News & World Report. And earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal published a front-page story comparing the industry's hotel reward programs, which found that Wyndham Rewards delivers the strongest consumer value of all.
Building on this success, today, we're announcing the Wyndham -- that Wyndham Worldwide will be the first hospitality company to globally expand the use of its loyalty program across Vacation Ownership and Vacation Rental Properties. This will provide members with an unmatched choice of redemption options, create an even stronger proposition for guests to earn points by staying at our hotels, provide a powerful and cost-efficient marketing platform for our WVO sales organization and help us attract and reward renters and owners in our Vacation Rental brands. We've always maintained a strategic vision to provide customers with a cohesive platform to access the widest range of places to stay. Our re-energized loyalty program is a major step in achieving that vision. We remain confident in our ability to drive continued growth and value for our shareholders. 
Before turning the call over to Tom, let me take a moment to discuss our outlook. As you know, we look for long-term EBITDA compound annual growth rate of 6% to 8%, and we have been above that for the past 5 years -- over the past 5 years. We are just starting our budget process now, and we take that process very seriously. At this time, it isn't prudent to give guidance, so like our peers, we will wait until we finish our budget process.  But be assured that we'll do our best to achieve our long-term objectives next year and beyond, and as always, to deliver shareholder value. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to walk you through more details for this quarter."

As Steve noted, our overall financial performance was in line with our estimates. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5% in constant currency and excluding acquisitions, as strong results at our Destination Network and hotel businesses and company-wide expense reductions more than offset the underperformance of our timeshare business. We generated $650 million of free cash flow in the first 9 months of the year compared with $660 million over the first 9 months of 2015. Now remember that our free cash flow has been reduced by $34 million of unexpected foreign exchange headwinds over the first 9 months of 2016, including a $24 million impact from the Venezuelan currency devaluation in the first quarter.
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of stock for $150 million. We reduced our weighted average share count by 7% year-over-year through share repurchases made during the last 12 months.
In addition, we've repurchased 700,000 shares for $50 million so far in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units. At our Hotel Group, revenues increased 2%, reflecting higher royalties, growth in Wyndham Rewards credit card program and global franchisee conference fees, partially offset by the loss of pass-through revenues from 2 managed hotels that are no longer in our system. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 8%, reflecting higher royalties and growth in the Wyndham Rewards credit card program as well as expense management initiatives. Domestic RevPAR increased 1.9%, reflecting higher room rates, partially offset by lower occupancy. Excluding oil-producing regions, domestic RevPAR grew 3.1%. RevPAR in the oil-producing regions, which represent approximately 7% of our portfolio, declined 15% year-over-year, roughly consistent with 16% decline we saw in quarter 2, but a substantial improvement over the 28% declines in both quarter 1 and the fourth quarter of 2015, pointing to one headwind removed for the fourth quarter. Those of you who have followed us for some time know that our systemwide RevPAR results have been negatively affected in recent years by our rapid growth in China, where our portfolio consists of hotels that generally have significantly lower room rates than our overall system average. Beginning this quarter, we will disclose global RevPAR on a same-store basis to give a more accurate reflection of our underlying RevPAR performance. So on a same-store basis, systemwide global RevPAR was up 1.4% in constant currency, reflecting flat to modest growth in most major international regions and incorporating a 120 basis point unfavorable impact from domestic and Canadian oil markets.
Net system size grew 2.7% year-over-year as we continued our focus on improving the overall quality of our system with the termination of substandard properties. Gross room additions increased 5% compared with the third quarter of last year. Our development pipeline is nearly 134,000 rooms. That's a 9% increase over the prior year, which includes a 14% increase in domestic new construction activity with a concentration in our higher-end brands, particularly our Wyndham Brand.
Moving on to Destination Network. On a currency-neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, revenues increased 5% and adjusted EBITDA increased 8%. 
At RCI, exchange revenues increased 2% in constant currency, reflecting a 1.4% increase in revenue per member, which benefited from higher pricing, and a 0.9% increase in the average number of members due to growth in North and South America.
Overall performance continues to benefit from innovation and product extensions. Vacation Rentals revenue for the quarter were up 6% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions. An 8% increase in transaction volume was partially offset by a 1.7% decline in the average net price per rental. Transaction growth benefited from our dynamic pricing initiative, which often results in higher occupancy due to more efficient pricing, especially during off-peak travel weeks. Transactions also benefited from capacity increases as our brands continue to expand both in existing and new markets.
Growth was strongest in our U.K.-based Hoseasons; Denmark-based Novasol; and Netherlands-based Landal GreenParks brands.
Our continued momentum speaks to the strength of our value proposition with consumers, especially with domestic drive-to vacations. Faster growth in our more moderately priced products reduced the average net price per rental.
At our Vacation Ownership business, total revenues and gross VOI sales were flat. As Steve noted, gross VOI sales were below our expectations. The shortfall reflects lower-than-expected upgrade tours. Owner tour flow was dampened by our focus on new owners as well as more targeted marketing efforts. As you know, coming into the year, our plan was to grow new owners substantially while keeping sales to existing owners flat. As part of that process, we refined our marketing, our owner marketing, to be more selective, ensuring that we are touring the right owner at the right time. That put a natural but healthy constraint on the number of upgrade tours, and it affected third quarter performance more than we anticipated. Year-to-date, however, sales to existing owners are tracking ahead of 2015. On the other hand, new owners are crucial to the long-term health of the business and expanding the number of new owners ranks among our most important strategic initiatives. However, bringing in new owners is more costly and takes more effort, and that is reflected in lower VPG. Since we sold proportionally more to new owners in the third quarter, it affected our overall VPG rate, which was down by 1.4%.
Year-to-date, we're tracking a little behind our aggressive goal of tripling the growth rate of new owners. But we're very pleased with our progress in adding new owners this year.
Adjusted EBITDA decreased 3%, again, below our expectations. Year-over-year results reflect a higher loan loss provision and higher sales and marketing commission costs, partially offset by higher property management fees, consumer financing interest income along with expense management initiatives. Defaults were slightly better and the provision for loan loss was in line with our expectations but worse than 2015. 
Defaults for the quarter were $70 million, an increase of $10 million, which was primarily due to the organized third-party efforts. The provision for loan loss was $104 million in the third quarter, an increase of $26 million, primarily reflecting the third-party activity and a higher level of finance sales consistent with our strategy of lower down payments.
Note that we have good visibility, 4 months out, into the third-party prompted defaults. So our fourth quarter expectations for the provision are $90 million, which assumes a year-over-year increase of approximately $25 million. Again, primarily related to the third-party issue and higher loan originations. Remember that only approximately 60% of the provision will flow through to EBITDA.
As Steve noted, sales and marketing commissions were higher than we anticipated. Coming into the year, we reworked our commission structures to focus on new owners. And we didn't adequately adjust by reducing commission spend in other areas. In addition, we anticipated higher upgrade sales with lower commission rates, which did not materialize in the quarter. This execution was inconsistent with our typical standard, and we've made changes to ensure it doesn't happen again. As Steve noted, we have adjusted the commission program, and it is running at the proper level. In addition, we are instituting more centralized control over commissions going forward.
Finally, the increase in interest income relates to a higher portfolio balance resulting from our strategy to increase the percent of sales that we finance. Company-wide net interest expense increased by $1 million in the third quarter compared with the same period of 2015. Depreciation also increased $4 million as we brought new long-term projects into service. Corporate expenses declined by $3 million due to expense management initiatives.
Reported results for the company included $14 million pretax for restructuring initiatives across our businesses to reduce operating costs and better align the organization and position us for future growth. We expect an additional $3 million charge in the fourth quarter related to lease terminations from the restructuring. These efforts will result in $20 million in annual savings starting next year. 
We also booked a $7 million charge associated with the termination of an underperforming contract at our Hotel Group. Tables 7 and 8 include full reconciliations of reported to adjusted results for both periods.
At Vacation Ownership, we completed our third term securitization of the year in October. The ABS market remains robust. The $325 million Sierra 2016-3 transaction had a 90% advance rate and a 2.47% weighted average coupon. The terms are in line with our last transaction and significantly better than our first transaction of the year.
Now let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website after the call. 
At this point in the year, we are moving to approximate projections rather than ranges on the P&L lines, except for EPS. We believe revenue will be approximately $5,650,000,000 at the low end of our previous range. Our EBITDA target for the full year will be approximately $1,375,000,000. This is consistent with our last call, where we guided to the low end of our adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $1,375,000,000 to $1,400,000,000. Note that this reflects 6% growth year-over-year or 7% in constant currency despite the impact of approximately $30 million from third-party related defaults. 
In addition, we have fine-tuned our depreciation and amortization guidance to approximately $252 million. EPS guidance is $5.68 to $5.71 for the full year, with a diluted share count of 111 million shares. At the business unit level, adjusted EBITDA guidance for Wyndham Vacation Ownership was reduced to approximately $710 million, which is below the bottom end of the range. This change is primarily attributable to Wyndham Vacation Ownership's third quarter adjusted EBITDA shortfall and lower expected sales in the fourth quarter due to the closure of a few sales offices as part of our third quarter restructuring activity, the temporary shutdown of 14 locations due to Hurricane Matthew and the mix between new owner and upgrade sales.
Also, we've updated our full year driver guidance to reflect some of the changes in conditions we mentioned during the call. We now expect systemwide RevPAR to be flat to down 2%, down from the prior flat to up 2%, to reflect the slowing industry growth in the U.S. 
At Wyndham Vacation Ownership, our tour guidance has reduced to 2% to 3% from 3% to 5%, primarily as a result of the aforementioned sales office closings and the impact of Hurricane Matthew.
Finally, reflecting great business momentum, our rental transaction guidance at Wyndham Destination Network increases by 200 basis points, to 7% to 9%. Our neighborhood target for 2016 free cash flow remains at $800 million. As always, keep in mind that there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or any given year. So we view $800 million as a neighborhood target rather than an exact figure. We're confident in this target despite the fact that we are facing 2 free cash flow headwinds this year, consisting of foreign exchange headwinds and the effect of lower down payments.
Now turning to the fourth quarter. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.29 to $1.32, and remember that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance. Regarding our 2017 outlook, we'll provide full 2017 guidance, including company revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow guidance as well as business unit, revenue, EBITDA and driver guidance on our February call, when we will have completed our budgeting process. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Steve?"

Well, as you may remember, Joe, our long-term growth target is 6% to 8% for EBITDA. And we're not changing that. We feel comfortable with that. We -- what would change it in talking about the macro events that are happening around us? Obviously, the RevPAR market is kind of going back to its normal -- more normalized level of RevPAR growth. That does put a little bit of pressure on the growth of that business. But that business is not the main driver of our company. We have a nice portfolio. So the biggest driver is timeshare. And we really don't see any change in timeshare. The change we're seeing is our intentional change to move more towards new owners. And that's something that most in the industry are in the process of doing now. Some stuck with new owners after the downturn, but most of the players moved towards more upgrade sales. Long term, you want to keep a good firm pipeline of new owners coming in because that will give us more opportunity to grow in the future. And that's what we're committed to do. That will potentially put pressure on EBITDA because the margin is less on new owners. But we're looking at ways to mitigate and manage through that. So we're not moving on our long-term view."

Again, we'll manage the business to deliver as we always have on our growth objectives. If the general hotel industry is going to be at a flat to 2% growth next year or whatever the pundits are saying, that means that there will be pressure on companies that have costs that are going up faster than that. So we'll have to adjust for it. But we do want to focus on growth. Just on about the Hotel Group for a minute. We've done a lot recently to improve our value proposition to the franchisees. So I would like to see our growth of units start picking up in our domestic growth because we really teed up a great environment for franchisees, and we saw that at our conference out in Las Vegas. There's a lot of excitement around our brands right now. So at times when there's RevPAR pressure for us as a conversion brand and new construction, it often increases the opportunity to sign up more franchises. So we will go after every opportunity we see and do what we can to achieve that kind of growth, and that is our goal."

And so I'm not quite sure what was working with your specific model, but let me just sort of generically comment on some of the components that are included in that provision. One is the effect of defaults directly related to PP activity. The other is the effect that, that activity might have on our curve, on our loan loss curves. We have, as the earlier question implied, and when we decided to lower our down payment, we've increased our financing propensity. And therefore, that fact alone means for the same sales, you have to reserve a higher percentage because you're financing a higher percentage. So part of it has to do with the percentage of sales finance. And then some of it is just the volume of the business, I think, was another component. And then there are small things here and there that aren't essential for me to explain. But I think those are the major categories. And I think in general, the quarter came in below what our expectations were, not substantially below but below what we believe the number was.

So -- but beyond 2017, as Steve said, we haven't gone through our budget reviews yet. And I think our working assumption will be we can't discern a change for the better or the worse.

But we haven't reviewed budgets. So I'll just say that. But in general, over the longer term, the puts and takes are -- our CapEx is one of the factors that applies against free cash flow. And we believe we're in a comfortable CapEx zone at this point, which is in the low $200 millions. And our expectation would be -- we've talked to the business unit about down payments. That was an initiative this year as well about lowering down payments. I'm sure that'll be a discussion topic in the budget review. But other than that we expect that the free cash flow trends over the longer term should mirror the EBITDA trends. Because we feel like we've reached steady state on working capital, we've talked about how much we had invested in product. We don't have a different point of view on that as we sit here today. We feel our CapEx number is in a comfortable zone. And so there's no reason to believe that the longer-term trend shouldn't mirror the EBITDA longer-term trends.

I'll just respond to the other question about, following up on Joe's question regarding splitting up the company. As we said in the past, we believe there are a lot of advantages to having these businesses together. The most recent and notable example of that is the Wyndham Rewards program, which is really becoming a blue thread that runs through all of our businesses. That is something that we think will drive value to all business units, and that is a powerful, powerful product. It's only been around in its current form for about 1.5 years. And it's already setting top levels in all types of ratings for loyalty programs. So we're very proud of what that group has done. And it is being, as I said in my comments, it's being embraced by the timeshare business as well as by the Vacation Rental business to drive more business between the 3 initiatives. And that is going to be a major factor going forward that we see will be a positive impactor. The other positive impact is our technology. We have a very -- we have a terrific IT group across all the business units. And they share ideas, and those ideas result in things like the yield management system at the Vacation Rental business. That came out of our exchange business. And it was kind of that technology and know-how was transferred over and applied there. So there's a lot of elements within a company that work well together. But as I've said, we look at whatever we believe as a board will drive greatest shareholder value for the shareholders. And yes, we will look at all the options that are out there."

While I think it continues to be an underpenetrated product, it's not -- as you saw in this quarter, we increased our new owner number by 10%. So getting new owners is not a massive challenge. We just have to decide that we focus on that. And when you focus on that, with a ship the size of our ship, you don't just shift gears immediately. You need to bring on the sales people who are more accustomed to new owner sales. You have to modify things like your commission program. So it's not a simple flipping of a switch. It's an effort. It's an effort across the organization. So no, I don't think that there's anything larger scale that for some reason, timeshare is less attractive. As we've seen in the past, it was sold during the downturn very effectively. And it continues to be a product that is welcomed by consumers to this day. And also notably, because people have asked us about this I've put it in my script, 25% of the people who bought this year, are below the age of 40. So this isn't just a product for baby boomers. It's a product that is attractive to many different segments of the demographic profile."

With respect to the number of offerings, I can't give you the specifics. I know that we're going up to 25,000 different units that are available for Wyndham Rewards redemption. There will be certain properties that we pull out that are going to be kind of termed as our featured favorites, which are ones that will be made available to owners. But the way it's basically going to work is, and this technology will improve over time, if you want to redeem points, you go online, you look at what you can redeem for and then you're going to need to be directed to the various sources of booking for right now. In the future, it'll be all automated. But for now, if you want to do a WVO unit, you'll be directed over there and they have a team that's set up specifically to handle that, and the same thing with our Vacation Rental. So it's a large number and it's a great variety of products. And we'll have ones that are really quick to get to, which would be our featured favorites, that will be a mix of vacation product in Europe and in the U.S. as well as Vacation Ownership product at our timeshare business."

It's a good question regarding what I'm referring to because really, I'm more referring to domestic RevPAR than international RevPAR. We've seen pockets of positive and pockets of negative RevPAR performance internationally, and that is very much driven by local economic conditions. With respect to U.S., specifically on terrorism, where the terroristic activities have occurred, we've seen immediate impact on occupancies, but then they do bounce back. So I wouldn't say that there's a continued impact from the terrorist activities. And we certainly couldn't pull that out of any numbers that we look at. But -- so I'm referring more to domestic. But I think across the board, there are concerns now. Obviously, if you look at our rental business in Europe, we had a fantastic third quarter. So clearly, people in Northern Europe, which is where most of our businesses are based, they were traveling, they were going out. They were visiting families, they were having vacation. So it was very, very strong in Europe and yet, you could look at some European economies and say that they're down. And yet people are still traveling. So it's not as black and white maybe as the question you asked, Mike, because it's a little bit blurred in different areas. But my remarks about softening are really just that we've had a number of years of really terrific RevPAR growth. And now we're getting back to that more normalized inflation-plus type levels of RevPAR growth, in my opinion."
