I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. Starting on Page 1. The fi",2826,"Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $5.4 billion, EPS of $1.32 and return on tangible common equity of 11% on $23.7 billion of revenue. Included in the results is legal expense of $400 million after tax for a range of matters and we continue to put some issues behind us. This is reflected in a reduction of more than $1 billion to our reasonably possible loss estimate this quarter. In addition, we recognized the benefit of a settlement reached of $300 million after tax, which related to monies owed to Washington Mutual in connection with a failed savings and loan institution. We're showing this on the page as legal-related but on the benefits recorded in revenue in corporate. 
Much like we saw in the third quarter, the overall company's performance benefited from diversification across our businesses. We saw strong growth in consumer drivers, on the back of improvement in the U.S. economy, in large part generating core loan growth of 16% for the company. Global markets remained challenged across a number of fronts, leading to lower client activity and lower inventory. Against this backdrop, the CIB delivered solid performance across products. And in the quarter, we continued our trend of strong balance sheet, capital and expense discipline and exceeded targets. 
Shifting through the full year's results, if you skip over Page 2 -- or Page 3. The firm earned record net income of $24.4 billion and record EPS of $6 a share and a return on tangible common equity of 13.5% on revenue of nearly $97 billion. Revenue was down 1% or $1.3 billion, driven by noncore items, most notably by business and litigation in the investment bank and also in private equity. Adjusted, our underlying businesses were up modestly. We're very happy with our expense story for the year. We delivered adjusted expense of $56 billion, down $2.4 billion and a 2 percentage point decrease in adjusted overhead ratio. And while we did have a modest benefit from the strengthening dollar this year, we also self-funded incremental investments. Credit performance was strong, in line with our expectations, with net charge-offs at $4.1 billion, with obviously the biggest area of stress in wholesale being oil and gas, against which we built about $550 million of reserves this year, including $124 million this quarter. And at the outlook for oil has weakened, we would expect to see some additional reserve build in 2016 but prices would need to remain at this level for an extended period for them to be significant. 
We also built $68 million of reserves in metals and mining, including $35 million this quarter. We're watching the sector closely and similarly, as commodity prices remain at current levels, we would expect some additional reserve build but would not expect them to be significant. Finally, net capital distributions for the year were approximately $11 million, including dividends of $1.72 a share. 
Turning to Page 4. Starting on the top left, overall, our average balance sheet is down $100 billion year-on-year and our spot balance sheet down over $200 billion, with of course the biggest driver being a reduction of approximately $200 billion of wholesale nonoperating deposits, ultimately reflected in lower cash balances. In addition, you can see notable reductions in all other balance sheet categories, except for loans, which reflect the 16% core loan growth we achieved. Some portion of the other wholesale balance reductions were purposeful and will be sticky, particularly the decrease in short-term wholesale funding balances. The remainder resulted from volatile markets and general deleveraging, driving risk off and lower inventory across products. As clients demand for leverage growth, we will likely put some of that balance sheet back to work. 
Moving to the right. The story on deposits continued to be a very positive one as we delivered some incremental reductions of nonoperating balance while consistently growing retail and operating deposits. On the bottom left, overall, NII was up about $300 million, driving a 7 basis point improvement in NIM. The increase in NII reflects a mix shift to loans but also includes gains on certain securities and the impact of the rate move in December on this quarter's NII was not significant. 
Looking forward to the first quarter. Expect firm NII and NIM to be flat to up slightly, on higher rates and mix, substantially offset by the absence of those security gains as well as normal seasonal day count. However, for the full year, with the December rate hike alone, so in a rate flat scenario, together with the loan growth that we have seen and expect, we would expect to deliver about $2 billion of incremental NII. 
Perhaps the highlight of this page on the bottom right is that based upon the actions we've taken throughout the course of 2015, we believe that we have just reached the 3.5% method 2 G-SIB bucket and that we are close to the 2% method 1 G-SIB bucket. So the task ahead is to solidify this position, which we'll talk more about at Investor Day. 
Turning to Page 5. We're ending the year well ahead of our capital targets, with the firm's advanced fully paid NIM CT 1 ratio at 11.6% and our standardized fully based in ratio at 11.7%. The improvement to both ratios was driven by net capital generation, along with an overall reduction in risk-weighted assets, with net loan growth being more than offset by lower market risk, reductions in derivatives as well as secured financing balances. And these deliver a more meaningful reduction on the standardized approach. But with reference to my earlier comments on redeploying balance sheet, a portion of this reduction will likely reverse in the near future. 
Firm and bank SLR were 6.5% and 6.6%, respectively. Finally, we returned $2.6 billion of net capital to shareholders this quarter, including $1 billion in net repurchases and common dividends of $0.44 a share. 
Let's turn to Page 6 on consumer and community banking. The combined consumer businesses generated $2.4 billion of net income on revenue of $11.2 billion and ROE of 18% for the quarter. And full year expense was down by nearly $1 billion or half of our commitment if you adjust for legal and $150 million of incremental investments this year. Going forward, we'll have opportunities to further reinvest. You can see headcount was down by 12,000 for the year and nearly 43,000 in 2012. The fundamental business drivers remain strong. Year-over-year, average loans were up 11%, with core loans up 25% driven by mortgage, but with strength across products. Average deposits were up 10%. We added nearly 600,000 households and our active mobile customer base continues to grow, up 20% to roughly 23 million customers, the largest of the major U.S. banks. 
Moving to Page 7, Consumer and Business Banking. CBB generated strong results for the quarter, with net income of $968 million and an ROE of 32%, on relatively flat revenue of $4.6 billion. Although NII was flat quarter-on-quarter, it was down 5% year-on-year on spread compression, largely offset by that 10% deposit growth. And excluding an $85 million gain on the sale of a branch, noninterest revenue was down 3% seasonally and up 4% year-on-year, driven by high service fees and strong debit volume. We expect NII to show normal seasonal declines in the first quarter. Expense was down 3% year-on-year on lower headcount from branch efficiency. And additionally, client assets were up 2% and Business Banking average loan balance is up 6%. 
Next, Mortgage Banking on Page 8. Overall net income is $266 million. Originations in the quarter were $23 billion, down seasonally and we continue to add high-quality loans to our balance sheet, $16 billion for the quarter and totaling $70 billion for the full year. Total revenue of $1.7 billion increased 8% sequentially on strong loan growth as well as on the higher MSR risk management. For the full year, our loan interest revenue was down relative to 2014 by $1.2 billion, broadly in line with our guidance and that downward trend will continue as servicing balances continue to decline and as we expect production margins will compress in the smaller markets. We expect the decline in 2016 to be around $700 million. 
Expense of $1.2 billion picked up this quarter, related to exiting the OCT's consent order but it was down 10% year-on-year as we continue to manage costs. Finally, on credit. Net charge-offs of 13 basis points reflects the quality of our portfolio. 
Moving on to Page 9. Card, Commercial Solutions and Auto. Overall net income of $1.2 billion and an ROE of 24%. Revenue was $5 billion, up 10% year-on-year, driven principally by 2 nonrecurring items. The first was a loss in the prior year of over $200 million that related to noncore portfolio exits and a gain we saw this quarter of about $160 million on the IPO of Square. Adjusted, the revenue rate was 11.9% and in terms of core performance, business drivers were strong and growth offset the impact of co-brand renewals in noninterest revenues while driving growth in NII. Year-over-year, we saw a growth of 12% in auto, loan and lease balances; 6% in car sales volume; 3% in cars loans as well as 12% and 14% in merchant processing volumes and transactions, respectively. Expense of $2.2 billion, flat quarter-on-quarter but up 4% year-on-year, reflected higher depreciation on auto lease growth. And we expect expense to be relatively flat in the first quarter as we continue to invest. 
While on auto, 2015 set a record for new car sales, with strength in the fourth quarter continuing through December, when we gained nearly 40 basis points a share year-over-year, with the strength of our manufacturing partnerships driving growth. Finally on credit, in auto, net charge-offs were 50 basis points and while higher, it was still below our long-term expectations. And in card, the net charge-off rate was 242 basis points for the quarter, 251 for the year, and given our underwriting discipline, client selection and the improving economy, we expect net charge-offs to stay at these levels in 2016. 
Now turning to Page 10 and the Corporate and Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $1.7 billion on revenue of $7.1 billion and an ROE of 10%. In investment banking for the full year, we continue to rank number 1 in global IDCs and number 1 in North America and EMEA. In M&A, we maintained our number 2 ranking and grew wallet share by 50 basis points. In ECM, we rank #1 globally, up from #3 last year; and in DCM, we ranked #1 across high yield, high grades and loans. 
Banking revenue for the quarter of $1.5 billion was down 11%, driven by lower debt underwriting fees. It was another outstanding performance in advisory fees, up 43% in the corporate  third quarter in a market that was down 12, largely due in the North America. Equity underwriting fees were down 4% in the market down 12, with the U.S. remaining somewhat slow but a resurgence of large transactions in Europe and Asia and debt underwriting fees were down 43% from a record last year where we saw an unprecedented number of large events. Treasury Services revenue was flat quarter-on-quarter but down 4% year-on-year on lower deposit spread. In markets, a number of factors contributed to a quiet fourth quarter overall across products. Investor risk appetite was significantly dampened by a series of market events and clients retrenched and de-risked early. With that backdrop, the market businesses delivered $3.6 billion in revenue, in line with our expectations and normal seasonal trends, with adjusted revenues down 16% sequentially and 1% year-on-year. In fixed income, rates markets were up given U.S. and ECB monetary policy actions, offset by year-on-year declines in currencies and emerging markets as the strong dollar and emerging markets uncertainty being assisted as well as the commodities on reduced hedging and declines in credit on all those things seen plus a number of single name corporate events. Equities delivered solid results, flat excluding the exit of broker-dealer services last year, with strong performance in Europe being offset by lower deal flow in North America and Asia compared to a strong prior year. 
With respect to the first quarter, reflecting low levels of client activity, we would like to risk going into the year and inventory was low and so far, our trading businesses are performing well. But as you know, it is early and difficult to predict how the quarter will play out. Security Services revenue was $933 million, in line with guidance given the continued impact of lower emerging markets on asset-based fees. For the first quarter, expect revenue to be approximately $900 million, which includes seasonality. On credit, we saw a reserve build of $76 million, which included $63 million related to oil and gas. Finally, expense of $4.4 billion was down 20% year-on-year, mainly driven by lower legal. The comp to revenue ratio was 26% for the quarter and 30% for the full year. Moving on to page 11 and the Commercial Bank. The Commercial Bank generated net income of $550 million on revenue of $1.8 billion and an ROE of 15%. Revenue was up sequentially, but relatively flat year-on-year, with NII up 3% on higher loan balances despite spread compression offset by lower IB revenue from a strong quarter last year. However, for the full year, it was a record for investment banking, with gross revenue of $2.2 billion, up 10% from 2014. Expense of $750 million included $50 million of impairments on leased corporate aircraft, on the reassessment of residual values. The reigning balance sheet value portfolio is modest. We saw record average loan balances of $166 billion, up 14% year-on-year, with growth in Commercial Real Estate of 17% exceeding the industry as we continue to invest in its business and gain share. In C&I, loans were up 11%, largely driven by Corporate Client Banking on the back of several large transactions. 
Finally, credit performance of the portfolio does remain strong with only 4 basis points of net charge-offs. However, we did add $100 million to reserves, $60 million of which relates to oil and gas and $26 million for metals and mining. 
Moving on to page 12, asset management. Asset Management reported net income of $500 million, with a 27% pretax margin and 21% ROE, on revenue of $3 billion, down 5% year-on-year, driven by lower performance fees in alternative. Expense of $2.2 billion was also down 5% year-on-year, roughly equally explained by lower performance fee-driven compensation as well as a benefit from refining the value of a health scale asset. Assets under management of $1.7 trillion and client assets of $2.4 trillion were down 1% and 2% year-over-year, respectively. We saw mix flows in the fourth quarter resulting in long-term net outflows of $9 billion, with solid inflows and equity being more than offset by weakness in fixed income and the loss of select mandates. However, we had strong long-term investment performance, with 80% of mutual fund AOM ranked in the first or second quartiles over 5 years, which should be supported of future flow. And for the full year, we had positive long term inflows of $16 billion. In lending, we had record balances $110 billion, up 7% year-on-year, driven by both mortgage as well as traditional loans. 
Turning to page 13 and Corporate. Treasury and CIO reported net income of $138 million for the quarter. Included in this result, there's a pretax benefit of $178 million relating to certain securities held at a discount that record at par and this was a non-NII. Other Corporate net income of $84 million included a net benefit of $60 million after tax for the legal related matters we discussed earlier, as well as the contribution to our foundation this quarter of $150 million pretax. 
Turning to page 14. I've given you some guidance throughout the presentation and this page is for your reference. Obviously, when we get to Investor Day, we will give you a comprehensive outlook for each of our businesses for the year. So in summary, a solid quarter and a record for the full year, both in terms of net income and EPS, which even on higher capital, translates to a good return on tangible transferable common equity of 13.5%. We exceeded our targets on expense management, generating positive operating leverage and improving our adjusted overhead ratio by 2 percentage points. We had another strong core line growth of 16%, materially changed the mix of our deposit base, including growing retail deposits at 10% and made meaningful progress on our balance sheet, our decent surcharge and capital levels. With that, operator, we'll take Q&A."

So the way we do our results, this is just for context as I think it is important -- obviously, the oil price outlook is important and instructive and it's very clearly going to drive how we think about probabilities of default and was given to fall in certain of our customers but I think it's also the case just for context to know that it is very name-by-name specific conditions and clients matter greatly. And so when we do these estimates, they are directionally correct in order of magnitude correct. But that's just the context. Oil, we said last quarter, if oil reached $30 a barrel and here we are, and stayed there for call it, 18 months, you could expect to see reserve builds of up to $750 million and that assumption hasn't fundamentally change. So it is not the current market expectation that oil will flat line. It is -- the expectation right now that there will be a modest recovery. Based upon that, we would expect to take some additional reserves but for them to be more modest, less significant, but that kind of the range of oil of $30 and stayed here for a long time, up to $750 million."

You probably heard my comment but to clarify, on an apples-to-apples basis or half later on consumer, we've done $1 billion this year. You don't see that 100% translate into the results partly because of the legal expense, which is not something that we particularly can predict and hopefully won't be there forever. Also because we intentionally decisioned in 2015, in the fourth quarter in particular, more mentally to increase our investments in the consumer businesses by $150 million. So we've achieved the $1 billion. We chose to reinvest a quarter of it. Another $1 billion, we're on track for. We will potentially reinvest some of that, too and Gordon, and we will talk to you about the basis for that at Investor Day. On the $2.8 billion in CIB, we're $1.3 billion through at the end of the year and we talked before about the fact that the first $1.3 billion is largely on business identification. We've had the revenue decline. We need to have the expense decline and we were required to deliver that and we have. The next chunk has to do with technology and operations and infrastructure and organization and it's harder. And so we will continue with them on track to deliver it.

At that point, it becomes increasingly compelling to want to look at the margin or what you could do to get within the bucket and so that is what we did in the fourth quarter is spent time really focusing on getting to that achievable boundary, which we dropped at that point as well. And remember, it's not nothing in the year that we start of the thinking we would exit $100 billion of nonoperating deposit and while that's new it still could be some volatility in that number, of course. We've all made double that or double that, in fact. So we got some wind to our backs in doing it. It's also the case that when you get the entire business and company attuned to the sense of urgency and desires to want to be increasingly efficient in this way, that, at the margin in our 100 different things, little benefit the crew. So the correct, about 3.5 weeks to adjusted 3.5 bucket as we estimated. It's not as much important whether we're basis points of surcharge points below or above. It's much more what we do now to get safely in the bucket and that's going to still take work. So that's why, we'll obviously talk to you more about this at Investor Day. In terms of the give out from an economic perspective, we wouldn't have done it at any cost. We have done it because we think it is important to do because we think it's going to be constructive for the company and because the revenue give outs were not significant, but they weren't either but to be able to reduce a constraint that it is in one way or another likely to bind us or in multiple ways in fact likely to bind us.

So that -- I would say that based upon sort of 4 quarter balance sheet, given that market risk was a driver, given that balance sheet levels were the driver particularly on standardized, we could give back on standardized as much as 10, 20 bps of the 10.7% capital accretion. The bigger point on the RWA outlook is that we expect to be bound over the medium term by standardized and standardized is going to always have a mutual to upwards pressure as we continue to grow these high-quality loans. So even though the RWA being at the 1.5-ish trillion dollars that we expected is obviously good news, regardless of how much that may in the short term revert. Our job is going to be to continue to become more efficient to try and keep it there, just given the natural upward pressure of the standardized calculations. We can become more efficient in the sense that we are likely to be bound by it in a medium term. So that's what we're focused on. I wouldn't take one -- the $1.5 trillion and read through that will be continuing to decline from here on standardized. We'll be continuing to work hard to make sure that we can grow those loans that we love but there have been as 7% with a standard basis."

In terms of how we think about buffers, just really conceptually, the firm manages and the board have set for the firm a risk appetite. That risk appetite has a number of features and capital depreciation, depletion in a tough environment is one of them. And so when we think about setting buffers, we think about it just broadly in the context of allowing ourselves enough room to absorb losses that are within our risk appetite and not have to take premature actions from a capital perspective. So but having said that, our buffer has been pretty consistent at the 50 basis point level for a reasonable period of time and we'll update you on all of that at Investor Day. With respect to our target, it's a little bit more complicated than minimum regulated capital because as you say, we're bound potentially by multiple constraints and one of them maybe CCAR -- well it is CCAR, as it say. Because as you know, the first 2 quarters of this year, our capital distribution plans have been approved. We haven't done CCAR so this not any part of prediction but it's not which is surprising to know that it's unlikely that we will pay out 100% of our earnings in CCAR going forward. So we are on a path to continue to accrete capital then we would like to move up in our payout range. So given that we're still moving towards our 12% target and we will update you if any of that changes at Investor Day. We're also, as you know, potentially going to understand whether or not the Fed changes any of the CCAR parameters and whether that has an impact. So at the moment, the best we know is that we can continue to accrete capital, albeit more slowly as we hope to move out in the payout range but we haven't done CCAR yet. And that set the rules, go change, I mean 12% is it for now."

I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. Starting on Page 1. The fi",2816,"Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $5.4 billion, EPS of $1.32 and return on tangible common equity of 11% on $23.7 billion of revenue. Included in the results is legal expense of $400 million after tax for a range of matters, and we continue to put some issues behind us. This is reflected in a reduction of more than $1 billion to our reasonably possible loss estimate this quarter.
In addition, we recognized the benefit of a settlement reached of $300 million after tax, which related to monies owed to Washington Mutual in connection with a failed savings and loan institution. We're showing this on the page as legal-related and the benefits recorded in revenue in corporate.
Much like we saw in the third quarter, the overall company's performance benefited from diversification across our businesses. We saw strong growth in consumer drivers, on the back of improvement in the U.S. economy, in large part generating core loan growth of 16% for the company. Global markets remained challenged across a number of fronts, leading to lower client activity and lower inventory. Against this backdrop, the CIB delivered solid performance across products. And in the quarter, we continued our trend of strong balance sheet, capital and expense discipline and exceeded targets.
Shifting to the full year's results, if you skip over Page 2, on Page 3. The firm earned record net income of $24.4 billion and record EPS of $6 a share and a return on tangible common equity of 13.5% on revenue of nearly $97 billion. Revenue was down 1% or $1.3 billion, driven by noncore items, most notably by business simplification in the investment bank and also in private equity. Adjusted, our underlying businesses were up modestly. We're very happy with our expense story for the year. We delivered adjusted expense of $56 billion, down $2.4 billion and a 2 percentage point decrease in adjusted overhead ratio. And while we did have a modest benefit from the strengthening dollar this year, we also self-funded incremental investments. Credit performance was strong, in line with our expectations, with net charge-offs at $4.1 billion, with obviously the biggest area of stress in wholesale being oil and gas, against which we built about $550 million of reserves this year, including $124 million this quarter. And as the outlook for oil has weakened, we would expect to see some additional reserve build in 2016 but prices would need to remain at this level for an extended period for them to be significant.
We also built $68 million of reserves in metals and mining, including $35 million this quarter. We're watching the sector closely and similarly, as commodity prices remain at current levels, we would expect some additional reserve builds but would not expect them to be significant. Finally, net capital distributions for the year were approximately $11 million, including dividends of $1.72 a share. 
Turning to Page 4. Starting on the top left, overall, our average balance sheet is down $100 billion year-on-year and our spot balance sheet down over $200 billion, with, of course, the biggest driver being a reduction of approximately $200 billion of wholesale nonoperating deposits, ultimately reflected in lower cash balances. In addition, you can see notable reductions in all other balance sheet categories, except for loans, which reflects the 16% core loan growth we achieved. Some portion of the other wholesale balance reductions were purposeful and will be sticky, particularly the decrease in short-term wholesale funding balances. The remainder resulted from volatile markets and general deleveraging, driving risk off and lower inventory across products. As clients demand for leverage growth, we will likely put some of that balance sheet back to work.
Moving to the right. The story on deposits continued to be a very positive one, as we delivered some incremental reductions of nonoperating balance while consistently growing retail and operating deposits. On the bottom left, overall, NII was up about $300 million, driving a 7 basis point improvement in NIM. The increase in NII reflects a mix shift to loans but also includes gains on certain securities and the impact of the rate move in December on this quarter's NII was not significant.
Looking forward to the first quarter. Expect firm NII and NIM to be flat to up slightly, on higher rates and mix, substantially offset by the absence of those security gains as well as normal seasonal day count. However, for the full year, with the December rate hike alone, so in a rate flat scenario, together with the loan growth that we have seen and expect, we would expect to deliver about $2 billion of incremental NII.
Perhaps the highlight of this page on the bottom right is that based upon the actions we've taken throughout the course of 2015, we believe that we have just reached the 3.5% Method 2 G-SIB bucket and that we are close to the 2% Method 1 G-SIB bucket. So the task ahead is to solidify this position, which we'll talk more about at Investor Day.
Turning to Page 5. We're ending the year well ahead of our capital targets, with the firm's Advanced Fully Phased-In CET1 ratio at 11.6% and our Standardized Fully Phased-In ratio at 11.7%. The improvement to both ratios is driven by net capital generation, along with an overall reduction in risk-weighted assets, with net loan growth being more than offset by lower market risk, reductions in derivatives as well as secured financing balances. And these deliver a more meaningful reduction under the standardized approach. But with reference to my earlier comments on redeploying balance sheet, a portion of this reduction will likely reverse in the near future.
Firm and bank SLR were 6.5% and 6.6%, respectively. Finally, we returned $2.6 billion of net capital to shareholders this quarter, including $1 billion in net repurchases and common dividends of $0.44 a share.
Let's turn to Page 6 and Consumer & Community Banking. The combined consumer businesses generated $2.4 billion of net income on revenue of $11.2 billion and ROE of 18% for the quarter. And full year expense was down by nearly $1 billion or half of our commitment if you adjust for legal and $150 million of incremental investments this year. Going forward, we'll have opportunities to further reinvest. You can see headcount was down by 12,000 for the year and nearly 43,000 since 2012.
The fundamental business drivers remain strong. Year-over-year, average loans were up 11%, with core loans up 25% driven by mortgage, but with strength across products. Average deposits were up 10%. We added nearly 600,000 households and our active mobile customer base continues to grow, up 20% to roughly 23 million customers, the largest of the major U.S. banks.
Moving to Page 7, Consumer & Business Banking. CBB generated strong results for the quarter, with net income of $968 million and an ROE of 32%, on relatively flat revenue of $4.6 billion. Although NII was flat quarter-on-quarter, it was down 5% year-on-year on spread compression, largely offset by that 10% deposit growth. And excluding an $85 million gain on the sale of a branch, noninterest revenue was down 3% seasonally and up 4% year-on-year, driven by higher service fees and strong debit volume. We expect NII to show normal seasonal declines in the first quarter. Expense was down 3% year-on-year on lower headcount from branch efficiency. And additionally, client assets were up 2% and Business Banking average loan balance is up 6%.
Next, Mortgage Banking on Page 8. Overall net income is $266 million. Originations in the quarter were $23 billion, down seasonally and we continue to add high-quality loans to our balance sheet, $16 billion for the quarter and totaling $70 billion for the full year. Total revenue of $1.7 billion increased 8% sequentially, on strong loan growth as well as on the higher MSR risk management. For the full year, our loan interest revenue was down relative to 2014 by $1.2 billion, broadly in line with our guidance and that downward trend will continue as servicing balances continue to decline and as we expect production margins will compress in the smaller markets. We expect the decline in 2016 to be around $700 million.
Expense of $1.2 billion picked up this quarter, related to exiting the OCT's consent order, but it was down 10% year-on-year as we continue to manage costs. Finally, on credit. Net charge-offs of 13 basis points reflects the quality of our portfolio.
Moving on to Page 9, Card, Commercial Solutions & Auto. Overall net income of $1.2 billion and an ROE of 24%. Revenue was $5 billion, up 10% year-on-year, driven principally by 2 nonrecurring items. The first was a loss in the prior year of over $200 million that related to noncore portfolio exits and a gain we saw this quarter of about $160 million on the IPO of Square. Adjusted, the revenue rate was 11.9% and in terms of core performance, business drivers were strong and growth offset the impact of co-brand renewals on noninterest revenues while driving growth in NII. Year-over-year, we saw a growth of 12% in auto, loan and lease balances; 6% in car sales volume; 3% in cars loans as well as 12% and 14% in merchant processing volumes and transactions, respectively. Expense of $2.2 billion, flat quarter-on-quarter but up 4% year-on-year, reflected higher depreciation on auto lease growth. And we expect expense to be relatively flat into the first quarter as we continue to invest.
While on auto, 2015 set a record for new car sales, with strength in the fourth quarter continuing through December, when we gained nearly 40 basis points a share year-over-year, with the strength of our manufacturing partnerships driving growth. Finally on credit, in auto, net charge-offs were 50 basis points and while higher, it was still below our long-term expectations. And in card, the net charge-off rate was 242 basis points for the quarter, 251 for the year, and given our underwriting discipline, client selection and the improving economy, we expect net charge-offs to stay at these levels in 2016.
Now turning to Page 10 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $1.7 billion on revenue of $7.1 billion and an ROE of 10%. In investment banking for the full year, we continue to rank #1 in global IDCs and #1 in North America and EMEA. In M&A, we maintained our #2 ranking and grew wallet share by 50 basis points. In ECM, we rank #1 globally, up from #3 last year; and in DCM, we ranked #1 across high yield, high grades and loans.
Banking revenue for the quarter of $1.5 billion was down 11%, driven by lower debt underwriting fees. It was another outstanding performance in advisory fees, up 43% in the corporate third quarter in a market that was down 12%, largely driven by North America. Equity underwriting fees were down 4% in the market down 12%, with the U.S. remaining somewhat slow but a resurgence of large transactions in Europe and Asia and debt underwriting fees were down 43% from a record last year where we saw an unprecedented number of large events.
Treasury Services revenue was flat quarter-on-quarter but down 4% year-on-year on lower deposit spread. In markets, a number of factors contributed to a quiet fourth quarter overall across products. Investor risk appetite was significantly dampened by a series of market events and clients retrenched and de-risked early. With that backdrop, the market businesses delivered $3.6 billion in revenue, in line with our expectations and normal seasonal trends, with adjusted revenues down 16% sequentially and 1% year-on-year. In fixed income, rate markets were up given U.S. and ECB monetary policy actions, offset by year-on-year declines in currencies and emerging markets as the strong dollar and emerging markets uncertainty being assisted, as well as the commodities on reduced hedging and declines in credit on all those things seen [ph] plus a number of single name corporate events. Equities delivered solid results, flat excluding the exit of broker-dealer services last year, with strong performance in Europe being offset by lower deal flow in North America and Asia compared to a strong prior year.
With respect to the first quarter, reflecting low levels of client activity, we would like to risk going into the year end and inventory was low. And so far, our trading businesses are performing well. But as you know, it is early and it's difficult to predict how the quarter will play out. Security Services revenue was $933 million, in line with guidance given the continued impact of lower emerging markets on asset-based fees. For the first quarter, expect revenues to be approximately $900 million, which includes seasonality. On credit, we saw a reserve build of $76 million, which included $63 million related to oil and gas. Finally, expense of $4.4 billion was down 20% year-on-year, mainly driven by lower legal. The comp-to-revenue ratio was 26% for the quarter and 30% for the full year.
Moving on to page 11 and the Commercial Bank. The Commercial Bank generated net income of $550 million on revenue of $1.8 billion and an ROE of 15%. Revenue was up sequentially, but relatively flat year-on-year, with NII up 3% on higher loan balances despite spread compression offset by lower IB revenue from a strong quarter last year. However, for the full year, it was a record for investment banking, with gross revenue of $2.2 billion, up 10% from 2014. Expense of $750 million included $50 million of impairments on leased corporate aircraft, on the reassessment of residual values. The remaining balance sheet value of this portfolio is modest. We saw record average loan balances of $166 billion, up 14% year-on-year, with growth in Commercial Real Estate up 17% exceeding the industry as we continue to invest in its business and gain share. In C&I, loans were up 11%, largely driven by Corporate Client Banking on the back of several large transactions.
Finally, credit performance of the portfolio does remain strong with only 4 basis points of net charge-offs. However, we did add $100 million to reserves, $60 million of which relates to oil and gas and $26 million for metals and mining.
Moving on to Page 12, Asset Management. Asset Management reported net income of $500 million, with a 27% pretax margin and 21% ROE, on revenue of $3 billion, down 5% year-on-year, driven by lower performance fees in alternative. Expense of $2.2 billion was also down 5% year-on-year, roughly equally explained by lower performance fee-driven compensation as well as a benefit from refining the value of a health scale asset. Assets under management of $1.7 trillion and client assets of $2.4 trillion were down 1% and 2% year-over-year, respectively. We saw mixed flows in the fourth quarter resulting in long-term net outflows of $9 billion, with solid inflows and equity being more than offset by weakness in fixed income and the loss of select mandates. However, we had strong long-term investment performance, with 80% of mutual fund AOM ranked in the first or second quartiles over 5 years, which should be supportive of future flow. And for the full year, we had positive long term inflows of $16 billion. In lending, we had record balances $110 billion, up 7% year-on-year, driven by both mortgage as well as traditional loans.
Turning to page 13 and Corporate. Treasury and CIO reported net income of $138 million for the quarter. Included in this result, there's a pretax benefit of $178 million relating to certain securities held at a discount that record at par and this was a non-NII. Other Corporate net income of $84 million included a net benefit of $60 million after tax for the legal related matters we discussed earlier, as well as the contribution to our foundation this quarter of $150 million pretax.
Turning to page 14. I've given you some guidance throughout the presentation and this page is for your reference. Obviously, when we get to Investor Day, we will give you a comprehensive outlook for each of our businesses for the year. So in summary, a solid quarter and a record for the full year, both in terms of net income and EPS, which even on higher capital, translates to a good return on tangible common equity of 13.5%. We exceeded our targets on expense management, generating positive operating leverage and improving our adjusted overhead ratio by 2 percentage points. Another strong core loan growth of 16%, materially changed the mix of our deposit base, including growing retail deposits at 10% and made meaningful progress on our balance sheet, our decent surcharge and capital levels. With that, operator, we'll take Q&A."

And so when we do these estimates, they are directionally correct in order of magnitude correct. But that's just the context. Oil, we said last quarter, if oil reached $30 a barrel and here we are, and stayed there for call it, 18 months, you could expect to see reserve builds of up to $750 million and that assessment hasn't fundamentally changed. So it is not the current market expectation that oil will flat line. It is -- the expectation right now that there will be a modest recovery. Based upon that, we would expect to take some additional reserves but for them to be more modest, less significant, but that kind of the range of oil of $30 and stayed here for a long time, up to $750 million."

You reduced the lines of credit. You got ahead of that early. In 2007, you weren't exactly at the start but then you adjusted and then you said, ""Hey, this is a big issue."" And now we have oil and gas, which could be another industry-specific stress and you're only taking additional provisions of $124 million. Is that going to be enough?

Also because we intentionally decisioned in 2015, in the fourth quarter in particular, more mentally to increase our investments in the consumer businesses by $150 million. So we've achieved the $1 billion. We chose to reinvest a portion of it. Another $1 billion, we're on track for.

And remember, it's not -- nothing in the year that we started the year thinking we would exit $100 billion of nonoperating deposit and while that's still there could be some volatility in that number, of course. We've almost double that or double that, in fact. So we got some wind to our backs in doing it. It's also the case that when you get the entire business and company attuned to the sense of urgency and desire to want to be increasingly efficient in this way, that, at the margin in our 100 different things, little benefit the crew. So the correct, about 3.5 weeks to adjust, in fact, the 3.5 bucket as we estimated. It's not as much important whether we're basis points or surcharge points below or above. It's much more what we do now to get safely in the bucket and that's going to still take work. So that's why, we'll obviously talk to you more about this at Investor Day. In terms of the give out from an economic perspective, we wouldn't have done it at any cost. We have done it because we think it is important to do, because we think it's going to be constructive for the company and because the revenue give outs were not significant, but they weren't wider.

We could give back on standardized as much as 10, 20 bps of capital -- of the 10.7% capital accretion. But the bigger point on the RWA outlook is that we expect to be bound over the medium term by standardized and standardized is going to always have a mutual to upwards pressure as we continue to grow these high-quality loans. So even though the RWA being at the 1.5-ish trillion dollars sooner than we expected is obviously good news, regardless of how much that may in the short term revert. Our job is going to be to continue to become more efficient to try and keep it there, just given the natural upward pressure of the standardized calculations. We can become more efficient in advance but we're unlikely to be bound by it in the medium term. So that's what we're focused on. I wouldn't take one, the -- $1.5 trillion and read through that will be continuing to decline from here on standardized. We'll be continuing to work hard to make sure that we can grow those loans that we lost but there have been [indiscernible] under standalone basis."

So in terms of how we think about buffers, just really conceptually, the firm manages and the board have set for the firm a risk appetite. That risk appetite has a number of features and capital depreciation -- depletion and the stress environment is one of them. And so when we think about setting buffers, we think about it just broadly in the context of allowing ourselves enough room to absorb losses that are within our risk appetite and not have to take premature actions from a capital perspective. So but having said that, our buffer has been pretty consistent at the 50 basis point level for a reasonable period of time, and we'll update you on all of that at Investor Day. With respect to our target, it's a little bit more complicated than minimum regulated capital because as you say, we're bound potentially by multiple constraints and one of them maybe CCAR, plus -- well it is CCAR, I should say. Because as you know, the first 2 quarters of this year, our capital distribution plans have already been approved. And we haven't done CCAR, so this not any kind of prediction but it's not which is surprising you to know that it's unlikely that we will pay out 100% of our earnings in CCAR going forward. So we are on a path to continue to accrete capital that we would like to move up in our payout range. So given that we're still moving towards our 12% target and we will update you if any of that changes at Investor Day. We also, as you know, potentially going to understand whether or not the Fed changes any of the CCAR parameters and whether that has an impact. So at the moment, the best we know is that we can continue to accrete capital, albeit more slowly as we hope to move out in the payout range but we haven't done CCAR yet. And that set the rules, go change, so 12% is for now."

I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. Starting on Page 1. The fi",2821,"Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $5.4 billion, EPS of $1.32 and a return on tangible common equity of 11% on $23.7 billion of revenue. Included in the results is legal expense of $400 million after tax for a range of matters, and we continue to put some issues behind us. This is reflected in a reduction of more than $1 billion to our reasonably possible loss estimate this quarter.
In addition, we recognized the benefit of a settlement reached of $300 million after tax, which related to monies owed to Washington Mutual in connection with a failed savings and loan institution. We're showing this on the page as legal-related and the benefit is recorded in revenue in corporate.
Much like we saw in the third quarter, the overall company's performance benefited from diversification across our businesses. We saw strong growth in consumer drivers, on the back of improvement in the U.S. economy, in large part generating core loan growth of 16% for the company. Global markets remained challenged across a number of fronts, leading to lower client activity and lower inventory. Against this backdrop, the CIB delivered solid performance across products. And in the quarter, we continued our trend of strong balance sheet, capital and expense discipline and exceeded targets.
Shifting to the full year's results, if you skip over Page 2, on Page 3. The firm earned record net income of $24.4 billion and record EPS of $6 a share and a return on tangible common equity of 13.5% on revenue of nearly $97 billion. Revenue was down 1% or $1.3 billion, driven by noncore items, most notably by business simplification in the investment bank and also in private equity. Adjusted, our underlying businesses were up modestly. We're very happy with our expense story for the year. We delivered adjusted expense of $56 billion, down $2.4 billion and a 2 percentage point decrease in adjusted overhead ratio. And while we did have a modest benefit from the strengthening dollar this year, we also self-funded incremental investments. Credit performance was strong, in line with our expectations, with net charge-offs at $4.1 billion, with obviously the biggest area of stress in wholesale being oil and gas, against which we built about $550 million of reserves this year, including $124 million this quarter. And as the outlook for oil has weakened, we would expect to see some additional reserve build in 2016 but prices would need to remain at this level for an extended period for them to be significant.
We also built $68 million of reserves in metals and mining, including $35 million this quarter. We're watching this sector closely and similarly, as commodity prices remain at current levels, we would expect some additional reserve builds but would not expect them to be significant. Finally, net capital distributions for the year were approximately $11 billion, including dividends of $1.72 a share. 
Turning to Page 4. Starting on the top left, overall, our average balance sheet is down $100 billion year-on-year and our spot balance sheet down over $200 billion, with, of course, the biggest driver being a reduction of approximately $200 billion of wholesale nonoperating deposits, ultimately reflected in lower cash balances. In addition, you can see notable reductions in all other balance sheet categories, except for loans, which reflects the 16% core loan growth we achieved. Some portion of the other wholesale balance reductions were purposeful and will be sticky, particularly the decrease in short-term wholesale funding balances. The remainder resulted from volatile markets and general deleveraging, driving risk off and lower inventory across products. As client demand for leverage grows, we will likely put some of that balance sheet back to work.
Moving to the right. The story on deposits continues to be a very positive one, as we delivered some incremental reductions of nonoperating balance while consistently growing retail and operating deposits. On the bottom left, overall, NII was up about $300 million, driving a 7 basis point improvement in NIM. The increase in NII reflects a mix shift to loans but also includes gains on certain securities and the impact of the rate move in December on this quarter's NII was not significant.
Looking forward to the first quarter. Expect firm NII and NIM to be flat to up slightly, on higher rates and mix, substantially offset by the absence of those security gains as well as normal seasonal day count. However, for the full year, with the December rate hike alone, so in a rate flat scenario, together with the loan growth that we have seen and expect, we would expect to deliver about $2 billion of incremental NII.
Perhaps the highlight of this page on the bottom right is that based upon the actions we've taken throughout the course of 2015, we believe that we have just reached the 3.5% Method 2 G-SIB bucket and that we are in or close to the 2% Method 1 G-SIB bucket. So the task ahead is to solidify this position, which we'll talk more about at Investor Day.
Turning to Page 5. We're ending the year well ahead of our capital targets, with the firm's Advanced Fully Phased-In CET1 ratio at 11.6% and our Standardized Fully Phased-In ratio at 11.7%. The improvement to both ratios was driven by net capital generation, along with an overall reduction in risk-weighted assets, with net loan growth being more than offset by lower market risk, reductions in derivatives as well as secured financing balances. And these delivered a more meaningful reduction under the standardized approach. But with reference to my earlier comments on redeploying balance sheet, a portion of this reduction will likely reverse in the near future.
Firm and bank SLR were at 6.5% and 6.6%, respectively. Finally, we returned $2.6 billion of net capital to shareholders this quarter, including $1 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.44 a share.
Let's turn to Page 6 and Consumer & Community Banking. The combined consumer businesses generated $2.4 billion of net income on revenue of $11.2 billion and an ROE of 18% for the quarter. And full year expense was down by nearly $1 billion or half of our commitment if you adjust for legal and $150 million of incremental investments this year. Going forward, we'll look for opportunities to further reinvest. You can see headcount was down by 12,000 for the year and nearly 43,000 since 2012.
The fundamental business drivers remain strong. Year-over-year, average loans were up 11%, with core loans up 25% driven by mortgage, but with strength across products. Average deposits were up 10%. We added nearly 600,000 households and our active mobile customer base continues to grow, up 20% to roughly 23 million customers, the largest of the major U.S. banks.
Moving to Page 7, Consumer & Business Banking. CBB generated strong results for the quarter, with net income of $968 million and an ROE of 32%, on relatively flat revenue of $4.6 billion. Although NII was flat quarter-on-quarter, it was down 5% year-on-year on spread compression, largely offset by that 10% deposit growth. And excluding an $85 million gain on the sale of a branch, noninterest revenue was down 3% seasonally and up 4% year-on-year, driven by higher service fees and strong debit volume. We expect NII to show normal seasonal declines in the first quarter. Expense was down 3% year-on-year on lower headcount from branch efficiency. And additionally, client assets were up 2% and Business Banking average loan balance is up 6%.
Next, Mortgage Banking on Page 8. Overall net income was $266 million. Originations in the quarter were $23 billion, down seasonally and we continue to add high-quality loans to our balance sheet; $16 billion for the quarter and totaling $70 billion for the full year. Total revenue of $1.7 billion increased 8% sequentially, on strong loan growth as well as on higher MSR risk management. For the full year, our loan interest revenue was down relative to 2014 by $1.2 billion, broadly in line with our guidance and that downward trend will continue as servicing balances continue to decline, and as we expect production margins will compress in the smaller markets. We expect the decline in 2016 to be around $700 million.
Expense of $1.2 billion ticked up this quarter, related to exiting the OCC's consent order, but it was down 10% year-on-year as we continue to manage costs. Finally, on credit. Net charge-offs of 13 basis points reflects the quality of our portfolio.
Moving on to Page 9, Card, Commercial Solutions & Auto. Overall net income of $1.2 billion and an ROE of 24%. Revenue was $5 billion, up 10% year-on-year, driven principally by 2 nonrecurring items. The first was a loss in the prior year of over $200 million that related to noncore portfolio exits and a gain we saw this quarter of about $160 million on the IPO of Square. Adjusted, the revenue rate was 11.9% and in terms of core performance, business drivers were strong and growth offset the impact of co-brand renewals on noninterest revenues while driving growth in NII. Year-over-year, we saw growth of 12% in auto, loan and lease balances; 6% in cars sales volume; 3% in cars core loans as well as 12% and 14% in merchant processing volumes and transactions, respectively. Expense of $2.2 billion, flat quarter-on-quarter but up 4% year-on-year, reflected higher depreciation on auto lease growth. And we expect expense to be relatively flat into the first quarter as we continue to invest.
While on auto, 2015 set a record for new car sales, with strength in the fourth quarter continuing through December, when we gained nearly 40 basis points a share year-over-year, with the strength of our manufacturing partnerships driving growth. Finally on Credit, in auto, net charge-offs were 50 basis points and while higher, it was still below our long-term expectations. And in Card, the net charge-off rate was 242 basis points for the quarter, 251 for the year, and given our underwriting discipline, client selection and the improving economy, we expect net charge-offs to stay at these levels in 2016.
Now turning to Page 10 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $1.7 billion on revenue of $7.1 billion and an ROE of 10%. In investment banking for the full year, we continue to rank #1 in global IDCs and #1 in North America and EMEA. In M&A, we maintained our #2 ranking and grew wallet share by 50 basis points. In ECM, we ranked #1 globally, up from #3 last year; and in DCM, we ranked #1 across high yield, high grades and loans.
Banking revenue for the quarter of $1.5 billion was down 11%, driven by lower debt underwriting fees. It was another outstanding performance in advisory fees, up 43% in the corporate third quarter in a market that was down 12%, largely driven by North America. Equity underwriting fees were down 4% in the market down 12%, with the U.S. remaining somewhat slow but a resurgence of large transactions in Europe and Asia, and debt underwriting fees were down 43% from a record last year where we saw an unprecedented number of large fee events.
Treasury Services revenue was flat quarter-on-quarter but down 4% year-on-year on lower deposit spreads. In markets, a number of factors contributed to a quiet fourth quarter overall across products. Investor risk appetite was significantly dampened by a series of market events and clients retrenched and de-risked early. With that backdrop, the market businesses delivered $3.6 billion in revenue, in line with our expectations and normal seasonal trends, with adjusted revenues down 16% sequentially and 1% year-on-year. In fixed income, rate markets were up, given U.S. and ECB monetary policy actions, offset by year-on-year declines in currencies and emerging markets as the strong dollar and emerging markets uncertainties persisted, as well as the commodities on reduced hedging and declines in credit, on all those themes plus a number of single name corporate events. Equities delivered solid results, flat excluding the exit of broker-dealer services last year, with strong performance in Europe being offset by lower deal flow in North America and Asia compared to a strong prior year.
With respect to the first quarter, reflecting low levels of client activity, we were light risk going into the year end and inventory was low. And so far, our trading businesses are performing well. But as you know, it is early and it's difficult to predict how the quarter will play out. Security Services revenue was $933 million, in line with guidance given the continued impact of lower emerging markets on asset-based fees. For the first quarter, expect revenue to be approximately $900 million, which includes seasonality. On credit, we saw a reserve build of $76 million, which included $63 million related to oil and gas. Finally, expense of $4.4 billion was down 20% year-on-year, mainly driven by lower legal. The comp-to-revenue ratio was 26% for the quarter and 30% for the full year.
Moving on to page 11 and the Commercial Bank. The Commercial Bank generated net income of $550 million on revenue of $1.8 billion and an ROE of 15%. Revenue was up sequentially, but relatively flat year-on-year, with NII up 3% on higher loan balances despite spread compression offset by lower IB revenue from a strong quarter last year. However, for the full year, it was a record for investment banking, with gross revenue of $2.2 billion, up 10% from 2014. Expense of $750 million included $50 million of impairments on leased corporate aircraft, on the reassessment of residual values. The remaining balance sheet value of this portfolio is modest. We saw record average loan balances of $166 billion, up 14% year-on-year, with growth in Commercial Real Estate of 17% exceeding the industry as we continue to invest in its business and gain share. And C&I, loans were up 11%, largely driven by Corporate Client Banking on the back of several large transactions.
Finally, credit performance of the portfolio does remain strong with only 4 basis points of net charge-offs. However, we did add $100 million to reserves, $60 million of which relates to oil and gas and $26 million for metals and mining.
Moving on to Page 12, Asset Management. Asset Management reported net income of $500 million, with a 27% pretax margin and 21% ROE, on revenue of $3 billion, down 5% year-on-year, driven by lower performance fees in alternatives. Expense of $2.2 billion was also down 5% year-on-year, roughly equally explained by lower performance fee-driven compensation as well as a benefit from refining the value of a health scale asset. Assets under management of $1.7 trillion and client assets of $2.4 trillion were down 1% and 2% year-over-year, respectively. We saw mixed flows in the fourth quarter resulting in long-term net outflows of $9 billion, with solid inflows in Equity being more than offset by weakness in Fixed Income and the loss of select mandates. However, we had strong long-term investment performance, with 80% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over 5 years, which should be supportive of future flow. And for the full year, we had positive long term inflows of $16 billion. In Lending, we had record balances $110 billion, up 7% year-on-year, driven by both mortgage as well as traditional loans.
Turning to page 13 and Corporate. Treasury & CIO reported net income of $138 million for the quarter. Included in this result, there's a pretax benefit of $178 million relating to certain securities held at a discount that were called at par and this was in our NII. Other Corporate net income of $84 million included a net benefit of $60 million after tax for the legal related matters we discussed earlier, as well as a contribution to our foundation this quarter of $150 million pretax.
Turning to page 14. I've given you some guidance throughout the presentation and this page is for your reference. Obviously, when we get to Investor Day, we will give you a comprehensive outlook for each of our businesses for the year. So in summary, a solid quarter and a record for the full year, both in terms of net income and EPS, which even on higher capital, translates to a good return on tangible common equity of 13.5%. We exceeded our targets on expense management, generating positive operating leverage and improving our adjusted overhead ratio by 2 percentage points. Another strong core loan growth of 16%, materially changed the mix of our deposit base, including growing retail deposits at 10% and made meaningful progress on our balance sheet, our [indiscernible] surcharge and capital levels. With that, operator, we'll take Q&A."

So the way we do our results, this is just for context, I think it's important -- it's obviously, the oil price outlook is important and instructive and it's very clearly going to drive how we think about probabilities of default and loss, given default of certain of our customers, but I think it's also the case just for context to know that it is very name-by-name specific and specific conditions at clients matter greatly. And so when we do these estimates, they are directionally correct and order of magnitude correct. But that's just the context. Oil, we said last quarter, if oil reached $30 a barrel and here we are, and stayed there for call it, 18 months, you could expect to see reserve builds of up to $750 million and that assessment hasn't fundamentally changed. So it is not the current market expectation that oil will flat line. It is -- the expectation right now that there will be a modest recovery. Based upon that, we would expect to take some additional reserves but for them to be more modest, less significant, but that's kind of the range. If oil's at $30 and stays here for a long time, up to $750 million."

You reduced the lines of credit. You got ahead of that early. In 2007, you weren't exactly at the start but then you adjusted and you said, ""Hey, this is a big issue."" And now we have oil and gas, which could be another industry-specific stress and you're only taking additional provisions of $124 million. Is that going to be enough?

You don't see that 100% translate into the results partly because of legal expense, which is not something that we particularly can predict and hopefully won't be there forever. Also because we intentionally decisioned in 2015, in the fourth quarter in particular, momentaly to increase our investments in the Consumer businesses by $150 million. So we've achieved the $1 billion. We chose to reinvest a portion of it. Another $1 billion, we're on track for.

At that point, it becomes increasingly compelling to want to look at the margin or what you could do to get within the bucket and so that is what we did in the fourth quarter is spent time really focusing on getting to that achievable boundary, which we thought at that point it was. And remember, it's not -- nothing in the year that we started the year thinking we would exit $100 billion of nonoperating deposit and while that's still there could be some volatility in that number, of course. We've almost doubled that or doubled that, in fact. So we got some wind to our backs in doing it. It's also the case that when you get the entire business and company attuned to the sense of urgency and desire to want to be increasingly efficient in this way, that, at the margin in our 100 different things, little benefit the crew. So the correct, about 3.5 -- it were just inside 3.5% bucket as best we estimated. It's not as much important whether we're basis points or surcharge points below or above. It's much more what we do now to get safely in the bucket and that's going to still take work. So that's why, we'll obviously talk to you more about this at Investor Day. In terms of the give up from an economic perspective, we wouldn't have done it at any cost. We have done it because we think it is important to do, because we think it's going to be constructive for the company and because the revenue give ups were not significant, but they weren't zero either. But to be able to reduce a constraint that it is in one way or another likely to bind us, or in multiple ways, in fact, likely to bind us, it was a I think a very good trade."

So -- I would say that based upon sort of fourth quarter balance sheet, given that market risk was a driver, given that balance sheet levels were a driver particularly on standardized. We could give back on standardized as much as 10, 20 bps of capital -- of the 10.7% capital accretion. But the bigger point on the RWA outlook is that we expect to be bound over the medium term by standardized, and standardized is going to always have a mutual to upwards pressure as we continue to grow these high-quality loans. So even though the RWA, being at the 1.5-ish trillion dollars sooner than we expected is obviously good news, regardless of how much of that may in the short term revert. Our job is going to be to continue to become more efficient to try and keep it there, just given the natural upward pressure of the standardized calculations. We can become more efficient in advance but we're unlikely to be bound by it in the medium term. So that's what we're focused on. I wouldn't take one, the -- $1.5 trillion and read through that will be continuing to decline from here on standardized.

So in terms of how we think about buffers, just really conceptually, the firm manages and the Board have set for the firm a risk appetite. That risk appetite has a number of features and capital depreciation -- depletion in a stress environment is one of them. And so when we think about setting buffers, we think about it just broadly in the context of allowing ourselves enough room to absorb losses that are within our risk appetite and not have to take premature actions from a capital perspective. So -- but having said that, our buffer has been pretty consistent at the 50 basis point level for a reasonable period of time, and we'll update you on all of that at Investor Day. With respect to our target, it's a little bit more complicated than minimum regulatory capital because as you say, we're bound potentially by multiple constraints and one of them maybe CCAR, plus -- well it is CCAR, I should say. Because as you know, the first 2 quarters of this year, our capital distribution plans have already been approved. And we haven't done CCAR, so this not any kind of prediction but it's not going to surprise you to know that it's unlikely that we will pay out 100% of our earnings in CCAR going forward. So we are on a path to continue to accrete capital, though we would like to move up in our payout range. So given that, we're still moving towards our 12% target and we will update you if any of that changes at Investor Day. We also, as you know, potentially going to understand whether or not the Fed changes any of the CCAR parameters and whether that has an impact. So at the moment, the best we know is that we can continue to accrete capital, albeit more slowly as we hope to move up in the payout range but we haven't done CCAR yet. And that's if the rules don't change, so 12% it is for now."

But the reality, if you ask my opinion given that we're going to be reporting quarterly going forward and because of the likelihood that GSIB may or may not feature into CCAR, I think it's going to be less important necessarily what you are at any moment in time. But the way you're projecting to be, or stay. So I suspect that we will get the benefit potentially of this. Not today, we have just closed our balance sheet. But I think that it's going to need to be a little bit more dynamic going forward as it gets potentially into introducing a stress test. But I don't know that."

Starting on Page 1. Firm reported net income of $5.5 billion, EPS of $1.35 and return on tangible common equity of 12% on $24 billion of revenue. And despite the general market backdrop in energy, our results this quarter were quite good and pretty straightforward. 
[indiscernible] remain on solid footing, leading robust growth in business drivers and strong financial performance. In consumer, we saw double-digit growth in deposits year-on-year, healthy loan growth across products, driving 17% [ph] core loan growth at the firm and high single digits for sales volume. The wholesale businesses performed in line or better than expectations as set on Investor Day and delivered decent financial results in challenging markets, significant volatility and global macro uncertainty. 
The firm's result included one significant item, $773 million of wholesale credit loss, of which $529 million related to oil and gas reserves, and $162 million related to Metals & Mining reserve. We're generally in line with our guidance. We also experienced some charge-offs this quarter in these sectors totaling $48 million, which were already contemplated in the Investor Day guidance [indiscernible] $4.75 billion [ph] at [indiscernible] this year. 
While oil prices have increased somewhat [indiscernible] we do remain near historically low levels and [indiscernible] we don't expect the recoveries to be strong. Further, natural gas, which is a meaningful cost of our portfolio does remain [indiscernible] We don't feel the current prices are positioned to spur meaningful restarted production, and many of the cost reductions and conservation actions that have been taken are not easily and quickly reversed. Therefore, the impact of oil prices is somewhat asymmetric on credit costs. Reserves are named specific, based on downgrades reflecting the actual financial conditions and liquidity position of borrowers. As such, we likely will see some incremental reserve builds for the rest of the year, but they will be increasingly situation-specific and our ability to estimate them will improve over time. However, using reasonable stress assumptions on draws, downgrades and considering spillover effects to [indiscernible] closely related companies, those incremental reserves could reach $500 million, plus or minus, this year, but with a very high degree of variability around that number. We continue to believe overall our client base is relatively well positioned to weather this downturn, and we will be there to support them whenever feasible. 
We also monitor the contagion. And aside from experiencing a couple of name-specific issues on very closely related companies and observing some general stress and oil regions, we're not seeing anything broad-based and would not expect losses to be significant. 
Moving on to Page 2. Pausing on this page for just a moment, a few comments on overall revenue and expense. We told you that the first rate hike, together with our strong loan growth, would drive 2016 NII higher by $2 billion, and the $700 million increase in net interest income year-over-year that you see here is in line with that. However, sequentially, NII was only up slightly as expected given the absence of certain securities gains that we had in the fourth quarter as well as day count. 
Noninterest revenue was down $1.5 billion year-on-year, primarily driven by the market environments in both the Corporate & Investment Bank as well as asset management, with the biggest drivers being lower IBCs and Fixed Income Markets revenues, in both case, versus a very strong prior year. 
Adjusted expense of $13.9 billion was down 2% year-on-year on lower performance-based compensation while continuing to self-fund incremental investment in growth. 
Turning to Page 3. The firm's fully phased-in advance CET1 ratio was 11.7%, standardized at 11.9%. The improvement to both ratios was driven primarily by net capital generation. Recall that we ended the year with very low levels of inventory. And as expected, we did see that reverse with our spot balance sheet up $70 billion quarter-on-quarter, reflecting growth in deposits and an increase in trading assets and secured financing activity. This also drove a slight increase in RWA, [indiscernible] runoff and model calibration. Firm SLR improve to 6.6%, and we returned $3 billion of net capital to shareholders this quarter, including $1.3 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.44 a share. Lastly, the Fed did not object to a $1.9 billion increase in our capital plan, giving incremental capacity for repurchases next quarter. 
Moving on to Page 4 in Consumer & Community Banking. You'll notice that we consolidated consumer into one page. And for your reference, we've included the old pages in the appendix. CCB generated $2.5 billion [ph] of net income and an ROE of 19% with strength across all lines of business. And TNS just announced that for the fourth consecutive year, we are the #1 consumer retail bank, reflecting our ability to attract, satisfy and retain customers. The fundamental business drivers remained strong with average loans up 12% year-on-year and core loans up 25%, driven by mortgage and auto, but with strength across products. And we saw record deposit growth of $50 billion, [ph] up 10%. We added over 1 million household since last year, and are active mobile customer base was up 19%. Revenues of $11.1 billion was up 4% year-on-year and up 1% sequentially, if you exclude from last quarter nearly $200 million from the square IPO and a branch sale. In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 4% year-on-year, reflecting that record deposit growth I mentioned as well as higher account and transaction volume and investment revenue up 4% despite the challenging environment. Mortgage revenue increased 7% on higher MSR risk management and strong loan growth, partially offset by lower servicing revenue. Card solutions and auto, revenue was up 2% on strong auto loan and lease growth, 8% growth in card sales and 12% in merchant processing volumes, all of which more than offset the impact of card renegotiations. 
Expense was down 2% year-on-year with an overhead ratio improving to 55% as we continue to make progress against our commitments, more than offsetting $200 million in incremental marketing and auto lease growth. Finally, credit trends in the consumer businesses continue to be favorable. 
Now turning to Page 5 on the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2 billion on revenue of $8.1 billion and an ROE of 11%. In banking, IB revenue was $1.2 billion, down 24% year-on-year, driven by lower equity and debt underwriting fees, but in line with the market, which was down 27%. We continue to rank #1 in global IBCs and rank #1 in 3 regions: North America, EMEA and LatAm. 
It was another strong quarter for advisory, up 8%, versus [indiscernible] decline of 15%. We gained share, ranking #1 as we benefited from a number of deals that were announced in 2015 and closed this quarter. 
Equity underwriting fees were down 49%, in line with the market as volatility kept issuers on the sideline. We maintained our #1 rank globally and increased our lead. Debt underwriting fees were down 35%. And while we were down more than the market, it can be explained by a tough comparison with several large acquisition finance deals in the first quarter of last year as well as being conflicted out of several large deals this quarter. 
In terms of the outlook, we expect a sequential decline in M&A to be more than offset by an increase in debt and equity underwriting, if the recent market improvements continue. 
Treasury Services revenue was down 5%, driven by business simplification. Lending revenue was down 31%, primarily reflecting mark-to-market changes on both hedges of accrual loans and securities received from restructurings. 
Moving on the market. Markets revenue was $5.2 billion and was down 11% year-on-year, reflecting decent performance given the environment and especially in light of the strength in the third quarter of 2015 where we saw elevated client wallet and trading, particularly in January last year, particularly around the Swiss francs event. In fact, if you indulge me, adjusting for our outperformance year-over-year, results would have been down by mid-single-digits. 
Fixed-income revenue was down 13%. The first couple of months of this quarter, as you know, were challenging across markets, but some stability returned in March. And overall, I would characterize the quarter as seeing reasonably solid client activity. But given the market backdrop, it was more difficult to monetize loans. We saw better performance in rates and lower performance across other asset classes. 
Equity Markets revenue was down 5%. And although flows were steady, idiosyncratic events and sharp moves returned for our clients. Those on the way down and back up. Asian equities continued to outperform driven by market volatility, particularly in Japan. 
With respect to the second quarter, the relative stability we saw in March has continued into April so far. However, it's also the case that markets are still quite illiquid in certain parts and will be prone to somewhat on that direction. So while investors have started to deploy cash and capital markets are wide open for well-understood names, they still remain in caution for more challenging issuers. Although there's been noise in the data globally, there is an emerging belief that it's fundamentally better but we need to continue to see no downplay surprises. And as such, we remain somewhat cautious about the second quarter. 
Securities Services revenues was $881 million in line with guidance. Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $336 million, mainly driven by CVA on spread widening. Credit costs of $459 million were driven by reserve builds for oil and gas and Metals & Mining, as discussed earlier. And finally, expense of $4.8 billion was down 15% year-on-year driven by lower performance-based compensation and lower legal expense, with a [indiscernible] ratio for the quarter of 32%. 
Moving on to Page 6 on Commercial Banking. The Commercial Bank generated net income of $500 million on revenue of $1.8 billion and and ROE of 11%. Outside of credit cost for Oil & Gas, the first quarter was very solid performance. Revenue was up 4% year-on-year driven by higher loan balances and deposits, net interest income offset by lower IBC -- IB revenues versus the record last year. Expense of $713 million was up 1% year-on-year and down 5% quarter-on-quarter, but in line with recent trends, if you exclude the impairment taken on leased corporate aircraft last quarter. We saw strong growth in our loan book with average loan balances up 13% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter and with portfolios spreads relatively flat for a couple of quarters now. 
Our commercial real estate business continued to exceed the industry with growth of 18% year-on-year, reflecting superior execution while maintaining credit discipline. In C&I, loans were up 9% year-on-year driven by robust originations in Corporate Client Banking. Finally, on credit, we added $300 million to reserves, mostly related to oil and gas, but we continue to see very low net charge-offs. 
Moving on to Page 7 in asset management. Asset Management reported net income of $587 million with a 30% pretax margin and 25% ROE. Revenue of $3 billion was down 1% year-on-year driven by weaker market and lower brokerage revenues. Excluding the impact of the sale of an asset this quarter, which contributed $150 million to the revenue number, adjusted revenue, AUM and client assets were down each, generally line with our market. Expense of $2.1 billion was down 5% year-on-year, largely driven by lower performance-based compensation. Despite these lower markets, we saw positive long-term flows of $12 billion this quarter with strength in fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives and including the benefit of a large mandate, being partially offset by outflows in equity products given volatility. Our long-term investment performance remains strong with 80% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over 5 years. 
Loan balances of $110 billion were up 7% year-on-year with record mortgage balances up 20% and solid growth in traditional lending. 
Before I move on, as you're aware, the Department of Labor issued the final fiduciary [indiscernible] It's a long and complex set of requirements and details will matter. It will take time to fully digest. On first read, there are no significant new provisions from the proposal that would change our position, which means that we've been a fiduciary for over 150 years. And based on our current advisory business, we're confident in our ability to adjust and be successful. And that's one of the biggest positives is the longer time to implement, which allows us to be even better prepared. 
Skipping Page 8, as we actually have nothing significant to call out on corporate, I will move on to the outlook on Page 9. We've included our guidance from Investor Day on the page, and it's unchanged, so I won't go through it. But just 2 new points to highlight. For asset management, the first quarter revenues adjusted for the $150 million were a little over $2.8 billion. And assuming relatively constructive markets, we would expect those revenues in the second quarter to be flat to up, but to be less than $3 billion. And obviously, expense will also be flat to up, in line with those revenues, on performance-based compensation. 
In the Commercial Bank, we expect revenues will be up modestly on continued loan growth, but we also expect expenses to increase to about $725 million as we add bankers and execute on our technology and product investment strategies. The upshot of which is we expect provision net revenue for the Commercial Bank to be relatively in line with first quarter. 
Before moving to Q&A, I want to make a few comments about the news this morning regarding living wills. Obviously, we were disappointed with the conclusion reached by the joint agencies on our resolution plan. We have taken this planning process very seriously, and we believe we made substantial progress. Having said that, the most important thing is we worked with our regulators to understand their feedback fully and in more detail, and we are fully committed to meeting the expectations. 
So wrapping up, despite challenging market conditions, we delivered really quite good performance in the quarter, with diversification allowing us to perform well in difficult environments and be there for our clients. 
Operator, you can open up to Q&A."

Well, you're seeing it a little bit higher, it was on Metals & Mining's. We were expecting close to 100. And there were a couple of extra downgrades that came during the quarter. And that kind of timing is going to happen. It doesn't change the overall -- the perspective for us. With respect to the draws, when we -- when I gave sort of indicative guidance about what you might expect to see potentially in the rest of the year in terms of reserve builds, we do try to take into consideration the likelihood that we will see incremental draws. And clearly, we will work with borrowers to try and help them such that that may not be necessary. And in other cases, we can reduce our exposure in redetermination cases, but we will expect to see some draws. And that's contemplated in our guidance. So I want to make sure that everyone understood that we tried to be very complete. So this is not just Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining as [indiscernible] would suggest. We've looked at very closely related companies in shipping and marine transportation and the like. So we're trying to be very complete."

It is absolutely the case that as you look at the resolution process that there are provisions that talk about if remediation is not satisfactory with or cured within a 2-year period, there are -- there's a possibility the regulators could jointly decide or may jointly decide to take other actions that could increase capital or liquidity or leverage or operating model discussion. So obviously, they do have those powers. It -- October is not that far away. We're going to do our very, very best to make sure that we put our best foot forward and remediate issues and then we have another submission in July 2017. So not to suggest that we won't fully remediate to the very best of our ability, but the living will process expect to continue to be somewhat iterative of the next several cycles. And we will continue to push our best to raise the bar, and I'm certain the bar will continue to be raised on us, as it should."

And indeed, we don't see any uptick in revenues and they remain reasonably flat?"

Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. 
Starting on Page 1. Firm reported net income of $5.5 billion, EPS of $1.35 and a return on tangible common equity of 12% on $24 billion of revenue. And despite the general market backdrop and energy, our results this quarter were quite good and pretty straightforward. 
Consumers remained on solid footing, leading robust growth in business drivers and strong financial performance. In consumer, we saw double-digit growth in deposits year-on-year, healthy loan growth across products, driving 17% core loan growth of the firm and high single digits for our sales volume. The wholesale businesses performed in line or better than expectations as I stressed out on Investor Day and delivered decent financial results in challenging markets, significant volatility and global macro uncertainty. 
The firm's result included one significant item, $773 million of wholesale credit costs, of which $529 million related to Oil & Gas reserves, and $162 million related to Metals & Mining reserves, which were generally in line with our guidance. But we also experienced some charge-offs this quarter in these sectors, totaling $48 million, which were already contemplated in the Investor Day guidance of up to $4.75 billion in charge-offs this year. 
While oil prices have increased somewhat in March, they do remain near historically low levels and the market is not expecting the recovery to be strong. Further, natural gas, which is a meaningful portion of our portfolio does remain in track. We don't feel that current prices are positioned to spur meaningful restarted production, and many of the cost reduction and conservation actions that have been taken are not easily and quickly reversed. Therefore, the impact of oil prices is somewhat asymmetric on credit costs. Reserves are named specific. They're based on downgrades, reflecting the actual financial condition and liquidity position of borrowers. As such, we likely will see some incremental reserve builds for the rest of the year, but they will be increasingly situation-specific and our ability to estimate them will improve over time. However, using reasonable stress assumptions on draws, downgrades and considering spillover effects to closely-related companies, those incremental reserves could reach $500 million, plus or minus, this year, but with a very high degree of variability around that number. We continue to believe overall our client base is relatively well positioned to weather this downturn, and we will be there to support them whenever feasible. 
We also monitor the contagion. And aside from experiencing a couple of name-specific issues in very closely-related companies and observing some general stress in oil regions, we are not seeing anything broad-based and would not expect losses to be significant. 
Moving on to Page 2. Pausing on this page for just a moment, a few comments on overall revenue and expense. We told you that the first rate hike, together with our strong loan growth, would drive 2016 NII higher by $2 billion, and the $700 million increase in net interest income year-over-year that you see here is in line with that. However, sequentially, NII was only up slightly as expected given the absence of certain securities gains that we had in the fourth quarter as well as day count. 
Noninterest revenue was down $1.5 billion year-on-year, primarily driven by the market environments in both the Corporate & Investment Bank as well as asset management, with the biggest drivers being lower IBCs and Fixed Income Markets revenue, in both case, versus a very strong prior year. 
Adjusted expense of $13.9 billion was down 2% year-on-year on lower performance-based compensation, while continuing to self-fund incremental investments and growth. 
Turning to Page 3. The firm's Fully Phased-In Advanced CET1 ratio was 11.7%, standardized at 11.9%. The improvement to both ratios was driven primarily by net capital generation. Recall that we ended the year with very low levels of inventory. And as expected, we did see that reverse, with our spot balance sheet up $70 billion quarter-on-quarter, reflecting growth in deposits and an increase in trading assets and secured financing activity. This also drove a slight increase in RWA, net of runoff and model calibration. Firm SLR improved to 6.6%, and we returned $3 billion of net capital to shareholders this quarter, including $1.3 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.44 a share. Lastly, the Fed did not object to a $1.9 billion increase in our capital plan, giving incremental capacity for repurchases next quarter. 
Moving on to Page 4 in Consumer & Community Banking. You'll notice that we consolidated consumer into one page. And for your reference, we've included the old pages in the appendix. CCB generated $2.5 billion of net income and an ROE of 19% with strengths across all lines of business. And TNS just announced that for the fourth consecutive year, we are the #1 consumer retail bank, reflecting our ability to attract, satisfy and retain customers. The fundamental business drivers remained strong, with average loans up 12% year-on-year and core loans up 25%, driven by mortgage and auto, but with strengths across products. And we saw record deposit growth of $50 billion, up 10%. We added over 1 million household since last year, and our active mobile customer base was up 19%. Revenues of $11.1 billion was up 4% year-on-year and up 1% sequentially, if you exclude from last quarter nearly $200 million from the Square IPO and a branch sale. In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 4% year-on-year, reflecting that record deposit growth I mentioned as well as higher account and transaction volumes and investment revenue up 4% despite the challenging environment. Mortgage revenue increased 7% on higher MSR risk management and strong loan growth, partially offset by lower servicing revenue. Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto, revenue was up 2% on strong auto loan and lease growth, 8% growth in card sales and 12% in merchant processing volumes, all of which more than offset the impact of card renegotiations. 
Expense was down 2% year-on-year, with an overhead ratio improving to 55% as we continue to make progress against our commitments, more than offsetting $200 million in incremental marketing and auto lease growth. Finally, credit trends in the consumer businesses continue to be favorable. 
Now turning to Page 5 on the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2 billion, on revenue of $8.1 billion and an ROE of 11%. In banking, IB revenue was $1.2 billion, down 24% year-on-year, driven by lower equity and debt underwriting fees, but in line with the market, which was down 27%. We continue to rank #1 in global IBC fees and rank #1 in 3 regions: North America, EMEA and LatAm. 
It was another strong quarter for advisory, up 8%, versus our wallets that declined 15%. We gained share, ranking #1 as we benefited from a number of deals that were announced in 2015 and closed this quarter. 
Equity underwriting fees were down 49%, in line with the market as volatility kept issuers on the sidelines. We maintained our #1 rank globally and increased our lead. Debt underwriting fees were down 35%. And while we were down more than the market, it can be explained by a tough comparison, with several large acquisition finance deals in the first quarter of last year as well as being conflicted out of several large deals this quarter. 
In terms of the outlook, we expect a sequential decline in M&A to be more than offset by an increase in debt and equity underwriting, if the recent market improvements continue. 
Treasury Services revenue was down 5%, driven by business simplification. Lending revenue was down 31%, primarily reflecting mark-to-market changes on both hedges of accrual loans and securities received from restructurings. 
Moving on to market. The markets revenue was $5.2 billion and was down 11% year-on-year, reflecting decent performance given the environment and especially, in light of the strength in the third quarter of 2015 where we saw elevated client wallet and trading, particularly in January last year, particularly around the Swiss francs event. In fact, if you indulge me, adjusting for our outperformance year-over-year, results would have been down by mid-single digits. 
Fixed-income revenue was down 13%. The first couple of months of this quarter, as you know, were challenging across markets, but some stability returned in March. And overall, I would characterize the quarter as seeing reasonably solid client activity, but given the market backdrop, it was more difficult to monetize loans. We saw better performance in rates and lower performance across other asset classes. 
Equity Markets revenue was down 5%. And although flows were steady, idiosyncratic events and sharp moves were tough for our clients. Those on the way down and back up. Asian equities continued to outperform, driven by market volatility, particularly in Japan. 
With respect to the second quarter, the relative stability we saw in March has continued into April so far. However, it's also the case that markets are still quite illiquid in certain parts and will be prone to somewhat of that direction. So while investors have started to deploy cash and capital markets are wide open for well-understood names, they will still remain in caution for more challenging issuers. Although there's been noise in the data globally, there is an emerging belief that it's fundamentally better but we need to continue to see no downplay surprises. And as such, we've remained somewhat cautious about the second quarter. 
Securities Services revenues was $881 million, in line with guidance. Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $336 million, mainly driven by CVA on spread widening. Credit costs of $459 million were driven by reserve builds for Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining, as discussed earlier. And finally, expense of $4.8 billion was down 15% year-on-year, driven by lower performance-based compensation and lower legal expense, with a comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter of 32%. 
Moving on to Page 6 on Commercial Banking. The Commercial Bank generated net income of $500 million on revenue of $1.8 billion and an ROE of 11%. Outside of credit cost for Oil & Gas, the first quarter was very solid performance. Revenue was up 4% year-on-year driven by higher loan balances and deposits, net interest income, offset by lower IBC -- IB revenues versus the record last year. Expense of $713 million was up 1% year-on-year and down 5% quarter-on-quarter, but in line with recent trends, if you exclude the impairment taken on leased corporate aircraft last quarter. We saw strong growth in our loan book, with average loan balances up 13% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter with portfolio spreads relatively flat for a couple of quarters now. 
Our commercial real estate business continued to exceed the industry, with growth of 18% year-on-year, reflecting superior execution while maintaining credit discipline. In C&I, loans were up 9% year-on-year driven by robust originations in Corporate Client Banking. Finally, on credit, we added $300 million to reserves, mostly related to Oil & Gas, but we continue to see very low net charge-offs. 
Moving on to Page 7 in Asset Management. Asset Management reported net income of $587 million, with a 30% pretax margin and 25% ROE. Revenue of $3 billion was down 1% year-on-year driven by weaker market and lower brokerage revenues. Excluding the impact of the sale of an asset this quarter, which contributed $150 million to the revenue number, adjusted revenue, AUM and client assets were down each, generally in line with lower markets. Expense of $2.1 billion was down 5% year-on-year, largely driven by lower performance-based compensation. Despite these lower markets, we saw positive long-term flows of $12 billion this quarter, with strengths in fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives and including the benefit of a large mandate, being partially offset by outflows in equity products given volatility. Our long-term investment performance remains strong, with 80% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over 5 years. 
Loan balances of $110 billion were up 7% year-on-year, with record mortgage balances up 20% and solid growth in traditional lending. 
Before I move on, as you're aware, the Department of Labor issued the final fiduciary rule last week. It's a long and complex set of requirements and details will matter. It will take time to fully digest. On the first read, there were no significant new provisions from the proposal that would change our position, which is that we've been a fiduciary for over 150 years. And based on our current advisory business, we are confident in our ability to adjust and be successful. Perhaps one of the biggest positives is the longer time to implement, which allows us to be even better prepared. 
Skipping Page 8, as we actually have nothing significant to call out on corporate, I will move on to the outlook on Page 9. We've included our guidance from Investor Day on the page, and it's unchanged, so I won't go through it. So just 2 new points to highlight. For asset management, the first quarter revenues adjusted for the $150 million were a little over $2.8 billion. And assuming relatively constructive markets, we would expect those revenues in the second quarter to be flat to up, but to be less than $3 billion. And obviously, expense will also be flat to up, in line with those revenues, on performance-based compensation. 
In the Commercial Bank, we expect revenues will be up modestly on continued loan growth, but we also expect expenses to increase to about $725 million as we add bankers and execute on our technology and product investment strategies. The upshot of which is we expect preprovision net revenue for the Commercial Bank to be relatively in line with the first quarter. 
Before moving to Q&A, I want to make a few comments about the news this morning regarding living wills. Obviously, we were disappointed with the conclusion reached by the joint agencies on our resolution plan. We have taken this planning process very seriously, and we believe, we made substantial progress. Having said that, the most important thing is we worked with our regulators to understand their feedback fully and in more detail, and we are fully committed to meeting their expectations. 
So wrapping up, despite challenging market conditions, we delivered really quite good performance in the quarter, with diversification allowing us to perform well in difficult environments and be there for our clients. 
Operator, you can open up to Q&A."

You noted that the provision was slightly above your guidance in turn -- this quarter relative to what you mentioned you thought it might be in late February. I guess, I'm curious in terms of what your expectations are in terms of your guidance relative to potential drawdowns, particularly in the $10 billion of high-yield loans that you have undrawn, and what your ability is to potentially mitigate potential drawdowns based on the financial condition of your borrowers?"

Well, you're seeing it be a little bit higher, was on Metals & Mining's. We were expecting close to $100 million. And there were a couple of extra downgrades that came through in the quarter. And that kind of timing is going to happen. It doesn't change the overall -- the perspective for us. With respect to draws, when we -- when I gave some sort of indicative guidance about what you might expect to see potentially in the rest of the year in terms of reserve builds, we do try to take into consideration the likelihood that we will see incremental draws. And clearly, we will work with borrowers to try and help them such that that may not be necessary. And in other cases, we can reduce our exposure in redetermination cases, but we will expect to see some draws and that's contemplated in our guidance. So I want to make sure that everyone understood that we tried to be very complete. So this is not just Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining as the nature code would suggest. We've looked at very closely-related companies in shipping and marine transportation and the like. So we're trying to be very complete."

And obviously stability in the markets in March has continued to help us with that thesis. And so that, coupled with the fact that the Fed themselves both -- while they're dovish in their narratives in the minutes and also their dots are continuing to talk about gradual increases, and the debate around negative rates has kind of quietened, so we don't particularly run the company with a day-to-day beyond what's going to happen with interest rates. We are positioned for rising rates, as you know, and have been, but we also understand what the performance of the company looks like if there were no more rate rises or when we stress our portfolio in lots of different ways. So we are positioned for rising rates, it is our central case as that will happen. The market is pricing less than one hike in this year. The Fed does say 2. Our research says 2. We just don't have to wait and see. I'll also start and then Jamie can jump in on the living will thing. We have to take it a face value in discussions with our regulators, that we need to meet their requirements, whatever they may be, all of the rules, whether it's capital, whether it's liquidity, whether it's stress testing, whether it's resolution plans. And if we do that and satisfy them, then we can continue to operate the company the way that we think is best for our clients and communities around the world. And so at this point, we need to remediate and address the issues and the feedback they've given us, and resubmit the plan or assessments that we hope will be credible and that certainly what we will commit to do.

But on the positive side -- and on the positive side, Mortgage Banking, just given where rates were over the quarter has been positive, relative to the central expectations when we did Investor Day. So those 2 things are worth noting, but we are seeing really quite good drivers and noninterest revenue drivers across the consumer space generally, in debit investments, in fees and accounts, in the sort of 4%, 5% range and sometimes in the range higher than that. So we're continuing to see exactly what we expected, which is the majority of our businesses will continue to deliver mid- to high single-digit growth and make -- they seem set to do that. And the card impact will be what it will be and mortgage, NII will end up down year-over-year, whether its $700 million or $600 million, we'll see.

But one of the questions I perhaps just wanted to ask is an area that you've been pushing hard on is equity, cash equities, in particular. My sense is that actually, a lot of the players, including the Europeans who're doing massive restructuring are putting more capital into equities on the back of the fact that it's a lower-capital business. And therefore, they think they can get higher returns and just maybe that's why in the middle of the pool you added European equities yesterday.

Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. 
Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $5.5 billion, EPS of $1.35 and a return on tangible common equity of 12% on $24 billion of revenue. And despite the general market backdrop and energy, our results this quarter were quite good and pretty straightforward. 
Consumers remained on solid footing, leading to robust growth in business drivers and strong financial performance. In consumer, we saw double-digit growth in deposits year-on-year, healthy loan growth across products, driving 17% core loan growth for the firm and high single digits for our sales volumes. The wholesale businesses performed in line or better than expectations expressed at Investor Day and delivered decent financial results in challenging markets, with significant volatility and global macro uncertainty. 
The firm's results included one significant item, $773 million of wholesale credit costs, of which $529 million related to Oil & Gas reserves, and $162 million related to Metals & Mining reserves, which were generally in line with our guidance. But we also experienced some charge-offs this quarter in these sectors, totaling $48 million, which were already contemplated in the Investor Day guidance of up to $4.75 billion of charge-offs this year. 
While oil prices have improved somewhat in March, they do remain near historically low levels and the market is not expecting the recovery to be strong. Further, natural gas, which is a meaningful portion of our portfolio, does remain depressed. We don't feel that current prices are positioned to spur a meaningful restart to production, and many of the cost reduction and conservation actions that have been taken are not easily and quickly reversed. Therefore, the impact of oil prices is somewhat asymmetric on credit costs. Reserves are name specific. They're based on downgrades reflecting the actual financial condition and liquidity position of borrowers. As such, we likely will see some incremental reserve builds for the rest of the year, but they will be increasingly situation-specific and our ability to estimate them will improve over time. However, using reasonable stress assumptions on draws, downgrades and considering spillover effects to closely-related companies, those incremental reserves could reach $500 million, plus or minus, this year, but with a very high degree of variability around that number. We continue to believe overall our client base is relatively well positioned to weather this downturn, and we will be there to support them whenever feasible. 
We also monitor for contagion. And aside from experiencing a couple of name-specific issues in very closely-related companies and observing some general stress in oil regions, we are not seeing anything broad-based and would not expect losses to be significant. 
Moving on to Page 2. Pausing on this page for just a moment, a few comments on overall revenue and expense. We told you that the first rate hike, together with our strong loan growth, would drive 2016 NII higher by $2 billion, and the $700 million increase in net interest income year-over-year that you see here is in line with that. However, sequentially, NII was only up slightly as expected given the absence of certain securities gains that we had in the fourth quarter as well as day count. 
Noninterest revenue was down $1.5 billion year-on-year, primarily driven by the market environments in both the Corporate & Investment Bank as well as asset management, with the biggest drivers being lower IBCs and Fixed Income Markets revenue, in both case, versus a very strong prior year. 
Adjusted expense of $13.9 billion was down 2% year-on-year on lower performance-based compensation, while continuing to self-fund incremental investments and growth. 
Turning to Page 3. The firm's Fully Phased-In Advanced CET1 ratio was 11.7%, was standardized at 11.9%. The improvement to both ratios was driven primarily by net capital generation. Recall that we ended the year with very low levels of inventory. And as expected, we did see that reverse, with our spot balance sheet up $70 billion quarter-on-quarter, reflecting growth in deposits and an increase in trading assets and secured financing activity. This also drove a slight increase in RWA, net of runoff and model calibration. Firm SLR improved to 6.6%, and we returned $3 billion of net capital to shareholders this quarter, including $1.3 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.44 a share. Lastly, the Fed did not object to a $1.9 billion increase in our capital plan, giving incremental capacity for repurchases next quarter. 
Moving on to Page 4 in Consumer & Community Banking. You'll notice that we consolidated consumer into one page. And for your reference, we've included the old pages in the appendix. CCB generated $2.5 billion of net income and an ROE of 19% with strengths across all lines of business. And TNS just announced that for the fourth consecutive year, we are the #1 consumer retail bank, reflecting our ability to attract, satisfy and retain customers. The fundamental business drivers remained strong, with average loans up 12% year-on-year and core loans up 25%, driven by mortgage and auto, but with strengths across products. And we saw record deposit growth of $50 billion, up 10%. We added over 1 million households since last year, and our active mobile customer base was up 19%. Revenues of $11.1 billion was up 4% year-on-year and up 1% sequentially, if you exclude from last quarter nearly $200 million from the Square IPO and a branch sale. In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 4% year-on-year, reflecting that record deposit growth I mentioned as well as higher account and transaction volumes and investment revenue up 4% despite the challenging environment. Mortgage revenue increased 7% on higher MSR risk management and strong loan growth, partially offset by lower servicing revenue. Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto, revenue was up 2% on strong auto loan and lease growth, 8% growth in card sales and 12% in merchant processing volumes, all of which more than offset the impact of card renegotiations. 
Expense was down 2% year-on-year, with an overhead ratio improving to 55% as we continue to make progress against our commitments, more than offsetting $200 million in incremental marketing and auto lease growth. Finally, credit trends in the consumer businesses continue to be favorable. 
Now turning to Page 5 on the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2 billion, on revenue of $8.1 billion and an ROE of 11%. In banking, IB revenue was $1.2 billion, down 24% year-on-year, driven by lower equity and debt underwriting fees, but in line with the market, which was down 27%. We continue to rank #1 in global IB fees and rank #1 in 3 regions: North America, EMEA and LatAm. 
It was another strong quarter for advisory, up 8%, versus a wallet that declined 15%. We gained share, ranking #1 as we benefited from a number of deals that were announced in 2015 and closed this quarter. 
Equity underwriting fees were down 49%, in line with the market, as volatility kept issuers on the sidelines. We maintained our #1 rank globally and increased our lead. Debt underwriting fees were down 35%. And while we were down more than the market, it can be explained by a tough comparison, with several large acquisition finance deals in the first quarter of last year as well as being conflicted out of several large deals this quarter. 
In terms of the outlook, we expect a sequential decline in M&A to be more than offset by an increase in debt and equity underwriting, if the recent market improvements continue. 
Treasury Services revenue was down 5%, driven by business simplification. Lending revenue was down 31%, primarily reflecting mark-to-market changes on both hedges of accrual loans and securities received from restructurings. 
Moving on to market. The markets revenue was $5.2 billion and was down 11% year-on-year, reflecting decent performance given the environment and especially in light of the strength in the first quarter of 2015 where we saw elevated client wallet and trading, particularly in January last year, particularly around the Swiss franc event. In fact, if you indulge me, adjusting for our outperformance year-over-year, results would have been down by mid-single digits. 
Fixed-income revenue was down 13%. The first couple of months of this quarter, as you know, were challenging across markets, but some stability returned in March. And overall, I would characterize the quarter as seeing reasonably solid client activity, but given the market backdrop, it was more difficult to monetize flows. We saw better performance in rates and lower performance across other asset classes. 
Equity Markets revenue was down 5%. And although flows were steady, idiosyncratic events and sharp moves were tough for our clients. Those on the way down and back up. Asian equities continued to outperform, driven by market volatility, particularly in Japan. 
With respect to the second quarter, the relative stability we saw in March has continued into April so far. However, it's also the case that markets are still quite illiquid in certain parts and will be prone to somewhat abrupt corrections. So while investors have started to deploy cash and capital markets are wide open for well-understood names, there's still remaining caution for more challenging issuers. Although there's been noise in the data globally, there is an emerging belief that it's fundamentally better but we need to continue to see no downplay surprises. And as such, we've remained somewhat cautious about the second quarter. 
Securities Services revenues was $881 million, in line with guidance. Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $336 million, mainly driven by CVA on spread widening. Credit costs of $459 million were driven by reserve builds for Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining, as discussed earlier. And finally, expense of $4.8 billion was down 15% year-on-year, driven by lower performance-based compensation and lower legal expense, with a comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter of 32%. 
Moving on to Page 6 and Commercial Banking. The Commercial Bank generated net income of $500 million on revenue of $1.8 billion and an ROE of 11%. Outside of credit cost for Oil & Gas, the first quarter was very solid performance. Revenue was up 4% year-on-year driven by higher loan balances and deposits, net interest income, offset by lower IBC -- IB revenues versus the record last year. Expense of $713 million was up 1% year-on-year and down 5% quarter-on-quarter, but in line with recent trends, if you exclude the impairment taken on leased corporate aircraft last quarter. We saw strong growth in our loan book, with average loan balances up 13% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter and with portfolio spreads relatively flat for a couple of quarters now. 
Our commercial real estate business continued to exceed the industry, with growth of 18% year-on-year, reflecting superior execution while maintaining credit discipline. In C&I, loans were up 9% year-on-year driven by robust originations in Corporate Client Banking. Finally, on credit, we added $300 million to reserves, mostly related to Oil & Gas, but we continue to see very low net charge-offs. 
Moving on to Page 7 in Asset Management. Asset Management reported net income of $587 million, with a 30% pretax margin and 25% ROE. Revenue of $3 billion was down 1% year-on-year driven by weaker market and lower brokerage revenues. Excluding the impact of the sale of an asset this quarter, which contributed $150 million to the revenue number, adjusted revenue, AUM and client assets were down, each generally in line with lower markets. Expense of $2.1 billion was down 5% year-on-year, largely driven by lower performance-based compensation. Despite these lower markets, we saw positive long-term flows of $12 billion this quarter, with strengths in fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives and including the benefit of a large mandate, being partially offset by outflows in equity products given volatility. Our long-term investment performance remains strong, with 80% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over 5 years. 
Loan balances of $110 billion were up 7% year-on-year, with record mortgage balances up 20% and solid growth in traditional lending. 
Before I move on, as you're aware, the Department of Labor issued the final fiduciary rule last week. It's a long and complex set of requirements and details will matter. It will take time to fully digest. On first read, there are no significant new provisions from the proposal that would change our position, which is that we've been a fiduciary for over 150 years. And based on our current advisory business, we are confident in our ability to adjust and be successful. Perhaps one of the biggest positives is the longer time to implement, which allows us to be even better prepared. 
Skipping Page 8, as we actually have nothing significant to call out on corporate, I will move on to the outlook on Page 9. We've included our guidance from Investor Day on the page, and it's unchanged, so I won't go through it. So just 2 new points to highlight. For Asset Management, the first quarter revenues adjusted for the $150 million were a little over $2.8 billion. And assuming relatively constructive markets, we would expect those revenues in the second quarter to be flat to up, but to be less than $3 billion. And obviously, expense will also be flat to up, in line with those revenues, on performance-based compensation. 
In the Commercial Bank, we expect revenues will be up modestly on continued loan growth, but we also expect expenses to increase to about $725 million as we add bankers and execute on our technology and product investment strategies. The upshot of which is we expect preprovision net revenue for the Commercial Bank to be relatively in line with the first quarter. 
Before moving to Q&A, I want to make a few comments about the news this morning regarding living wills. Obviously, we were disappointed with the conclusion reached by the joint agencies on our resolution plan. We have taken this planning process very seriously, and we believe we've made substantial progress. Having said that, the most important thing is we worked with our regulators to understand their feedback fully and in more detail, and we are fully committed to meeting their expectations. 
So wrapping up, despite challenging market conditions, we delivered really quite good performance in the quarter, with diversification allowing us to perform well in difficult environments and be there for our clients. 
Operator, you can open up to Q&A."

Where you are seeing it be a little bit higher, was on Metals & Mining. We were expecting close to $100 million. And there were a couple of extra downgrades that came through in the quarter. And that kind of timing is going to happen. It doesn't change the overall perspective for us. With respect to draws, when we -- when I gave some sort of indicative guidance about what you might expect to see potentially in the rest of the year in terms of reserve build, we do try to take into consideration the likelihood that we will see incremental build. And clearly, we will work with borrowers to try and help them such that, that may not be necessary. And in other cases, we can reduce our exposure in redetermination cases, but we will expect to see some draws and that's contemplated in our guidance. And I want to make sure that everyone understood that we tried to be very complete. So this is not just Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining as the NAICS codes would suggest. We've looked at very closely-related companies in shipping and marine transportation and the like. So we're trying to be very complete."

So on the interest rate point, it -- the color is pretty consistent with what we've said over time, which is we have the belief that U.S. economy is continuing to move in the right direction, that the consumer is on solid footing and that despite the noise in the data and some of the volatility in the markets, global growth will continue, albeit at a moderate pace. And obviously stability in the markets in March has continued to help us with that thesis. And so that, coupled with the fact that the Fed themselves both -- while they're dovish in their narratives in the minutes and also their dots are continuing to talk about gradual increases, and the debate around negative rates has kind of quietened, so we don't particularly run the company with a day-to-day view on what's going to happen with interest rates. We are positioned for rising rates, as you know, and have been, but we also understand what the performance of the company looks like if there were no more rate rises or when we stress our portfolios in lots of different ways. So we are positioned for rising rates, it is our central case that, that will happen. The market is pricing less than one hike in this year. The Fed does say 2. Our research says 2. We're just going to have to wait and see. I'll also start and then Jamie can jump in on the living will thing. We have to take it at face value in discussions with our regulators, that we need to meet their requirements, whatever they may be, all of the rules, whether it's capital, whether it's liquidity, whether it's stress testing, whether it's resolution plans. And if we do that and satisfy them, then we can continue to operate the company the way that we think is best for our clients and communities around the world. And so at this point, we need to remediate and address the issues and the feedback they've given us, and resubmit a plan for assessments that we hope will be credible and that's certainly what we will commit to do.

So obviously, they do have those powers. It -- October is not that far away. We're going to do our very, very best to make sure that we put our best foot forward and remediate the issues and then we have another submission in July of 2017.

So the trajectory, if rates continue to rise, would be upwards, but that's why we said market dependent. We were not expecting our performance to go down from here. Flat to up, but depending on rate."

But one of the issues that strikes me is, clearly with the reduced revenues, particularly in the capital markets business. Your comp down about $400 million in the -- compared to the first quarter -- quarter of last year. And obviously, what we've experienced generally is you're holding the ratio reasonably steady for the second or third quarter, and then slowing up with the lower ratio in the fourth quarter. So I'm looking at the estimates we have the revenues on a well-known provider of data, and we've got pretty flat revenues being forecast by people like me, whether we're right or wrong. Should we be thinking about how you're going to build the bonus pool on the back -- against this background and whether we should be looking at thinking -- or thinking that you're going to have to retain the comp ratio at a pretty similar level through the year, if indeed, we don't see any uptick in revenues and they remain reasonably flat?"

But one of the questions I perhaps just wanted to ask is an area that you've been pushing hard on is equity, cash equities, in particular. My sense is that actually, a lot of the players, including the Europeans who're doing massive restructuring are putting more capital into equities on the back of the fact that it's a lower-capital business. And therefore, they think they can get higher returns and just maybe that's why the Mueller [ph] pulled out of European equities yesterday.

I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.Starting on Page 1. Th",2207,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.
Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $6.2 billion, EPS of $1.55 and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on $25.2 billion of revenue, a strong result this quarter, particularly given the backdrop. And while there are no significant items shown here on the page, our underlying performance was even stronger if you exclude the impact of other notable items, primarily credit, legal and tax, all of which you'll hear about as I go through the presentation. And that strength was driven by increased client trading activity across markets and an improvement in IBCs compared to the first quarter as well as strong core loan growth of 16%, reflecting good demand across both Consumer and Wholesale and record Consumer deposit growth, up $54 billion. 
Before I go through the results, let me spend a moment on 2 topics that are top of mind: first, an update on wholesale credit. You will see that the total wholesale credit costs this quarter were approximately $200 million. Within this, charge-offs of $150 million were principally driven by Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining, and those charge-offs were very substantially offset by reserve releases. So they were previously reserved, which means that underlying the net $50 million reserve build, we saw incremental reserve actions this quarter of about $200 million, principally one energy name downgraded in the CIB. 
Although the Oil & Gas sector remains stressed and reserves will continue to be idiosyncratic, overall trends have been somewhat positive with oil prices continuing to stabilize and firming sentiment in the sector improving access to capital markets. In addition, outside of energy, we still have not seen contagion or deterioration in our Wholesale or Consumer credit portfolios. 
Second, on Brexit, uncertainty running up to the referendum led to a risk-off environment. And following the decision, the markets were quite volatile as expected, and volumes were materially higher in the immediate aftermath. The market functioned quite well, absorbing the volatility. And despite the significant increases in volumes, our systems were stable, and we continue to support client activity with decent trading performance. 
With respect to next steps, as you know, the ultimate relationship between the U.K. and the European Union broadly and access to the single market and passporting specifically will likely unfold slowly and over an extended period, depending on when Article 50 is invoked. We continue to work on plans for the full range of outcomes, but we will be appropriately patient. 
The most important point is that we remain committed to fully supporting our European and U.K. clients across businesses, and we will be fully able to do this. And while executing against certain of these options would be complex, ultimately, we will protect the franchise and minimize any friction costs so that they will be manageable for the company. 
Moving on to Page 2. Revenue of $25.2 billion was up $700 million year-on-year on higher net interest income. For the full year, expect NII to be up more than the $2 billion we guided at Investor Day despite headwinds from a flatter yield curve, given that our sensitivity is significantly skewed to the front end of the curve and as industry deposit reprice to date has remained low, coupled with continued strong loan and deposit growth. 
Noninterest revenue was flat year-on-year with the increase in Markets revenues being offset by declines in IBCs as well as Asset Management. Adjusted expense of $14.1 billion was down $140 million, reflecting continued progress against our commitments. We still expect full year expense of $56 billion, plus or minus, as the second half of the year includes our expectation of an increase in the SEI surcharge in the third and fourth quarters. 
Moving on to capital on Page 3. The firm's advanced fully phased-in CET1 ratio was 11.9%, with standardized at 12.1%, both up about 15 basis points from the prior quarter. The improvement in both ratios was driven by net capital generation with RWA remaining relatively flat. Firm SLR remained flat to the prior quarter at 6.6% as capital generation was offset by balance sheet growth. 
This quarter, we returned $4.4 billion of net capital to shareholders, including $2.6 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.48 a share. Finally, we're pleased we did not receive an objection to our capital plan, and the board authorized gross repurchases of up to $10.6 billion. 
Moving on to Page 4 and Consumer & Community Banking. Consumer & Community Banking generated $2.7 billion of net income with an ROE of 20%, reflecting continued strength in business drivers. We had record deposit growth again this quarter, up 10% year-on-year. Average loans were up 11%, with core loans up 23%, driven by mortgage and Auto but with continued strength across all products. 
And we had record Business Banking loan originations of $2.2 billion, up 14% year-on-year and with a strong pipeline, up 17%. We added nearly 2 million households year-on-year, with an increase of 700,000 since last quarter, reflecting strong acquisition trends, including the launch of Freedom Unlimited. And finally, our active mobile customer base remains the largest among U.S. banks, up 18%. Revenue of $11.5 billion included some noncore items, which contributed a little under $200 million, principally a onetime gain on Visa Europe and negative mark to market on Square. Adjusted for this, revenue was up 2%. 
Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 3%, reflecting strong deposit and account growth. Mortgage revenue was up 5%, with rates remaining low, supporting production margins and on growth in NII as we added $14 billion of high-quality loans to our portfolio this quarter, partially offset by lower servicing revenue. 
Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto revenue was up but flat if you exclude the noncore items I mentioned, with growth in Card and Auto offsetting the impact of card renegotiations. Expense was down 3%, driven by lower legal expense and continued progress against our efficiency commitment, allowing us to fund the incremental marketing and Auto lease growth that we talked about at Investor Day. 
Finally, credit trends across the Consumer businesses continue to be favorable, with charge-offs in cards trending up slightly. Over the last 2, 3 years, we have responsibly expanded our credit box in cards in the prime and near-prime space. As these vintages season, we would naturally expect a higher loss rate, and performance is in line with our expectation. These loans are coming on at ROEs higher than the portfolio average. So as the mix of our portfolio increasingly reflects these newer vintages, we do expect loss rates to continue to trend up but to do so slowly, and as such, we built $250 million of reserves this quarter. 
Moving to Auto credit. Competitive pressures have caused some lenders to take more layered risk. We have maintained our underwriting discipline with average FICO scores and LTVs better than the industry and with a very sharp focus on avoiding risk layering. Our credit performance is in line with expectations, and we built $50 million in reserves this quarter, largely reflecting volume growth. Against this reserve build, we saw releases of $125 million, principally driven by mortgage. 
Turning to Page 5 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $9.2 billion and an ROE of 15%. In banking, IB revenue was $1.5 billion, down 15% in a market down 18%, largely driven by lower equity underwriting fees. We maintained share and ranked #1 in Global IB fees, ranking #1 in North America and EMEA. Advisory fees were flat versus a wallet that declined 15%. This quarter, we ranked #2 globally and grew share by 50 basis points. 
In equity underwriting, global issuance improved after a weak first quarter but was down from a strong quarter last year, with fees down 37% in a market down 42%. We continue to rank #1 globally, growing share by 30 basis points, and we ranked #1 in every product category for the first half of this year. Net underwriting fees were down 2% from a strong prior year, largely in line with the market, which was down 4%, and we ranked #2 globally. 
Moving on to the outlook for fees. Given the decline in M&A volumes, lower wallet is expected in the second half of 2016. We expect to see positive momentum in ECM as the new issuance market continues to improve, and we expect DCM to be broadly in line with first half, reflecting robust high-grade bond issuance, offset by lower acquisition finance. 
Lending revenue of $277 million was down 8%, reflecting mark-to-market losses on hedges of accrual loans. Markets revenue of $5.6 billion was up 23% year-on-year. As I mentioned at the beginning, the Brexit vote triggered a spike in volatility and volumes across asset classes. We were able to meet our clients' needs, execute their transactions and provide liquidity. 
Fixed Income revenue of $4 billion was up 35% versus a weak second quarter last year. The positive momentum that we saw in March continued into the second quarter, with strong performance in Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets from higher client flows. And performance also improved in Credit and Securitized Products as client risk appetite recovered in a more stable environment, driving increased primary and secondary market activity. 
Equities revenue was $1.6 billion, up 2% compared to a strong second quarter last year. With respect to the third [ph] quarter, client activity is returning to more normal levels, and trading performance so far has been fine. Credit costs of $235 million were driven by reserve builds for Oil & Gas. And finally, expense of $5.1 billion was down 1% year-on-year, with a comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter of 30%. 
Moving on to Page 6 and Commercial Banking. Overall, a solid quarter for Commercial Banking, with net income of nearly $700 million on revenue of $1.8 billion and an ROE of 16%. IB revenue rebounded from the first quarter. It was up 23% sequentially and flat year-on-year, and we continue to see strong momentum in loan growth, with average loan balances up 13% year-on-year. 
Commercial Real Estate loans grew 18%, reflecting continued outperformance in both commercial term lending and real estate banking, and C&I loans were up 9% on increased origination activity in both Corporate Client Banking and middle market. Revenue was up 4% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit NII and loan growth, and expense of $731 million was up 4%, reflecting continued investment in bankers and technology. Finally, credit performance continues to be in line with our expectations, with net charge-offs of 14 basis points, driven by Oil & Gas but almost fully reserved, and outside of energy, credit performance continues to be strong. 
Moving on to Page 7 and Asset Management. Asset Management reported net income of $521 million, with a 29% pretax margin and an ROE of 22%. Revenue of $2.9 billion was down 7% year-on-year as we continue to feel the impact of weaker markets, lower performance fees and lower brokerage activity.  Expense of $2.1 billion was down 13% year-on-year, largely driven by lower legal expense and recall that the prior year included a noncore loss. 
AUM of $1.7 trillion and client assets of $2.3 trillion were both up 1% sequentially and down 5% and 3% year-on-year, respectively. We had positive long-term flows of $3 billion as we continue to see strong net inflows into our fixed income products, with equity market weakness and volatility causing clients to derisk, resulting in outflows in equity and multi-asset. Our long-term investment performance remains good, with 81% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over 5 years. Lastly, we had record loan balances of $112 billion, up 4% year-on-year, driven by mortgage, up 20%. 
Turning to Page 8 and Corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $166 million, which included 2 notable items. There was a net legal benefit reflecting some favorable developments in the quarter, offset by a number of tax items, including additions to tax reserves for developments relating to open audit periods. As a result of the tax items, our managed tax rate for the quarter was 39%. Adjusted, it would have been closer to 36%. 
Now turning to Page 9 and moving on to the outlook. To reiterate, our firm-wide guidance for the full year on each of revenues, expenses and charge-offs at this point is largely unchanged, obviously market dependent. So to wrap up, a strong quarter, reflecting our leadership position and the benefits of our diversified franchise, with the Consumer businesses firing on all cylinders and with robust loan growth across all businesses. We had a good result in Markets, continuing to demonstrate our ability to support clients no matter the environment.

We're replacing them all of the time over the course of the last couple of years since the end of 2013. We made some changes to our credit box and our credit risk policies very, very thoughtfully, and we've been monitoring it very closely. And what we're seeing in terms of the loss rates and the seasoning of them is fully in line with our expectations, and these loans are coming on at higher risk-adjusted margins. So the ROEs are at or above the portfolio ROEs. So nothing that would speak to anything other than our full expectation for our credit risk appetite. And with respect to Auto, not to speak for others, but obviously, when you look at lower FICO scores and higher LTVs longer term on top of each other in an environment where you've already seen used car prices soften some and they're likely to continue to do so, it's something to watch. And so we've been very, very thoughtful about that not just today but as we've been going through the cycle. And not only on an absolute basis do we compare favorably in terms of LTVs and FICO scores and even terms to the industry, but we've been very, very careful in -- and low percentage of subprime origination, very, very careful about looking at those layered risks. So nothing in our -- and remember, for Auto this year, I think the charge-off rate's going to be the sort of 40-ish basis points compared to a long-run average of more like 60. So we're sort of reverting to a more normal level, if nothing else. And used car prices will ultimately come down, and we're being thoughtful about that."

So I would honestly characterize it not as sort of underplay as quarter-over-quarter noise. Looking forward -- and so when you look at our NIM -- you have NII flat. You have the balance sheet growing, as we expected, both on loans and trading assets. So NIM just naturally is down a few basis points, but we would be looking for NII to be up slightly in the third and fourth quarter and for our NIM to be relatively stable."

So there'll be some of that, but I would characterize it as modest. And then as these vintages continue to season, we've been experiencing very, very low loss rates, circa 2.5%. They will trend up slightly, and so there will be a little bit of rates impact, too, but, again, as I say, with very accretive ROEs. So I would look forward and expect there to be some reserve adds over the course of the next several quarters on a combination of those factors but for all the right reasons.

We are going to have some impact in NII of the lower 10-year. It's not significant, but it will offset that to a degree.

And if you think about just the other factors that would be supportive of M&A like cheap financing globally, lower organic growth, good multiple, solid economy in the U.S. and globally notwithstanding, a bit of the steam taking out in Europe or the U.K., all of that you continues to be supportive of strategic M&A. Yes, and third [ph] at the end of the day and currency could be supportive of cross-border activity. So there are puts and takes. I'm certain that there will be some people who think carefully through the right timing and what to do. But at the end of the day, the strategic proposition should ultimately win out in most cases. And similarly, volatility, generally speaking, is not particularly conducive in terms of ECM, but investor appetite is still there, and there have been deals price post Brexit.

So I don't have insights, but I can say at would use specifically to try and reconcile the Fed's results year-on-year nor do we really try to do that. You're right. Operational risk is likely a piece of it, and that was disclosed in their -- in that information. So I would say there can be volatility, but I feel like this is not an unreasonable place to think that PPNR would start, and it's consistent, as you can see, relatively speaking with what we calculated. In respect to what that means for what's most binding, what it does mean is if you look at the analysis that we've done a couple of years in a row now, where we've said using this CCAR results from the Fed, what will that imply CET 1 ratio would need to be to pass to. It had previously been a little less than 11% with improved PPNR, and therefore, the improved results at this point, it would be a little less than 10%. So in that context, as we sort of look forward sometime in the near future, maybe in the third quarter to getting the sort of 2017 CCAR changes in proposed form hopefully, it will alleviate, to a degree, a little bit of that pressure, but I still would suggest to you as we said in Investor Day that CCAR may, depending on how these are charges included in minimum, may become binding, if not likely will become binding, and so we'll continue to take that into consideration as we go forward, and we are already taking it into consideration as we think about optimizing against the multiple binding constraints we have."

And so everything is constructive on that path, but it needs to continue along the same path. And yes, we are growing our portfolio, and so even if we're not for energy, we would, all other things equal, be adding to reserves but are also time to paydown, other puts and takes, too."

I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.Starting on Page 1. Th",2207,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.
Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $6.2 billion, EPS of $1.55 and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on $25.2 billion of revenue, a strong result this quarter, particularly given the backdrop. And while there are no significant items shown here on the page, our underlying performance was even stronger if you exclude the impact of other notable items, primarily credit, legal and tax, all of which you'll hear about as I go through the presentation. And that strength was driven by increased client trading activity across markets and an improvement in IBCs compared to the first quarter as well as strong core loan growth of 16%, reflecting good demand across both Consumer and Wholesale and record Consumer deposit growth, up $54 billion. 
Before I go through the results, let me spend a moment on 2 topics that are top of mind: first, an update on wholesale credit. You will see that the total wholesale credit costs this quarter were approximately $200 million. Within this, charge-offs of $150 million were principally driven by Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining, and those charge-offs were very substantially offset by reserve releases. So they were previously reserved, which means that underlying the net $50 million reserve build, we saw incremental reserve actions this quarter of about $200 million, principally one energy name downgraded in the CIB. 
Although the Oil & Gas sector remains stressed and reserves will continue to be idiosyncratic, overall trends have been somewhat positive with oil prices continuing to stabilize and firming sentiment in the sector improving access to capital markets. In addition, outside of energy, we still have not seen contagion or deterioration in our Wholesale or Consumer credit portfolios. 
Second, on Brexit, uncertainty running up to the referendum led to a risk-off environment. And following the decision, the markets were quite volatile as expected, and volumes were materially higher in the immediate aftermath. The market functioned quite well, absorbing the volatility. And despite the significant increases in volumes, our systems were stable, and we continue to support client activity with decent trading performance. 
With respect to next steps, as you know, the ultimate relationship between the U.K. and the European Union broadly and access to the single market and passporting specifically will likely unfold slowly and over an extended period, depending on when Article 50 is invoked. We continue to work on plans for the full range of outcomes, but we will be appropriately patient. 
The most important point is that we remain committed to fully supporting our European and U.K. clients across businesses, and we will be fully able to do this. And while executing against certain of these options would be complex, ultimately, we will protect the franchise and minimize any friction costs so that they will be manageable for the company. 
Moving on to Page 2. Revenue of $25.2 billion was up $700 million year-on-year on higher net interest income. For the full year, expect NII to be up more than the $2 billion we guided at Investor Day despite headwinds from a flatter yield curve, given that our sensitivity is significantly skewed to the front end of the curve and as industry deposit reprice to date has remained low, coupled with continued strong loan and deposit growth. 
Noninterest revenue was flat year-on-year with the increase in Markets revenues being offset by declines in IBCs as well as Asset Management. Adjusted expense of $14.1 billion was down $140 million, reflecting continued progress against our commitments. We still expect full year expense of $56 billion, plus or minus, as the second half of the year includes our expectation of an increase in the SEI surcharge in the third and fourth quarters. 
Moving on to capital on Page 3. The firm's advanced fully phased-in CET1 ratio was 11.9%, with standardized at 12.1%, both up about 15 basis points from the prior quarter. The improvement in both ratios was driven by net capital generation with RWA remaining relatively flat. Firm SLR remained flat to the prior quarter at 6.6% as capital generation was offset by balance sheet growth. 
This quarter, we returned $4.4 billion of net capital to shareholders, including $2.6 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.48 a share. Finally, we're pleased we did not receive an objection to our capital plan, and the board authorized gross repurchases of up to $10.6 billion. 
Moving on to Page 4 and Consumer & Community Banking. Consumer & Community Banking generated $2.7 billion of net income with an ROE of 20%, reflecting continued strength in business drivers. We had record deposit growth again this quarter, up 10% year-on-year. Average loans were up 11%, with core loans up 23%, driven by mortgage and Auto but with continued strength across all products. 
And we had record Business Banking loan originations of $2.2 billion, up 14% year-on-year and with a strong pipeline, up 17%. We added nearly 2 million households year-on-year, with an increase of 700,000 since last quarter, reflecting strong acquisition trends, including the launch of Freedom Unlimited. And finally, our active mobile customer base remains the largest among U.S. banks, up 18%. Revenue of $11.5 billion included some noncore items, which contributed a little under $200 million, principally a onetime gain on Visa Europe and negative mark to market on Square. Adjusted for this, revenue was up 2%. 
Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 3%, reflecting strong deposit and account growth. Mortgage revenue was up 5%, with rates remaining low, supporting production margins and on growth in NII as we added $14 billion of high-quality loans to our portfolio this quarter, partially offset by lower servicing revenue. 
Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto revenue was up but flat if you exclude the noncore items I mentioned, with growth in Card and Auto offsetting the impact of card renegotiations. Expense was down 3%, driven by lower legal expense and continued progress against our efficiency commitment, allowing us to fund the incremental marketing and Auto lease growth that we talked about at Investor Day. 
Finally, credit trends across the Consumer businesses continue to be favorable, with charge-offs in cards trending up slightly. Over the last 2, 3 years, we have responsibly expanded our credit box in cards in the prime and near-prime space. As these vintages season, we would naturally expect a higher loss rate, and performance is in line with our expectation. These loans are coming on at ROEs higher than the portfolio average. So as the mix of our portfolio increasingly reflects these newer vintages, we do expect loss rates to continue to trend up but to do so slowly, and as such, we built $250 million of reserves this quarter. 
Moving to Auto credit. Competitive pressures have caused some lenders to take more layered risk. We have maintained our underwriting discipline with average FICO scores and LTVs better than the industry and with a very sharp focus on avoiding risk layering. Our credit performance is in line with expectations, and we built $50 million in reserves this quarter, largely reflecting volume growth. Against this reserve build, we saw releases of $125 million, principally driven by mortgage. 
Turning to Page 5 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $9.2 billion and an ROE of 15%. In banking, IB revenue was $1.5 billion, down 15% in a market down 18%, largely driven by lower equity underwriting fees. We maintained share and ranked #1 in Global IB fees, ranking #1 in North America and EMEA. Advisory fees were flat versus a wallet that declined 15%. This quarter, we ranked #2 globally and grew share by 50 basis points. 
In equity underwriting, global issuance improved after a weak first quarter but was down from a strong quarter last year, with fees down 37% in a market down 42%. We continue to rank #1 globally, growing share by 30 basis points, and we ranked #1 in every product category for the first half of this year. Net underwriting fees were down 2% from a strong prior year, largely in line with the market, which was down 4%, and we ranked #2 globally. 
Moving on to the outlook for fees. Given the decline in M&A volumes, lower wallet is expected in the second half of 2016. We expect to see positive momentum in ECM as the new issuance market continues to improve, and we expect DCM to be broadly in line with first half, reflecting robust high-grade bond issuance, offset by lower acquisition finance. 
Lending revenue of $277 million was down 8%, reflecting mark-to-market losses on hedges of accrual loans. Markets revenue of $5.6 billion was up 23% year-on-year. As I mentioned at the beginning, the Brexit vote triggered a spike in volatility and volumes across asset classes. We were able to meet our clients' needs, execute their transactions and provide liquidity. 
Fixed Income revenue of $4 billion was up 35% versus a weak second quarter last year. The positive momentum that we saw in March continued into the second quarter, with strong performance in Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets from higher client flows. And performance also improved in Credit and Securitized Products as client risk appetite recovered in a more stable environment, driving increased primary and secondary market activity. 
Equities revenue was $1.6 billion, up 2% compared to a strong second quarter last year. With respect to the third [ph] quarter, client activity is returning to more normal levels, and trading performance so far has been fine. Credit costs of $235 million were driven by reserve builds for Oil & Gas. And finally, expense of $5.1 billion was down 1% year-on-year, with a comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter of 30%. 
Moving on to Page 6 and Commercial Banking. Overall, a solid quarter for Commercial Banking, with net income of nearly $700 million on revenue of $1.8 billion and an ROE of 16%. IB revenue rebounded from the first quarter. It was up 23% sequentially and flat year-on-year, and we continue to see strong momentum in loan growth, with average loan balances up 13% year-on-year. 
Commercial Real Estate loans grew 18%, reflecting continued outperformance in both commercial term lending and real estate banking, and C&I loans were up 9% on increased origination activity in both Corporate Client Banking and middle market. Revenue was up 4% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit NII and loan growth, and expense of $731 million was up 4%, reflecting continued investment in bankers and technology. Finally, credit performance continues to be in line with our expectations, with net charge-offs of 14 basis points, driven by Oil & Gas but almost fully reserved, and outside of energy, credit performance continues to be strong. 
Moving on to Page 7 and Asset Management. Asset Management reported net income of $521 million, with a 29% pretax margin and an ROE of 22%. Revenue of $2.9 billion was down 7% year-on-year as we continue to feel the impact of weaker markets, lower performance fees and lower brokerage activity.  Expense of $2.1 billion was down 13% year-on-year, largely driven by lower legal expense and recall that the prior year included a noncore loss. 
AUM of $1.7 trillion and client assets of $2.3 trillion were both up 1% sequentially and down 5% and 3% year-on-year, respectively. We had positive long-term flows of $3 billion as we continue to see strong net inflows into our fixed income products, with equity market weakness and volatility causing clients to derisk, resulting in outflows in equity and multi-asset. Our long-term investment performance remains good, with 81% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over 5 years. Lastly, we had record loan balances of $112 billion, up 4% year-on-year, driven by mortgage, up 20%. 
Turning to Page 8 and Corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $166 million, which included 2 notable items. There was a net legal benefit reflecting some favorable developments in the quarter, offset by a number of tax items, including additions to tax reserves for developments relating to open audit periods. As a result of the tax items, our managed tax rate for the quarter was 39%. Adjusted, it would have been closer to 36%. 
Now turning to Page 9 and moving on to the outlook. To reiterate, our firm-wide guidance for the full year on each of revenues, expenses and charge-offs at this point is largely unchanged, obviously market dependent. So to wrap up, a strong quarter, reflecting our leadership position and the benefits of our diversified franchise, with the Consumer businesses firing on all cylinders and with robust loan growth across all businesses. We had a good result in Markets, continuing to demonstrate our ability to support clients no matter the environment.

We're replacing them all of the time over the course of the last couple of years since the end of 2013. We made some changes to our credit box and our credit risk policies very, very thoughtfully, and we've been monitoring it very closely. And what we're seeing in terms of the loss rates and the seasoning of them is fully in line with our expectations, and these loans are coming on at higher risk-adjusted margins. So the ROEs are at or above the portfolio ROEs. So nothing that would speak to anything other than our full expectation for our credit risk appetite. And with respect to Auto, not to speak for others, but obviously, when you look at lower FICO scores and higher LTVs longer term on top of each other in an environment where you've already seen used car prices soften some and they're likely to continue to do so, it's something to watch. And so we've been very, very thoughtful about that not just today but as we've been going through the cycle. And not only on an absolute basis do we compare favorably in terms of LTVs and FICO scores and even terms to the industry, but we've been very, very careful in -- and low percentage of subprime origination, very, very careful about looking at those layered risks. So nothing in our -- and remember, for Auto this year, I think the charge-off rate's going to be the sort of 40-ish basis points compared to a long-run average of more like 60. So we're sort of reverting to a more normal level, if nothing else. And used car prices will ultimately come down, and we're being thoughtful about that."

So I would honestly characterize it not as sort of underplay as quarter-over-quarter noise. Looking forward -- and so when you look at our NIM -- you have NII flat. You have the balance sheet growing, as we expected, both on loans and trading assets. So NIM just naturally is down a few basis points, but we would be looking for NII to be up slightly in the third and fourth quarter and for our NIM to be relatively stable."

So there'll be some of that, but I would characterize it as modest. And then as these vintages continue to season, we've been experiencing very, very low loss rates, circa 2.5%. They will trend up slightly, and so there will be a little bit of rates impact, too, but, again, as I say, with very accretive ROEs. So I would look forward and expect there to be some reserve adds over the course of the next several quarters on a combination of those factors but for all the right reasons. And similarly, volume-wise in Auto, we should see some adds, but, again, in comparison to card, modest."

We are going to have some impact in NII of the lower 10-year. It's not significant, but it will offset that to a degree.

And if you think about just the other factors that would be supportive of M&A, so like cheap financing globally, lower organic growth, good multiples, solid economy in the U.S. and globally notwithstanding, a bit of the steam taken out in Europe or the U.K., all of that should continue to be supportive of strategic M&A, yes. And so at the end of the day -- and currency could be supportive of cross-border activity. So there are puts and takes. I'm certain that there will be some people who think carefully through the right timing and what to do. But at the end of the day, the strategic proposition should ultimately win out in most cases. And similarly, volatility, generally speaking, is not particularly conducive in terms of ECM. But investor appetite is still there, and there have been deals priced post Brexit.

Not to say that, that means that these results are more normal, but I would say if you look at the 3 years and look at the PPNR results now, it's more consistent with the sort of portfolio risks, revenue generation we would expect. And you can see that because it's much more consistent with our results. So I don't have insights, but I can say I would need specifically to try and reconcile the Fed's results year-on-year nor do we really try to do that. You're right, operational risk is likely a piece of it, and that was disclosed in that information. So I would just say there can be volatility, but I feel like this is not an unreasonable place to think that the PPNR would start. And it's consistent, as you can see, relatively speaking, with what we calculated. In respect to what that means for what's most binding, what it does mean is, if you look at the analysis that we've done a couple of years in a row now where we've said, using these CCAR results from the Fed, what would that imply our CET 1 ratio would need to be to pass, it had previously been a little less than 11%. With the improved PPNR and, therefore, the improved results, at this point, it would be a little less than 10%. So in that context, as we sort of look forward sometime in the near future, maybe in the third quarter, to getting the sort of 2017 CCAR changes in proposed form, hopefully, it will alleviate, to a degree, a little bit of that pressure. But I still would suggest to you, as we said in Investor Day, that CCAR may -- depending on how the G-SIB surcharges, including the minimum, may become binding, if not likely, will become binding. And so we'll continue to take that into consideration as we go forward, and we are already taking it into consideration as we think about optimizing against the multiple binding constraints we have."

I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.Starting on Page 1. Th",2211,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.
Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $6.2 billion, EPS of $1.55 and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on $25.2 billion of revenue, a strong result this quarter, particularly given the backdrop. And while there are no significant items shown here on the page, our underlying performance was even stronger if you exclude the impact of other notable items, primarily credit, legal and tax, all of which you'll hear about as I go through the presentation. And that strength was driven by increased client trading activity across markets and an improvement in IB fees compared to the first quarter as well as strong core loan growth of 16%, reflecting good demand across both Consumer and Wholesale and record Consumer deposit growth, up $54 billion. 
Before I go through the results, let me spend a moment on 2 topics that are top of mind: first, an update on wholesale credit. You will see that the total wholesale credit costs this quarter were approximately $200 million. Within this, charge-offs of $150 million were principally driven by Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining, and those charge-offs were very substantially offset by reserve releases. So they were previously reserved, which means that underlying the net $50 million reserve build, we saw incremental reserve actions this quarter of about $200 million, principally one energy name downgraded in the CIB. 
Although the Oil & Gas sector remains stressed and reserves will continue to be idiosyncratic, overall trends have been somewhat positive with oil prices continuing to stabilize and firming sentiment in the sector improving access to capital markets. In addition, outside of energy, we still have not seen contagion or deterioration in our Wholesale or Consumer credit portfolios. 
Second, on Brexit, uncertainty running up to the referendum led to a risk-off environment. And following the decision, the markets were quite volatile as expected, and volumes were materially higher in the immediate aftermath. The market functioned quite well, absorbing the volatility. And despite the significant increases in volumes, our systems were stable, and we continued to support client activity with decent trading performance. 
With respect to next steps, as you know, the ultimate relationship between the U.K. and the European Union broadly and access to the single market and passporting, specifically, will likely unfold slowly and over an extended period, depending on when Article 50 is invoked. We continue to work on plans for the full range of outcomes, but we will be appropriately patient. 
The most important point is that we remain committed to fully supporting our European and U.K. clients across businesses, and we will be fully able to do this. And while executing against certain of these options would be complex, ultimately, we will protect the franchise and minimize any friction costs so that they will be manageable for the company. 
Moving on to Page 2. Revenue of $25.2 billion was up $700 million year-on-year on higher net interest income. For the full year, expect NII to be up more than the $2 billion we guided at Investor Day despite headwinds from a flatter yield curve, given that our sensitivity is significantly skewed to the front end of the curve and as industry deposit reprice to date has remained low, coupled with continued strong loan and deposit growth. 
Noninterest revenue was flat year-on-year with the increase in Markets revenues being offset by declines in IB fees as well as Asset Management. Adjusted expense of $14.1 billion was down $140 million, reflecting continued progress against our commitments. We still expect full year expense of $56 billion, plus or minus, as the second half of the year includes our expectation of an increase in the SEI surcharge in the third and fourth quarters. 
Moving on to capital on Page 3. The firm's advanced fully phased-in CET1 ratio was 11.9%, with standardized at 12.1%, both up about 15 basis points from the prior quarter. The improvement in both ratios was driven by net capital generation with RWA remaining relatively flat. Firm SLR remained flat to the prior quarter at 6.6% as capital generation was offset by balance sheet growth. 
This quarter, we returned $4.4 billion of net capital to shareholders, including $2.6 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.48 a share. Finally, we're pleased we did not receive an objection to our capital plan, and the board authorized gross repurchases of up to $10.6 billion. 
Moving on to Page 4 and Consumer & Community Banking. Consumer & Community Banking generated $2.7 billion of net income with an ROE of 20%, reflecting continued strength in business drivers. We had record deposit growth again this quarter, up 10% year-on-year. Average loans were up 11%, with core loans up 23%, driven by mortgage and Auto but with continued strength across all products. 
And we had record Business Banking loan originations of $2.2 billion, up 14% year-on-year and with a strong pipeline, up 17%. We added nearly 2 million households year-on-year, with an increase of 700,000 since last quarter, reflecting strong acquisition trends, including the launch of Freedom Unlimited. And finally, our active mobile customer base remains the largest among U.S. banks, up 18%. Revenue of $11.5 billion included some noncore items, which contributed a little under $200 million, principally a onetime gain on Visa Europe and negative mark to market on Square. Adjusted for this, revenue was up 2%. 
Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 3%, reflecting strong deposit and account growth. Mortgage revenue was up 5%, with rates remaining low, supporting production margins and on growth in NII as we added $14 billion of high-quality loans to our portfolio this quarter, partially offset by lower servicing revenue. 
Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto revenue was up but flat if you exclude the noncore items I mentioned, with growth in Card and Auto offsetting the impact of card renegotiations. Expense was down 3%, driven by lower legal expense and continued progress against our efficiency commitment, allowing us to fund the incremental marketing and Auto lease growth that we talked about at Investor Day. 
Finally, credit trends across the Consumer businesses continue to be favorable, with charge-offs in card trending up slightly. Over the last 2, 3 years, we have responsibly expanded our credit box in card in the prime and near-prime space. As these vintages season, we would naturally expect a higher loss rate, and performance is in line with our expectation. These loans are coming on at ROEs higher than the portfolio average. So as the mix of our portfolio increasingly reflects these newer vintages, we do expect loss rates to continue to trend up but to do so slowly, and as such, we built $250 million of reserves this quarter. 
Moving to Auto credit. Competitive pressures have caused some lenders to take more layered risk. We have maintained our underwriting discipline with average FICO scores and LTVs better than the industry and with a very sharp focus on avoiding risk layering. Our credit performance is in line with expectations, and we built $50 million in reserves this quarter, largely reflecting volume growth. Against this reserve build, we saw releases of $125 million, principally driven by mortgage. 
Turning to Page 5 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $9.2 billion and an ROE of 15%. In banking, IB revenue was $1.5 billion, down 15% in a market down 18%, largely driven by lower equity underwriting fees. We maintained share and ranked #1 in Global IB fees, ranking #1 in North America and EMEA. Advisory fees were flat versus a wallet that declined 15%. This quarter, we ranked #2 globally and grew share by 50 basis points. 
In equity underwriting, global issuance improved after a weak first quarter but was down from a strong quarter last year, with fees down 37% in a market down 42%. We continued to rank #1 globally, growing share by 30 basis points, and we ranked #1 in every product category for the first half of this year. Net underwriting fees were down 2% from a strong prior year, largely in line with the market, which was down 4%, and we ranked #2 globally. 
Moving on to the outlook for fees. Given the decline in M&A volumes, lower wallet is expected in the second half of 2016. We expect to see positive momentum in ECM as the new issuance market continues to improve, and we expect DCM to be broadly in line with the first half, reflecting robust high-grade bond issuance, offset by lower acquisition finance. 
Lending revenue of $277 million was down 8%, reflecting mark-to-market losses on hedges of accrual loans. Markets revenue of $5.6 billion was up 23% year-on-year. As I mentioned at the beginning, the Brexit vote triggered a spike in volatility and volumes across asset classes. We were able to meet our clients' needs, execute their transactions and provide liquidity. 
Fixed Income revenue of $4 billion was up 35% versus a weak second quarter last year. The positive momentum that we saw in March continued into the second quarter, with strong performance in Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets on higher client flows. And performance also improved in Credit and Securitized Products as client risk appetite recovered in a more stable environment, driving increased primary and secondary market activity. 
Equities revenue was $1.6 billion, up 2% compared to a strong second quarter last year. With respect to the third [ph] quarter, client activity is returning to more normal levels, and trading performance so far has been fine. Credit costs of $235 million were driven by a reserve build for Oil & Gas. And finally, expense of $5.1 billion was down 1% year-on-year, with a comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter of 30%. 
Moving on to Page 6 and Commercial Banking. Overall, a solid quarter for Commercial Banking, with net income of nearly $700 million on revenue of $1.8 billion and an ROE of 16%. IB revenue rebounded from the first quarter. It was up 23% sequentially and flat year-on-year, and we continue to see strong momentum in loan growth, with average loan balances up 13% year-on-year. 
Commercial Real Estate loans grew 18%, reflecting continued outperformance in both commercial term lending and real estate banking, and C&I loans were up 9% on increased origination activity in both Corporate Client Banking and middle market. Revenue was up 4% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit NII and loan growth, and expense of $731 million was up 4%, reflecting continued investment in bankers and technology. Finally, credit performance continues to be in line with our expectations, with net charge-offs of 14 basis points, driven by Oil & Gas but almost fully reserved, and outside of energy, credit performance continues to be strong. 
Moving on to Page 7 and Asset Management. Asset Management reported net income of $521 million, with a 29% pretax margin and an ROE of 22%. Revenue of $2.9 billion was down 7% year-on-year as we continue to feel the impact of weaker markets, lower performance fees and lower brokerage activity.  Expense of $2.1 billion was down 13% year-on-year, largely driven by lower legal expense and recall that the prior year included a noncore loss. 
AUM of $1.7 trillion and client assets of $2.3 trillion were both up 1% sequentially and down 5% and 3% year-on-year, respectively. We had positive long-term flows of $3 billion as we continued to see strong net inflows into our fixed income products, with equity market weakness and volatility causing clients to derisk, resulting in outflows in equity and multi-asset. Our long-term investment performance remained good, with 81% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over 5 years. Lastly, we had record loan balances of $112 billion, up 4% year-on-year, driven by mortgage, up 20%. 
Turning to Page 8 and Corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $166 million, which included 2 notable items. There was a net legal benefit reflecting some favorable developments in the quarter, offset by a number of tax items, including additions to tax reserves for developments relating to open audit periods. As a result of the tax items, our managed tax rate for the quarter was 39%. Adjusted, it would have been closer to 36%. 
Now turning to Page 9 and moving on to the outlook. To reiterate, our firm-wide guidance for the full year on each of revenues, expenses and charge-offs at this point is largely unchanged, obviously market dependent. So to wrap up, a strong quarter, reflecting our leadership position and the benefits of our diversified franchise, with the Consumer businesses firing on all cylinders and with robust loan growth across all businesses. We had a good result in Markets, continuing to demonstrate our ability to support clients no matter the environment.

We're replacing them all of the time over the course of the last couple of years since the end of 2013. We made some changes to our credit box and our credit risk policies very, very thoughtfully, and we've been monitoring them very closely. And what we're seeing in terms of the loss rates and the seasoning of them is fully in line with our expectations, and these loans are coming on at higher risk-adjusted margins. So the ROEs are at or above the portfolio ROEs. So nothing that would speak to anything other than our full expectation for our credit risk appetite. And with respect to Auto, not to speak for others, but obviously, when you look at lower FICO scores and higher LTVs and longer term on top of each other in an environment where you've already seen used car prices soften some and they're likely to continue to do so, it's something to watch. And so we've been very, very thoughtful about that not just today but as we've been going through the cycle. And not only on an absolute basis do we compare favorably in terms of LTVs and FICO scores and even terms to the industry, but we've been very, very careful in -- and low percentage of subprime origination, very, very careful about looking at those layered risks. So nothing in our -- and remember, for Auto this year, I think the charge-off rate's going to be sort of 40-ish basis points compared to a long-run average of more like 60. So we're sort of reverting to a more normal level, if nothing else. And used car prices will, ultimately, come down, and we're being thoughtful about that."

So I would honestly characterize it, not to sort of underplay it, as quarter-over-quarter noise. Looking forward -- and so when you look at our NIM, you have NII flat. You have the balance sheet growing, as we expected, both on loans and trading assets. So NIM just naturally is down a few basis points, but we would be looking for NII to be up slightly in the third and fourth quarter and for our NIM to be relatively stable."

So there'll be some of that, but I would characterize it as modest. And then as these vintages continue to season, we've been experiencing very, very low loss rates, circa 2.5%. They will trend up slightly, and so there will be a little bit of rates impact, too, but, again, as I say, with very accretive ROEs. So I would look forward and expect there to be some reserve adds over the course of the next several quarters on a combination of those factors but for all the right reasons. And similarly, volume-wise in Auto, we should see some adds, but, again, in comparison to card, modest."

But you've seen already in the first 2 quarters that year-over-year, we're up $1.4 billion. So we were doing better than that on a combination of lower deposit basis reprices and also on strong loan growth. But if you annualize that, that would be too high. We are going to have some impact in NII of the lower 10-year. It's not significant, but it will offset that to a degree.

So you may recall that we said we would expect mortgage revenues to be down year-on-year, actually, by a reasonably significant amount. Given, obviously, where the rate environment is as well as some positive MSR results in the first half of the year, we would expect mortgage revenues to be more like flat. And against that, to your point, lower IB fees and lower Asset Management revenues, given the environment.

So look, I would say, if you look at the last 3 years of PPNR, notwithstanding that there have been obviously differences in the scenarios, 2015 CCAR results, so not this year's but last year's, were low. Not to say that, that means that these results are more normal, but I would say if you look at the 3 years and look at the PPNR results now, it's more consistent with the sort of portfolio risks, the revenue generation we would expect. And you can see that because it's much more consistent with our results. So I don't have insights that I can share with you, specifically, to try and reconcile the Fed's results year-on-year, nor do we really try to do that. You're right, operational risk is likely a piece of it, and that was disclosed in that information. So I would just say there can be volatility, but I feel like this is not an unreasonable place to think that the PPNR would start. And it's consistent, as you can see, relatively speaking, with what we calculated. In respect to what that means for what's most binding, what it does mean is, if you look at the analysis that we've done a couple of years in a row now where we've said, using the CCAR results from the Fed, what would that imply our CET1 ratio would need to be to pass, it had previously been a little less than 11%. With the improved PPNR and, therefore, the improved results, at this point, it would be a little less than 10%. So in that context, as we sort of look forward sometime in the near future, maybe in the third quarter, to getting the sort of 2017 CCAR changes in proposed form, hopefully, it will alleviate, to a degree, a little bit of that pressure. But I still would suggest to you, as we said in Investor Day, that CCAR may, depending on how the G-SIB surcharge is included in the minimum, may become binding, if not likely, will become binding. And so we'll continue to take that into consideration as we go forward, and we are already taking it into consideration as we think about optimizing against the multiple binding constraints we have."

I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.Starting on Page 1. Th",2211,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.
Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $6.2 billion, EPS of $1.55 and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on $25.2 billion of revenue, a strong result this quarter, particularly given the backdrop. And while there are no significant items shown here on the page, our underlying performance was even stronger if you exclude the impact of other notable items, primarily credit, legal and tax, all of which you'll hear about as I go through the presentation. And that strength was driven by increased client trading activity across markets and an improvement in IB fees compared to the first quarter as well as strong core loan growth of 16%, reflecting good demand across both Consumer and Wholesale and record Consumer deposit growth, up $54 billion. 
Before I go through the results, let me spend a moment on 2 topics that are top of mind: first, an update on wholesale credit. You will see that the total wholesale credit costs this quarter were approximately $200 million. Within this, charge-offs of $150 million were principally driven by Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining, and those charge-offs were very substantially offset by reserve releases. So they were previously reserved, which means that underlying the net $50 million reserve build, we saw incremental reserve actions this quarter of about $200 million, principally one energy name downgraded in the CIB. 
Although the Oil & Gas sector remains stressed and reserves will continue to be idiosyncratic, overall trends have been somewhat positive with oil prices continuing to stabilize and firming sentiment in the sector improving access to capital markets. In addition, outside of energy, we still have not seen contagion or deterioration in our Wholesale or Consumer credit portfolios. 
Second, on Brexit, uncertainty running up to the referendum led to a risk-off environment. And following the decision, the markets were quite volatile as expected, and volumes were materially higher in the immediate aftermath. The market functioned quite well, absorbing the volatility. And despite the significant increases in volumes, our systems were stable, and we continued to support client activity with decent trading performance. 
With respect to next steps, as you know, the ultimate relationship between the U.K. and the European Union broadly and access to the single market and passporting, specifically, will likely unfold slowly and over an extended period, depending on when Article 50 is invoked. We continue to work on plans for the full range of outcomes, but we will be appropriately patient. 
The most important point is that we remain committed to fully supporting our European and U.K. clients across businesses, and we will be fully able to do this. And while executing against certain of these options would be complex, ultimately, we will protect the franchise and minimize any friction costs so that they will be manageable for the company. 
Moving on to Page 2. Revenue of $25.2 billion was up $700 million year-on-year on higher net interest income. For the full year, expect NII to be up more than the $2 billion we guided at Investor Day despite headwinds from a flatter yield curve, given that our sensitivity is significantly skewed to the front end of the curve and as industry deposit reprice to date has remained low, coupled with continued strong loan and deposit growth. 
Noninterest revenue was flat year-on-year with the increase in Markets revenues being offset by declines in IB fees as well as Asset Management. Adjusted expense of $14.1 billion was down $140 million, reflecting continued progress against our commitments. We still expect full year expense of $56 billion, plus or minus, as the second half of the year includes our expectation of an increase in the SEI surcharge in the third and fourth quarters. 
Moving on to capital on Page 3. The firm's advanced fully phased-in CET1 ratio was 11.9%, with standardized at 12.1%, both up about 15 basis points from the prior quarter. The improvement in both ratios was driven by net capital generation with RWA remaining relatively flat. Firm SLR remained flat to the prior quarter at 6.6% as capital generation was offset by balance sheet growth. 
This quarter, we returned $4.4 billion of net capital to shareholders, including $2.6 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.48 a share. Finally, we're pleased we did not receive an objection to our capital plan, and the board authorized gross repurchases of up to $10.6 billion. 
Moving on to Page 4 and Consumer & Community Banking. Consumer & Community Banking generated $2.7 billion of net income with an ROE of 20%, reflecting continued strength in business drivers. We had record deposit growth again this quarter, up 10% year-on-year. Average loans were up 11%, with core loans up 23%, driven by mortgage and Auto but with continued strength across all products. 
And we had record Business Banking loan originations of $2.2 billion, up 14% year-on-year and with a strong pipeline, up 17%. We added nearly 2 million households year-on-year, with an increase of 700,000 since last quarter, reflecting strong acquisition trends, including the launch of Freedom Unlimited. And finally, our active mobile customer base remains the largest among U.S. banks, up 18%. Revenue of $11.5 billion included some noncore items, which contributed a little under $200 million, principally a onetime gain on Visa Europe and negative mark to market on Square. Adjusted for this, revenue was up 2%. 
Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 3%, reflecting strong deposit and account growth. Mortgage revenue was up 5%, with rates remaining low, supporting production margins and on growth in NII as we added $14 billion of high-quality loans to our portfolio this quarter, partially offset by lower servicing revenue. 
Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto revenue was up but flat if you exclude the noncore items I mentioned, with growth in Card and Auto offsetting the impact of card renegotiations. Expense was down 3%, driven by lower legal expense and continued progress against our efficiency commitment, allowing us to fund the incremental marketing and Auto lease growth that we talked about at Investor Day. 
Finally, credit trends across the Consumer businesses continue to be favorable, with charge-offs in card trending up slightly. Over the last 2, 3 years, we have responsibly expanded our credit box in card in the prime and near-prime space. As these vintages season, we would naturally expect a higher loss rate, and performance is in line with our expectation. These loans are coming on at ROEs higher than the portfolio average. So as the mix of our portfolio increasingly reflects these newer vintages, we do expect loss rates to continue to trend up but to do so slowly, and as such, we built $250 million of reserves this quarter. 
Moving to Auto credit. Competitive pressures have caused some lenders to take more layered risk. We have maintained our underwriting discipline with average FICO scores and LTVs better than the industry and with a very sharp focus on avoiding risk layering. Our credit performance is in line with expectations, and we built $50 million in reserves this quarter, largely reflecting volume growth. Against this reserve build, we saw releases of $125 million, principally driven by mortgage. 
Turning to Page 5 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $9.2 billion and an ROE of 15%. In banking, IB revenue was $1.5 billion, down 15% in a market down 18%, largely driven by lower equity underwriting fees. We maintained share and ranked #1 in Global IB fees, ranking #1 in North America and EMEA. Advisory fees were flat versus a wallet that declined 15%. This quarter, we ranked #2 globally and grew share by 50 basis points. 
In equity underwriting, global issuance improved after a weak first quarter but was down from a strong quarter last year, with fees down 37% in a market down 42%. We continued to rank #1 globally, growing share by 30 basis points, and we ranked #1 in every product category for the first half of this year. Net underwriting fees were down 2% from a strong prior year, largely in line with the market, which was down 4%, and we ranked #2 globally. 
Moving on to the outlook for fees. Given the decline in M&A volumes, lower wallet is expected in the second half of 2016. We expect to see positive momentum in ECM as the new issuance market continues to improve, and we expect DCM to be broadly in line with the first half, reflecting robust high-grade bond issuance, offset by lower acquisition finance. 
Lending revenue of $277 million was down 8%, reflecting mark-to-market losses on hedges of accrual loans. Markets revenue of $5.6 billion was up 23% year-on-year. As I mentioned at the beginning, the Brexit vote triggered a spike in volatility and volumes across asset classes. We were able to meet our clients' needs, execute their transactions and provide liquidity. 
Fixed Income revenue of $4 billion was up 35% versus a weak second quarter last year. The positive momentum that we saw in March continued into the second quarter, with strong performance in Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets on higher client flows. And performance also improved in Credit and Securitized Products as client risk appetite recovered in a more stable environment, driving increased primary and secondary market activity. 
Equities revenue was $1.6 billion, up 2% compared to a strong second quarter last year. With respect to the third [ph] quarter, client activity is returning to more normal levels, and trading performance so far has been fine. Credit costs of $235 million were driven by a reserve build for Oil & Gas. And finally, expense of $5.1 billion was down 1% year-on-year, with a comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter of 30%. 
Moving on to Page 6 and Commercial Banking. Overall, a solid quarter for Commercial Banking, with net income of nearly $700 million on revenue of $1.8 billion and an ROE of 16%. IB revenue rebounded from the first quarter. It was up 23% sequentially and flat year-on-year, and we continue to see strong momentum in loan growth, with average loan balances up 13% year-on-year. 
Commercial Real Estate loans grew 18%, reflecting continued outperformance in both commercial term lending and real estate banking, and C&I loans were up 9% on increased origination activity in both Corporate Client Banking and middle market. Revenue was up 4% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit NII and loan growth, and expense of $731 million was up 4%, reflecting continued investment in bankers and technology. Finally, credit performance continues to be in line with our expectations, with net charge-offs of 14 basis points, driven by Oil & Gas but almost fully reserved, and outside of energy, credit performance continues to be strong. 
Moving on to Page 7 and Asset Management. Asset Management reported net income of $521 million, with a 29% pretax margin and an ROE of 22%. Revenue of $2.9 billion was down 7% year-on-year as we continue to feel the impact of weaker markets, lower performance fees and lower brokerage activity.  Expense of $2.1 billion was down 13% year-on-year, largely driven by lower legal expense and recall that the prior year included a noncore loss. 
AUM of $1.7 trillion and client assets of $2.3 trillion were both up 1% sequentially and down 5% and 3% year-on-year, respectively. We had positive long-term flows of $3 billion as we continued to see strong net inflows into our fixed income products, with equity market weakness and volatility causing clients to derisk, resulting in outflows in equity and multi-asset. Our long-term investment performance remained good, with 81% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over 5 years. Lastly, we had record loan balances of $112 billion, up 4% year-on-year, driven by mortgage, up 20%. 
Turning to Page 8 and Corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $166 million, which included 2 notable items. There was a net legal benefit reflecting some favorable developments in the quarter, offset by a number of tax items, including additions to tax reserves for developments relating to open audit periods. As a result of the tax items, our managed tax rate for the quarter was 39%. Adjusted, it would have been closer to 36%. 
Now turning to Page 9 and moving on to the outlook. To reiterate, our firm-wide guidance for the full year on each of revenues, expenses and charge-offs at this point is largely unchanged, obviously market dependent. So to wrap up, a strong quarter, reflecting our leadership position and the benefits of our diversified franchise, with the Consumer businesses firing on all cylinders and with robust loan growth across all businesses. We had a good result in Markets, continuing to demonstrate our ability to support clients no matter the environment.

We're replacing them all of the time over the course of the last couple of years since the end of 2013. We made some changes to our credit box and our credit risk policies very, very thoughtfully, and we've been monitoring them very closely. And what we're seeing in terms of the loss rates and the seasoning of them is fully in line with our expectations, and these loans are coming on at higher risk-adjusted margins. So the ROEs are at or above the portfolio ROEs. So nothing that would speak to anything other than our full expectation for our credit risk appetite. And with respect to Auto, not to speak for others, but obviously, when you look at lower FICO scores and higher LTVs and longer term on top of each other in an environment where you've already seen used car prices soften some and they're likely to continue to do so, it's something to watch. And so we've been very, very thoughtful about that not just today but as we've been going through the cycle. And not only on an absolute basis do we compare favorably in terms of LTVs and FICO scores and even terms to the industry, but we've been very, very careful in -- and low percentage of subprime origination, very, very careful about looking at those layered risks. So nothing in our -- and remember, for Auto this year, I think the charge-off rate's going to be sort of 40-ish basis points compared to a long-run average of more like 60. So we're sort of reverting to a more normal level, if nothing else. And used car prices will, ultimately, come down, and we're being thoughtful about that."

So I would honestly characterize it, not to sort of underplay it, as quarter-over-quarter noise. Looking forward -- and so when you look at our NIM, you have NII flat. You have the balance sheet growing, as we expected, both on loans and trading assets. So NIM just naturally is down a few basis points, but we would be looking for NII to be up slightly in the third and fourth quarter and for our NIM to be relatively stable."

So there'll be some of that, but I would characterize it as modest. And then as these vintages continue to season, we've been experiencing very, very low loss rates, circa 2.5%. They will trend up slightly, and so there will be a little bit of rates impact, too, but, again, as I say, with very accretive ROEs. So I would look forward and expect there to be some reserve adds over the course of the next several quarters on a combination of those factors but for all the right reasons.

Not to say that, that means that these results are more normal, but I would say if you look at the 3 years and look at the PPNR results now, it's more consistent with the sort of portfolio risks, the revenue generation we would expect. And you can see that because it's much more consistent with our results. So I don't have insights that I can share with you, specifically, to try and reconcile the Fed's results year-on-year, nor do we really try to do that. You're right, operational risk is likely a piece of it, and that was disclosed in that information. So I would just say there can be volatility, but I feel like this is not an unreasonable place to think that the PPNR would start. And it's consistent, as you can see, relatively speaking, with what we calculated. In respect to what that means for what's most binding, what it does mean is, if you look at the analysis that we've done a couple of years in a row now where we've said, using the CCAR results from the Fed, what would that imply our CET1 ratio would need to be to pass, it had previously been a little less than 11%. With the improved PPNR and, therefore, the improved results, at this point, it would be a little less than 10%. So in that context, as we sort of look forward sometime in the near future, maybe in the third quarter, to getting the sort of 2017 CCAR changes in proposed form, hopefully, it will alleviate, to a degree, a little bit of that pressure. But I still would suggest to you, as we said in Investor Day, that CCAR may, depending on how the G-SIB surcharge is included in the minimum, may become binding, if not likely, will become binding. And so we'll continue to take that into consideration as we go forward, and we are already taking it into consideration as we think about optimizing against the multiple binding constraints we have."

I mean -- so I'm going to start with a couple of general comments, which is we talked about the fact that the charge-offs that we've experienced in the quarter were credits that we had previously reserved for. So we're at the point now where at least, as a sort of basic matter, as we're experiencing charge-offs, we feel like we're in a reasonably good reserve position, notwithstanding that, idiosyncratically, there may be additional adds. I mean what we would need to see is continued firming of sentiment in the sector, continued access to capital market to allow companies to repair their balance sheets and continued stabilization, if not improvement in oil and gas prices. And so everything is constructive on that path, but it needs to continue along the same path. And yes, we are growing our portfolio. And so even if it were not for energy, we would, all other things equal, be adding to reserves, but there are also time to pay paydown, lots of other puts and takes, too."

Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. 
Starting on Page 1 and taking a look at the quarter. We had strong performance in each of our businesses, despite the continuation of reasonably challenging conditions. And bringing it all together, this quarter's result was clean with no significant items and with the firm reporting net income of $6.3 billion, EPS of $1.58 and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on 28 -- $25.5 billion of revenue. 
Highlights of the quarter include: the highest reported revenue for a third quarter in the CIB, with IBCs up 15% and Markets revenues up 33%, with strong performance across the board; robust core loan growth for the company of 15% on the back of sustained demand across businesses and the continuation of strong credit performance, including a net release for Oil & Gas. Card sales are back to double-digit growth year-on-year, and we saw a strong positive market reaction to new proprietary products. And finally, we had record consumer deposit growth, up 11%. 
Before I move on, we recently submitted our 2016 resolution filing. The board and management believe that we submitted a credible plan and more than met the requirement for the October submission. We have tremendous effort across the company involving all businesses and functions, and we took many significant actions, perhaps most notably, improving the firm's overall liquidity and prepositioning our material legal entities for both liquidity and capital. We determined this is in the best interest of the company, albeit at some cost. And we took many other important actions, which hopefully you've had a chance to review in our public filings. 
Moving back to the quarter and moving on to Page 2. Revenue of $25.5 billion was up $2 billion year-on-year or up 8%. On the back of continued strong growth in core loans, net interest income was up $700 million and is trending for the full year to be above the $2.5 billion guided last quarter. Noninterest revenue was up $1.3 billion, driven by strong performance in the CIB. 
Adjusted expense of $14.5 billion was up $500 million both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by 2 notable expense items in Consumer, which I'll talk about later; as well as the increase in FDIC surcharge, which took effect this quarter; and some higher marketing expense. Credit cost of $1.3 billion in the quarter includes consumer reserve builds of $225 million, primarily card. But against that, we have a net reserve release in Wholesale for Oil & Gas of about $50 million. 
So as I said, net income was $6.3 billion. And while down 8% year-on-year, you will recall that there were a number of significant items in last year's results, most notably significant tax benefits. If you adjust for tax, legal expense and credit reserves, net income is up over $800 million year-on-year. 
Dealing with Oil & Gas here. We're encouraged by how quickly investor sentiment and risk appetite for the sector returned as the outlook for both oil and gas prices continue to improve. Capital markets opened more broadly to these clients, and we experienced low withdrawals against our facilities than previously anticipated. So a combination of pay downs, opportunistic loan sales and select upgrades more than offset the impact of downgrades. If the environment remains broadly consistent with today, we would not expect further significant builds in the fourth quarter for energy. 
Moving to Page 3 and capital. Key takeaways from this page: capital and leverage ratios were broadly flat quarter-on-quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.9% as net capital generation was offset by strong loan and commitment growth. Our spot balance sheet closed a little over $2.5 trillion, principally a result of strong deposit growth as well as liability actions taken to raise liquidity in the context of resolution, which also drove up liquid assets. While HQLA was up $23 billion quarter-on-quarter, our liquid assets were up significantly more than that as excess liquidity at the bank is not included in reported HQLA. Finally, we returned $3.8 billion of net capital to shareholders, including $2.1 billion of net repurchases and common dividend of $0.48 a share. 
Moving on to Page 4 and Consumer & Community Banking. Consumer & Community Banking generated $2.2 billion of net income and an ROE of 16%. We continue to experience record deposit growth, more than twice the industry average, up 11% year-on-year. More than half of that growth is from existing customers. And based on the FDIC survey for 2016, we were #1 in absolute growth and grew share in each of our top 30 markets. 
Core loan growth remained strong at 19%. And while it's primarily driven by mortgage, we also saw 14% growth in auto, 9% in Business Banking and 7% in card loans. Card new account originations were up 35% with strong demand for Sapphire Reserve and Freedom Unlimited and with more than 3/4 of new accounts being opened through digital channels. Card sales volume was up double digits this quarter, and we expect share gains to accelerate. So to close on drivers, we saw merchant processing volumes up 13% and our active mobile customer base up 17%. 
Revenue of $11.3 billion was up 4% year-on-year. Consumer & Business Banking revenue was also up 4% on the back of strong deposit growth. Mortgage revenue was up 21% on higher MSR risk management but also on higher production margins and growth in NII as we continue to add high-quality loans to our portfolio.  Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto revenue was down 1% as the strong momentum in card and Auto volumes and balanced growth was offset by higher card origination costs and the remaining impact of co-brand renegotiations. And while the new account origination costs do cause a near-term drag on revenues, it's a high-class problem to have as we expect these accounts will be strongly accretive over time. Looking forward, assuming strong demand for Sapphire Reserve through the fourth quarter, we would expect revenue for CCSA to be down about $200 million quarter-on-quarter on higher acquisition costs, but it would clearly be dependent on the number of new accounts originated. 
Expense of $6.5 billion is up year-on-year, as I said, driven by 2 notable items totaling $175 million as well as the increased FDIC surcharge. The first item relates to liabilities assumed for a merchant in bankruptcy, and the second is a modest increase in reserves for mortgage servicing. Underlying this expense performance is an incremental investment of $250 million in marketing and auto lease growth, which is in line with Investor Day guidance and largely self-funded with expense efficiency. 
Finally, the credit environment remains favorable. In card, we built $200 million of reserves this quarter, reflecting growth in the portfolio, including newer vintages, which have a higher loss rates than the portfolio average, consistent with our discussion during the second quarter and consistent with how we underwrite the loans. And in auto, we built $25 million of reserves on the back of high-quality loan growth. 
Now turning to Page 5 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. Total revenue for CIB of $9.5 billion, up 16% year-on-year, was the best reported performance for a third quarter and included the highest IBCs on record for a third quarter, too, up 15%; with strong Markets performance across the board, revenues up 33%. Expense was down 20% year-on-year on lower legal costs but also with strong expense discipline more broadly. Coupled with solid credit performance, including a modest reserve build for Oil & Gas here, the business delivered a pretty clean $2.9 billion of net income and a 17% ROE this quarter. 
Diving deeper. IB revenue of $1.7 billion was up 14% year-on-year with strong performance across products. We ranked #1 in global IBCs, maintaining share on a year-to-date basis, and ranked #1 in North America and EMEA. Advisory fees were up 8% year-on-year, and we continue to rank #2 globally and have done more deals than anyone else so far this year. In equity underwriting, fees were up 38% year-on-year. With a stable market backdrop and strong investor demand, issuance was up across products and particularly in IPOs. We ranked #1 in wallet globally and in North America and EMEA, and we also ranked #1 on a number of deals basis for overall ECMs and IPOs. 
Debt underwriting had the highest third quarter on record with strong market-wide bond issuance, record high-grade bond supply in August and yields near record lows. Fees were up 12% from a high watermark last year, and we ranked #1. In terms of outlook, given the strength this quarter, we expect IBCs to be down in the fourth quarter sequentially but relatively flat year-on-year. 
Markets revenue of $5.7 billion was up 33% year-on-year. Clients were active, and risk management conditions were favorable. Fixed income revenue was up 48% compared to a weaker third quarter last year. Rates was a standout in terms of performance this quarter as market stays active post Brexit, with good client flow as well as anticipation of and uncertainty around central bank actions. 
Currencies & Emerging Markets matched a very strong third quarter last year but slowed down slightly. And Credit and Securitized Products came back from a weak prior period, with a recovery in the energy sector and central bank actions motivating clients to put money to work, producing a much more constructive market-making and new issuance environment, resulting in a particularly strong quarter. 
Equities revenue was up 1% compared to a strong third quarter last year with Asia matching last year's strong performance and strength in North America flow derivatives offsetting weakness in cash volumes. Taking Treasury Services and Securities Services revenues together, each for over $900 million, with strong forward pipelines and leverage to higher rates. 
Moving on to Page 6 and Commercial Banking. Commercial Banking reported record net income of $778 million on revenue of $1.9 billion and an ROE of 18%. Revenue was up 14% year-on-year driven by a trifecta of NII on loan growth, higher deposit spreads as well as higher IB revenues. Loan growth continues to be strong across both C&I and CRE, outperforming the industry. C&I loans were up 10% year-on-year despite competition for quality loans as the investments that we've been making this year are delivering results. We've added over 100 net new bankers, opened 7 new offices and further built out our specialized industry coverage, and we've added nearly 600 new relationships in middle market this year.  
CRE loans grew 19%, reflecting strong originations in both Commercial Term Lending and Real Estate Banking. We're also seeing stable to improving new loan spreads. IB revenue was up 57%, in part driven by a few large transactions but bringing year-to-date IB revenues closer to flat versus last year, which is a strong performance. Expense growth of 4% is driven by our investments. And as I said, these investments are already paying off. 
Finally, credit performance remains strong with a net charge-off rate of 10 basis points, roughly half of which was driven by Oil & Gas. In addition, you see further reserve releases for Oil & Gas here, as I mentioned earlier. Outside of energy, credit quality is good, and the commercial real estate portfolio had no net charge-offs during the quarter. 
Leaving the Commercial Bank and moving on to Asset Management on Page 7. Asset Management reported net income of $557 million with a 29% pretax margin and an ROE of 24%. Revenue of $3 billion was up 5% year-on-year, driven primarily by strong banking results on higher loan and deposit spreads. Expense of $2.1 billion was up slightly year-on-year and up 2% sequentially on higher incentive compensation. We saw positive long-term flows of $19 billion with strength in multi-asset, including the benefit of a large mandate this quarter; as well as inflows in alternative and fixed income, partially offset by outflows in equity products. In addition, we were the beneficiaries of $22 billion of liquidity flows this quarter, capturing more than our share of money in motion, given money market reform. 
AUM grew 4% and overall client assets, 5% to $1.8 trillion and $2.4 trillion, respectively, driven by market as well as long-term flows. Our long-term investment performance remains solid with 80% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over 5 years. Lastly, we have record loan balances of $114 billion, up 5% year-on-year, driven by mortgage. 
Skipping over Page 8 and Corporate the results were very close to home and no significant items to highlight. 
Returning to Page 9 and the outlook. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, expect net interest income to be up modestly quarter-on-quarter on continued strength in loan growth, even as we digest incremental cost of resolution-based liquidity actions, which will be fully in our run rate in the fourth quarter. Expect noninterest revenue to be down quarter-on-quarter based upon our current outlook for IBCs and assuming flat year-on-year markets revenues, also including higher card acquisition costs and seasonally lower mortgages. All else equal, expect NIR to come in at $50.5 billion, plus or minus, for the full year, market dependent. Finally, expect adjusted expense in the fourth quarter to be flat year-on-year, bringing full year expense in at approximately $56 billion, consistent with our guidance and self-funding the consumer items I've mentioned. 
So to wrap up, strong performance whichever way you look at it this quarter. We're continuing to demonstrate that our operating model and our platform is working for our clients, that our scale across gives us operating leverage and that our investments through time are paying off. And while as a company we are proud of this quarter's performance, and in particular proud of the growth in the underlying business drivers, we take a long-term, disciplined view and remain focused on delivering excellent customer experience, strong execution, particularly in risk management and expenses so that we can continue to deliver best-in-class performance.

So in that sense, because of the offset, because of the lack of balance sheet growth, lack of RWA growth and the curtailment of capital distributions, we've actually ended up in a place where we look to be approximately equally bound based some last year's test by both of those 2 measures, which is a space we played in for a while. We've been -- as I've talked about before, we've been bound by many constraints, somewhat equally over a period of time, and striving to sort of operate within that constraint and maximize shareholder value. I think the things we don't know, obviously how funding liquidity shock will be incorporated. And in any case, this is not for the 2017 CCAR cycle. So it's a whole cycle away from now.

I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation.

Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. 
Starting on Page 1 and taking a look at the quarter. We had strong performance in each of our businesses, despite the continuation of reasonably challenging conditions. And bringing it all together, this quarter's result was clean with no significant items and with the firm reporting net income of $6.3 billion, EPS of $1.58 and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on 28 -- $25.5 billion of revenue. 
Highlights of the quarter include: the highest reported revenue for a third quarter in the CIB, with IBCs up 15% and Markets revenues up 33%, with strong performance across the board; robust core loan growth for the company of 15% on the back of sustained demand across businesses and the continuation of strong credit performance, including a net release for Oil & Gas. Card sales are back to double-digit growth year-on-year, and we saw a strong positive market reaction to new proprietary products. And finally, we had record consumer deposit growth, up 11%. 
Before I move on, we recently submitted our 2016 resolution filing. The board and management believe that we submitted a credible plan and more than met the requirement for the October submission. We have tremendous effort across the company involving all businesses and functions, and we took many significant actions, perhaps most notably, improving the firm's overall liquidity and prepositioning our material legal entities for both liquidity and capital. We determined this is in the best interest of the company, albeit at some cost. And we took many other important actions, which hopefully you've had a chance to review in our public filings. 
Moving back to the quarter and moving on to Page 2. Revenue of $25.5 billion was up $2 billion year-on-year or up 8%. On the back of continued strong growth in core loans, net interest income was up $700 million and is trending for the full year to be above the $2.5 billion guided last quarter. Noninterest revenue was up $1.3 billion, driven by strong performance in the CIB. 
Adjusted expense of $14.5 billion was up $500 million both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by 2 notable expense items in Consumer, which I'll talk about later; as well as the increase in FDIC surcharge, which took effect this quarter; and some higher marketing expense. Credit cost of $1.3 billion in the quarter includes consumer reserve builds of $225 million, primarily card. But against that, we have a net reserve release in Wholesale for Oil & Gas of about $50 million. 
So as I said, net income was $6.3 billion. And while down 8% year-on-year, you will recall that there were a number of significant items in last year's results, most notably significant tax benefits. If you adjust for tax, legal expense and credit reserves, net income is up over $800 million year-on-year. 
Dealing with Oil & Gas here. We're encouraged by how quickly investor sentiment and risk appetite for the sector returned as the outlook for both oil and gas prices continue to improve. Capital markets opened more broadly to these clients, and we experienced low withdrawals against our facilities than previously anticipated. So a combination of pay downs, opportunistic loan sales and select upgrades more than offset the impact of downgrades. If the environment remains broadly consistent with today, we would not expect further significant builds in the fourth quarter for energy. 
Moving to Page 3 and capital. Key takeaways from this page: capital and leverage ratios were broadly flat quarter-on-quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.9% as net capital generation was offset by strong loan and commitment growth. Our spot balance sheet closed a little over $2.5 trillion, principally a result of strong deposit growth as well as liability actions taken to raise liquidity in the context of resolution, which also drove up liquid assets. While HQLA was up $23 billion quarter-on-quarter, our liquid assets were up significantly more than that as excess liquidity at the bank is not included in reported HQLA. Finally, we returned $3.8 billion of net capital to shareholders, including $2.1 billion of net repurchases and common dividend of $0.48 a share. 
Moving on to Page 4 and Consumer & Community Banking. Consumer & Community Banking generated $2.2 billion of net income and an ROE of 16%. We continue to experience record deposit growth, more than twice the industry average, up 11% year-on-year. More than half of that growth is from existing customers. And based on the FDIC survey for 2016, we were #1 in absolute growth and grew share in each of our top 30 markets. 
Core loan growth remained strong at 19%. And while it's primarily driven by mortgage, we also saw 14% growth in auto, 9% in Business Banking and 7% in card loans. Card new account originations were up 35% with strong demand for Sapphire Reserve and Freedom Unlimited and with more than 3/4 of new accounts being opened through digital channels. Card sales volume was up double digits this quarter, and we expect share gains to accelerate. So to close on drivers, we saw merchant processing volumes up 13% and our active mobile customer base up 17%. 
Revenue of $11.3 billion was up 4% year-on-year. Consumer & Business Banking revenue was also up 4% on the back of strong deposit growth. Mortgage revenue was up 21% on higher MSR risk management but also on higher production margins and growth in NII as we continue to add high-quality loans to our portfolio.  Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto revenue was down 1% as the strong momentum in card and Auto volumes and balanced growth was offset by higher card origination costs and the remaining impact of co-brand renegotiations. And while the new account origination costs do cause a near-term drag on revenues, it's a high-class problem to have as we expect these accounts will be strongly accretive over time. Looking forward, assuming strong demand for Sapphire Reserve through the fourth quarter, we would expect revenue for CCSA to be down about $200 million quarter-on-quarter on higher acquisition costs, but it would clearly be dependent on the number of new accounts originated. 
Expense of $6.5 billion is up year-on-year, as I said, driven by 2 notable items totaling $175 million as well as the increased FDIC surcharge. The first item relates to liabilities assumed for a merchant in bankruptcy, and the second is a modest increase in reserves for mortgage servicing. Underlying this expense performance is an incremental investment of $250 million in marketing and auto lease growth, which is in line with Investor Day guidance and largely self-funded with expense efficiency. 
Finally, the credit environment remains favorable. In card, we built $200 million of reserves this quarter, reflecting growth in the portfolio, including newer vintages, which have a higher loss rates than the portfolio average, consistent with our discussion during the second quarter and consistent with how we underwrite the loans. And in auto, we built $25 million of reserves on the back of high-quality loan growth. 
Now turning to Page 5 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. Total revenue for CIB of $9.5 billion, up 16% year-on-year, was the best reported performance for a third quarter and included the highest IBCs on record for a third quarter, too, up 15%; with strong Markets performance across the board, revenues up 33%. Expense was down 20% year-on-year on lower legal costs but also with strong expense discipline more broadly. Coupled with solid credit performance, including a modest reserve build for Oil & Gas here, the business delivered a pretty clean $2.9 billion of net income and a 17% ROE this quarter. 
Diving deeper. IB revenue of $1.7 billion was up 14% year-on-year with strong performance across products. We ranked #1 in global IBCs, maintaining share on a year-to-date basis, and ranked #1 in North America and EMEA. Advisory fees were up 8% year-on-year, and we continue to rank #2 globally and have done more deals than anyone else so far this year. In equity underwriting, fees were up 38% year-on-year. With a stable market backdrop and strong investor demand, issuance was up across products and particularly in IPOs. We ranked #1 in wallet globally and in North America and EMEA, and we also ranked #1 on a number of deals basis for overall ECMs and IPOs. 
Debt underwriting had the highest third quarter on record with strong market-wide bond issuance, record high-grade bond supply in August and yields near record lows. Fees were up 12% from a high watermark last year, and we ranked #1. In terms of outlook, given the strength this quarter, we expect IBCs to be down in the fourth quarter sequentially but relatively flat year-on-year. 
Markets revenue of $5.7 billion was up 33% year-on-year. Clients were active, and risk management conditions were favorable. Fixed income revenue was up 48% compared to a weaker third quarter last year. Rates was a standout in terms of performance this quarter as market stays active post Brexit, with good client flow as well as anticipation of and uncertainty around central bank actions. 
Currencies & Emerging Markets matched a very strong third quarter last year but slowed down slightly. And Credit and Securitized Products came back from a weak prior period, with a recovery in the energy sector and central bank actions motivating clients to put money to work, producing a much more constructive market-making and new issuance environment, resulting in a particularly strong quarter. 
Equities revenue was up 1% compared to a strong third quarter last year with Asia matching last year's strong performance and strength in North America flow derivatives offsetting weakness in cash volumes. Taking Treasury Services and Securities Services revenues together, each for over $900 million, with strong forward pipelines and leverage to higher rates. 
Moving on to Page 6 and Commercial Banking. Commercial Banking reported record net income of $778 million on revenue of $1.9 billion and an ROE of 18%. Revenue was up 14% year-on-year driven by a trifecta of NII on loan growth, higher deposit spreads as well as higher IB revenues. Loan growth continues to be strong across both C&I and CRE, outperforming the industry. C&I loans were up 10% year-on-year despite competition for quality loans as the investments that we've been making this year are delivering results. We've added over 100 net new bankers, opened 7 new offices and further built out our specialized industry coverage, and we've added nearly 600 new relationships in middle market this year.  
CRE loans grew 19%, reflecting strong originations in both Commercial Term Lending and Real Estate Banking. We're also seeing stable to improving new loan spreads. IB revenue was up 57%, in part driven by a few large transactions but bringing year-to-date IB revenues closer to flat versus last year, which is a strong performance. Expense growth of 4% is driven by our investments. And as I said, these investments are already paying off. 
Finally, credit performance remains strong with a net charge-off rate of 10 basis points, roughly half of which was driven by Oil & Gas. In addition, you see further reserve releases for Oil & Gas here, as I mentioned earlier. Outside of energy, credit quality is good, and the commercial real estate portfolio had no net charge-offs during the quarter. 
Leaving the Commercial Bank and moving on to Asset Management on Page 7. Asset Management reported net income of $557 million with a 29% pretax margin and an ROE of 24%. Revenue of $3 billion was up 5% year-on-year, driven primarily by strong banking results on higher loan and deposit spreads. Expense of $2.1 billion was up slightly year-on-year and up 2% sequentially on higher incentive compensation. We saw positive long-term flows of $19 billion with strength in multi-asset, including the benefit of a large mandate this quarter; as well as inflows in alternative and fixed income, partially offset by outflows in equity products. In addition, we were the beneficiaries of $22 billion of liquidity flows this quarter, capturing more than our share of money in motion, given money market reform. 
AUM grew 4% and overall client assets, 5% to $1.8 trillion and $2.4 trillion, respectively, driven by market as well as long-term flows. Our long-term investment performance remains solid with 80% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over 5 years. Lastly, we have record loan balances of $114 billion, up 5% year-on-year, driven by mortgage. Skipping over Page 8 and Corporate, where the results were very close to home and where there are no significant items to highlight. 
So turning to Page 9 and the outlook. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, expect net interest income to be up modestly quarter-on-quarter on continued strength in loan growth even as we digest the incremental cost of resolution-based liquidity actions, which will be fully in our run rate in the fourth quarter. Expect noninterest revenue to be down quarter-on-quarter based upon our current outlook for IBCs and assuming flat year-on-year markets revenues, also including higher card acquisition costs and seasonally lower mortgages. All else equal, expect NIR to come in at $50.5 billion plus or minus for the full year, market dependent. Finally, expect adjusted expense in the fourth quarter to be flat year-on-year, bringing full year expense in at approximately $56 billion, consistent with our guidance and self-funding the consumer items I mentioned. 
So to wrap up, strong performance whichever way you look at it this quarter. We're continuing to demonstrate that our operating model and our platform is working for our clients, that our scale across businesses gives us operating leverage and that our investments through time are paying off. And while, as a company, we are proud of this quarter's performance and, in particular, proud of the growth in the underlying business drivers, we take a long-term, disciplined view and remain focused on delivering excellent customer experience, strong execution, particularly in risk management and expenses so that we can continue to deliver best-in-class performance. 
With that, operator, please open up the line, and we can take questions."

The first is -- that I would say, that the industry generally had a pretty weak third quarter last year. And so when you think about the year-over-year comparison, we are a little flattered by last year's performance, not necessarily more so than our peers, but nevertheless, we are. And then we talked about the fact that this quarter, the conditions were relatively favorable broadly. And compare and contrast that to last year, where there were pockets of activity and client flow but there were also pockets where people were really sitting on their hands and not transacting. So I think client flow, quite broadly, across the environment would characterize the quarter. In terms of competitive performance, I would say it feels like we did well. Obviously, we're the first to report, pop in the the city [ph] this morning. It feels like we did relatively well, so we may have gained some share.

I mean, partly because, obviously,  our 250-ish basis points, I think we could call that pretty low historically, but also because, over the course of the last couple of years, we have been changing the mix of our originations a bit to the prime, near-prime space. Still completely within our credit risk appetite and at risk adjusted margins that are better than the portfolio average. So we're getting paid for that, so we're doing it within our risk appetite, doing it judiciously. But as a result, as those vintages become a higher percentage of our overall population, they will have a gentle upward pressure on the charge-off rate. So what we're seeing in terms of the delinquency uptick and the charge-off, a gradual increase is completely in line with how we underwrote those loans and our expectations. And so as you look forward, for us, over the course of the next several quarters, we would expect those phenomena to generally continue, again, slowly. We're growing our portfolio. We're going to see the seasoning of those vintages. As the mix increases and as they become more seasoned cause us to build reserves but for the right reasons."

And -- but our objectives will remain consistent with those that we stated previously, which is we continue to try and become more efficient across our businesses. As you know, we're at the tail end but not finished on a couple of large expense programs in our largest businesses so that we create capacity to be able to invest in the businesses broadly, whether that's in products, in marketing and investment in innovation, all of which we're doing as much as we can, as long as we do it well. And so it's going to come down to if we think we have investment opportunities that we can execute well that have an appropriate return, we would like to keep doing that. And in order to have the right to do it, we would like to become more and more efficient in our core business operations. So we haven't actually given guidance.

But based upon the speech, moving to a baseline minimum standard is more consistent with how we think about our capital management policy. And using the capital stack add up, using our G-SIBs for stress roll-down, actually you would come out with a sort of capital constraint under CCAR that's pretty much on top of our regulatory capital minimum. So in that sense, because of the offset, because of the lack of balance sheet growth, lack of RWA growth and the curtailment of capital distributions, we've actually ended up in a place where we look to be approximately equally bound based on last year's test by both of those 2 measures, which is a space we played in for a while. We've been -- as I talked about before, we've been bound by many constraints, somewhat equally, over a period of time and striving to sort of operate within that constraint and maximize shareholder value. I think the things we don't know, obviously, how funding or liquidity shock will be incorporated. And in any case, this is not for the 2017 CCAR cycle, so it's a whole cycle away from now. So we will be operating in 2017 under the same basic test construct as we have previously. And so I don't think it's a clear and present danger necessarily that we will be able to look at payout ratios that are above the top end of our range. Meanwhile, we are at the top end of our range now."

Good examples would be commercial loans on the asset side or long-term debt on the liability side, but our notional mismatch is not particularly big. And so as a consequence, the impact of LIBOR curve moves has been not very significant on our P&L. We wouldn't expect it to be. I will say that the LIBOR moves were one of the features that our rates business had a perspective around, and they got good client flow in and around that trade. And so it was one of the catalysts, one of many, but one of the catalysts that we point to in terms of the ability for rates to monetize flow as we had a lot of client flow around that conviction.

And we've been very, very focused on investing in customer experience, broadly defined, and have made great progress, I think, in doing that. And also, we had talked about the fact that what we are looking for very, very clearly is deep customer relationships, engaged customers. We want to be primary bank. We want to gather deeper share of wallet, so balances not necessarily products. And so again, we remember saying cross-sell is an outcome, it's not an objective. And that's certainly the philosophy with which we have designed our compensation and performance structures for the branches. And we review them regularly, at least annually, to make sure that they continue to be aligned with our objectives and, again, objectives about the engaged relationship with customers, good customer experience, in the right products, for the right reasons, the right way.

And obviously, even -- specifically for JPMorgan, if you look at our stress results calculated by the Fed over the course of the last 3 years, it's been reasonable volatility. And clearly, there's not -- it's not the case that we would expect it to be completely stable. I would not expect to see the same levels of volatility going forward as we've seen historically, as the test has, as you know, over time, occasionally included new, not insignificant features. And while that may continue to be the case, I would think that there'd be a bit more stability. But we haven't actually gone through and finalized our thinking about what the buffers would look like."

I just -- before I talk about the prioritization of capital distributions, I would just start by saying our capital management policies prior to this year's CCAR and this year's resolution had us making those actions regardless of whether they were allowed to be reflected in the test. And obviously, as part of the resolution planning, we have revised our policy to include more granular triggers. So our policies do, with some specificity, run pretty granularly through time, through a stress, speak to the sorts of actions that we would be leaning into and taking even if they don't get reflected in the test. With respect to the prioritization, look, the soft cap on dividends has been lifted. Dividends are ultimately still a part of the baseline minimum standard, so there will be constantly some natural constraint there. It hasn't changed at this point anyway. The board's determination -- or management's determination about the order of priority, we would like to continue to have the capacity to grow our dividends. And I think, even though there may be some natural constraints, I think it would be above 30%."

Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. 
Starting on Page 1 and taking a look at the quarter. We had strong performance in each of our businesses, despite the continuation of reasonably challenging conditions. And bringing it all together, this quarter's result was clean with no significant items and with the firm reporting net income of $6.3 billion, EPS of $1.58 and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on 28 -- $25.5 billion of revenue. 
Highlights of the quarter include: the highest reported revenue for a third quarter in the CIB, with IBCs up 15% and Markets revenues up 33%, with strong performance across the board; robust core loan growth for the company of 15% on the back of sustained demand across businesses and the continuation of strong credit performance, including a net release for Oil & Gas. Card sales are back to double-digit growth year-on-year, and we saw a strong positive market reaction to new proprietary products. And finally, we had record consumer deposit growth, up 11%. 
Before I move on, we recently submitted our 2016 resolution filing. The board and management believe that we submitted a credible plan and more than met the requirements for the October submission. We have tremendous effort across the company involving all businesses and functions, and we took many significant actions, perhaps most notably, improving the firm's overall liquidity and prepositioning our material legal entities for both liquidity and capital. We determined this is in the best interest of the company, albeit at some cost. And we took many other important actions, which hopefully you've had a chance to review in our public filings. 
Moving back to the quarter and moving on to Page 2. Revenue of $25.5 billion was up $2 billion year-on-year or up 8%. On the back of continued strong growth in core loans, net interest income was up $700 million and is trending for the full year to be above the $2.5 billion guided last quarter. Noninterest revenue was up $1.3 billion, driven by strong performance in the CIB. 
Adjusted expense of $14.5 billion was up $500 million both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by 2 notable expense items in Consumer, which I'll talk about later; as well as the increase in FDIC surcharge, which took effect this quarter; and some higher marketing expense. Credit cost of $1.3 billion in the quarter includes consumer reserve builds of $225 million, primarily card. But against that, we have a net reserve release in Wholesale for Oil & Gas of about $50 million. 
So as I said, net income was $6.3 billion. And while down 8% year-on-year, you will recall that there were a number of significant items in last year's results, most notably significant tax benefits. If you adjust for tax, legal expense and credit reserves, net income is up over $800 million year-on-year. 
Dealing with Oil & Gas here. We're encouraged by how quickly investor sentiment and risk appetite for the sector returned as the outlook for both oil and gas prices continue to improve. Capital markets opened more broadly to these clients, and we experienced lower draws against our facilities than previously anticipated. So a combination of pay downs, opportunistic loan sales and select upgrades more than offset the impact of downgrades. If the environment remains broadly consistent with today, we would not expect further significant builds in the fourth quarter for energy. 
Moving to Page 3 and capital. Key takeaways from this page: capital and leverage ratios were broadly flat quarter-on-quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.9% as net capital generation was offset by strong loan and commitment growth. Our spot balance sheet closed a little over $2.5 trillion, principally a result of strong deposit growth as well as liability actions taken to raise liquidity in the context of resolution, which also drove up liquid assets. While HQLA was up $23 billion quarter-on-quarter, our liquid assets were up significantly more than that as excess liquidity at the bank is not included in reported HQLA. Finally, we returned $3.8 billion of net capital to shareholders, including $2.1 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.48 a share. 
Moving on to Page 4 and Consumer & Community Banking. Consumer & Community Banking generated $2.2 billion of net income and an ROE of 16%. We continue to experience record deposit growth, more than twice the industry average, up 11% year-on-year. More than half of that growth is from existing customers. And based on the FDIC survey for 2016, we were #1 in absolute growth and grew share in each of our top 30 markets. 
Core loan growth remained strong at 19%. And while it's primarily driven by mortgage, we also saw 14% growth in Auto, 9% in Business Banking and 7% in card loans. Card new account originations were up 35% with strong demand for Sapphire Reserve and Freedom Unlimited and with more than 3/4 of new accounts being opened through digital channels. Card sales volume was up double digits this quarter, and we expect share gains to accelerate. So to close on drivers, we saw merchant processing volumes up 13% and our active mobile customer base up 17%. 
Revenue of $11.3 billion was up 4% year-on-year. Consumer & Business Banking revenue was also up 4% on the back of strong deposit growth. Mortgage revenue was up 21% on higher MSR risk management but also on higher production margins and growth in NII as we continue to add high-quality loans to our portfolio.  Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto revenue was down 1% as the strong momentum in card and Auto volumes and balance growth was offset by higher card origination costs and the remaining impact of co-brand renegotiations. And while the new account origination costs do cause a near-term drag on revenues, it's a high-class problem to have as we expect these accounts will be strongly accretive over time. Looking forward, assuming strong demand for Sapphire Reserve through the fourth quarter, we would expect revenue for CCSA to be down about $200 million quarter-on-quarter on higher acquisition costs, but it would clearly be dependent on the number of new accounts originated. 
Expense of $6.5 billion is up year-on-year, as I said, driven by 2 notable items totaling $175 million as well as the increased FDIC surcharge. The first item relates to liabilities assumed for a merchant in bankruptcy, and the second is a modest increase in reserves for mortgage servicing. Underlying this expense performance is an incremental investment of $250 million in marketing and auto lease growth, which is in line with Investor Day guidance and largely self-funded with expense efficiency. 
Finally, the credit environment remains favorable. In card, we built $200 million of reserves this quarter, reflecting growth in the portfolio, including newer vintages, which have a higher loss rate than the portfolio average, consistent with our discussion during the second quarter and consistent with how we underwrite the loans. And in auto, we built $25 million of reserves on the back of high-quality loan growth. 
Now turning to Page 5 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. Total revenue for CIB of $9.5 billion, up 16% year-on-year, was the best reported performance for a third quarter and included the highest IBCs on record for a third quarter, too, up 15%; with strong Markets performance across the board, revenues up 33%. Expense was down 20% year-on-year on lower legal costs but also with strong expense discipline more broadly. Coupled with solid credit performance, including a modest reserve build for Oil & Gas here, the business delivered a pretty clean $2.9 billion of net income and a 17% ROE this quarter. 
Diving deeper. IB revenue of $1.7 billion was up 14% year-on-year with strong performance across products. We ranked #1 in global IBCs, maintaining share on a year-to-date basis, and ranked #1 in North America and EMEA. Advisory fees were up 8% year-on-year, and we continue to rank #2 globally and have done more deals than anyone else so far this year. In equity underwriting, fees were up 38% year-on-year. With a stable market backdrop and strong investor demand, issuance was up across products and particularly in IPOs. We ranked #1 in wallet globally and in North America and EMEA, and we also ranked #1 on a number-of-deals basis for overall ECMs and IPOs. 
Debt underwriting had the highest third quarter on record with strong market-wide bond issuance, record high-grade bond supply in August and yields near record lows. Fees were up 12% from a high watermark last year, and we ranked #1. In terms of outlook, given the strength this quarter, we expect IBCs to be down in the fourth quarter sequentially but relatively flat year-on-year. 
Markets revenue of $5.7 billion was up 33% year-on-year. Clients were active, and risk management conditions were favorable. Fixed income revenue was up 48% compared to a weaker third quarter last year. Rates was a standout in terms of performance this quarter as markets stayed active post-Brexit with good client flow as well as anticipation of and uncertainty around central bank actions. 
Currencies & Emerging Markets matched a very strong third quarter last year but slowed down slightly. And Credit and Securitized Products came back from a weak prior period, with a recovery in the energy sector and central bank actions motivating clients to put money to work, producing a much more constructive market-making and new issuance environment, resulting in a particularly strong quarter. 
Equities revenue was up 1% compared to a strong third quarter last year, with Asia matching last year's strong performance and strength in North America flow derivatives offsetting weakness in cash volumes. Taking Treasury Services and Securities Services revenues together, each were over $900 million, with strong forward pipelines and levers to higher rates. 
Moving on to Page 6 and Commercial Banking. Commercial Banking reported record net income of $778 million on revenue of $1.9 billion and an ROE of 18%. Revenue was up 14% year-on-year driven by a trifecta of NII on loan growth, higher deposit spreads as well as higher IB revenues. Loan growth continues to be strong across both C&I and CRE, outperforming the industry. C&I loans were up 10% year-on-year despite competition for quality loans as the investments that we've been making this year are delivering results. We've added over 100 net new bankers, opened 7 new offices and further built out our specialized industry coverage, and we've added nearly 600 new relationships in middle market this year.  
CRE loans grew 19%, reflecting strong originations in both Commercial Term Lending and Real Estate Banking. We're also seeing stable to improving new loan spreads. IB revenue was up 57%, in part driven by a few large transactions but bringing year-to-date IB revenues closer to flat versus last year, which is a strong performance. Expense growth of 4% is driven by our investments. And as I said, these investments are already paying off. 
Finally, credit performance remains strong with a net charge-off rate of 10 basis points, roughly half of which was driven by Oil & Gas. In addition, you see further reserve releases for Oil & Gas here, as I mentioned earlier. Outside of energy, credit quality is good, and the commercial real estate portfolio had no net charge-offs during the quarter. 
Leaving the Commercial Bank and moving on to Asset Management on Page 7. Asset Management reported net income of $557 million with a 29% pretax margin and an ROE of 24%. Revenue of $3 billion was up 5% year-on-year, driven primarily by strong banking results on higher loan and deposit spreads. Expense of $2.1 billion was up slightly year-on-year and up 2% sequentially on higher incentive compensation. We saw positive long-term flows of $19 billion with strength in multi-asset, including the benefit of a large mandate this quarter; as well as inflows in alternative and fixed income, partially offset by outflows in equity products. In addition, we were the beneficiaries of $22 billion of liquidity flows this quarter, capturing more than our share of money in motion, given money market reform. 
AUM grew 4% and overall client assets, 5%, to $1.8 trillion and $2.4 trillion, respectively, driven by markets as well as long-term flows. Our long-term investment performance remains solid with 80% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over 5 years. Lastly, we have record loan balances of $114 billion, up 5% year-on-year, driven by mortgage. Skipping over Page 8 and Corporate, where the results were very close to home and where there are no significant items to highlight. 
So turning to Page 9 and the outlook. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, expect net interest income to be up modestly quarter-on-quarter on continued strength in loan growth even as we digest the incremental cost of resolution-based liquidity actions, which will be fully in our run rate in the fourth quarter. Expect noninterest revenue to be down quarter-on-quarter based upon our current outlook for IBCs and assuming flat year-on-year Markets revenues, also including higher card acquisition costs and seasonally lower mortgages. All else equal, expect NIR to come in at $50.5 billion plus or minus for the full year, market dependent. Finally, expect adjusted expense in the fourth quarter to be flat year-on-year, bringing full year expense in at approximately $56 billion, consistent with our guidance and self-funding the Consumer items I mentioned. 
So to wrap up, strong performance whichever way you look at it this quarter. We're continuing to demonstrate that our operating model and our platform is working for our clients, that our scale across businesses gives us operating leverage and that our investments through time are paying off. And while, as a company, we are proud of this quarter's performance and, in particular, proud of the growth in the underlying business drivers, we take a long-term, disciplined view and remain focused on delivering excellent customer experience, strong execution, particularly in risk management and expenses, so that we can continue to deliver best-in-class performance. 
With that, operator, please open up the line, and we can take questions."

Obviously, we're the first to report, apart from Citi this morning. It feels like we did relatively well, so we may have gained some share.

I mean, partly because, obviously, our 250-ish basis points, I think we could call that pretty low historically, but also because, over the course of the last couple of years, we have been changing the mix of our originations a bit to the prime, near-prime space. Still completely within our credit risk appetite and at risk-adjusted margins that are better than the portfolio average. So we're getting paid for that, so we're doing it within our risk appetite, doing it judiciously. But as a result, as those vintages become a higher percentage of our overall population, they will have a gentle upward pressure on the charge-off rate. So what we're seeing in terms of the delinquency uptick and the charge-offs, a gradual increase is completely in line with how we underwrote those loans and our expectations. And so as you look forward, for us, over the course of the next several quarters, we would expect those phenomena to generally continue, again, slowly. We're growing our portfolio. We're going to see the seasoning of those vintages, as the mix increases and as they become more seasoned, cause us to build reserves but for the right reasons."

But based upon the speech, moving to a baseline minimum standard is more consistent with how we think about our capital management policy. And using the capital stack add-up, using our G-SIB score and our stress draw-down, actually you would come out with a sort of capital constraint under CCAR that's pretty much on top of our regulatory capital minimum. So in that sense, because of the offset, because of the lack of balance sheet growth, lack of RWA growth and the curtailment of capital distributions, we've actually ended up in a place where we look to be approximately equally bound based on last year's test by both of those 2 measures, which is a space we played in for a while. We've been -- as I talked about before, we've been bound by many constraints somewhat equally over a period of time and striving to sort of operate within that constraint and maximize shareholder value. I think the things we don't know, obviously, how funding or liquidity shocks will be incorporated. And in any case, this is not for the 2017 CCAR cycle, so it's a whole cycle away from now. So we will be operating in 2017 under the same basic test construct as we have previously. And so I don't think it's a clear and present danger necessarily that we will be able to look at payout ratios that are above the top end of our range.

And so as a consequence, the impact of LIBOR curve moves has been not very significant on our P&L. We wouldn't expect it to be. I will say that the LIBOR moves were one of the features that our Rates business had a perspective around, and they got good client flow in and around that trade.

With respect to the prioritization, look, the soft cap on dividends has been lifted. Dividends are ultimately still a part of the baseline minimum standard, so there will be constantly some natural constraint there. It hasn't changed at this point anyway. The board's determination -- or management's determination about the order of priority, we would like to continue to have the capacity to grow our dividends.

Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. 
Starting on Page 1 and taking a look at the quarter. We had strong performance in each of our businesses, despite the continuation of reasonably challenging conditions. And bringing it all together, this quarter's result was clean with no significant items and with the firm reporting net income of $6.3 billion, EPS of $1.58 and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on 28 -- $25.5 billion of revenue. 
Highlights of the quarter include: the highest reported revenue for a third quarter in the CIB, with IBCs up 15% and Markets revenues up 33%, with strong performance across the board; robust core loan growth for the company of 15% on the back of sustained demand across businesses and the continuation of strong credit performance, including a net release for Oil & Gas. Card sales are back to double-digit growth year-on-year, and we saw a strong positive market reaction to new proprietary products. And finally, we had record consumer deposit growth, up 11%. 
Before I move on, we recently submitted our 2016 resolution filing. The board and management believe that we submitted a credible plan and more than met the requirements for the October submission. We have tremendous effort across the company involving all businesses and functions, and we took many significant actions, perhaps most notably, improving the firm's overall liquidity and prepositioning our material legal entities for both liquidity and capital. We determined this is in the best interest of the company, albeit at some cost. And we took many other important actions, which hopefully you've had a chance to review in our public filings. 
Moving back to the quarter and moving on to Page 2. Revenue of $25.5 billion was up $2 billion year-on-year or up 8%. On the back of continued strong growth in core loans, net interest income was up $700 million and is trending for the full year to be above the $2.5 billion guided last quarter. Noninterest revenue was up $1.3 billion, driven by strong performance in the CIB. 
Adjusted expense of $14.5 billion was up $500 million both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by 2 notable expense items in Consumer, which I'll talk about later; as well as the increase in FDIC surcharge, which took effect this quarter; and some higher marketing expense. Credit cost of $1.3 billion in the quarter includes consumer reserve builds of $225 million, primarily card. But against that, we have a net reserve release in Wholesale for Oil & Gas of about $50 million. 
So as I said, net income was $6.3 billion. And while down 8% year-on-year, you will recall that there were a number of significant items in last year's results, most notably significant tax benefits. If you adjust for tax, legal expense and credit reserves, net income is up over $800 million year-on-year. 
Dealing with Oil & Gas here. We're encouraged by how quickly investor sentiment and risk appetite for the sector returned as the outlook for both oil and gas prices continue to improve. Capital markets opened more broadly to these clients, and we experienced lower draws against our facilities than previously anticipated. So a combination of pay downs, opportunistic loan sales and select upgrades more than offset the impact of downgrades. If the environment remains broadly consistent with today, we would not expect further significant builds in the fourth quarter for energy. 
Moving to Page 3 and capital. Key takeaways from this page: capital and leverage ratios were broadly flat quarter-on-quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.9% as net capital generation was offset by strong loan and commitment growth. Our spot balance sheet closed a little over $2.5 trillion, principally a result of strong deposit growth as well as liability actions taken to raise liquidity in the context of resolution, which also drove up liquid assets. While HQLA was up $23 billion quarter-on-quarter, our liquid assets were up significantly more than that as excess liquidity at the bank is not included in reported HQLA. Finally, we returned $3.8 billion of net capital to shareholders, including $2.1 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.48 a share. 
Moving on to Page 4 and Consumer & Community Banking. Consumer & Community Banking generated $2.2 billion of net income and an ROE of 16%. We continue to experience record deposit growth, more than twice the industry average, up 11% year-on-year. More than half of that growth is from existing customers. And based on the FDIC survey for 2016, we were #1 in absolute growth and grew share in each of our top 30 markets. 
Core loan growth remained strong at 19%. And while it's primarily driven by mortgage, we also saw 14% growth in Auto, 9% in Business Banking and 7% in card loans. Card new account originations were up 35% with strong demand for Sapphire Reserve and Freedom Unlimited and with more than 3/4 of new accounts being opened through digital channels. Card sales volume was up double digits this quarter, and we expect share gains to accelerate. So to close on drivers, we saw merchant processing volumes up 13% and our active mobile customer base up 17%. 
Revenue of $11.3 billion was up 4% year-on-year. Consumer & Business Banking revenue was also up 4% on the back of strong deposit growth. Mortgage revenue was up 21% on higher MSR risk management but also on higher production margins and growth in NII as we continue to add high-quality loans to our portfolio.  Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto revenue was down 1% as the strong momentum in card and Auto volumes and balance growth was offset by higher card origination costs and the remaining impact of co-brand renegotiations. And while the new account origination costs do cause a near-term drag on revenues, it's a high-class problem to have as we expect these accounts will be strongly accretive over time. Looking forward, assuming strong demand for Sapphire Reserve through the fourth quarter, we would expect revenue for CCSA to be down about $200 million quarter-on-quarter on higher acquisition costs, but it would clearly be dependent on the number of new accounts originated. 
Expense of $6.5 billion is up year-on-year, as I said, driven by 2 notable items totaling $175 million as well as the increased FDIC surcharge. The first item relates to liabilities assumed for a merchant in bankruptcy, and the second is a modest increase in reserves for mortgage servicing. Underlying this expense performance is an incremental investment of $250 million in marketing and auto lease growth, which is in line with Investor Day guidance and largely self-funded with expense efficiency. 
Finally, the credit environment remains favorable. In card, we built $200 million of reserves this quarter, reflecting growth in the portfolio, including newer vintages, which have a higher loss rate than the portfolio average, consistent with our discussion during the second quarter and consistent with how we underwrite the loans. And in auto, we built $25 million of reserves on the back of high-quality loan growth. 
Now turning to Page 5 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. Total revenue for CIB of $9.5 billion, up 16% year-on-year, was the best reported performance for a third quarter and included the highest IBCs on record for a third quarter, too, up 15%; with strong Markets performance across the board, revenues up 33%. Expense was down 20% year-on-year on lower legal costs but also with strong expense discipline more broadly. Coupled with solid credit performance, including a modest reserve build for Oil & Gas here, the business delivered a pretty clean $2.9 billion of net income and a 17% ROE this quarter. 
Diving deeper. IB revenue of $1.7 billion was up 14% year-on-year with strong performance across products. We ranked #1 in global IBCs, maintaining share on a year-to-date basis, and ranked #1 in North America and EMEA. Advisory fees were up 8% year-on-year, and we continue to rank #2 globally and have done more deals than anyone else so far this year. In equity underwriting, fees were up 38% year-on-year. With a stable market backdrop and strong investor demand, issuance was up across products and particularly in IPOs. We ranked #1 in wallet globally and in North America and EMEA, and we also ranked #1 on a number-of-deals basis for overall ECMs and IPOs. 
Debt underwriting had the highest third quarter on record with strong market-wide bond issuance, record high-grade bond supply in August and yields near record lows. Fees were up 12% from a high watermark last year, and we ranked #1. In terms of outlook, given the strength this quarter, we expect IBCs to be down in the fourth quarter sequentially but relatively flat year-on-year. 
Markets revenue of $5.7 billion was up 33% year-on-year. Clients were active, and risk management conditions were favorable. Fixed income revenue was up 48% compared to a weaker third quarter last year. Rates was a standout in terms of performance this quarter as markets stayed active post-Brexit with good client flow as well as anticipation of and uncertainty around central bank actions. 
Currencies & Emerging Markets matched a very strong third quarter last year but slowed down slightly. And Credit and Securitized Products came back from a weak prior period, with a recovery in the energy sector and central bank actions motivating clients to put money to work, producing a much more constructive market-making and new issuance environment, resulting in a particularly strong quarter. 
Equities revenue was up 1% compared to a strong third quarter last year, with Asia matching last year's strong performance and strength in North America flow derivatives offsetting weakness in cash volumes. Taking Treasury Services and Securities Services revenues together, each were over $900 million, with strong forward pipelines and levers to higher rates. 
Moving on to Page 6 and Commercial Banking. Commercial Banking reported record net income of $778 million on revenue of $1.9 billion and an ROE of 18%. Revenue was up 14% year-on-year driven by a trifecta of NII on loan growth, higher deposit spreads as well as higher IB revenues. Loan growth continues to be strong across both C&I and CRE, outperforming the industry. C&I loans were up 10% year-on-year despite competition for quality loans as the investments that we've been making this year are delivering results. We've added over 100 net new bankers, opened 7 new offices and further built out our specialized industry coverage, and we've added nearly 600 new relationships in middle market this year.  
CRE loans grew 19%, reflecting strong originations in both Commercial Term Lending and Real Estate Banking. We're also seeing stable to improving new loan spreads. IB revenue was up 57%, in part driven by a few large transactions but bringing year-to-date IB revenues closer to flat versus last year, which is a strong performance. Expense growth of 4% is driven by our investments. And as I said, these investments are already paying off. 
Finally, credit performance remains strong with a net charge-off rate of 10 basis points, roughly half of which was driven by Oil & Gas. In addition, you see further reserve releases for Oil & Gas here, as I mentioned earlier. Outside of energy, credit quality is good, and the commercial real estate portfolio had no net charge-offs during the quarter. 
Leaving the Commercial Bank and moving on to Asset Management on Page 7. Asset Management reported net income of $557 million with a 29% pretax margin and an ROE of 24%. Revenue of $3 billion was up 5% year-on-year, driven primarily by strong banking results on higher loan and deposit spreads. Expense of $2.1 billion was up slightly year-on-year and up 2% sequentially on higher incentive compensation. We saw positive long-term flows of $19 billion with strength in multi-asset, including the benefit of a large mandate this quarter; as well as inflows in alternative and fixed income, partially offset by outflows in equity products. In addition, we were the beneficiaries of $22 billion of liquidity flows this quarter, capturing more than our share of money in motion, given money market reform. 
AUM grew 4% and overall client assets, 5%, to $1.8 trillion and $2.4 trillion, respectively, driven by markets as well as long-term flows. Our long-term investment performance remains solid with 80% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over 5 years. Lastly, we have record loan balances of $114 billion, up 5% year-on-year, driven by mortgage. Skipping over Page 8 and Corporate, where the results were very close to home and where there are no significant items to highlight. 
So turning to Page 9 and the outlook. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, expect net interest income to be up modestly quarter-on-quarter on continued strength in loan growth even as we digest the incremental cost of resolution-based liquidity actions, which will be fully in our run rate in the fourth quarter. Expect noninterest revenue to be down quarter-on-quarter based upon our current outlook for IBCs and assuming flat year-on-year Markets revenues, also including higher card acquisition costs and seasonally lower mortgages. All else equal, expect NIR to come in at $50.5 billion plus or minus for the full year, market dependent. Finally, expect adjusted expense in the fourth quarter to be flat year-on-year, bringing full year expense in at approximately $56 billion, consistent with our guidance and self-funding the Consumer items I mentioned. 
So to wrap up, strong performance whichever way you look at it this quarter. We're continuing to demonstrate that our operating model and our platform is working for our clients, that our scale across businesses gives us operating leverage and that our investments through time are paying off. And while, as a company, we are proud of this quarter's performance and, in particular, proud of the growth in the underlying business drivers, we take a long-term, disciplined view and remain focused on delivering excellent customer experience, strong execution, particularly in risk management and expenses, so that we can continue to deliver best-in-class performance. 
With that, operator, please open up the line, and we can take questions."

And so when you think about the year-over-year comparison, we are a little flattered [ph] by last year's performance, not necessarily more so than our peers, but nevertheless, we are. And then we talked about the fact that this quarter, the conditions were relatively favorable broadly. And compare and contrast that to last year, where there were pockets of activity and client flow but there were also pockets where people were really sitting on their hands and not transacting. So I think client flow, quite broadly, across the environment would characterize the quarter. In terms of competitive performance, I would say it feels like we did well. Obviously, we're the first to report, apart from Citi this morning. It feels like we did relatively well, so we may have gained some share. Certainly -- hopefully, the momentum in terms of the business we've been building and the way we are serving our clients will serve us in that capacity not just this quarter but through time. But obviously, there can be a bit of volatility in the market share space, so we prefer to look at it more through time. And we feel pretty good about the performance."

Still completely within our credit risk appetite and at risk-adjusted margins that are better than the portfolio average. So we're getting paid for that, so we're doing it within our risk appetite, doing it judiciously. But as a result, as those vintages become a higher percentage of our overall population, they will have a gentle upward pressure on the charge-off rate.

And so as you look forward, for us, over the course of the next several quarters, we would expect those phenomena to generally continue, again, slowly. We're growing our portfolio.

But based upon the speech, moving to a baseline minimum standard is more consistent with how we think about our capital management policy. And using the capital stack add-up, using our G-SIB score and our stress draw-down, actually you would come out with a sort of capital constraint under CCAR that's pretty much on top of our regulatory capital minimum. So in that sense, because of the offset, because of the lack of balance sheet growth, lack of RWA growth and the curtailment of capital distributions, we've actually ended up in a place where we look to be approximately equally bound based on last year's test by both of those 2 measures, which is a space we played in for a while. We've been -- as I talked about before, we've been bound by many constraints somewhat equally over a period of time and striving to sort of operate within that constraint and maximize shareholder value. I think the things we don't know, obviously, how funding or liquidity shocks will be incorporated. And in any case, this is not for the 2017 CCAR cycle, so it's a whole cycle away from now. So we will be operating in 2017 under the same basic test construct as we have previously. And so I don't think it's a clear and present danger necessarily that we will be able to look at payout ratios that are above the top end of our range. Meanwhile, we are at the top end of our range now."

And so as a consequence, the impact of LIBOR curve moves has been not very significant on our P&L. We wouldn't expect it to be.

We don't really manage to NIM, but you can obviously back into it. So if we ended up in a situation right now where rates were flat throughout all of 2017, which, for what it's worth, I don't think is pretty much anyone's central expectation right now, but if we were rate flat, you've seen us grow our core loans and our loan balances pretty strongly, pretty consistently across businesses. And while we may not be able to replicate 15% core loan growth forever, certainly, we can continue to grow our loans. So on that plus mix shift away from securities over time, we should be able to deliver $1.5 billion of incremental NII next year, rate flat. You know that if rates are -- if we're fortunate enough, for the right reasons, that we see a hike this year -- at the end of this year and get the full benefit of that next year, it will be higher than that. And you've seen our earnings at-risk disclosures. They've been pretty close to a $3 billion number on 100 basis point move for a while, most of which is front end."

So look, we're aware, obviously, of the riskier types of CRE lending, the types of lending that attract scrutiny, for reasonable reasons, considering how they performed in past cycles. We're also mindful of where we are in the cycle and take that into consideration in our underwriting. So we are -- have and continue to avoid what I would characterize as the riskier segments and those segments that performed poorly in previous cycles. And we really stick to our knitting, if that's an American expression, in terms of continuing to do what we're good at within our risk appetite. And so if you think about our Commercial Real Estate growth, Commercial Term Lending is about 3/4 of our portfolio. And you know that we're very focused on smaller loan size, term B -- sorry, Class B, Class C properties with low vacancy rates, so rent-stabilized, high-constrained markets, underwrite to low LTVs, good debt service coverage. We look at forward rates and current rents. And so we really have an expertise in a specific niche, and we compete on speed and certainty of execution, not on credit and structure. So we feel pretty good about our exposures. And even in the more traditional Real Estate Banking space, we have avoided riskier segments. We have limited construction lending exposure; homebuilders, minimal exposure. We're pretty disciplined about it."

With respect to the prioritization, look, the soft cap on dividends has been lifted. Dividends are ultimately still a part of the baseline minimum standard, so there will be constantly some natural constraint there. It hasn't changed at this point anyway. The board's determination -- or management's determination about the order of priority, we would like to continue to have the capacity to grow our dividends.
