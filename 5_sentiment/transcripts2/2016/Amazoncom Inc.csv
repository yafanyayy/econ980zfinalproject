I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 74% to $11.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free",1146,"Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 74% to $11.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow, less lease principal repayments increased to $4.7 billion, up from $529 million. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $2.2 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.6 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares compared with 483 million 1 year ago. 
Worldwide revenue increased 22% to $35.7 billion or 26%, excluding the $1.2 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 304 million. Excluding customers who only had 3 orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 280 million, up from approximately 254 million in the comparable prior-year period. Worldwide paid prime members increased 51% year-over-year. Worldwide seller units represented 47% of paid units. Performance by Amazon or FBA units represent nearly 50% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web Services customers exceeded 1 million. 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $24.3 billion or 68.1% of revenue compared with 70.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $9.7 billion or 27.1% of sales, up approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $4.4 billion or 12.3% of revenue compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $3.2 billion or 9% of revenue compared with 8.2%. Marketing was $1.7 billion or 4.8% of revenue compared with 5.1%. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to our segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $21.5 billion. Media revenue grew 11% to $3.9 billion or 12%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 28% to $17.3 billion. North America segment operating income was $1 billion, a 4.7% operating margin, compared with $733 million in the prior year period. North America segment operating income includes $6 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. In the international segment, revenue grew 12% to $11.8 billion. Excluding the $1.1 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 3% to $3.3 billion or increased 5%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 19% to $8.5 billion or 31%, excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating income was $60 million compared with $65 million in the prior year. International segment operating income includes $47 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 69% to $2.4 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income was $687 million, a 28.5% operating margin, compared with $240 million in the prior year period. AWS segment operating income includes $60 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income was $1.8 billion or 4.9% of revenue, up approximately 140 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $20 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 88% to $1.1 billion. Our income tax expense was $453 million. GAAP net income was $482 million or $1 per diluted share compared with a net income of $214 million and $0.45 per diluted share. 
Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $107 billion or 26%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $63.7 billion or 26%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. International revenue grew 6% to $35.4 billion or 21%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, Germany revenue grew 18%, Japan revenue grew 19% and U.K. revenue grew 16%. AWS revenue grew 70% to $7.9 billion. Consolidated segment operating income was $4.5 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $16 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion compared with $178 million in the prior year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 billion year-over-year to $19.8 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $10.2 billion and inventory turns were 8.5, down from 8.6 turns a year ago as we expanded selection improved in stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $20.4 billion and accounts payable days increased to 77 from 73 in the prior year. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be perfectly conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements recording any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For Q1 2016, we expect net sales to be between $26.5 billion and $29 billion or growth of between 17% and 28%. This guidance anticipates approximately 130 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $100 million and $700 million compared with $255 million in the first quarter 2015. This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expenses net. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense net, to be between $700 million and $1.3 billion compared with $706 million in the first quarter of 2015. 
We are grateful to our customers and remain heads down focused on driving better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions."

First, pricing as concerned, we had a price reduction in January for our ECT services. It was our 51st price reduction since we launched AWS years ago. And generally, what we find is that price is important, but so is speed and agility for customers and the ability to deliver services and features that are beneficial to them. I will point out that we added 722 new features and services in 2015, and that was up 40% year-over-year.

It's up 400 basis points year-over-year. So a really strong quarter for our FBA sellers using our FBA services. It did put a lot of demand on our warehouses and we were followed. It was a very busy quarter and it did increase some of our cost as a result, primarily in the U.S. But a very strong quarter for FBA. It exceeded even our expectations."

First, there's the Prime platform and all the features I just mentioned, including the fulfillment, adding more fulfillment resources to handle higher and higher retail volumes and very strong FBA program as well. And then the remainder -- the biggest other investment areas of the India and we like -- what's we continue to see, like what we see in India. In Q4, Amazon India was a top e-commerce site in India throughout the very busy Diwali shopping season, including the shopping season according to come score and sales by sellers in Q4 were greater than all of 2014 combined in Q4.

The deceleration you're seeing, 700 basis points, is more a function of the Prime Day that we had in Q3, if you remember. We didn't break it out by segment, but we said that Prime Day contributed 200 basis points to our Q3 run rate -- revenue growth rate. So sequentially, last year, in the North America EGM, we dropped from 31% to 27%. This year, it's 35% to 28%. So there is always generally a sequential drop in Q4. But certainly, very happy with that business and its role in Prime as well total customer satisfaction. Your other question, investments. Yes, we continue to have healthy investments, as we've stated, across the globe. To step back again on that, our general philosophy is we want to find things, businesses that customers love and can grow, be large, will provide strong financial returns and adorable, it can last for decades. We think Prime is that. We think the marketplace is that. We think AWS is that. And we're constantly looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that criteria. So, but as we continue to invest primarily in, as I said, in Prime, the Prime platform, Prime features for customers, expansion for fulfillment capacity as we build out this for 26% [ph] unit growth in Q4 for instance and much greater FBA share. And not to mention all the investments in AWS. We're constantly looking for cost efficiencies in fixed and variable productivity. I think about the investments will have been flow over time, but our focus on cost reduction and improvement in customer experience will be constant."

Let me work backwards from your footprint question or comment. We have -- we just announced Korea as region and we'll be adding 5 more regions in the next -- in the future, in the near future as we mentioned. CapEx, let me start with that first. CapEx, we've seen great efficiencies in capital expenditures in, particularly in AWS, and we continue to work on better purchase efficiencies and driving utilization rates in our data centers. CapEx, as I mentioned, grew quite a bit in 2014. It grew even more to over $9 billion across all of our capital expenditures and capital leases in 2015. From the new regions, they're not in the major driver in anyway. Most of our capacity and that capital and capital leases in AWS is to service existing regions and existing customers demand growth. But there certainly expenditures, when we open up new regions, some of that is not always in the year that we opened the region. So we spent a good bit on those new regions already in 2015. As far as pricing, there's no capacity constraint, and I would -- a little bit dispute the deceleration comment on the, yes, on a percentage basis, 1,600 [ph] percent is lower than Q3, but as I said before, we're approaching a $10 billion run rate in this business on a dollar basis.

I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 74% to $11.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free",1142,"Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 74% to $11.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $4.7 billion, up from $529 million. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $2.2 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.6 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our Fulfillment operations. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares compared with 483 million 1 year ago. 
Worldwide revenue increased 22% to $35.7 billion or 26% excluding the $1.2 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 304 million. Excluding customers who only had 3 orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 280 million, up from approximately 254 million in the comparable prior-year period. Worldwide paid prime members increased 51% year-over-year. Worldwide seller units represented 47% of paid units. Fulfillment by Amazon or FBA units represent nearly 50% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web Services customers exceeded 1 million. 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $24.3 billion or 68.1% of revenue compared with 70.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $9.7 billion or 27.1% of sales, up approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $4.4 billion or 12.3% of revenue compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $3.2 billion or 9% of revenue compared with 8.2%. Marketing was $1.7 billion or 4.8% of revenue compared with 5.1%. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to our segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $21.5 billion. Media revenue grew 11% to $3.9 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 28% to $17.3 billion. North America segment operating income was $1 billion, a 4.7% operating margin, compared with $733 million in the prior year period. North America segment operating income includes $6 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. 
In the international segment, revenue grew 12% to $11.8 billion. Excluding the $1.1 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 3% to $3.3 billion or increased 5% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 19% to $8.5 billion or 31% excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating income was $60 million compared with $65 million in the prior year. International segment operating income includes $47 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. 
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 69% to $2.4 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income was $687 million, a 28.5% operating margin, compared with $240 million in the prior year period. AWS segment operating income includes $60 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income was $1.8 billion or 4.9% of revenue, up approximately 140 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $20 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 88% to $1.1 billion. Our income tax expense was $453 million. GAAP net income was $482 million or $1 per diluted share compared with a net income of $214 million and $0.45 per diluted share. 
Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $107 billion or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $63.7 billion or 26%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. International revenue grew 6% to $35.4 billion or 21% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, Germany revenue grew 18%; Japan revenue grew 19%; and U.K. revenue grew 16%. AWS revenue grew 70% to $7.9 billion. Consolidated segment operating income was $4.5 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $16 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion compared with $178 million in the prior year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 billion year-over-year to $19.8 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $10.2 billion, and inventory turns were 8.5, down from 8.6 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $20.4 billion and accounts payable days increased to 77 from 73 in the prior year. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements recording further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For Q1 2016, we expect net sales of between $26.5 billion and $29 billion or growth of between 17% and 28%. This guidance anticipates approximately 130 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $100 million and $700 million compared with $255 million in first quarter 2015. This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expenses net. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense net to be between $700 million and $1.3 billion compared with $706 million in the first quarter of 2015. 
We are grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.

Nearly 50% of our third-party units were FBA and our third-party units were also up to 47% of our paid units, so up 400 basis points year-over-year. So a really strong quarter for our FBA sellers using our FBA services. It did put a lot of demands on our warehouses, and we were full. It was a very busy quarter, and it did increase some of our variable cost as a result, primarily in the U.S. But a very strong quarter for FBA. It exceeded even our expectations."

The other comment I would say about video is we're very happy with the Amazon Studios content, in particular, which had some great success in 2014 and 2015.

But certainly, very happy with that business and its role in Prime as well total customer satisfaction. Your other question, investments. Yes, we continue to have healthy investments, as we've stated, across the globe. To step back again on that, our general philosophy is we want to find things, businesses that customers love, that can grow, be large, will provide strong financial returns and adorable, it can last for decades. We think Prime is that. We think Marketplace is that. We think AWS is that. And we're constantly looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that criteria. So -- but as we continue to invest primarily in -- as I said, in Prime, the Prime platform, Prime features for customers, expansion for Fulfillment capacity as we build out to support 26% unit growth in Q4 for instance and much greater FBA share. And not to mention all the investments in AWS. We're constantly looking for cost efficiencies in fixed and variable productivity.

CapEx, as I mentioned, grew quite a bit in 2014. It grew even more to over $9 billion across all of our capital expenditures and capital leases in 2015. From the new regions, they're not in the major driver in anyway. Most of our capacity and capital and capital leases in AWS is to service existing regions and existing customers demand growth. But there's certainly expenditures when we open up new regions. Some of that is not always in the year that we opened a region. So we spent a good bit on those new regions already in 2015. As far as pricing, there's no capacity constraint, and I would a little bit dispute the deceleration comment on a -- yes, on a percentage basis, 1,600 percentage lower than Q3.

So we're excited about what we're building there. I don't have any stats for you today. On the Twitch side, we continue to let Twitch do what Twitch does best. And so don't have any updates on numbers there, but they continue to really engage customers and offer really unique experience, which was one of the reasons we were attracted to them to start with."

I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 74% to $11.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free",1140,"Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 74% to $11.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $4.7 billion, up from $529 million. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $2.2 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.6 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our Fulfillment operations. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares compared with 483 million 1 year ago. 
Worldwide revenue increased 22% to $35.7 billion, or 26% excluding the $1.2 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 304 million. Excluding customers who only had 3 orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 280 million, up from approximately 254 million in the comparable prior-year period. Worldwide paid Prime members increased 51% year-over-year. Worldwide seller units represented 47% of paid units. Fulfillment by Amazon or FBA units represent nearly 50% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web Services customers exceeded 1 million. 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $24.3 billion or 68.1% of revenue compared with 70.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $9.7 billion or 27.1% of sales, up approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $4.4 billion or 12.3% of revenue compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $3.2 billion or 9% of revenue compared with 8.2%. Marketing was $1.7 billion or 4.8% of revenue compared with 5.1%. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to our segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $21.5 billion. Media revenue grew 11% to $3.9 billion, or 12% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 28% to $17.3 billion. North America segment operating income was $1 billion, a 4.7% operating margin, compared with $733 million in the prior-year period. North America segment operating income includes $6 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. 
In the international segment, revenue grew 12% to $11.8 billion. Excluding the $1.1 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 3% to $3.3 billion, or increased 5% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 19% to $8.5 billion, or 31% excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating income was $60 million compared with $65 million in the prior year. International segment operating income includes $47 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. 
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 69% to $2.4 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income was $687 million, a 28.5% operating margin, compared with $240 million in the prior-year period. AWS segment operating income includes $60 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income was $1.8 billion or 4.9% of revenue, up approximately 140 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $20 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 88% to $1.1 billion. Our income tax expense was $453 million. GAAP net income was $482 million or $1 per diluted share compared with a net income of $214 million and $0.45 per diluted share. 
Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $107 billion, or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $63.7 billion, or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. International revenue grew 6% to $35.4 billion, or 21% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, Germany revenue grew 18%, Japan revenue grew 19%, and U.K. revenue grew 16%. AWS revenue grew 70% to $7.9 billion. Consolidated segment operating income was $4.5 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $16 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion compared with $178 million in the prior year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 billion year-over-year to $19.8 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $10.2 billion, and inventory turns were 8.5, down from 8.6 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $20.4 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 77 from 73 in the prior year. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, recording further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For Q1 2016, we expect net sales of between $26.5 billion and $29 billion or growth of between 17% and 28%. This guidance anticipates approximately 130 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.

This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expenses net.

First, there's the Prime platform and all the features that I just mentioned, including the Fulfillment, adding more Fulfillment resources to handle higher and higher retail volumes, and a very strong FBA program as well. And then the remainder -- the biggest other investment area is obviously India. And we like what we're -- continue to see -- like what see in India.

But certainly, very happy with that business and its role in Prime as well total customer satisfaction. Your other question, investments. Yes, we continue to have healthy investments, as we've stated, across the globe. To step back again on that, our general philosophy is we want to find things -- businesses that customers love, that can grow to be large, will provide strong financial returns and are durable that can last for decades. We think Prime is that. We think Marketplace is that. We think AWS is that. And we're constantly looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that criteria. So -- but as we continue to invest, primarily in -- as I said, in Prime, the Prime platform, Prime features for customers, expansion for Fulfillment capacity as we build out to support 26% unit growth in Q4, for instance, and much greater FBA share, and not to mention all the investments in AWS, we're constantly looking for cost efficiencies in fixed and variable productivity.

Is there any capacity constraint or management that -- that's driving pricing strategy in AWS?

Let me work backwards from your footprint question or comment. We have -- we just announced Korea as a region, and we'll be adding 5 more regions in the next -- in the future, in the near future, as we've mentioned. CapEx, let me start with that first. CapEx, we've seen great efficiencies in capital expenditures in -- particularly in AWS, and we continue to work on better purchase efficiencies and driving utilization rates in our data centers. CapEx, as I mentioned, grew quite a bit in 2014. It grew even more, to over $9 billion, across all of our capital expenditures and capital leases in 2015. From the new regions, they're not the major driver in any way. Most of our capacity in capital and capital leases in AWS is to service existing regions and existing customers' demand growth. But there's certainly expenditures when we open up new regions. Some of that is not always in the year that we open the region. So we spent a good bit on those new regions already in 2015. As far as pricing, there's no capacity constraint, and I would a little bit dispute the deceleration comment on a -- yes, on a percentage basis, 69% is lower than Q3. But as I said before, we're approaching a $10 billion run rate in this business. On a dollar basis, we continue to grow. We saw the greatest growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter.

Oh, and mobile, we said for a long time, continues to be a tailwind for the business.

I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 74% to $11.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free",1140,"Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 74% to $11.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $4.7 billion, up from $529 million. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $2.2 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.6 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our Fulfillment operations. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares compared with 483 million 1 year ago. 
Worldwide revenue increased 22% to $35.7 billion, or 26% excluding the $1.2 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 304 million. Excluding customers who only had 3 orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 280 million, up from approximately 254 million in the comparable prior-year period. Worldwide paid Prime members increased 51% year-over-year. Worldwide seller units represented 47% of paid units. Fulfillment by Amazon or FBA units represent nearly 50% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web Services customers exceeded 1 million. 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $24.3 billion or 68.1% of revenue compared with 70.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $9.7 billion or 27.1% of sales, up approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $4.4 billion or 12.3% of revenue compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $3.2 billion or 9% of revenue compared with 8.2%. Marketing was $1.7 billion or 4.8% of revenue compared with 5.1%. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to our segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $21.5 billion. Media revenue grew 11% to $3.9 billion, or 12% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 28% to $17.3 billion. North America segment operating income was $1 billion, a 4.7% operating margin, compared with $733 million in the prior-year period. North America segment operating income includes $6 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. 
In the international segment, revenue grew 12% to $11.8 billion. Excluding the $1.1 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 3% to $3.3 billion, or increased 5% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 19% to $8.5 billion, or 31% excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating income was $60 million compared with $65 million in the prior year. International segment operating income includes $47 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. 
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 69% to $2.4 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income was $687 million, a 28.5% operating margin, compared with $240 million in the prior-year period. AWS segment operating income includes $60 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income was $1.8 billion or 4.9% of revenue, up approximately 140 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $20 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 88% to $1.1 billion. Our income tax expense was $453 million. GAAP net income was $482 million or $1 per diluted share compared with a net income of $214 million and $0.45 per diluted share. 
Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $107 billion, or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $63.7 billion, or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. International revenue grew 6% to $35.4 billion, or 21% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, Germany revenue grew 18%, Japan revenue grew 19%, and U.K. revenue grew 16%. AWS revenue grew 70% to $7.9 billion. Consolidated segment operating income was $4.5 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $16 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion compared with $178 million in the prior year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 billion year-over-year to $19.8 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $10.2 billion, and inventory turns were 8.5, down from 8.6 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $20.4 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 77 from 73 in the prior year. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, recording further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For Q1 2016, we expect net sales of between $26.5 billion and $29 billion or growth of between 17% and 28%. This guidance anticipates approximately 130 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $100 million and $700 million compared with $255 million in first quarter 2015. This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expenses net. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense net, to be between $700 million and $1.3 billion compared with $706 million in the first quarter of 2015. 
We are grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions."

And generally, what we find is that price is important, but so is speed and agility for customers and the ability to deliver services and features that are beneficial to them. I will point out that we added 722 new features and services in 2015, and that was up 40% year-over-year.

Nearly 50% of our third-party units were FBA, and our third-party units were also up to 47% of our paid units, so up 400 basis points year-over-year. So a really strong quarter for our FBA sellers using our FBA services. It did put a lot of demands on our warehouses, and we were full. It was a very busy quarter, and it did increase some of our variable cost as a result, primarily in the U.S. But a very strong quarter for FBA. It exceeded even our expectations."

The other comment I would say about video is we're very happy with the Amazon Studios content, in particular, which had some great success in 2014 and 2015. As you probably know, Transparent has won multiple Golden Globes and Emmys, both for actors and for the show itself. Mozart in the Jungle just won 2 Golden Globe awards.

And in February, we will have Chiraq, our first original movie that we got to work with Spike Lee on, which won many critical -- made many critics' best films list in 2015. That would be coming to Prime Video in February."

We rolled out a lot of additional Prime features internationally as well this year, from FREE Same-Day to Prime Now to Prime Music and Prime Video in Japan, to name a few. So very happy with that. But in general, if I step back, our investments in international are twofold. First, there's the Prime platform and all the features that I just mentioned, including the Fulfillment, adding more Fulfillment resources to handle higher and higher retail volumes, and a very strong FBA program as well. And then the remainder -- the biggest other investment area is obviously India. And we like what we're -- continue to see -- like what see in India. In Q4, Amazon India was the top e-commerce site in India throughout the very busy Diwali shopping season, including the -- the shopping season according to comScore. And sales by sellers in Q4 were greater than all of 2014 combined in Q4. So seeing great progress with downloads, innovations for sellers and customers alike, and we like the ramp there, and we're continuing to invest in India."

The deceleration you're seeing of 700 basis points is more a function of the Prime Day that we had in Q3, if you remember. We didn't break it out by segment, but we said that Prime Day contributed 200 basis points to our Q3 run rate -- revenue growth rate. So sequentially, last year, in the North America EGM, we dropped from 31% to 27%. This year, it's 35% to 28%. So there is always a -- generally, a sequential drop in Q4. But certainly, very happy with that business and its role in Prime as well total customer satisfaction. Your other question, investments. Yes, we continue to have healthy investments, as we've stated, across the globe. To step back again on that, our general philosophy is we want to find things -- businesses that customers love, that can grow to be large, will provide strong financial returns and are durable that can last for decades. We think Prime is that. We think Marketplace is that. We think AWS is that. And we're constantly looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that criteria. So -- but as we continue to invest, primarily in -- as I said, in Prime, the Prime platform, Prime features for customers, expansion for Fulfillment capacity as we build out to support 26% unit growth in Q4, for instance, and much greater FBA share, and not to mention all the investments in AWS, we're constantly looking for cost efficiencies in fixed and variable productivity. I think a thing to think about is the investments will ebb and flow over time, but our focus on cost reductions and improvement on customer experience will be constant."

Let me work backwards from your footprint question or comment. We have -- we just announced Korea as a region, and we'll be adding 5 more regions in the next -- in the future, in the near future, as we've mentioned. CapEx, let me start with that first. CapEx, we've seen great efficiencies in capital expenditures in -- particularly in AWS, and we continue to work on better purchase efficiencies and driving utilization rates in our data centers. CapEx, as I mentioned, grew quite a bit in 2014. It grew even more, to over $9 billion, across all of our capital expenditures and capital leases in 2015. From the new regions, they're not the major driver in any way. Most of our capacity in capital and capital leases in AWS is to service existing regions and existing customers' demand growth. But there's certainly expenditures when we open up new regions. Some of that is not always in the year that we open the region. So we spent a good bit on those new regions already in 2015. As far as pricing, there's no capacity constraint, and I would a little bit dispute the deceleration comment on a -- yes, on a percentage basis, 69% is lower than Q3. But as I said before, we're approaching a $10 billion run rate in this business. On a dollar basis, we continue to grow. We saw the greatest growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter.

On the restaurant delivery, it's just another great service we can offer for our Prime members. This is tied in with the Prime Now offering in a handful of cities at this point.

I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 74% to $11.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free",1143,"Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 74% to $11.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $4.7 billion, up from $529 million. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $2.2 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.6 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our Fulfillment operations. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares compared with 483 million 1 year ago. 
Worldwide revenue increased 22% to $35.7 billion, or 26% excluding the $1.2 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 304 million. Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 280 million, up from approximately 254 million in the comparable prior year period. Worldwide paid Prime members increased 51% year-over-year. Worldwide seller units represented 47% of paid units. Fulfillment by Amazon, or FBA, units represent nearly 50% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web Services customers exceeded 1 million. 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $24.3 billion or 68.1% of revenue compared with 70.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $9.7 billion or 27.1% of sales, up approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $4.4 billion or 12.3% of revenue compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $3.2 billion or 9% of revenue compared with 8.2%. Marketing was $1.7 billion or 4.8% of revenue compared with 5.1%. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to our segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $21.5 billion. Media revenue grew 11% to $3.9 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 28% to $17.3 billion. North America segment operating income was $1 billion, a 4.7% operating margin, compared with $733 million in the prior year period. North America segment operating income includes $6 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. 
In the international segment, revenue grew 12% to $11.8 billion. Excluding the $1.1 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 3% to $3.3 billion or increased 5% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 19% to $8.5 billion or 31% excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating income was $60 million compared with $65 million in the prior year. International segment operating income includes $47 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. 
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 69% to $2.4 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income was $687 million, a 28.5% operating margin, compared with $240 million in the prior year period. AWS segment operating income includes $60 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income was $1.8 billion or 4.9% of revenue, up approximately 140 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $20 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 88% to $1.1 billion. Our income tax expense was $453 million. GAAP net income was $482 million or $1 per diluted share compared with a net income of $214 million and $0.45 per diluted share. 
Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $107 billion or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $63.7 billion or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. International revenue grew 6% to $35.4 billion or 21% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, Germany revenue grew 18%, Japan revenue grew 19%, and U.K. revenue grew 16%. AWS revenue grew 70% to $7.9 billion. Consolidated segment operating income was $4.5 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $16 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion compared with $178 million in the prior year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 billion year-over-year to $19.8 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $10.2 billion, and inventory turns were 8.5, down from 8.6 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $20.4 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 77 from 73 in the prior year. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, recording further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For Q1 2016, we expect net sales of between $26.5 billion and $29 billion or growth of between 17% and 28%. This guidance anticipates approximately 130 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $100 million and $700 million compared with $255 million in first quarter 2015. This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expenses net. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense net, to be between $700 million and $1.3 billion compared with $706 million in the first quarter of 2015. 
We are grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.

And generally, what we find is that price is important, but so is speed and agility for customers and the ability to deliver services and features that are beneficial to them.

Nearly 50% of our third-party units were FBA, and our third-party units were also up to 47% of our paid units, so up 40 basis -- 400 basis points year-over-year. So a really strong quarter for our FBA sellers using our FBA services. It did put a lot of demands on our warehouses, and we were full. It was a very busy quarter, and it did increase some of our variable cost as a result, primarily in the U.S. But a very strong quarter for FBA. It exceeded even our expectations."

So sequentially, last year, in the North America EGM, we dropped from 31% to 27%. This year, it's 35% to 28%. So there is always a -- generally, a sequential drop in Q4. But certainly, very happy with that business and its role in Prime as well, total customer satisfaction. Your other question, investments. Yes, we continue to have healthy investments, as we've stated, across the globe. To step back again on that, our general philosophy is we want to find things -- businesses that customers love, that can grow to be large, will provide strong financial returns and are durable that can last for decades. We think Prime is that. We think Marketplace is that. We think AWS is that. And we're constantly looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that criteria. So -- but as we continue to invest, primarily in -- as I said, in Prime, the Prime platform, Prime features for customers, expansion for Fulfillment capacity as we build out to support 26% unit growth in Q4, for instance, and much greater FBA share, and not to mention all the investments in AWS, we're constantly looking for cost efficiencies in fixed and variable productivity.

CapEx, we've seen great efficiencies in capital expenditures in -- particularly in AWS, and we continue to work on better purchase efficiencies and driving utilization rates in our data centers. CapEx, as I mentioned, grew quite a bit in 2014. It grew even more, to over $9 billion across all of our capital expenditures and capital leases in 2015. From the new regions, they're not the major driver in any way. Most of our capacity in capital and capital leases in AWS is to service existing regions and existing customers' demand growth. But there's certainly expenditures when we open up new regions. Some of that is not always in the year that we open the region. So we spent a good bit on those new regions already in 2015. But as far as pricing, there's no capacity constraint, and I would a little bit dispute the deceleration comment on a -- yes, on a percentage basis, 69% is lower than Q3.

There's also an FX tailwind in there as well, which I think was about $60 million this quarter, which would contribute on a year-over-year basis, which really arises because we're largely priced in dollars but have assets with local currency costs throughout the world. As for the streaming content, we haven't given another update this year and haven't given any commentary on the profile quarter-to-quarter."

I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 44% to $11.3 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $6.4 billion, up from $3.2 billion. Trailing 12-month free c",1003,"Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 44% to $11.3 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $6.4 billion, up from $3.2 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $3.5 billion, up from $1.5 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $1.6 billion, up from an outflow of $1.2 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.9 billion. 
Capital expenditures did not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligation. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares compared with 483 million 1 year ago. Worldwide revenue increased 28% to $29.1 billion or 29%, excluding the $210 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. 
Worldwide active customer accounts, excluding customers who only had 3 orders in the preceding 12-month period, exceeded 285 million. Worldwide paid unit growth was 27%. Worldwide seller units represented 48% of paid units. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results. In the first quarter of 2016, we began to allocate stock-based compensation and other operating expense net to our segment results. These amounts are combined entitled Stock-based Compensation and Other in our segment results and reflect the way we now evaluate our business performance and manage our operations. For reference, this quarter, I'll also mention segment operating income excluding stock-based compensation and other.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 27% to $17 billion. Media revenue grew 8% to $3.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 32% to $13.5 billion. North America segment operating income, including stock-based compensation and other, was $588 million, a 3.5% operating margin compared with $254 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. North America segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $924 million, a 5.4% operating margin compared with $517 million in the prior year. 
In the international segment, revenue grew 24% to $9.6 billion. Excluding the $177 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 26%. Media revenue increased 7% to $2.5 billion or 9%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 31% to $7 billion or 33%, excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating loss, including stock-based compensation and other, was $121 million compared with a loss of $194 million in the prior year. This includes $21 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. International segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $20 million compared with a loss of $76 million in the prior year.
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 64% to $2.6 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income, including stock-based compensation and other, was $604 million, a 23.5% operating margin compared with $195 million in the prior year. This includes $24 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. 
Amazon Web Services segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $716 million, a 27.9% operating margin compared with $265 million in the prior year. Our operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. Operating income was $1.1 billion or 3.7% of revenue, up approximately 260 basis points year-over-year. This includes $50 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $1.7 billion or 5.7% of revenue compared to $706 million in the prior year.
Our income tax expense was $475 million, net income was $513 million or $1.07 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $57 million or a loss of $0.12 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $2.1 billion year-over-year to $15.9 billion. Inventory increased 30% to $9.6 billion, and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.8 turns a year ago as we expand selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 26% to $15 billion and accounts payable days increased to 72 from 70 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. 
It's not possible to actually predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling in our company balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on our results. 
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisition, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2 2016, we expect net sales of between $28 billion and $30.5 billion or growth of between 21% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 70 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income to be between $375 million and $975 million compared with $464 million in second quarter 2015. This includes approximately $825 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expense net. 
We're grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way that create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks, and with that, Phil, let's move on to questions."

As may have mentioned in the past, Europe and large countries in Europe and Japan are a few years behind the U.S. on a lot of the key Prime metrics, but we also said last year that Prime subscriptions were up 51% year-over-year in 2015, 47% of that was -- 47% in the U.S. and higher rate than that internationally. So certainly a lot going on in the international, a lot that's really good adding Prime subscribers at a high clip, continue to add selection at FBA sellers. So you'll see device,  you see devices, you see video content. So it's the whole array of Prime offering, Prime Now same-day everything is in Europe. It's maybe getting there a little slower than starting point in the U.S. but we see it really showing up in customer engagement and customer purchases. On the AWS side, I think the 2016 to 2015 comparison probably stands on its own and 2014 false by the wayside. So I would encourage you to look at recent trend.

What that means for our Prime customers is there's more for them to choose from. Obviously, that gives them more they can purchase, it makes Prime more valuable. For sellers, it means they sell more.

And so that number for this quarter was 310 -- over 310 million. So that may be where you're making the statement about the slowdown in growth.

So was that solely from FX impact or was there some seasonality of expenses? Any color on what's driving the AWS margin and how we should think about that over the longer term?"

The other bigger element of that is the third-party contribution. Third-party units are now up to 48% of paid units. That's up 400 basis points year-over-year.

I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12 months operating cash flow increased 44% to $11.3 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow increased to $6.4 billion, up from $3.2 billion. Trailing 12 months fre",1003,"Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12 months operating cash flow increased 44% to $11.3 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow increased to $6.4 billion, up from $3.2 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $3.5 billion, up from $1.5 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $1.6 billion, up from an outflow of $1.2 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.9 billion. 
Capital expenditures did not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligation. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operation.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares compared with 483 million 1 year ago. Worldwide revenue increased 28% to $29.1 billion or 29%, excluding the $210 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. 
Worldwide active customer accounts, excluding customers who only had 3 orders in the preceding 12-month period, exceeded 285 million. Worldwide paid unit growth was 27%. Worldwide seller units represented 48% of paid units. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results. In the first quarter of 2016, we began to allocate stock-based compensation and other operating expense net to our segment results. These amounts are combined entitled Stock-based Compensation and Other in our segment results and reflect the way we now evaluate our business performance and manage our operations. For reference, this quarter, I'll also mention segment operating income excluding stock-based compensation and other.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 27% to $17 billion. Media revenue grew 8% to $3.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 32% to $13.5 billion. North America segment operating income, including stock-based compensation and other, was $588 million, a 3.5% operating margin compared with $254 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. North America segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $924 million, a 5.4% operating margin compared with $517 million in the prior year. 
In the international segment, revenue grew 24% to $9.6 billion. Excluding the $177 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 26%. Media revenue increased 7% to $2.5 billion or 9%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 31% to $7 billion or 33%, excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating loss, including stock-based compensation and other, was $121 million compared with a loss of $194 million in the prior year. This includes $21 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. International segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $20 million compared with a loss of $76 million in the prior year.
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 64% to $2.6 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income, including stock-based compensation and other, was $604 million, a 23.5% operating margin compared with $195 million in the prior year. This includes $24 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. 
Amazon Web Services segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $716 million, a 27.9% operating margin compared with $265 million in the prior year.
Our operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. Operating income was $1.1 billion or 3.7% of revenue, up approximately 260 basis points year-over-year. This includes $50 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $1.7 billion or 5.7% of revenue compared to $706 million in the prior year.
Our income tax expense was $475 million. Net income was $513 million or $1.07 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $57 million or a loss of $0.12 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $2.1 billion year-over-year to $15.9 billion. Inventory increased 30% to $9.6 billion, and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.8 turns a year ago as we expand selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 26% to $15 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 72 from 70 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. 
It's not possible to actually predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on our results. 
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisition, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2 2016, we expect net sales of between $28 billion and $30.5 billion or growth of between 21% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 70 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income to be between $375 million and $975 million compared with $464 million in second quarter 2015. This includes approximately $825 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expense net. 
We're grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way that create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions."

International's 26% for FX-neutral growth rate was actually the strongest we've seen in 3.5 years. I would attribute it to the Prime flywheel. As I may have mentioned in the past, so the Europe and large countries in Europe and Japan are a few years behind the U.S. on a lot of the key Prime metrics, but we also said last year that Prime subscriptions were up 51% year-over-year in 2015, 47% of that was -- 47% in the U.S. and a higher rate than that internationally. So certainly a lot going on in the international, a lot that's really good adding Prime subscribers at a high clip, continuing to add selection at FBA sellers. So you'll see device -- you see devices, you see video content. So it's the whole array of Prime offering, Prime Now, Same-Day, everything is in Europe. It's maybe getting there a little slower than starting point in the U.S., but we see it really showing up in customer engagement and customer purchases. On the AWS side, I think the 2016 to 2015 comparison probably stands on its own and 2014 falls by the wayside. So I would encourage you to look at recent trends. We don't forecast it obviously by segment."

But I was just hoping you could comment on kind of the overall acceleration we've seen here and the key drivers behind that, and if there's something different perhaps than what you talked about on the international. And then just also on AWS, can you just talk about the underlying drivers here of margins and thinking about that a little bit going forward, kind of primary sources of leveraging? As you open up 6 new regions in coming months, should we expect this to be kind of constant build-out or something that's kind of more lumpy over time and more in waves?"

So really the units are driven by very similar trends to what Brian described. I think when we look at the bridges for revenue, and obviously units are a key driver for revenue, things like Prime are key in that bridge. I would also call out selection growth. That's been a big area of focus for us. And one important way we drive selection is through FBA. And so we continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making in FBA. What that means for our Prime customers is there's more for them to choose from. Obviously, that gives them more they can purchase, it makes Prime more valuable. For sellers, it means they sell more. And so I would say that FBA is helping drive some of the selection growth we're seeing here. So selection growth and Prime though are our 2 very key drivers of our growth.

We came in at 23.5% operating margin on a -- the new basis, including stock-based compensation and other. We're very pleased -- stepping back, the 54% growth in AWS, which is now a $10 billion business. But on the margin side, I would caution you that we're pleased, but it is very early to start drawing too many conclusions on the long-term margins in this business. They'll be bumpy over time. At any point in time, they're going to reflect the balance of investing, including global expansion talked about. Price reductions, we may offer and also driving cost efficiency, which for us is a very important driver now in this business but also the North America and international segments."

So as we look at our metrics and what information we provide each year, we often make some changes. So this quarter, we only gave the active customers with a pay purchase in the trailing 12 months. And so that number was more than 285 million. I think that's pretty similar to the trend that we've seen in that metric. Now in the past, sometimes, we had also given a total active customers count. And so that number for this quarter was 310 -- over 310 million. So that may be where you're making the statement about the slowdown in growth. But the trajectory was very similar from prior quarters for both these numbers, but we opted just to give the other one, but you now have the number for the total number of customers as well. And on your AWS footprint question, so we ended the quarter with 33 available -- availability zones in 12 geographic regions. And we have 5 -- 11 more availability soon to opening in the next year. The impact on capital, yes, there will be additional capital investment as we build out the zones. Some of it already taking place. But I will also say that, by and large, the largest increases in capital leases has spud the growth of incremental usage of customers we have now in regions we have now. And you should expect to see us continue to invest and support this business for are very, very -- we have a leadership position. We intend to maintain it, and we're very excited about where we are."

I would say it's a combination of a lot of separate investments that we're making. So if you look at the success of our devices, we are seeing -- tablets were sold twice the volume in Q1 year-over-year. Fire TV Stick, you may have read in our press release that it has greater than 100,000 customer reviews, the most reviewed product ever. 62,000 or over 62,000 of those reviews are 5-star reviews. We've not only have the Echo, but we have the Echo Dot and Tab. So we're branching off that product line and having trouble keeping those in stock. And of course, we launched the new Kindle Oasis e-reader. So that is important part of the story as is the digital content. You may have seen the recent announcements that we're working on a great amount of new content for Prime members. We love the -- customers love the content, and we like the results we see particularly around Prime free trial conversion and renewal rates for subscribers who use and take advantage of Prime. So beyond the award that the content is winning and the success we're having with Amazon, particularly Amazon Originals, we feel that program's working. We're going to significantly increase our spend in that area. Some of that is in Q2. You'll see that more in the next few quarters. But we think that's working and look forward to bringing a lot of new content to our Prime subscriber base, both through our normal Prime subscription and also the monthly plan that you alluded to."

It's products that are already boxed. And we think again this is activities we've been doing already, which means they grow at a very rapid rate.

It's a very exciting time in India. And again, the invention is off the charts. We're inventing things in India that do not exist in other parts of the country -- or excuse me, parts of the world. And the team there is one of our best. You can see in some of the external commentary as well, for the second year in a row customers selected Amazon India asAmazon's -- most trusted online shopping brand. During the quarter, we rolled out a feature called Tatkal, which is a studio-on-wheels that we go to the sellers to help them sign up. We let them do registration, imaging, catalog, uploads and basic seller training. So we're taking it to the sellers, taking the business to the sellers. We've already reached sellers in 25 cities, and we're really helping them expand their business, not only within their home region throughout the whole country."

I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12 months operating cash flow increased 44% to $11.3 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow increased to $6.4 billion, up from $3.2 billion. Trailing 12 months fre",1003,"Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12 months operating cash flow increased 44% to $11.3 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow increased to $6.4 billion, up from $3.2 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $3.5 billion, up from $1.5 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $1.6 billion, up from an outflow of $1.2 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.9 billion. 
Capital expenditures did not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligation. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operation.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares compared with 483 million 1 year ago. Worldwide revenue increased 28% to $29.1 billion or 29%, excluding the $210 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. 
Worldwide active customer accounts, excluding customers who only had 3 orders in the preceding 12-month period, exceeded 285 million. Worldwide paid unit growth was 27%. Worldwide seller units represented 48% of paid units. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results. In the first quarter of 2016, we began to allocate stock-based compensation and other operating expense net to our segment results. These amounts are combined entitled Stock-based Compensation and Other in our segment results and reflect the way we now evaluate our business performance and manage our operations. For reference, this quarter, I'll also mention segment operating income excluding stock-based compensation and other.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 27% to $17 billion. Media revenue grew 8% to $3.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 32% to $13.5 billion. North America segment operating income, including stock-based compensation and other, was $588 million, a 3.5% operating margin compared with $254 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. North America segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $924 million, a 5.4% operating margin compared with $517 million in the prior year. 
In the international segment, revenue grew 24% to $9.6 billion. Excluding the $177 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 26%. Media revenue increased 7% to $2.5 billion or 9%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 31% to $7 billion or 33%, excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating loss, including stock-based compensation and other, was $121 million compared with a loss of $194 million in the prior year. This includes $21 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. International segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $20 million compared with a loss of $76 million in the prior year.
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 64% to $2.6 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income, including stock-based compensation and other, was $604 million, a 23.5% operating margin compared with $195 million in the prior year. This includes $24 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. 
Amazon Web Services segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $716 million, a 27.9% operating margin compared with $265 million in the prior year.
Our operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. Operating income was $1.1 billion or 3.7% of revenue, up approximately 260 basis points year-over-year. This includes $50 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $1.7 billion or 5.7% of revenue compared to $706 million in the prior year.
Our income tax expense was $475 million. Net income was $513 million or $1.07 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $57 million or a loss of $0.12 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $2.1 billion year-over-year to $15.9 billion. Inventory increased 30% to $9.6 billion, and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.8 turns a year ago as we expand selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 26% to $15 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 72 from 70 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. 
It's not possible to actually predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on our results. 
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisition, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2 2016, we expect net sales of between $28 billion and $30.5 billion or growth of between 21% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 70 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income to be between $375 million and $975 million compared with $464 million in second quarter 2015. This includes approximately $825 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expense net. 
We're grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way that create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions."

International's 26% for FX-neutral growth rate was actually the strongest we've seen in 3.5 years. I would attribute it to the Prime flywheel. As I may have mentioned in the past, so the Europe and large countries in Europe and Japan are a few years behind the U.S. on a lot of the key Prime metrics, but we also said last year that Prime subscriptions were up 51% year-over-year in 2015, 47% of that was -- 47% in the U.S. and a higher rate than that internationally. So certainly a lot going on in the international, a lot that's really good adding Prime subscribers at a high clip, continuing to add selection at FBA sellers. So you'll see device -- you see devices, you see video content. So it's the whole array of Prime offering, Prime Now, Same-Day, everything is in Europe. It's maybe getting there a little slower than starting point in the U.S., but we see it really showing up in customer engagement and customer purchases. On the AWS side, I think the 2016 to 2015 comparison probably stands on its own and 2014 falls by the wayside. So I would encourage you to look at recent trends.

I think when we look at the bridges for revenue, and obviously units are a key driver for revenue, things like Prime are key in that bridge. I would also call out selection growth. That's been a big area of focus for us. And one important way we drive selection is through FBA. And so we continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making in FBA. What that means for our Prime customers is there's more for them to choose from. Obviously, that gives them more they can purchase, it makes Prime more valuable. For sellers, it means they sell more. And so I would say that FBA is helping drive some of the selection growth we're seeing here. So selection growth and Prime though are our 2 very key drivers of our growth.

So as we look at our metrics and what information we provide each year, we often make some changes. So this quarter, we only gave the active customers with a pay purchase in the trailing 12 months. And so that number was more than 285 million. I think that's pretty similar to the trend that we've seen in that metric. Now in the past, sometimes, we had also given a total active customers count. And so that number for this quarter was 310 -- over 310 million. So that may be where you're making the statement about the slowdown in growth. But the trajectory was very similar from prior quarters for both these numbers, but we opted just to give the other one, but you now have the number for the total number of customers as well. And on your AWS footprint question, so we ended the quarter with 33 available -- availability zones in 12 geographic regions. And we have 5 -- 11 more availability zones opening in the next year. The impact on capital, yes, there will be additional capital investment as we build out the zones. Some of it already taking place. But I will also say that, by and large, the largest increases in capital leases is to support the growth of incremental usage of customers we have now in regions we have now. And you should expect to see us continue to invest and support this business for are very, very -- we have a leadership position.

Fire TV Stick, you may have read in our press release that it has greater than 100,000 customer reviews, the most reviewed product ever. 62,000 or over 62,000 of those reviews are 5-star reviews. We've not only have the Echo, but we have the Echo Dot and Tab. So we're branching off that product line and having trouble keeping those in stock. And of course, we launched the new Kindle Oasis e-reader. So that is important part of the story as is the digital content. You may have seen the recent announcements that we're working on a great amount of new content for Prime members. We love the -- customers love the content, and we like the results we see particularly around Prime free trial conversion and renewal rates for subscribers who use and take advantage of Prime. So beyond the award that the content is winning and the success we're having with Amazon, particularly Amazon Originals, we feel that program's working. We're going to significantly increase our spend in that area. Some of that is in Q2. You'll see that more in the next few quarters.

Can you talk about how you're thinking about planning against that as the Prime flywheels are getting broader for you? How do you try to get ahead of that into the peak season later this year?"

It was more the FBA demand that we had from FBA sellers for space in our warehouses. We were very full. It was a high-class problem to have. But as I mentioned, last quarter, it did result in higher fulfillment costs in the fourth quarter as a result. I think you'll see some of that dissipating now in Q1. So it's a Q4 issue. We learn from every Q4. This one was no exception. We are already making plans for a smoother Q4 next year. We will continue to add fulfillment capacity. We'll work with FBA sellers on inventory stocking and timing. And we think that there's things that we can do better as we do every year come out fourth quarter with immense learnings."

Also varying levels of digital benefits as well. So generally, the international countries are not as far along with selection or the fullness of the digital offers. We've got Prime Video in the U.K., in Germany and Japan. Music is not fully rolled out yet altogether. So that's where we are with Prime."

I think it's a mathematical certainty that Prime subscribers will decelerate in North America at some point from 50% growth.

I'm not saying other investments may not go up as well, but that is the one that we are focusing on and that I called out. On the comment about Prime, I guess what I will call availability or saturation, yes, I think that's one of the thoughts behind our monthly plan. We want to create flexibility for consumers to try Prime in a low-cost way if that's how they choose. We've always had our free trial program, but it is a hurdle for many people or there's hesitancy to put up full year's payment for Europe Prime. Annual is still going to be a better deal, but we know that customers may try it more frequently if it's a monthly plan. And that's what we're looking for. We know that once customers try, generally, they'll really like it. So we think that'll approach some other demographic groups as well."

Another comment on Prime. On your saturation question, keep in mind that even in the U.S., which is our most mature by years of launch, we still grew last year at 47% year-over-year membership growth, and we continue to make the program better and better. I think the monthly offers are great for flexibility, give people a chance to try new ways, and we continue to add content, we continue to add selection. Prime Now is a huge benefit that didn't even exist 2 years ago. So all these things are making the program better, and we're still out trying to meet as many customers as possible. We're obviously very committed to driving Prime and it's important to the company. Your question on China, part of the biggest thing to is more progress in selection on the Amazon Global Store. So this is our website -- this is the offer that allows Chinese customers to shop from the U.S. website, Amazon.com, with prices in RMB and with Chinese language pages. So it's focused on really items that may be hard to get. And Amazon is really trying to become the trusted source for many of these goods. And so really that's a big part of the focus. And if you've been tracking that number over time, we're now up over 10 million which is a good progress on that front."

Trailing 12 months operating cash flow increased 42% to $12.7 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $4.4 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow, less lease principal repayments, increased to $3.9 billion, up from $2.4 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow, less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases, increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $492 million. Worldwide revenue increased 31% to $30.4 billion or 30%, excluding the $166 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 28%. Worldwide seller units represented 49% of paid units.
Now I'll talk about our segment result. North America revenue grew 28% to $17.7 billion. North America operating income was $702 million, a 4% operating margin, compared with $348 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact of foreign exchange. International revenue grew 30% to $9.8 billion. Excluding the $184 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 28%. International operating loss was $135 million compared with a loss of $189 million in the prior year. This includes $40 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Amazon Web Services revenue grew 58% to $2.9 billion. Amazon Web Services operating income was $718 million, a 24.9% operating margin compared with $305 million in the prior year. Our operating income was $1.3 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year-over-year. This includes $45 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Net income was $857 million or $1.78 per diluted share compared with a net income of $92 million or $0.19 per diluted share.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. For Q3 2016, we expect net sales of between $31 billion and $33.5 billion or growth of between 22% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rate. Operating income to be between $50 million and $650 million compared with $406 million in third quarter 2015.

Yes, let me talk a little bit about guidance and I'll incorporate the answer to the fulfillment question. So you'll notice on the top line guidance of $31 billion to $33.5 billion or 22% to 32% growth incorporates the Prime Day results and I can talk more about that later, but Prime Day was very successful for us. It was up 60% on a world wide basis over the prior year and it was also a record day for Amazon devices, as well sellers and customers alike. In the bottom line, you'll need to remember that Q3 is typically a low -- lower operating income quarter as we prepare for Q4, the holiday peak. It's a little bit more exaggerated this year in that we're opening 18 fulfillment centers this quarter. To put that in perspective, we launched 6 in Q3 of last year. This will bring us up to 21 net FCs for the year by the end of Q3 and that compares with 10 fulfillment centers for the first 3 quarters of last year on a net basis. So why we expanding so much? If you remember back to Q4 and the capacity constraints we had in Q4, primarily due to really strong FBA growth, we talked a lot in the Q4 call about the operational cost of that in Q4, customers well taken cared of, but we had additional fulfillment costs from being so tight in capacity. This year, with that in mind and then knowing that our growth rate is actually accelerating on a unit basis, we're -- Q2 with 28% unit growth for paid units, but fulfilled by -- Units Fulfilled by amazon is much higher than that due to the growth of Prime and FBA. That compares with last year in Q2 when we saw 22% unit growth, or 600 basis points faster growth in Q2 this year than last year and that 22% last year trended 26% in Q4. So it ramped up in the back end of the year. So a lot of data points there, but the bottom line is that there's a large step up in the amount of fulfillment capacity in Q2 -- excuse me, Q3 versus Q2. Just a couple of other factors while I'm at it for guidance. We're also nearly doubling our content spend in the second half of this year versus the second half of 2015. We have a great slate of new Amazon originals coming out later this year, both in the U.S. and internationally and we're nearly tripling our number of new Amazon originals shows, TV shows and movies compared with the second half of last year. There are other investments, certainly, that are increasing sequentially. I point to [indiscernible] AWS, but primarily [indiscernible] Q3 guidance, I would say are the operational ramp and also the increase in digital content spend."

We don't give -- obviously, we don't give segment-based guidance, but to your question about AWS, we actually see 9 availabilities in 4 reasons coming out in the next -- in the coming year. The impact on short-term is pretty much indistinguishable from the growth that we're seeing in our expansion of our base customers and our existing regions, so we don't see a large step up for the addition of new regions relative to the large and rapid growth in the business itself. We do think that it does take benefit both for ourselves and for our customers because of the expansion and we're happy to have [indiscernible] region in Mumbai this past quarter. We think, when we expand geographically, [indiscernible] customers will run more their workload on AWS. Sometimes they have local latency concerns or security issues that require them to run things in their country, so that helps. And we also open up to new customers when we add these regions. So not a large impact on Q3 guidance, but certainly, exciting investment for our customer base."

And the second question is, why is it that the rate at which you are deploying Prime Now is so much greater or faster than the rate at which you are deploying Fresh?

On tech and content, that's going to be a combination of our people costs related to many areas of the website and also the infrastructure costs to run it, at both the Amazon Web Services and also the Amazon site. We've been seeing some great efficiencies in our infrastructure, both internally as Amazon and also as part of AWS. We have great people working on not only better efficiency, but also driving costs out of our acquisition prices. So there's a lot of great work going on there. I think that's what you're seeing reflected in the tech and content line. Again, this can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but we're happy with the current trend and you'll see it in the AWS margins. On Prime Now versus fresh, the -- they are separate -- sorry. The -- we'll point out in Q2 that we added London and Boston as 2 new sites in London. First, AmazonFresh and that was the first international location. But we've been running AmazonFresh for 7 years -- excuse me, since 2007 in Seattle and what you've seen is we've been testing the model, we've been expanding in North America and more so, we've been expanding within the cities that we're in, adding ZIP Codes, adding additional customers. So the move into Boston and also now into London give us some really good data points. And as -- it's a great customer feature for the Prime offering. Prime Now is a little bit easier to build up from scratch, I would say. It has a different purpose, although some of the products overlap. Again, this is more about immediacy of 1-hour and 2-hour delivery of a curated list of important products that people need in a short period of time. So they have different roles. Some of the products overlap, of course, but we -- we're happy with both and we think that customers like both of them."

We continue to expand the list of Prime benefits for customers to make it more valuable and none is more valuable than FBA, which we've talked a lot about the value of Prime to FBA and vice versa. FBA is bringing more [indiscernible] selection to Prime and then the growth of Prime and the type of customers that utilize Prime and their buying behavior is a great attraction for other FBA sellers.

Let me start with the second question first. So on Prime Video, again, we're very happy with the customer adoption of Prime Video and we know the customers love it, we like the results that we see, particularly with the free trial conversion, the renewal rates for subscription. So it's clearly working. I mentioned earlier how we're doubling the investment rate in second half of the year versus the last year second half and we're tripling the Amazon originals content. That originals content, for TVs and movies, that content can be used globally. We've talked a bit about our Prime launch in India and alluded to the fact that we'll be having video soon in India, both local content and also Amazon originals. So stay tuned for that, many more to announce on that today. On the variance to guidance, what I'll say is we came in the very high end of our revenue guidance. I would say that our business model usually reacts well to high-volume as we get a really good leverage on our fixed expenses. So the best part of what we saw, very strong operating efficiencies as we hit essentially the highest end of our revenue guidance. But we do have a lot of diverse profit streams here at Amazon and a lot of investments going on at any point in time. I think I heard a question there about level of investment. We continue to invest heavily. In fact, I just called out a few things that are going to be stepping up in investment levels in Q3, mostly ops and digital content. So we continue to invest on behalf of customers, but we also work very hard, efficiently scaling the businesses that we have. So we take both roles very seriously around here, the best thing on the right -- in right things, seeing results on behalf of customers and also driving efficiencies. And there can be timing, quarter-to-quarter, the operating margin and levels of investment can fluctuate, but certainly, continue to expand."

Trailing 12 months free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $4.4 billion. Trailing 12 months",388,"Thanks, Darin. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. 
Trailing 12 months operating cash flow increased 42% to $12.7 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $4.4 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $3.9 billion, up from $2.4 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $492 million. Worldwide revenue increased 31% to $30.4 billion, or 30%, excluding the $166 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 28%. Worldwide seller units represented 49% of paid units.
Now I'll talk about our segment result. North America revenue grew 28% to $17.7 billion. North America operating income was $702 million, a 4% operating margin compared with $348 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. International revenue grew 30% to $9.8 billion. Excluding the $184 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 28%. International operating loss was $135 million compared with a loss of $189 million in the prior year. This includes $40 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. 
Amazon Web Services revenue grew 58%, $2.9 billion. Amazon Web Services operating income was $718 million, a 24.9% operating margin compared with $305 million in the prior year. Our operating income was $1.3 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year-over-year. This includes $45 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Net income was $857 million or $1.78 per diluted share compared with a net income of $92 million or $0.19 per diluted share.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. For Q3 2016, we expect net sales of between $31 billion and $33.5 billion, or growth of between 22% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rate. Operating income to be between $50 million and $650 million compared with $406 million in third quarter 2015. 
We're grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.

So you'll notice on the top line guidance of $31 billion to $33.5 billion, or 22% to 32% growth incorporates the Prime Day results, and I can talk more about that later, but Prime Day was very successful for us. It was up 60% on a worldwide-basis over the prior year and it was also a record day for Amazon devices, as well sellers and customers alike. In the bottom line, you'll need to remember that Q3 is typically a low -- lower operating income quarter as we prepare for Q4, the holiday peak. It's a little bit more exaggerated this year in that we're opening 18 fulfillment centers this quarter. To put that in perspective, we launched 6 in Q3 of last year. This will bring us up to 21 net FCs for the year by the end of Q3 and that compares with 10 fulfillment centers for the first 3 quarters of last year on a net basis. So why we expanding so much? If you remember back to Q4 and the capacity constraints we had in Q4, primarily due to really strong FBA growth, we talked a lot in the Q4 call about the operational cost of that in Q4, customers well taken care of, but we had additional fulfillment costs from being so tight in capacity. This year, with that in mind and then knowing that our growth rate is actually accelerating on a unit basis, we're -- Q2 with 28% unit growth for paid units, but fulfilled by -- units Fulfilled by Amazon is much higher than that due to the growth of Prime and FBA. That compares with last year in Q2 when we saw 22% unit growth, or 600 basis points faster growth in Q2 this year than last year and that 22% last year trended at 26% in Q4. So it ramped up in the back end of the year. So a lot of data points there, but the bottom line is that there is a large step up in the amount of fulfillment capacity in Q2 -- excuse me, Q3 versus Q2. There's couple of other factors while I'm added for guidance. We're also nearly doubling our content spend in the second half of this year versus the second half of 2015. We have a great slate of new Amazon originals coming out later this year, both in the U.S. and internationally, and we're nearly tripling our number of new Amazon original shows -- TV shows and movies compared with the second half of last year. There are other investments, certainly, that are increasing sequentially. I point to India and AWS, but primarily the 2 biggest issues in Q3 guidance, I would say, are the operational ramp and also the increase in the digital content spend."

We do think that it does pay benefits both for ourselves and for our customers because of the expansion, and we're happy to added the region in Mumbai this past quarter. We think, when we expand geographically, existing customers will run more their workloads on AWS. Sometimes they have local latency concerns or security issues that require them to run things in their country, so that helps, and we also open up to new customers when we add these regions.

As I look at your tech and content expense as a percentage of revenues, we see year-on-year decline for the last 2 quarters, which is something we hadn't seen since mid-2010, and of course, this is reflected in the AWS margins. Can you help us understand what has driven this significant change in relative trajectory in tech and content expenses? And the second question is, why is it that the rate at which you are deploying Prime Now is so much greater or faster than the rate at which you are deploying a Fresh? Now what's different between them? And how is it that -- now you are deploying Fresh in new markets, but not as fast as Prime Now and what drives the difference?"

On tech and content, that's going to be a combination of our people cost related to many areas of the website and also the infrastructure costs to run it, at both the Amazon Web Services and also the Amazon site. We've been seeing some great efficiencies in our infrastructure, both internally as Amazon and also as part of AWS. We have great people working on, not only better efficiency, but also driving costs out of our acquisition prices. So there is a lot of great work going on there. I think that's what you're seeing reflected in the tech and content line. Again, this can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but we are happy with the current trend and you'll see it in the AWS margins. On Prime Now versus Fresh, the -- they are separate -- sorry. The -- we'll point out in Q2 that we added London and Boston as 2 new sites in London for AmazonFresh and that was the first international location. But we've been running AmazonFresh for 7 years -- excuse me, since 2007 in Seattle, and what you've seen as we've been testing the model, we've been expanding in North America, and more so, we've been expanding within the cities that we're in, adding ZIP Codes, adding additional customers. So the move into Boston and also now to London give us some really good data points. And as -- it's a great customer feature for the Prime offering. Prime Now is a little bit easier to build up from scratch, I would say. It has a different purpose, although some of the products overlap. Again, this is more about immediacy of 1-hour and 2-hour delivery of a curated list of important products that people needed in short period of time. So they have different roles. Some of the products overlap, of course, but we're happy with both, and we think that customers like both of them."

The low prices, vast selection and convenience continue to resonate with customers. Prime membership increases and selection through FBA makes Prime more valuable.

We continue to expand the list of Prime benefits for customers to make it more valuable and none is more valuable than FBA, which we've talked a lot about the value of Prime to FBA and vice versa. FBA is bringing more Prime -- multiple selection to Prime and then the growth of Prime and the type of customers that utilize Prime and their buying behavior is a great attraction for other FBA sellers.

Let me start with the second question first. So on Prime Video, again, we're very happy with the customer adoption of Prime Video, and we know the customers love it, like the results that we see, particularly with the free trial conversion, the renewal rates for subscription. So it's clearly working. I mentioned earlier how we're doubling the investment rate in second half of the year versus the last year second half, and we're tripling the Amazon originals content. That originals content, for TVs and movies, that content can be used globally. We've talked a bit about our Prime launch in India and alluded to the fact that we'll be having video soon in India, both local content and also Amazon originals. So stay tuned for that, I don't have anymore to announce on that today. On the variance to guidance, what I'll say is, we came into very high end of our revenue guidance. I would say that our business model usually reacts well to high-volume, as we get a really good leverage on our fixed expenses. So that's part of what we saw, very strong operating efficiencies as we hit, essentially the highest end of our revenue guidance. But we do have a lot of diverse profit streams here at Amazon and a lot of investments going on at any point in time. I think I heard a question there about levels of investment. We continue to invest heavily. In fact, I just called out a few things that are going to be stepping up in investment levels in Q3, mostly ops and digital content. So we continue to invest on behalf of customers, but we also work very hard at efficiencies in scaling the businesses that we have. So we take both roles very seriously around here, best thing on the right -- in the right things, seeing results on behalf of customers and also driving efficiencies. And there can be timing, quarter-to-quarter, the operating margin and levels of investment can fluctuate, but certainly, continued to expand."

So very creative and the customers' response has been really strong. So we are very excited about the Prime program.

Trailing 12 months operating cash flow increased 42% to $12.7 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $4.4 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $3.9 billion, up from $2.4 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $492 million. Worldwide revenue increased 31% to $30.4 billion, or 30%, excluding the $166 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 28%. Worldwide seller units represented 49% of paid units.
Now I'll talk about our segment result. North America revenue grew 28% to $17.7 billion. North America operating income was $702 million, a 4% operating margin compared with $348 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. International revenue grew 30% to $9.8 billion. Excluding the $184 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 28%. International operating loss was $135 million compared with a loss of $189 million in the prior year. This includes $40 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. 
Amazon Web Services revenue grew 58%, to $2.9 billion. Amazon Web Services operating income was $718 million, a 24.9% operating margin compared with $305 million in the prior year. Our operating income was $1.3 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year-over-year. This includes $45 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Net income was $857 million or $1.78 per diluted share compared with a net income of $92 million or $0.19 per diluted share.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. For Q3 2016, we expect net sales of between $31 billion and $33.5 billion, or growth of between 22% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income to be between $50 million and $650 million compared with $406 million in the third quarter 2015. 
We're grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks. And with that, I'll hand it back to Darin."

So you'll notice on the top line guidance of $31 billion to $33.5 billion, or 22% to 32% growth incorporates the Prime Day results, and I can talk more about that later, but Prime Day was very successful for us. It was up 60% on a worldwide basis over the prior year and it was also a record day for Amazon devices as well, sellers and customers alike. In the bottom line, you'll need to remember that Q3 is typically a low -- lower operating income quarter as we prepare for Q4, the holiday peak. It's a little bit more exaggerated this year in that we're opening 18 fulfillment centers this quarter. To put that in perspective, we launched 6 in Q3 of last year. This will bring us up to 21 net FCs for the year by the end of Q3 and that compares with 10 fulfillment centers for the first 3 quarters of last year on a net basis. So why we expanding so much? If you remember back to Q4 and the capacity constraints we had in Q4, primarily due to really strong FBA growth, we talked a lot in the Q4 call about the operational cost of that in Q4.  We had customers well taken care of, but we had additional fulfillment costs from being so tight in capacity. This year, with that in mind and then knowing that our growth rate is actually accelerating on a unit basis, we're -- Q2 was 28% unit growth for paid units, but fulfilled by -- units Fulfilled by Amazon is much higher than that due to the growth of Prime and FBA. That compares with last year in Q2 when we saw 22% unit growth, or 600 basis points faster growth in Q2 this year than last year and that 22% last year trended at 26% in Q4. So it ramped up in the back end of the year. So a lot of data points there, but the bottom line is that there is a large step up in the amount of fulfillment capacity in Q2 -- excuse me, Q3 versus Q2. There's a couple of other factors while I'm at it for guidance. We're also nearly doubling our content spend in the second half of this year versus the second half of 2015. We have a great slate of new Amazon originals coming out later this year, both in the U.S. and internationally, and we're nearly tripling our number of new Amazon original shows -- TV shows and movies compared with the second half of last year. There are other investments, certainly, that are increasing sequentially. I point to India and AWS, but primarily the 2 biggest issues in Q3 guidance, I would say, are the operational ramp and also the increase in the digital content spend."

We do think that it does pay benefits both for ourselves and for our customers because of the expansion, and we're happy to have added the region in Mumbai this past quarter. We think, when we expand geographically, existing customers will run more of their workloads on AWS. Sometimes they have local latency concerns or security issues that require them to run things in their country, so that helps, and we also open up to new customers when we add these regions.

But we've been running AmazonFresh for 7 years -- excuse me, since 2007 in Seattle, and what you've seen as we've been testing the model, we've been expanding in North America, and more so, we've been expanding within the cities that we're in, adding ZIP Codes, adding additional customers. So the move into Boston and also now to London gives us some really good data points. And as -- it's a great customer feature for the Prime offering. Prime Now is a little bit easier to build up from scratch, I would say. It has a different purpose, although some of the products overlap. Again, this is more about immediacy of 1-hour and 2-hour delivery of a curated list of important products that people need in a short period of time. So they have different roles. Some of the products overlap, of course, but we're happy with both, and we think that customers like both of them."

We don't have anything to disclose on physical orders from -- orders through Echo. On Amazon Web Services margin, again, this was primarily due to efficiencies gained on our infrastructure, better utilization, better cost out. There is a certainly a mix of products and services. I don't have a bridge for you on whether that's helpful or hurtful, but these margins in AWS will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and that's what you're seeing, but we're very happy with the year-over-year improvement."

The low prices, vast selection and convenience continue to resonate with customers. Prime membership increases and selection through FBA makes Prime more valuable. So it's a bit as simple as that in the consumer business in North America and international. We are seeing great acceptance of Prime and usage of Prime benefits. We continue to expand the list of Prime benefits for customers to make it more valuable and none is more valuable than FBA, which we've talked a lot about the value of Prime to FBA and vice versa. FBA is bringing more Prime -- multiple selection to Prime and then the growth of Prime and the type of customers that utilize Prime and their buying behavior is a great attraction for other FBA sellers. So that is essentially what we are seeing, and we're certainly pleased with the customer response to those offers globally."

So on Prime Video, again, we're very happy with the customer adoption of Prime Video, and we know that customers love it. We like the results that we see, particularly with the free trial conversion, the renewal rates for subscriptions. So it's clearly working. I mentioned earlier how we're doubling the investment rate in second half of the year versus the last year second half, and we're tripling the Amazon originals content. That originals content, for TVs and movies, that content can be used globally. We've talked a bit about our Prime launch in India and alluded to the fact that we'll be having video soon in India, both local content and also Amazon originals. So stay tuned for that, I don't have any more to announce on that today. On the variance to guidance, what I'll say is, we came into the very high end of our revenue guidance. I would say that our business model usually reacts well to high-volume, as we get a really good leverage on our fixed expenses. So that's part of what we saw, very strong operating efficiencies as we hit, essentially the highest end of our revenue guidance. But we do have a lot of diverse profit streams here at Amazon and a lot of investments going on at any point in time. I think I heard a question there about levels of investment. We continue to invest heavily. In fact, I just called out a few things that are going to be stepping up in investment levels in Q3, mostly ops and digital content. So we continue to invest on behalf of customers, but we also work very hard at efficiencies and scaling the businesses that we have. So we take both roles very seriously around here, investing on the right -- in the right things, seeing results on behalf of customers and also driving efficiencies. And there can be timing -- quarter-to-quarter, the operating margin and levels of investment can fluctuate, but certainly, continued to expand."

And I would say, the rapid pace of innovation continues to stretch our lead in that dimension. We have had 422 new significant services and features added in the first half of this year -- that's a faster pace than last year when we added 722 services and features.

So India, we're very encouraged by what we've seen so far in India, both with customers and also sellers at the third-party seller market. You heard that we launched the Prime program this week, which will be a whole new experience for Indian customers. In hundreds of cities we'll now have unlimited free 1-day and 2-day delivery, and we also mentioned that Prime Video is coming there, both Indian and global content. We're also starting to see exclusive online sales partnerships. Recently, we've got partnerships with Motorola, Samsung, Lenovo on select phones. But more importantly, again, we really like the opportunity in India. We like the initial results that we see from customers and also sellers. We really like our team there. We have a great team of Amazonians who have been very inventive in India. Every time there's an obstacle or something that's different from the U.S. or another major business, they'll invent around it, whether it's shipping method or a payment method or whatever. So very creative and the customer response has been really strong. So we are very excited about the Prime program. We think it'll enter into a new chapter in India, and we've seen great success every country in the world that we've launched Prime, and we feel India is going to be no different. So we're looking forward to seeing what we can do on behalf of the Indian customer."

Trailing 12 months free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $4.4 billion. Trailing 12 months",390,"Thanks, Darin. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. 
Trailing 12 months operating cash flow increased 42% to $12.7 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $4.4 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $3.9 billion, up from $2.4 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $492 million. Worldwide revenue increased 31% to $30.4 billion, or 30%, excluding the $166 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 28%. Worldwide seller units represented 49% of paid units.
Now I'll talk about our segment result. North America revenue grew 28% to $17.7 billion. North America operating income was $702 million, a 4% operating margin compared with $348 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. International revenue grew 30% to $9.8 billion. Excluding the $184 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 28%. International operating loss was $135 million compared with a loss of $189 million in the prior year. This includes $40 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. 
Amazon Web Services revenue grew 58%, to $2.9 billion. Amazon Web Services operating income was $718 million, a 24.9% operating margin compared with $305 million in the prior year. Our operating income was $1.3 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year-over-year. This includes $45 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Net income was $857 million or $1.78 per diluted share compared with a net income of $92 million or $0.19 per diluted share.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. For Q3 2016, we expect net sales of between $31 billion and $33.5 billion, or growth of between 22% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income to be between $50 million and $650 million compared with $406 million in the third quarter 2015. 
We're grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks. And with that, I'll hand it back to Darin."

So you'll notice on the top line guidance of $31 billion to $33.5 billion, or 22% to 32% growth incorporates the Prime Day results, and I can talk more about that later, but Prime Day was very successful for us. It was up 60% on a worldwide basis over the prior year and it was also a record day for Amazon devices as well, sellers and customers alike. In the bottom line, you'll need to remember that Q3 is typically a low -- lower operating income quarter as we prepare for Q4, the holiday peak. It's a little bit more exaggerated this year in that we're opening 18 fulfillment centers this quarter. To put that in perspective, we launched 6 in Q3 of last year. This will bring us up to 21 net FCs for the year by the end of Q3 and that compares with 10 fulfillment centers for the first 3 quarters of last year on a net basis. So why we expanding so much? If you remember back to Q4 and the capacity constraints we had in Q4, primarily due to really strong FBA growth, we talked a lot in the Q4 call about the operational cost of that in Q4. We had customers well taken care of, but we had additional fulfillment costs from being so tight in capacity. This year, with that in mind and then knowing that our growth rate is actually accelerating on a unit basis, we're -- Q2 was 28% unit growth for paid units, but fulfilled by -- units Fulfilled by Amazon is much higher than that due to the growth of Prime and FBA. That compares with last year in Q2 when we saw 22% unit growth, or 600 basis points faster growth in Q2 this year than last year and that 22% last year trended at 26% in Q4. So it ramped up in the back end of the year. So a lot of data points there, but the bottom line is that there is a large step up in the amount of fulfillment capacity in Q2 -- excuse me, Q3 versus Q2. There's a couple of other factors while I'm at it for guidance. We're also nearly doubling our content spend in the second half of this year versus the second half of 2015. We have a great slate of new Amazon originals coming out later this year, both in the U.S. and internationally, and we're nearly tripling our number of new Amazon original shows -- TV shows and movies compared with the second half of last year. There are other investments, certainly, that are increasing sequentially. I point to India and AWS, but primarily the 2 biggest issues in Q3 guidance, I would say, are the operational ramp and also the increase in the digital content spend."

We do think that it does pay benefits both for ourselves and for our customers because of the expansion, and we're happy to have added the region in Mumbai this past quarter. We think, when we expand geographically, existing customers will run more of their workloads on AWS. Sometimes they have local latency concerns or security issues that require them to run things in their country, so that helps, and we also open up to new customers when we add these regions. So not a large impact on Q3 guidance, but certainly an exciting investment for our customer base."

We've been seeing some great efficiencies in our infrastructure, both internally as Amazon and also as part of AWS. We have great people working on not only better efficiency, but also driving costs out of our acquisition prices. So there is a lot of great work going on there. I think that's what you're seeing reflected in the tech and content line. Again, this can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but we are happy with the current trend and you see it in the AWS margins. On Prime Now versus Fresh, the -- they are separate -- sorry. The -- we'll point out in Q2 that we added London and Boston as 2 new sites in London for AmazonFresh and that was the first international location. But we've been running AmazonFresh for 7 years -- excuse me, since 2007 in Seattle, and what you've seen as we've been testing the model, we've been expanding in North America, and more so, we've been expanding within the cities that we're in, adding ZIP Codes, adding additional customers. So the move into Boston and also now to London gives us some really good data points. And as -- it's a great customer feature for the Prime offering. Prime Now is a little bit easier to build up from scratch, I would say. It has a different purpose, although some of the products overlap. Again, this is more about immediacy of 1-hour and 2-hour delivery of a curated list of important products that people need in a short period of time. So they have different roles. Some of the products overlap, of course, but we're happy with both, and we think that customers like both of them."

So there's a lot of uses that we're seeing for Echo, a lot ties into our Prime Music offering. It's just a great way to access Prime Music and more and more the Amazon site. We don't have anything to disclose on physical orders from -- orders through Echo. On Amazon Web Services margin, again, this was primarily due to efficiencies gained on our infrastructure, better utilization, better cost out. There is a certainly a mix of products and services. I don't have a bridge for you on whether that's helpful or hurtful, but these margins in AWS will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and that's what you're seeing, but we're very happy with the year-over-year improvement."

The low prices, vast selection and convenience continue to resonate with customers. Prime membership increases and selection through FBA makes Prime more valuable. So it's a bit as simple as that in the consumer business in North America and international. We are seeing great acceptance of Prime and usage of Prime benefits. We continue to expand the list of Prime benefits for customers to make it more valuable and none is more valuable than FBA, which we've talked a lot about the value of Prime to FBA and vice versa. FBA is bringing more Prime -- multiple selection to Prime and then the growth of Prime and the type of customers that utilize Prime and their buying behavior is a great attraction for other FBA sellers. So that is essentially what we are seeing, and we're certainly pleased with the customer response to those offers globally."

I was just wondering as you look back at where you guided relative to actual, where do you think that delta was most pronounced? Why wouldn't we assume that maybe, at least on the margin, the investment intensity in the business has maybe decelerated a bit? And second, on Prime Video, just was wondering, considering what the main competitor there is doing, i.e. expanding aggressively around the world, you guys have been growing in a more measured manner. Is that still the plan? Or are you guys interested in maybe, instead of moving into few countries, kind of expand globally in one fell swoop?"

So on Prime Video, again, we're very happy with the customer adoption of Prime Video, and we know that customers love it. We like the results that we see, particularly with the free trial conversion, the renewal rates for subscriptions. So it's clearly working. I mentioned earlier how we're doubling the investment rate in second half of the year versus the last year second half, and we're tripling the Amazon originals content. That originals content, for TVs and movies, that content can be used globally. We've talked a bit about our Prime launch in India and alluded to the fact that we'll be having video soon in India, both local content and also Amazon originals. So stay tuned for that, I don't have any more to announce on that today. On the variance to guidance, what I'll say is, we came into the very high end of our revenue guidance. I would say that our business model usually reacts well to high-volume, as we get a really good leverage on our fixed expenses. So that's part of what we saw, very strong operating efficiencies as we hit, essentially the highest end of our revenue guidance. But we do have a lot of diverse profit streams here at Amazon and a lot of investments going on at any point in time. I think I heard a question there about levels of investment. We continue to invest heavily. In fact, I just called out a few things that are going to be stepping up in investment levels in Q3, mostly ops and digital content. So we continue to invest on behalf of customers, but we also work very hard at efficiencies and scaling the businesses that we have. So we take both roles very seriously around here, investing on the right -- in the right things, seeing results on behalf of customers and also driving efficiencies. And there can be timing -- quarter-to-quarter, the operating margin and levels of investment can fluctuate, but certainly, continued to expand."

What we focus on is innovating on behalf of customers and expanding the geographic footprint to make our services more widely available. You can see us continuing to invest in things like new application services higher up the stack, additional technologies that will make integrating with AWS seamless for those companies that have a hybrid IT environment and then continue to add functionality for data, analytics, mobile, Internet of Things, machine learning offerings, things like that, that will add greater and greater value for AWS customers. And I would say, the rapid pace of innovation continues to stretch our lead in that dimension. We have had 422 new significant services and features added in the first half of this year -- that's a faster pace than last year when we added 722 services and features. So we feel good about the business, the position we're in and our position with customers."

On transportation, I think your question was about whether that's impacting our short-term results. No -- the answer is no. We are certainly expanding our service offerings on the transportation side, and we have been for many years, things like sortation centers and delivery methods.

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. 
Please note unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. 
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, October 27, 2016 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. 
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which are posted in our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world events; the rate of growth of the Internet online commerce and; cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investment, restructurings or legal settlement. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question."

Well, we'll continue to invest in the business where we are seeing significant customer traction. And the things I'm [ph] to mention fall into that category. But the largest individual reasons for the ramp-up in investment between first half and second half of this year and also second half of this year versus last -- second half of last year are the things I mentioned on the call last quarter. First, video content and marketing associated with that is nearly doubling year-over-year in the second half of the year and continues to be a large increase both Q3 and Q4. In the quarter, in Q3, we added 18 fulfillment centers, and we've added 5 more in October. For the year, we'll add 26. Most of those are in North America, but that compares to 14 last year. And I would look -- looking back, there's a -- the last time we had double-digit increase in fulfillment centers was in 2012, when we added 11 in the third quarter. So it was a rare aggregation of start-ups in Q3 and Q4 that's helping us position better for Q4 volumes because paid unit growth continues to be strong, and Amazon fulfilled unit growth, which includes what we shipped with FBA, is significantly higher than even that. So we are continuing to build for high AFN or Amazon-Fulfilled Network demand, including both retail and FBA. The number of warehouses that we added represents a 30% increase in square footage year-over-year. Last year, we increased square footage by just under 20%. The definition of square footage in this case is all of our warehouses plus our sortation at delivery centers, so it's pretty much our -- in customer service. So it's pretty much our full square footage that supports our operations. So those will dissipate as we -- as they burn it. We've talked about fulfillment centers' initial start-up costs include increase in fixed costs but also variable costs as we train workers and also bring in inventory. And there's a number of transportation costs also related to the start-up of a new fulfillment center, both inbound and outbound. And they're inherently less efficient than more established, mature buildings. So there will be a cycle where those will be more productive next year than they are this year and more productive in 2018 than they are in 2017. So what you're seeing essentially in the second half of this year is the step-up in investment, primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment, but also things like Echo and Alexa, which we're adding a lot of resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional service at rapid growth in that business."

So I can't forecast it for you into next year quite yet, but we certainly had productivity and additional costs at Q3 and even into Q4 this year as we build that space -- the additional capacity. Again, the underlying reason for that capacity build is the strength in paid units and even more so in the units that we're fulfilling, driven by our FBA program. The FBA program is the key pillar of our Prime offering. It adds selection. It makes Prime stronger. And then, itself reinforces [indiscernible] where Prime then --  success attracts more sellers. So we're delighted to have that problem. We're just working very hard to get capacity in place and in productive use for Q4 and beyond."

Certainly a business where we continue to work on costs and profitability, but we are finding it a very attractive and service to our customers, which is what we're after. And similarly, but not exactly the same as the Prime Now business, which has a similar overlap on things besides groceries. It's a slightly different model, obviously, where we're more about immediacy and a smaller list of items available in 1 to 2 hours. But there's certainly a lot of people who are using that for groceries and consumable items. And that is now up to 40 cities across 7 countries versus 17 this time last year. We're also adding restaurant, Amazon restaurant delivery, to the Prime Now offer in 19 metropolitan cities in the U.S. And that's up from 2 last year. So we continue to believe consumables, groceries are a key part of the offer to customers. And we are playing with very different models to see which works and for what needs. So we're very happy with the AmazonFresh. And we've now expanded quite a bit in DC [ph] this year.

Not only do we lower the prices of our products, but we also create new services that are cheaper that customers can switch to. So they can also benefit from that as well. So if you step back and say, why do people choose AWS? I'll give you the points I said last quarter.

We've added new, more new significant features and services this year already than we had all of last year when we added 722. We have a partner and customer ecosystem.

What I can tell you again is that we've ramped up considerably. We've been investing quite openly in a lot of areas and continue to do so. We are experiencing a ramp-up, if you will, in the second half of this year, particularly tied to AWS -- excuse me, the fulfillment center spend and also the video content spend. So we will continue to invest in video content. We'll continue to invest in fulfillment space to handle higher and higher paid unit volumes and shipped unit volumes. We'll continue to invest in things that we believe enhance the customer experience, particularly the Prime experience. Devices, we'll continue to invest in this, particularly Alexa and the Echo products. We'll continue to invest in getting faster and faster shipping methods for our customers. We believe that's working. We're very happy with the results. We're very happy with -- all the customers we have, and particularly the Prime customers that we have. As far as long-term operating margins, I can't forecast that right now. I can't forecast that for AWS business either. We are again working on 2 fronts. We are honing the businesses that we're in and making them as efficient and profitable as possible, while also investing very pointedly and very wisely, we believe, in things that will enhance customer experience and create lasting businesses for us down the line. We've said we want things that customers will love, that can grow to be large, with strong financial returns and durable and can last for decades. So that's still our mission. We have pillars of the business right now with Marketplace and AWS Prime, and we're actively looking for a fourth and fifth pillar."

Please note unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. 
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, October 27, 2016 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. 
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which are posted in our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world events; the rate of growth of the Internet online commerce and; cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investment, restructurings or legal settlement. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

Well, we'll continue to invest in the business where we are seeing significant customer traction. And the things I'm [ph] to mention fall into that category. But the largest individual reasons for the ramp-up in investment between first half and second half of this year and also second half of this year versus last -- second half of last year are the things I mentioned on the call last quarter. First, video content and marketing associated with that is nearly doubling year-over-year in the second half of the year and continues to be a large increase both Q3 and Q4. In the quarter, in Q3, we added 18 fulfillment centers, and we've added 5 more in October. For the year, we'll add 26. Most of those are in North America, but that compares to 14 last year. And I would look -- looking back, there's a -- the last time we had double-digit increase in fulfillment centers was in 2012, when we added 11 in the third quarter. So it was a rare aggregation of start-ups in Q3 and Q4 that's helping us position better for Q4 volumes because paid unit growth continues to be strong, and Amazon fulfilled unit growth, which includes what we shipped with FBA, is significantly higher than even that. So we are continuing to build for high AFN or Amazon-Fulfilled Network demand, including both retail and FBA. The number of warehouses that we added represents a 30% increase in square footage year-over-year. Last year, we increased square footage by just under 20%. The definition of square footage in this case is all of our warehouses plus our sortation at delivery centers, so it's pretty much our -- in customer service. So it's pretty much our full square footage that supports our operations. So those will dissipate as we -- as they burn it. We've talked about fulfillment centers' initial start-up costs include increase in fixed costs but also variable costs as we train workers and also bring in inventory. And there's a number of transportation costs also related to the start-up of a new fulfillment center, both inbound and outbound. And they're inherently less efficient than more established, mature buildings. So there will be a cycle where those will be more productive next year than they are this year and more productive in 2018 than they are in 2017. So what you're seeing essentially in the second half of this year is the step-up in investment, primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment, but also things like Echo and Alexa, which we're adding a lot of resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional service at rapid growth in that business."

So I can't forecast it for you into next year quite yet, but we certainly had productivity and additional costs at Q3 and even into Q4 this year as we build that space -- the additional capacity. Again, the underlying reason for that capacity build is the strength in paid units and even more so in the units that we're fulfilling, driven by our FBA program. The FBA program is the key pillar of our Prime offering. It adds selection. It makes Prime stronger. And then, itself reinforces [indiscernible] where Prime then --  success attracts more sellers.

So yes, this quarter, we launched in Northern Virginia, Maryland, Dallas and Chicago. We also launched a new pricing plan, which is the monthly $14.99 add-on to Prime in the U.S. And we've expanded, as you know, previously into London. We're very happy with the progression, both in the geographies that we've been in for a long time, where we're continuing to add [ph] additional neighborhoods, and also these new cities. Certainly a business where we continue to work on costs and profitability, but we are finding it a very attractive and service to our customers, which is what we're after. And similarly, but not exactly the same as the Prime Now business, which has a similar overlap on things besides groceries. It's a slightly different model, obviously, where we're more about immediacy and a smaller list of items available in 1 to 2 hours. But there's certainly a lot of people who are using that for groceries and consumable items. And that is now up to 40 cities across 7 countries versus 17 this time last year. We're also adding restaurant, Amazon restaurant delivery, to the Prime Now offer in 19 metropolitan cities in the U.S. And that's up from 2 last year. So we continue to believe consumables, groceries are a key part of the offer to customers. And we are playing with very different models to see which works and for what needs. So we're very happy with the AmazonFresh. And we've now expanded quite a bit in DC [ph] this year. And Prime Now, we're also very happy with, although obviously, the economics in that business are even tougher.

The thing I can tell you about pricing is that our pricing is -- price reductions are a core part of our philosophy, of course. We had a price decrease in Q3, and that was our 52nd since we started this business. So it's -- we are comfortable with price decreases. Not only do we lower the prices of our products, but we also create new services that are cheaper that customers can switch to. So they can also benefit from that as well. So if you step back and say, why do people choose AWS? I'll give you the points I said last quarter. Basically what we hear are the functionality and pace of innovation is greater than our competition. We've added new, more new significant features and services this year already than we had all of last year when we added 722. We have a partner and customer ecosystem. You've heard about the VMware deal we signed this quarter. So we continue to extend with partners and build ecosystems that better support our customers. And finally, experience, we've been in this business a long time, longer than anyone else. And we've used that time to make our product and services better.

As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. 
Please note unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. 
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, October 27, 2016 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. 
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which are posted in our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world events; the rate of growth of the Internet online commerce and; cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investment, restructurings or legal settlement. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question."

Well, we'll continue to invest in the business where we are seeing significant customer traction. And the things I'm [ph] to mention fall into that category. But the largest individual reasons for the ramp-up in investment between first half and second half of this year and also second half of this year versus last -- second half of last year are the things I mentioned on the call last quarter. First, video content and marketing associated with that is nearly doubling year-over-year in the second half of the year and continues to be a large increase both Q3 and Q4. In the quarter, in Q3, we added 18 fulfillment centers, and we've added 5 more in October. For the year, we'll add 26. Most of those are in North America, but that compares to 14 last year. And I would look -- looking back, there's a -- the last time we had double-digit increase in fulfillment centers was in 2012, when we added 11 in the third quarter. So it was a rare aggregation of start-ups in Q3 and Q4 that's helping us position better for Q4 volumes because paid unit growth continues to be strong, and Amazon fulfilled unit growth, which includes what we shipped with FBA, is significantly higher than even that. So we are continuing to build for high AFN or Amazon-Fulfilled Network demand, including both retail and FBA. The number of warehouses that we added represents a 30% increase in square footage year-over-year. Last year, we increased square footage by just under 20%. The definition of square footage in this case is all of our warehouses plus our sortation at delivery centers, so it's pretty much our -- in customer service. So it's pretty much our full square footage that supports our operations. So those will dissipate as we -- as they burn it. We've talked about fulfillment centers' initial start-up costs include increase in fixed costs but also variable costs as we train workers and also bring in inventory. And there's a number of transportation costs also related to the start-up of a new fulfillment center, both inbound and outbound. And they're inherently less efficient than more established, mature buildings. So there will be a cycle where those will be more productive next year than they are this year and more productive in 2018 than they are in 2017. So what you're seeing essentially in the second half of this year is the step-up in investment, primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment, but also things like Echo and Alexa, which we're adding a lot of resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional service at rapid growth in that business."

So I can't forecast it for you into next year quite yet, but we certainly had productivity and additional costs at Q3 and even into Q4 this year as we build that space -- the additional capacity. Again, the underlying reason for that capacity build is the strength in paid units and even more so in the units that we're fulfilling, driven by our FBA program. The FBA program is the key pillar of our Prime offering. It adds selection. It makes Prime stronger. And then, itself reinforces [indiscernible] where Prime then --  success attracts more sellers. So we're delighted to have that problem. We're just working very hard to get capacity in place and in productive use for Q4 and beyond."

Certainly a business where we continue to work on costs and profitability, but we are finding it a very attractive and service to our customers, which is what we're after. And similarly, but not exactly the same as the Prime Now business, which has a similar overlap on things besides groceries. It's a slightly different model, obviously, where we're more about immediacy and a smaller list of items available in 1 to 2 hours. But there's certainly a lot of people who are using that for groceries and consumable items. And that is now up to 40 cities across 7 countries versus 17 this time last year. We're also adding restaurant, Amazon restaurant delivery, to the Prime Now offer in 19 metropolitan cities in the U.S. And that's up from 2 last year. So we continue to believe consumables, groceries are a key part of the offer to customers. And we are playing with very different models to see which works and for what needs. So we're very happy with the AmazonFresh. And we've now expanded quite a bit in DC [ph] this year.

We've added new, more new significant features and services this year already than we had all of last year when we added 722. We have a partner and customer ecosystem. You've heard about the VMware deal we signed this quarter. So we continue to extend with partners and build ecosystems that better support our customers. And finally, experience, we've been in this business a long time, longer than anyone else. And we've used that time to make our product and services better. So there was going to be a lot of winners in this space, as we said. But we are very happy with our position and the customer reception to our products."

What I can tell you again is that we've ramped up considerably. We've been investing quite openly in a lot of areas and continue to do so. We are experiencing a ramp-up, if you will, in the second half of this year, particularly tied to AWS -- excuse me, the fulfillment center spend and also the video content spend. So we will continue to invest in video content. We'll continue to invest in fulfillment space to handle higher and higher paid unit volumes and shipped unit volumes. We'll continue to invest in things that we believe enhance the customer experience, particularly the Prime experience. Devices, we'll continue to invest in this, particularly Alexa and the Echo products. We'll continue to invest in getting faster and faster shipping methods for our customers. We believe that's working. We're very happy with the results. We're very happy with -- all the customers we have, and particularly the Prime customers that we have. As far as long-term operating margins, I can't forecast that right now. I can't forecast that for AWS business either. We are again working on 2 fronts. We are honing the businesses that we're in and making them as efficient and profitable as possible, while also investing very pointedly and very wisely, we believe, in things that will enhance customer experience and create lasting businesses for us down the line. We've said we want things that customers will love, that can grow to be large, with strong financial returns and durable and can last for decades. So that's still our mission. We have pillars of the business right now with Marketplace and AWS Prime, and we're actively looking for a fourth and fifth pillar."

In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which are posted in our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world events; the rate of growth of the Internet online commerce and; cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investment, restructurings or legal settlement.

Well, we'll continue to invest in the business, where we are seeing significant customer traction. And the things I'm [ph] to mention fall into that category. But the largest individual reasons for the ramp-up in investment between first half and second half of this year and also second half of this year versus last -- second half of last year are the things I mentioned on the call last quarter. First, video content and marketing associated with that is nearly doubling year-over-year in the second half of the year and continues to be a large increase both Q3 and Q4. In the quarter, in Q3, we added 18 fulfillment centers, and we've added 5 more in October. For the year, we'll add 26. Most of those are in North America, but that compares to 14 last year. And I would look -- looking back, there's a -- the last time we had double-digit increase in fulfillment centers was in 2012, when we added 11 in the third quarter. So it was a rare aggregation of start-ups in Q3 and Q4 that's helping us position better for Q4 volumes because paid unit growth continues to be strong, and Amazon fulfilled unit growth, which includes what we shipped with FBA, is significantly higher than even that. So we are continuing to build for high AFN or Amazon-Fulfilled Network demand, including both retail and FBA. The number of warehouses that we added represents a 30% increase in square footage year-over-year. Last year, we increased square footage by just under 20%. The definition of square footage in this case is all of our warehouses plus our sortation at delivery centers, so it's pretty much our -- in customer service. So it's pretty much our full square footage that supports our operations. So those will dissipate as we -- as they burn it. We've talked about fulfillment centers' initial start-up costs include increase in fixed costs but also variable costs as we train workers and also bring in inventory. And there's a number of transportation costs also related to the start-up of a new fulfillment center, both inbound and outbound. And they're inherently less efficient than more established, mature buildings. So there will be a cycle where those will be more productive next year than they are this year and more productive in 2018 than they are in 2017. So what you're seeing essentially in the second half of this year is the step-up in investment, primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment, but also things like Echo and Alexa, which we're adding a lot of resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional service at rapid growth in that business."

So I can't forecast it for you into next year quite yet, but we certainly had productivity and additional costs at Q3 and even into Q4 this year as we build that space -- the additional capacity. Again, the underlying reason for that capacity build is the strength in paid units and even more so in the units that we're fulfilling, driven by our FBA program. The FBA program is the key pillar of our Prime offering. It adds selection. It makes Prime stronger. And then, that [indiscernible] reinforcing loop, where Prime then -- Prime's success attracts more sellers. So we're delighted to have that problem.

So yes, this quarter, we launched in Northern Virginia, Maryland, Dallas and Chicago. We also launched a new pricing plan, which is the monthly $14.99 add-on to Prime in the U.S. And we've expanded, as you know, previously into London. We're very happy with the progression, both in the geographies that we've been in for a long time, where we're continuing to add ZIP codes and additional neighborhoods, and also these new cities. Certainly a business where we continue to work on costs and profitability, but we are finding it a very attractive and service to our customers, which is what we're after. And similarly, but not exactly the same as the Prime Now business, which has a similar overlap on things besides groceries. It's a slightly different model, obviously, where we're more about immediacy and a smaller list of items available in 1 to 2 hours. But there's certainly a lot of people who are using that for groceries and consumable items. And that is now up to 40 cities across 7 countries versus 17 this time last year. We're also adding restaurant, Amazon restaurant delivery, to the Prime Now offer in 19 metropolitan cities in the U.S. And that's up from 2 last year. So we continue to believe consumables, groceries are a key part of the offer to customers. And we are playing with very different models to see which works and for what needs. So we're very happy with the AmazonFresh. And we've now expanded quite a bit, as we've seen this year. And Prime Now, we're also very happy with, although obviously, the economics in that business are even tougher. But we do feel that our scale makes that possible because of our -- the geographic footprint and how close we are to customers."

Your question on fulfillment expenses, I can't extend the guidance into next year. We will do that obviously at the end of next quarter, but I would say we are -- this was an extraordinary step-up, as I mentioned, in Q3 that is tied to very rapid growth in not only paid units, but Amazon-fulfilled units. So really, our forecast for additional capacity additions and the rate of addition will be tied to those growth factors as well. So we'll have to see. We right now are working on getting the capacity in. It was very lumpy this time. It was 18 warehouses in 1 quarter and another 5 in the first 3 weeks of the next quarter.

The thing I can tell you about pricing is that our pricing is -- price reductions are a core part of our philosophy, of course. We had a price decrease in Q3, and that was our 52nd since we started this business. So it's -- we are comfortable with price decreases. Not only do we lower the prices of our products, but we also create new services that are cheaper that customers can switch to. So they can also benefit from that as well. So if you step back and say, why do people choose AWS? I'll give you the points I said last quarter. Basically, what we hear are the functionality and pace of innovation is greater than our competition. We've added new, more new, significant features and services this year already than we had all of last year when we added 722. We have a partner and customer ecosystem. You've heard about the VMware deal that we signed this quarter. So we continue to extend with partners and build ecosystems that better support our customers. And finally, experience, we've been in this business a long time, longer than anyone else. And we've used that time to make our product and services better.

It's hard to compare India to any other country. It's very different in its stage and structure. Being a third-party market has cost a lot of invention on our side. We're being creative. The team there in India has been very creative on whenever they find a roadblock or something that does not exist in another country, they create it themselves. Whether that's delivering stations to working with smaller merchants to -- you name it. So we're very happy with both of the customer engagement that we're seeing and also the seller engagement, which is very important in India, and very pleased with the team that runs it over there and the way they work with teams throughout the world."

Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. 
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which are posted in our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world events; the rate of growth of the Internet online commerce and; cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investment, restructurings or legal settlement.

And the things that I'm not allowed to mention fall into that category. But the largest individual reasons for the ramp-up in investment between first half and second half of this year and also second half of this year versus last -- second half of last year are the things I mentioned on the call last quarter. First, video content and marketing associated with that is nearly doubling year-over-year in the second half of the year and continues to be a large increase both Q3 and Q4. In the quarter, in Q3, we added 18 fulfillment centers, and we've added 5 more in October. For the year, we'll add 26. Most of those are in North America, but that compares to 14 last year. And I would look -- looking back, there's a -- the last time we had double-digit increase in fulfillment centers was in 2012, when we added 11 in the third quarter. So it was a rare aggregation of start-ups in Q3 and Q4 that's helping us position better for Q4 volumes because paid unit growth continues to be strong, and Amazon fulfilled unit growth, which includes what we ship with FBA, is significantly higher than even that. So we are continuing to build for high AFN or Amazon-Fulfilled Network demand, including both retail and FBA. The number of warehouses that we added represents a 30% increase in square footage year-over-year. Last year, we increased square footage by just under 20%. The definition of square footage in this case is all of our warehouses plus our sortation and delivery centers. So it's pretty much our -- and customer service. So it's pretty much our full square footage that supports operations. So those will dissipate as we -- as they burn in. We've talked about fulfillment centers' initial start-up costs include increase in fixed costs but also variable costs as we train workers and also bring in inventory. And there's a number of transportation costs also related to the start-up of a new fulfillment center, both inbound and outbound. And they're inherently less efficient than more established, mature buildings. So there will be a cycle where those will be more productive next year than they are this year and more productive in 2018 than they are in 2017. So what you're seeing essentially in the second half of this year is the step-up in investment, primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment, but also things like Echo and Alexa, which we're adding a lot of resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional service at rapid growth in that business."

So I can't forecast it for you into next year quite yet, but we certainly had productivity and additional costs at Q3 and even into Q4 this year as we build that space -- the additional capacity. Again, the underlying reason for that capacity build is the strength in paid units and even more so in the units that we're fulfilling, driven by our FBA program. The FBA program is the key pillar of our Prime offering. It adds selection. It makes Prime stronger. And then, that's a self-reinforcing loop where Prime then -- Prime's success attracts more sellers. So we're delighted to have that problem. We're just working very hard to get capacity in place and in productive use for Q4 and beyond."

We're very happy with the progression, both in the geographies that we've been in for a long time, where we're continuing to add ZIP codes and additional neighborhoods, and also these new cities. Certainly a business where we continue to work on costs and profitability, but we are finding it a very attractive service to our customers, which is what we're after. Similarly, but not exactly the same as the Prime Now business, which has a similar overlap on things besides groceries. It's a slightly different model, obviously, where we're more about immediacy and a smaller list of items available in 1 to 2 hours. But there's certainly a lot of people who are using that for groceries and consumable items. And that is now up to 40 cities across 7 countries versus 17 this time last year. We're also adding restaurant, Amazon restaurant delivery, to the Prime Now offer in 19 metropolitan cities in the U.S. And that's up from 2 last year. So we continue to believe consumables, groceries are a key part of the offer to customers. And we are playing with very different models to see which works and for what needs. So we're very happy with the AmazonFresh. And we've now expanded quite a bit, as we've seen this year. And Prime Now, we're also very happy with, although obviously, the economics in that business are even tougher.

So yes, we are looking forward to a great holiday, and that includes working with our shipping partners both in the U.S. and globally. We've worked very closely with them to line up capacity, share capacity plans. We certainly have additional delivery capability of our own. But with all of our partners, we work well in advance of the holiday to get our plans in place. We feel very confident. We're looking forward to a good holiday not only for customers but also for sellers. On your question on AWS, I didn't listen to the Google call, but -- you'll have to fill me in on that later. The thing I can tell you about pricing is that our pricing is -- price reductions are a core part of our philosophy, of course. We had a price decrease in Q3, and that was our 52nd since we started this business. So it's -- we are comfortable with price decreases. Not only do we lower the prices of our products, but we also create new services that are cheaper that customers can switch to. So they can also benefit from that as well. So if you step back and say, why do people choose AWS? I'll give you the points I said last quarter. Basically, what we hear are the functionality and pace of innovation is greater than our competition. We've added new, more new, significant features and services this year already than we had all of last year when we added 722. We have a partner and customer ecosystem. You've heard about the VMware deal that we signed this quarter. So we continue to extend with partners and build ecosystems that better support our customers. And finally, experience. We've been in this business a long time, longer than anyone else. And we've used that time to make our products and services better. So there was going to be a lot of winners in this space, as we said, but we are very happy with our position and the customer reception to our products."

What I can tell you again is that we've ramped up considerably. We've been investing quite openly in a lot of areas and continue to do so. We are experiencing a ramp-up, if you will, in the second half of this year, particularly tied again to AWS -- excuse me, the fulfillment center spend and also the video content spend. So we will continue to invest in video content. We'll continue to invest in fulfillment space to handle higher and higher paid unit volumes and shipped unit volumes. We'll continue to invest in things that we believe enhance the customer experience, particularly the Prime experience. Devices, we'll continue to invest in this, particularly Alexa and the Echo products. We'll continue to invest in getting faster and faster shipping methods for our consumers. We believe that's working. We're very happy with the results. We're very happy with the -- all the customers we have, but particularly the Prime customers that we have. As far as long-term operating margins, I can't forecast that right now. I can't forecast that for AWS business either. We are again working on 2 fronts. We are honing the businesses that we're in and making them as efficient and profitable as possible, while also investing very pointedly and very wisely, we believe, in things that will enhance customer experience and create lasting businesses for us down the line. We've said we want things that customers will love, that can grow to be large, will have strong financial returns and durable and can last for decades. So that's still our mission. We have pillars of the business right now with Marketplace, AWS and Prime, and we're actively looking for our fourth and fifth pillar."

I would characterize it as continued investments.

Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. 
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which are posted in our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world events; the rate of growth of the Internet online commerce and; cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investment, restructurings or legal settlement.

And the things that I'm not allowed to mention fall into that category. But the largest individual reasons for the ramp-up in investment between first half and second half of this year and also second half of this year versus last -- second half of last year are the things I mentioned on the call last quarter. First, video content and marketing associated with that is nearly doubling year-over-year in the second half of the year and continues to be a large increase both Q3 and Q4. In the quarter, in Q3, we added 18 fulfillment centers, and we've added 5 more in October. For the year, we'll add 26. Most of those are in North America, but that compares to 14 last year. And I would look -- looking back, there's a -- the last time we had double-digit increase in fulfillment centers was in 2012, when we added 11 in the third quarter. So it was a rare aggregation of start-ups in Q3 and Q4 that's helping us position better for Q4 volumes because paid unit growth continues to be strong, and Amazon fulfilled unit growth, which includes what we ship with FBA, is significantly higher than even that. So we are continuing to build for high AFN or Amazon-Fulfilled Network demand, including both retail and FBA. The number of warehouses that we added represents a 30% increase in square footage year-over-year. Last year, we increased square footage by just under 20%. The definition of square footage in this case is all of our warehouses plus our sortation and delivery centers. So it's pretty much our -- and customer service. So it's pretty much our full square footage that supports operations. So those will dissipate as we -- as they burn in. We've talked about fulfillment centers' initial start-up costs include increase in fixed costs but also variable costs as we train workers and also bring in inventory. And there's a number of transportation costs also related to the start-up of a new fulfillment center, both inbound and outbound. And they're inherently less efficient than more established, mature buildings. So there will be a cycle where those will be more productive next year than they are this year and more productive in 2018 than they are in 2017. So what you're seeing essentially in the second half of this year is the step-up in investment, primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment, but also things like Echo and Alexa, which we're adding a lot of resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional service at rapid growth in that business."

Again, the underlying reason for that capacity build is the strength in paid units and even more so in the units that we're fulfilling, driven by our FBA program. The FBA program is the key pillar of our Prime offering. It adds selection. It makes Prime stronger. And then, that's a self-reinforcing loop where Prime then -- Prime's success attracts more sellers. So we're delighted to have that problem. We're just working very hard to get capacity in place and in productive use for Q4 and beyond."

Specifically, things like the database migration tool that are helpful for customers when they move production databases to -- or from on-premises to the cloud with virtually no downtime. And also, many of our AWS customers are beginning to choose and continue to choose the AWS scheme and conversion tool which really switches database engines to get out of old guard proprietary databases and on to AWS. And so we'll continue to react to customer needs, and that will include opening up new regions. We've opened up Ohio this past quarter, and we've highlighted that we'll have another -- a number of regions coming online in a few months.

We're very happy with the progression, both in the geographies that we've been in for a long time, where we're continuing to add ZIP codes and additional neighborhoods, and also these new cities. Certainly a business where we continue to work on costs and profitability, but we are finding it a very attractive service to our customers, which is what we're after. Similarly, but not exactly the same as the Prime Now business, which has a similar overlap on things besides groceries. It's a slightly different model, obviously, where we're more about immediacy and a smaller list of items available in 1 to 2 hours. But there's certainly a lot of people who are using that for groceries and consumable items. And that is now up to 40 cities across 7 countries versus 17 this time last year. We're also adding restaurant, Amazon restaurant delivery, to the Prime Now offer in 19 metropolitan cities in the U.S. And that's up from 2 last year. So we continue to believe consumables, groceries are a key part of the offer to customers. And we are playing with very different models to see which works and for what needs. So we're very happy with the AmazonFresh. And we've now expanded quite a bit, as we've seen this year. And Prime Now, we're also very happy with, although obviously, the economics in that business are even tougher.

The thing I can tell you about pricing is that our pricing is -- price reductions are a core part of our philosophy, of course. We had a price decrease in Q3, and that was our 52nd since we started this business. So it's -- we are comfortable with price decreases. Not only do we lower the prices of our products, but we also create new services that are cheaper that customers can switch to. So they can also benefit from that as well. So if you step back and say, why do people choose AWS? I'll give you the points I said last quarter. Basically, what we hear are the functionality and pace of innovation is greater than our competition. We've added new, more new, significant features and services this year already than we had all of last year when we added 722. We have a partner and customer ecosystem. You've heard about the VMware deal that we signed this quarter. So we continue to extend with partners and build ecosystems that better support our customers. And finally, experience. We've been in this business a long time, longer than anyone else. And we've used that time to make our products and services better.

And many of them turn into full-time employees after the holiday. So nothing specific on the wage pressure front. As you probably saw, our headcount is up 38% year-over-year in Q3. And that is a continuation of a lot of ops roles that are supporting the site to man the opening of the fulfillment centers we talked about, new Fresh locations, Prime Now. But also a lot of hiring in our tech areas, particularly around AWS and also the Echo, Alexa areas."

It's hard to compare India to any other country. It's very different in its stage and structure. Being a third-party market has caused a lot of invention on our side. We're being creative. The team there in India has been very creative on whenever they find a roadblock or something that does not exist in another country, they create it themselves. Whether that's delivering stations to working with small merchants to -- you name it. So we're very happy with both of the customer engagement that we're seeing and also the seller engagement, which is very important in India, and very pleased with the team that runs it over there and the way they work with teams throughout the world."
