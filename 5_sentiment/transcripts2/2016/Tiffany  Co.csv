We issued Tiffany's full year and fourth quarter financial results earlier today and hope you had a chance to read the news release. On today's agenda, I'll review sales results.

We issued Tiffany's full year and fourth quarter financial results earlier today and hope you had a chance to read the news release. 
On today's agenda, I'll review sales results. Ralph will cover the rest of the earnings statements, the balance sheet and 2016 outlook, and then Frederic will close with some comments on strategies before we then answer your questions. 
Before continuing, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
Now let's proceed. I think we can begin with a candid assessment that overall financial results in 2015 were disappointing. 
On the positive side, we accomplished many ongoing strategic initiatives tied to expanding and optimizing our store base and web presence, introducing new product designs that resonated with customers, managing inventories well and achieving strong free cash flow. 
We improved Tiffany's gross margin by a full point in the year and managed our SG&A expenses prudently while increasing marketing spending. However, a worldwide sale increase of only 2% on a constant-exchange-rate basis and a 3% decline as reported, combined with a 9% decline in EPS, excluding charges in 2014 and 2015, clearly did not meet our initial targets. 
For a good part of the year, we achieved healthy sales growth on a constant-exchange-rate basis in most regions outside the U.S. But sales were negatively affected by the translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar. 
In the Americas, our largest region, we faced the daunting challenges in the U.S. of sharply lower foreign tourist spending, along with the weaker sales to domestic customers. And then the year concluded on a softer note in most markets around the world. 
While we can attribute some of the pressure on results to the strong U.S. dollar and other macro factors that affected consumer spending, both with local customers and foreign tourists, which we expect will continue into 2016, as Frederic will discuss, we continue to focus on catalysts to drive our business effectively and efficiently as we invest in longer-term growth opportunities. 
And wrapping up a summary on a positive note, our disciplined inventory management enabled us to achieve our objective for free cash flow. While a portion of our cash gets reinvestment to growing our business, we also were pleased to return cash to shareholders through dividends, including our 14th dividend increase in the past 13 years and share repurchases with our board authorizing new and larger repurchase program in January. 
So now let's look at sales performance in our various regions. 
First, there were no meaningful changes in geographical mix in 2015 versus 2014. With the Americas, again, representing just under 50% of worldwide sales, followed by Asia-Pacific at 24%, Japan at 13% and Europe at 12%. 
In the Americas on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total and comp store sales for the full year were down 2% and 4% and the trends were a bit softer in the fourth quarter with declines of 6% and 8%. 
In dollars, total sales declined 4% in the full year and 8% in the fourth quarter reflecting lower unit volume across categories, especially in silver jewelry under $500, partly offset by favorable pricing mix. 
I already mentioned the adverse effects from the strong us dollar on foreign tourists sales in the Americas. Although it cannot be tracked precisely, we now estimate that foreign tourists sales represent less than 1/4 of U.S. sales, but roughly 40% of sales in the New York flagship store. 
We saw a marked deceleration in Chinese tourist spending in the fourth quarter in the Americas and frankly, in most other regions as well. 
In addition, it's worth noting that domestic sales were also generally soft across the U.S. in varying degrees in the full year and more so in the fourth quarter. However, we were pleased with local currency total sales growth in Canada and Latin America. 
During the year, we added a net of 2 stores in the Americas, opening in the U.S. in the Miami Design District, in Ottawa, Canada and in Santiago, Chile and closing the U.S. store in the Mohegan Sun Resort. 
We also relocated a few stores in the Americas region in line with our strategy to optimize the store base and continued with our worldwide program to renovate stores to a new design esthetic. 
In the Asia-Pacific region on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales in the full year rose 3% and comparable-store sales were unchanged while total and comp store sales softened in the fourth quarter, declining 3% and 8%. 
Within the region, Greater China is comprised of the 51 total stores we operate across China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau and represents more than half of total sales to the region. 
For the year, we experienced some growth throughout most markets in the Asia-Pacific region, led by strength in Mainland China and Australia, but we also saw substantial softness in Hong Kong. 
Growth decelerated in the fourth quarter across most of the region, reflecting the further softening of Chinese tourist spending that I alluded to earlier. Spending within China was strong throughout the fourth quarter but it's been more volatile since then. 
In addition, there's clearly no way to predict when sales growth will resume in Hong Kong so we're assuming that softness will continue through 2016. 
When measured in U.S dollars, total Asia-Pacific sales declined 2% in the full year and 8% in the fourth quarter due to generally lower jewelry unit volume in most categories, partly offset by higher average pricing mix. 
We continue to be pleased with our progress in developing brand awareness at Tiffany with the Chinese customer. Volatile economies, currencies and stock markets certainly affect short term spending by customers of all nationalities, including those in China. However, we remain committed to serving the growing desires of those customers, seeking extraordinary jewelry of the finest quality and with a wonderful in-store experience. 
There was substantial store activity across the Asia-Pacific region during the year with a net addition of 8 stores. We opened 11 stores, including 5 in China, 2 in Macau and 1 each in Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. We also closed 3 existing stores in the region, including 1 each in China, Korea and Taiwan. 
Now turning to Japan. We had a very successful year in 2015. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 10% and comp store sales rose 5% in the full year and we finished with increases of 12% in total sales and 10% comps in the fourth quarter. 
Throughout the year, results in Japan benefited from higher foreign tourist spending, predominantly Chinese, while domestic customer spending fluctuated and was roughly unchanged for the full year. 
The weaker yen versus the dollar had a substantially negative effect on the translation of those sales into dollars in the year although less so in the fourth quarter. 
And when measured in dollars, total sales in Japan declined 2% in the full year but rose 9% in the fourth quarter. 
We kept the number of company-operated stores in Japan unchanged at 56. Although during the year, we expanded 2 stores and relocated 2 others. 
We also achieved strong sales growth in Europe through most of the year on a constant-exchange-rate basis due to a combination of higher foreign tourist spending, likely tied to a weak euro and pound as well as local customer demand but sales growth decelerated considerably in the fourth quarter especially in France, following the tragedy in Paris that reverberated across other countries in the region as well. 
However, for the full year on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total and comparable-store sales rose 12% and 9% with strength across Continental Europe and the U.K., which represents about 40% of our European sales. 
In the fourth quarter, however, total sales rose 2% and comp store sales declined 3% due to the pronounced softness in France and mixed results elsewhere. 
When translated into U.S. dollars, total sales in Europe declined 1% in the full year and 6% in the fourth quarter, partly due to modest declines in jewelry unit volume as well as lower average price that was largely currency-related. 
We were active on the storefront in Europe in 2015, opening our first store in Geneva and our second in Madrid. And we also enhanced our store presence in London with relocations in both Harrods and Selfridges. 
We also now include our Moscow store, which has been posting strong growth since opening in early 2014 within the Europe region instead of in the other segment. 
We concluded 2015 with 41 stores in Europe and last month, we opened a third store in Rome, on Via dei Condotti. 
Lastly, other sales declined 13% in the full year and were down 6% in the fourth quarter. Both periods were affected by comp store sales declines in our stores in the UAE and there were lower wholesale sales of diamonds in the full year. 
For my comments in each region, you can see that it was an active year on the store development front as we continue to optimize our store base partly with store openings but also with a substantial number of renovations and relocations and some closings. The ultimate objective is to drive better top line growth through stronger comparable-store sales growth rather than from simply opening substantial numbers of stores. 
For the full year, we opened 16 stores and closed 4, representing a 4% increase in the number of company-operated stores and a corresponding 4% increase in worldwide gross square footage. 
Our plan for 2016 is to open 11 stores across most regions while also closing or relocating some existing ones, resulting in a 2% net increase in company-operated retail square footage.  The longer term expectation is to approximately maintain that square footage growth rate. 
In terms of store productivity, worldwide sales per gross square foot for company-operated stores declined slightly to $2,900 compared with $3,100 per foot in 2014 resulting from the 4% increase in worldwide square footage but lesser growth in sales. 
By region, sales productivity in 2015 ranged from $4,300 in Asia-Pacific, to $3,100 in Japan, to $2,900 in Europe, to $2,300 in the Americas region. Of course, keep in mind that the negative translation effect on sales from the strong dollar had a meaningful effect on any declines in productivity. 
Before concluding the regional sales review, it's worth reminding everyone of the meaningful benefits that we derive from complementing our store presence with our website, which reinforce brand and product awareness and can drive store traffic. 
E-commerce sales in dollars rose modestly in the full year, which was better than the 3% worldwide sales decline and continued to represent 6% of worldwide sales. This dual focus on stores and online supports our global strategy to enhance our relationships with customers and optimize their overall experiences with Tiffany. 
Finally, from a merchandising perspective, the decline in fourth quarter sales did not include any significant differences in performance among our product categories on a worldwide basis. 
For the full year, the 3% worldwide sales decline in dollars or the 2% increase on the constant-exchange-rate basis included virtually in line performance relative to overall sales for the statements sign and solitaire jewelry category although with strong sales growth of statement of jewelry, in line relative performance for the fashion jewelry category although with continued strong gold jewelry sales and a slight relative underperformance in the engagement jewelry category although a new marketing campaign that we launched last month is intended to address that engagement softness. 
We were pleased with customer response to new products that we introduced in the fashion and fine jewelry categories, including design reinterpretations in our Return to Tiffany and Infinity Collection, which have been successful in mitigating some of the softness in silver jewelry sales under $500. Our new designs in the Victoria and Bow fine jewelry collections, including diamonds, the continued success of the Tiffany T Collection, which reached the highest sales level ever for a jewelry collection in its first 12 months and we were pleased with sales of our new watch collections, including the CT60 and the East-West collections. 
So that covers the regional and products sales highlights, and I'll now turn the call over to Ralph"

Before looking at the rest of the results, I would like to reinforce a few points. Sales growth was challenged by the strong U.S. dollar throughout the year, both from its effect on the translation of results and the effect on tourist spending in the U.S. 
While we saw our higher gross margin in the full year and fourth quarter, the operating margin was pressured all year by the lack of sales growth in the resulting sales deleverage on SG&A expenses. 
A 9% decline in EPS for the full year, excluding charges in 2015 and 2014 was below our initial expectation a year-ago that had called for minimal growth. However, we managed inventories more efficiently, meeting our objective to keep inventory growth below sales growth and finished the year generating higher amount of free cash flow than initially planned. 
We returned cash to shareholders through substantial share repurchases and another increase in dividend and we expect a further strengthening of the dollar, along with challenging and volatile external conditions that affect customer spending to continue to pressure results in 2016 and especially in the first half of the year. 
Let's look at the rest of the earnings statement, the balance sheet and our forecast. 
Gross margin rose in the full year and the fourth quarter. We benefited throughout the year to varying degrees from favorable product input costs while sales mix fluctuated during the year. 
We also took price increases during the year that address most of the pressure from the strong dollar and has enabled us to restore our global pricing structure pretty much back to normal levels. 
Our forecast for gross margin in 2016 calls for some increase, primarily due to lower product input costs as well as benefits from price increases taken within the past year and anticipated modest increases in the coming year. But our expectation for minimal sales growth will continue to put some pressure on gross margin as it will be difficult to get sales leverage on fixed cost. 
Selling, general administrative expenses rose 5% in the full year and 6% in the fourth quarter. Both of those results included translation benefits from the strong dollar. You would also note that the full year SG&A expenses included a $38 million of loan impairment charge with $10 million of that in the second quarter and $28 million in the fourth quarter related to a diamond mining company in Sierra Leone and also included a $9 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter for staffing and occupancy reductions. 
Excluding these charges, SG&A growth in the quarter and year was due to store-related spending and higher pension costs, partially offset by lower variable cost. 
In addition, marketing spending rose in the full year to represent 7.4% of net sales from 6.7% in the prior year. Although marketing spending declined in the fourth quarter, as we expected, due to disproportionately high spending in the fourth quarter of 2014, tied to the launch of the Tiffany T Collection. 
We expect SG&A expenses in 2016 to increase over 2015's SG&A expense, excluding charges, due to increased store-related and marketing expenses with some benefit from lower pension costs. 
Our projections for 2016 of a modest increase in the gross margin and for SG&A expense growth exceeding sales growth, mostly due to higher store-related costs, will result in a decline in operating margin for the year. 
Interest and other expenses net declined in the full year due to our refinancing of long term debt to lower interest rates in October of 2014. Interest and other expenses net were about flat in the fourth quarter. 
We are projecting interest and other expenses net to be approximately unchanged in 2016. 
The effective tax rate for the full year was slightly higher than last year and we are projecting a fractionally lower rate in 2016. 
Getting it all up, net earnings declined 5% the fourth quarter and 9% in the full year, excluding charges in both years. This followed a 13% increase in net earnings in 2014, excluding charges. 
Putting together our assumptions for 2016, we arrive at a forecast calling for net earnings ranging from unchanged to a mid-single-digit decline compared to the $3.83 per diluted share excluding charges in 2015. 
While we expect a gradually improving peso sales over 4 quarters, we also expect a similar projection in terms of earnings, with earnings declining in the first quarter by 15% to 20%, a 5% to 10% decline in the second quarter and then followed by a resumption of growth in the second half. 
Most importantly, we will continue throughout the year to focus on investing in improving the business despite a choppy and uncertain environment. 
Looking at our balance sheet. We finished the year in a very solid position. Net inventories of $2.2 billion at January 31 were 6% lower than the prior year end. Raw materials and work-in-process inventories declined 4% and finished goods inventories declined 7%, reflecting more efficient inventory management. 
Even excluding the translation effect from the strong dollar, net inventories would have declined 4% in the year compared with the 2% increase in worldwide net sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis.  We are projecting inventories in 2016 to be roughly unchanged. 
Accounts receivable of $206 million was 6% higher than a year-ago, largely reflecting in-house credit tied to strong sales of statement jewelry but the receivable turnover remained at a very high 21x per year. 
Our capital expenditures totaled $253 million in 2015 versus $247 million in the prior year and represented 6% of sales in both years. 
Approximately half of our CapEx is store-related for openings, renovations and relocations with that store-related mix shifting more towards renovations and relocations. 
CapEx also currently include substantial spending during a multiyear period to introduce new IT systems with a major focus on a global customer relationship management system and a new inventory management system. 
We began 2015 projecting that we would generate free cash flow of at least $400 million and later in the year, revive the forecast upward to at least $500 million based on better inventory management. We were pleased to now report that actual free cash flow for 2015 amounted to $561 million and for 2016, we are projecting to generate free cash flow of at least $400 million. 
In addition to continuing to reinvest some in the business, we regularly evaluate opportunities to return cash to shareholders through dividends growth and share repurchases. We were quite active in this area in 2015. 
In the second quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 5%, which represented the 14th dividend increase in the past 13 years and as the year progress, we stepped up the pace of share repurchases to take advantage of a lower stock price. 
For the full year, we spent $220 million to repurchase 2.8 million shares at an average cost of $78 per share. 
In January, our Board replaced an existing $300 million repurchase program that had only about $59 million of authorization remaining and replaced it with a new authorization permitting repurchase of up to $500 million of common stock. 
At January 31, approximately $494 million remained available for repurchase under that new program that expires in January of 2019. 
Factoring everything we've highlighted, we finished the year with cash and short term investments of $887 million and $1 billion of short term and long term debt that represented 38% of stockholders' equity. 
Despite the lower earnings, Tiffany's full year return on assets, as recorded, was approximately 9% and the return on stockholders' equity was approximately 16% close to our long term objectives for at least a 10% ROA and at least a 15% ROE. 
Looking out longer-term, we believe that by continuing to invest in sales growth opportunities and managing cost effectively, helped by more favorable external environment, Tiffany will be well positioned to achieve improved and sustainable financial performance. 
Given this, our earnings objective ultimately includes reaching high single digits net earnings growth, driven by mid-single-digit worldwide net sales growth on a constant-exchange-rate basis by also continuing to generate strong free cash flow. 
Wrapping up my remarks, it was a challenging year with overall disappointing financial performance. However, that should not overshadow the progress we are making to operate Tiffany's business more profitably over the longer term. 
I will now turn the call over to Frederic and then we'll take some questions."

While our financial results in 2015 were clearly disappointing, I also believe that challenges can help us to learn and sharpen our focus on a number of important initiatives within our control in order to derive better financial performance going forward. And I believe that Tiffany has many fantastic growth opportunities available. 
On our call a year-ago, I've talked about a clear road map for the future, focused on the store experience, products, marketing, the supply chain and margin improvement. I believe we've made progress in all of those areas in 2015 and we have continued opportunities to do more in 2016 and beyond. 
Our overall objective is to drive superior total shareholder return through sales growth, improving margins and cash flow, strengthening the brand and the customer experience and achieving operational excellence. 
The key strategy focuses on client and what I mean by that is to better engage with our customers through a more conservative approach in our stores through enhanced visual merchandising presentations through better customer data analytics using a new global CRM system and through optimizing our store base. 
In regard to stores, we were active in 2015 through openings, relocations, renovations and a few closings. 
In the coming year, we will continue to be very focused on optimizing our existing store base with a 2% net increase in worldwide square footage that includes opening 11 new stores across most region. 
As we continue to increase Tiffany's worldwide store base, our ultimate objective is to ensure that we are best positioned in every market where we are present. 
We were pleased with customer reaction to the new design that we've introduced in 2015. Those designs included extraordinary statement pieces in the art of the C collection in our Blue Book that was introduced to very strong demand. 
And at the other extreme, we worked toward improving our entry-level silver jewelry assortment with some encouraging early results. 
We were also very proud to make our official strategic reentry into the watch category and double our watch sales albeit on a very small base. 
I also believe that our marketing footprint and digital media and catalogs is more effectively communicating Tiffany as a global luxury brand would appeal to both the gift giver and the self purchaser. 
With an extraordinary product assortment and a 170-year age year heritage, we have strong messages to convey to customers. 
I'm pleased to say that we attracted some highly skilled new members of management at various levels and in different areas of responsibility over the past year and now have experienced teams in place at the global and regional level to execute our strategies. 
And despite the pressure on sales and earnings in 2015, I was pleased that we increased our gross margin and managed the expenses prudently and we've all maintained a strong financial position. 
While we invested in our business, in stores, in product sourcing and in developing new IT systems, we were still able to return a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders. 
I'll close by reiterating our objective to reinforce Tiffany's position amongst the world's most important luxury brands. External pressures on our business will eventually abate and we believe that the long term global growth opportunities for the Tiffany brand are compelling. 
We will remain committed to building on Tiffany's great heritage by delivering the finest products and experiences to a growing number of customers. 
I hope that many of you will participate in our Investor Day meeting on April 12, whether in person or on the webcast, and I'll look forward to seeing many of you throughout the year and updating you on our progress.

Truth is that Greater China, because of Hong Kong, Hong Kong continues to be a nightmare. There is no other word. And I believe this is the same for all of us, all the luxury player. We don't know when we will bottom-up and we don't believe that the situation will significantly improve in Hong Kong during '16. So this is why we are not too bullish and Hong Kong is a significant market despite a decrease in '15 and this is why despite our overall good performance or we plan for good performance in '16 overall in Asia, but it will be negatively impacted by a low performance in Hong Kong."

And frankly, we know that this collection is particularly relevant. It's not the only one, but to millenials. You will also see some more refresh on 1837 and some other collections. But at the same time, I mean, not only we see that is clearly a collection tapping in a clientele between $750 and $5,000, but you will see newness on some more classic, fine jewelry. We've introduced a big refresh collection around Victoria in both -- in Q4 of '15. We're going to continue to push behind those collections and to introduce some more newness behind us collections. You're going to see us to continue to activate and to refresh and to introduce new things on Ts.

And building out our global capabilities in terms of how we source from a procurement standpoint, how and where we manufacture are all areas that we're taking a hard look at and have some action plans on expanding our capabilities there. So there is -- so I'll call it infrastructure side, we are taking steps that over the next few years, is going to make us, I'd say, better positioned to manage a strong dollar environment are frankly, an over -- a more volatile currency environment over time in any direction that the dollar moves. So we're taking a lot of steps in that direction. And then on capital allocation, these, what I'll call volatile conditions, from a strategic standpoint on capital allocation doesn't deter us from investing in key locations in key markets that we think strategically are important to be at.

And the question of volatility of currencies is really the critical one because it's not from just the value of the dollar that is the concern. The concern is, the unpredictability and the reality for consumers is that perception is reality. So when you are at currency moving in one direction or the other direction, consumers and tourists really tend to believe that everything is on deal in a given country or that everything is super expensive in another country. And brands, as powerful as we can be or as powerful as some of the brands can be, we -- there's not a lot of things that we can do to counter this perception. Frankly, when we look internally at our price differentials in the world, we are not any cheaper in Europe than we are in the U.S. So for a Chinese consumers, I mean buying Tiffany in Europe is not really a better deal than buying Tiffany in the U.S. But they believe that everything in Europe is cheaper and there is nothing that I can do. We are not going to enter in term of promotional. We're not going to reinforce promotional activities and start to discount things and we will never do that. So we are doing -- we have a lot of concerted effort to manage and to attract tourists.

And we are clearly not on this school of thought. Now the SKUs, it is clear that when we are introducing news SKU, we are also using that as an opportunity to review the SKU base and we're not about proliferation of SKU. So if anything within the past few years, we've reduced the number of SKUs and we need to do a better job and specifically, on the net, on our site, because we are presenting too many SKUs that some of them, you won't find them in the stores and it has alluded the tale of the collection. So it's probably -- and we are considering that right now, it's not making a good service and it's not helping us in this direction. So no SKU proliferation, if anything, less SKUs than more SKUs. About the number of collections, frankly, we've got 6 or 7 key collections. Will we introduce new collection in the future? Yes, absolutely, we will. And the life of some of the collections that are maybe smaller than some, we will focus less in the future on some of them. But that's -- remember, that those collections, a lot of them have the capabilities and the ability to cover different price points. Not necessarily for all of them below $500 price points but you see key today or key tomorrow, it's yes, we've got 1 or 2 SKUs actually at $500 price point, but we all know that the core offering of T is more around $1,500 than anything else but this is a collection that can go much higher and today, it's going as high as $5,000. But there is no reason not to consider in the future this collection to have more accent diamonds and some other things. So those collections can play a role at very different price points.

First, not that long ago, we got into manufacturing on a vertically integrated basis. And so we have been building the capability and in time and over time that we've been doing this, we've been finding more and more ways to be efficient within the operations we have. So that on e element of this is within the manufacturing footprint we have to continue to invest in capabilities, to improve our efficiency. Second is, and I've talked about this a little bit around systems, we have systems today that support our manufacturing and distribution network to our stores that was in place 20 years ago or more. And when we were basically a smaller U.S. company and as we upgrade some of the systems capabilities, it's going to enable us to be much more nimble in terms of how we manage inventory, much more efficient in the movement of our products and the accuracy of how we deploy and replenish our stores. So those kinds of areas all bring us a significant amount of cost, inventory and service opportunity for us. Those are a couple of examples and then maybe the last one I would add is, just the area of procurement. And this runs both in SG&A and then also in indirect costs, in particular, that sit inside of a gross margin. This year, we really created a procurement -- a global procurement function and it's because we weren't really leveraging our global scale and footprint and we've put that in place. We've got a very good start to it this year. We're going to see benefits in 2016 and it's going to build over time and that's an area and capability that we think there's a lot of runway at and that will help us manage costs as well."

So that's one clear aspect of it. So we have a lot of runway for improvement there, but it cuts -- and why I've framed it this way because it cuts in 2 directions: One, there's an effort through this process to remove some of the excess that we have that is inefficient and not working for us. But as we better deploy our inventory, we're  also going to improve the turnover and that's the other side of it. So we can improve our turns as we get better in terms of how we replenish. So that's how we think about. We have a lot of runway, that's why I'm confident that over time that we can manage our inventory growth, lower rates of sales growth. As it relates to the other parts of the balance sheet, I think frankly that we're in good shape and capital. We're getting very sharp around -- our discipline around on the cost side of capital. We've always been disciplined around the location strategy side but getting sharper, principally through deployment -- I'm sorry, procurement on capital.

Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
Now let's proceed. I think we can begin with a candid assessment that overall financial results in 2015 were disappointing. On the positive side, we accomplished many ongoing strategic initiatives tied to expanding and optimizing our store base and web presence, introducing new product designs that resonated with customers, managing inventories well and achieving strong free cash flow. 
We improved Tiffany's gross margin by a full point in the year and managed our SG&A expenses prudently while increasing marketing spending. However, a worldwide sales increase of only 2% on a constant-exchange-rate basis and a 3% decline as reported, combined with a 9% decline in EPS, excluding charges in 2014 and 2015, clearly did not meet our initial targets. 
For a good part of the year, we achieved healthy sales growth on a constant-exchange-rate basis in most regions outside the U.S. But sales were negatively affected by the translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar. 
In the Americas, our largest region, we faced the daunting challenges in the U.S. of sharply lower foreign tourist spending, along with weaker sales to domestic customers. And then the year concluded on a softer note in most markets around the world. 
While we can attribute some of the pressure on results to the strong U.S. dollar and other macro factors that affected consumer spending, both with local customers and foreign tourists, which we expect will continue into 2016, as Frederic will discuss, we continue to focus on catalysts to drive our business effectively and efficiently as we invest in longer-term growth opportunities. 
And wrapping up the summary on a positive note, our disciplined inventory management enabled us to exceed our objective for free cash flow. While a portion of that cash gets reinvested into growing our business, we also were pleased to return cash to shareholders through dividend, including our 14th dividend increase in the past 13 years and share repurchases with our board authorizing new and larger repurchase program in January. 
So now let's look at sales performance in our various regions. First, there were no meaningful changes in geographical mix in 2015 versus 2014. With the Americas, again, representing just under 50% of worldwide sales, followed by Asia-Pacific at 24%, Japan at 13% and Europe at 12%. 
In the Americas on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total and comp store sales in the full year were down 2% and 4% and the trends were a bit softer in the fourth quarter with declines of 6% and 8%. 
In dollars, total sales declined 4% in the full year and 8% in the fourth quarter reflecting lower unit volume across categories, especially in the silver jewelry under $500, partly offset by favorable pricing mix. 
I already mentioned the adverse effect from the strong U.S. dollar on foreign tourist sales in the Americas. Although it cannot be tracked precisely, we now estimate that foreign tourists sales represent less than 1/4 of U.S. sales, but roughly 40% of sales in the New York flagship store. 
We saw a marked deceleration in Chinese tourists spending in the fourth quarter in the Americas and frankly, in most other regions as well. 
In addition, it's worth noting that domestic sales were also generally soft across the U.S. in varying degrees in the full year and more so in the fourth quarter. However, we were pleased with local currency total sales growth in Canada and Latin America. 
During the year, we added a net of 2 stores in the Americas, opening in the U.S. in the Miami Design District, in Ottawa, Canada, and in Santiago, Chile and closing the U.S. store in the Mohegan Sun Resort. 
We also relocated a few stores in the Americas region in line with our strategy to optimize the store base and continued with our worldwide program to renovate stores to a new design aesthetic. 
In the Asia-Pacific region on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales in the full year rose 3% and comparable store sales were unchanged while total and comp store sales softened in the fourth quarter, declining 3% and 8%. 
Within the region, Greater China is comprised of the 51 total stores we operate across China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau and represents more than half of total sales for the region. 
For the year, we experienced some growth throughout most markets in the Asia-Pacific region, led by strength in Mainland China and Australia, but we also saw a substantial softness in Hong Kong. 
Growth decelerated in the fourth quarter across most of the region, reflecting the further softening of Chinese tourists spending that I alluded to earlier. Spending within China was strong throughout the fourth quarter, but has been more volatile since then. 
In addition, there is clearly no way to predict when sales growth will resume in Hong Kong so we are assuming that softness will continue through 2016. 
When measured in U.S dollars, total Asia-Pacific sales declined 2% in the full year and 8% in the fourth quarter due to generally lower jewelry unit volume in most categories, partly offset by higher average pricing mix. 
We continue to be pleased with our progress in developing brand awareness of Tiffany with the Chinese customer. Volatile economies, currencies and stock markets certainly affect short-term spending by customers of all nationalities, including those in China. However, we remain committed to serving the growing desires of those customers, seeking extraordinary jewelry of the finest quality and with a wonderful in-store experience. 
There was substantial store activity across the Asia-Pacific region during the year with a net addition of 8 stores. We opened 11 stores, including 5 in China, 2 in Macau and 1 each in Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. We also closed 3 existing stores in the region, including 1 each in China, Korea and Taiwan. 
Now turning to Japan. We had a very successful year in 2015. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 10% and comp store sales rose 5% in the full year and we finished with increases of 12% in total sales and 10% in comps in the fourth quarter. 
Throughout the year, our results in Japan benefited from higher foreign tourist spending, predominantly Chinese, while domestic customer spending fluctuated and was roughly unchanged for the full year. 
The weaker yen versus the dollar had a substantially negative effect on the translation of those sales into dollars in the year although less so in the fourth quarter. 
And when measured in dollars, total sales in Japan declined 2% in the full year, but rose 9% in the fourth quarter. 
We kept the number of company-operated stores in Japan unchanged at 56. Although during the year, we expanded 2 stores and relocated 2 others. 
We also achieved strong sales growth in Europe through most of the year on a constant-exchange-rate basis due to a combination of higher foreign tourist spending, likely tied to a weak euro and pound as well as local customer demand. But sales growth decelerated considerably in the fourth quarter especially in France, following the tragedy in Paris that reverberated across other countries in the region as well. 
However, for the full year on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total and comparable store sales rose 12% and 9% with strength across Continental Europe and the U.K., which represents about 40% of our European sales. 
In the fourth quarter, however, total sales rose 2% and comp store sales declined 3% due to the pronounced softness in France and mixed results elsewhere. 
When translated into U.S. dollars, total sales in Europe declined 1% in the full year and 6% in the fourth quarter, partly due to modest declines in jewelry unit volume as well as lower average price that was largely currency-related. 
We were active on the storefront in Europe in 2015, opening our first store in Geneva and our second in Madrid. And we also enhanced our store presence in London with relocations in both Harrods and Selfridges. 
We also now include our Moscow store, which has been posting strong growth since opening in early 2014 within the Europe region instead of in the other segment. 
We concluded 2015 with 41 stores in Europe, and last month, we opened a third store in Rome, on Via dei Condotti. 
Lastly, other sales declined 13% in the full year and were down 6% in the fourth quarter. Both periods were affected by comp store sales declines in our stores in the UAE and there were lower wholesale sales of diamonds in the full year. 
From my comments on each region, you can see that it was an active year on the store development front as we continued to optimize our store base partly with store openings, but also with a substantial number of renovations and relocations and some closings. The ultimate objective is to drive better top line growth through stronger comparable store sales growth rather than from simply opening substantial numbers of stores. 
For the full year, we opened 16 stores and closed 4, representing a 4% increase in the number of company-operated stores and a corresponding 4% increase in worldwide gross square footage. 
Our plan for 2016 is to open 11 stores across most regions while also closing or relocating some existing ones, resulting in a 2% net increase in company-operated retail square footage. The longer term expectation is to approximately maintain that square footage growth rate. 
In terms of store productivity, worldwide sales per gross square foot for company-operated stores declined slightly $2,900 compared with $3,100 per foot in 2014 resulting from the 4% increase in worldwide square footage, but lesser growth in sales. 
By region, sales productivity in 2015 ranged from $4,300 in Asia-Pacific, to $3,100 in Japan, to $2,900 in Europe, to $2,300 in the Americas region. Of course, keep in mind that the negative translation effect on sales from the strong dollar had a meaningful effect on any declines in productivity. 
Before concluding the regional sales review, it's worth reminding everyone of the meaningful benefits that we derive from complementing our store presence with our websites, which reinforce brand and product awareness and can drive store traffic. 
E-commerce sales in dollars rose modestly in the full year, which was better than the 3% worldwide sales decline and continued to represent 6% of worldwide sales. This dual focus on stores and online supports our global strategy to enhance our relationships with customers and optimize their overall experiences with Tiffany. 
Finally, from a merchandising perspective, the decline in the fourth quarter sales did not include any significant differences in performance among our product categories on a worldwide basis. 
For the full year, the 3% worldwide sales decline in dollars or the 2% increase on the constant-exchange-rate basis included virtually in line performance relative to overall sales for the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry category although with strong sales growth of statement jewelry, in line relative performance for the fashion jewelry category, although with continued strong gold jewelry sales and a slight relative underperformance in the engagement jewelry category, although a new marketing campaign that we launched last month is intended to address that engagement softness. 
We were pleased with customer response to new products that we introduced in the fashion and fine jewelry categories, including design reinterpretations in our Return to Tiffany and Infinity Collection, which have been successful in mitigating some of the softness in silver jewelry sales under $500. Our new designs in the Victoria and Bow fine jewelry collections, including diamonds, the continued success of the Tiffany T Collection, which reached the highest sales level ever for a jewelry collection in its first 12 months and we were pleased with sales of our new watch collections, including the CT60 and the East West collections. 
So that covers the regional and product sales highlights, and I'll now turn the call over to Ralph"

Before looking at the rest of the results, I would like to reinforce a few points. Sales growth was challenged by the strong U.S. dollar throughout the year, both from its effect on the translation of results and the effect on tourist spending in the U.S. 
While we saw a higher gross margin in the full year and fourth quarter, the operating margin was pressured all year by the lack of sales growth and the resulting sales deleverage on SG&A expenses. 
A 9% decline in EPS for the full year, excluding charges in 2015 and 2014 was below our initial expectation a year-ago that had called for minimal growth. However, we managed inventories more efficiently, meeting our objective to keep inventory growth below sales growth and finished the year generating higher amount of free cash flow than initially planned. 
We returned cash to shareholders through substantial share repurchases and another increase in dividend and we expect a further strengthening of the dollar, along with challenging and volatile external conditions that affect customer spending to continue to pressure results in 2016 and especially in the first half of the year. 
Let's look at the rest of the earning statement, the balance sheet and our forecast. 
Gross margin rose in the full year and the fourth quarter. We benefited throughout the year to a varying degrees from favorable product input costs while sales mix fluctuated during the year. 
We also took price increases during the year that addressed most of the pressure from the strong dollar and has enabled us to restore our global pricing structure pretty much back to normal levels. 
Our forecast for gross margin in 2016 calls for some increase, primarily due to lower product input cost as well as benefits from price increases taken within the past year and anticipated modest increases in the coming year. But our expectation for minimal sales growth will continue to put some pressure on gross margin as it will be difficult to get sales leverage on fixed cost. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 5% in the full year and 6% in the fourth quarter. Both of those results included translation benefits from the strong dollar. You would also note that the full year SG&A expenses included a $38 million of loan impairment charge with $10 million of that in the second quarter and $28 million in the fourth quarter related to a diamond mining company in Sierra Leone and also included a $9 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter for staffing and occupancy reductions. 
Excluding these charges, SG&A growth in the quarter and year was due to store-related spending and higher pension costs, partially offset by a lower variable cost. 
In addition, marketing spending rose in the full year to represent 7.4% of net sales from 6.7% in the prior year. Although marketing spending declined in the fourth quarter, as we expected, due to disproportionately high spending in the fourth quarter of 2014, tied to the launch of the Tiffany T Collection. 
We expect SG&A expenses in 2016 to increase over 2015's SG&A expense, excluding charges, due to increased store-related and marketing expenses with some benefit from lower pension costs. 
Our projections for 2016 of a modest increase in the gross margin and for SG&A expense growth exceeding sales growth, mostly due to higher store-related costs, will result in a decline in operating margin for the year. 
Interest and other expenses net declined in the full year due to our refinancing of long-term debt to lower interest rates in October of 2014. Interest and other expenses net were about flat in the fourth quarter. 
We are projecting interest and other expenses net to be approximately unchanged in 2016. 
The effective tax rate for the full year was slightly higher than last year and we are projecting a fractionally lower rate in 2016. 
Getting it all up, net earnings declined 5% in the fourth quarter and 9% in the full year, excluding charges in both years. This followed a 13% increase in net earnings in 2014, excluding charges. 
Putting together our assumptions for 2016, we arrive at a forecast calling for net earnings ranging from unchanged to a mid-single-digit decline compared to the $3.83 per diluted share excluding charges in 2015. 
While we expect a gradually improving peso sales over 4 quarters, we also expect a similar progression in terms of earnings, with earnings declining in the first quarter by 15% to 20%, a 5% to 10% decline in the second quarter, and then followed by a resumption of growth in the second half. 
Most importantly, we will continue throughout the year to focus on investing and improving the business despite a choppy and uncertain environment. 
Looking at our balance sheet. We finished the year in a very solid position. Net inventories of $2.2 billion at January 31 were 6% lower than the prior year end. Raw materials and work-in-process inventories declined 4% and finished goods inventories declined 7%, reflecting more efficient inventory management. 
Even excluding the translation effect from the strong dollar, net inventories would have declined 4% in the year compared with the 2% increase in worldwide net sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis.  We are projecting inventories in 2016 to be roughly unchanged. 
Accounts receivable of $206 million was 6% higher than a year-ago, largely reflecting in-house credit tied to strong sales of statement jewelry, but the receivable turnover remained at a very high 21x per year. 
Our capital expenditures totaled $253 million in 2015 versus $247 million in the prior year and represented 6% of sales in both years. 
Approximately half of our CapEx is store-related for openings, renovations and relocations with that store-related mix shifting more towards renovations and relocations. 
CapEx also currently include substantial spending during a multiyear period to introduce new IT systems with a major focus on a global customer relationship management system and a new inventory management system. 
We began 2015 projecting that we would generate free cash flow of at least $400 million and later in the year, revised the forecast upward to at least $500 million based on better inventory management. We were pleased to now report that actual free cash flow for 2015 amounted to $561 million, and for 2016, we are projecting to generate free cash flow of at least $400 million. 
In addition to continuing to reinvest some in the business, we regularly evaluate opportunities to return cash to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. We were quite active in this area in 2015. 
In the second quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 5%, which represented the 14th dividend increase in the past 13 years and as the year progressed, we stepped up the pace of share repurchases to take advantage of a lower stock price. 
For the full year, we spent $220 million to repurchase 2.8 million shares at an average cost of $78 per share. 
In January, our Board replaced an existing $300 million repurchase program that had only about $59 million of authorization remaining and replaced it with a new authorization permitting repurchase of up to $500 million of common stock. 
At January 31, approximately $494 million remained available for repurchase under that new program that expires in January of 2019. 
Factoring everything we've highlighted, we finished the year with cash and short-term investments of $887 million and $1 billion of short-term and long-term debt that represented 38% of stockholders' equity. 
Despite the lower earnings, Tiffany's full year return on assets, as reported, was approximately 9% and the return on stockholders' equity was approximately 16% close to our long-term objectives for at least a 10% ROA and at least a 15% ROE. 
Looking out longer-term, we believe that by continuing to invest in sales growth opportunities and managing cost effectively, helped by more favorable external environment, Tiffany will be well positioned to achieve improved and sustainable financial performance. 
Given this, our earnings objective ultimately includes reaching high single digits net earnings growth, driven by mid-single-digit worldwide net sales growth on a constant-exchange-rate basis by also continuing to generate strong free cash flow. 
Wrapping up my remarks, it was a challenging year with overall disappointing financial performance. However, that should not overshadow the progress we are making to operate Tiffany's business more profitably over the longer term. 
I will now turn the call over to Frederic and then we'll take some questions."

While our financial results in 2015 were clearly disappointing, I also believe that challenges can help us to learn and sharpen our focus on a number of important initiatives within our control in order to derive better financial performance going forward. And I believe that Tiffany has many fantastic growth opportunities available. 
On our call a year-ago, I talked about a clear roadmap for the future, focused on the store experience, products, marketing, the supply chain and margin improvement. I believe we made progress in all of those areas in 2015 and we have continued opportunities to do more in 2016 and beyond. 
Our overall objective is to drive superior total shareholder return through sales growth, improving margins and cash flow, strengthening the brand and the customer experience and achieving operational excellence. 
The key strategy focuses on clientele and what I mean by that is to better engage with our customers through a more conservative approach in our stores through enhanced visual merchandising presentations through better customer data analytics using a new global CRM system and through optimizing our store base. 
In regard to stores, we were active in 2015 through openings, relocations, renovations and a few closings. In the coming year, we will continue to be very focused on optimizing our existing store base with a 2% net increase in worldwide square footage that includes opening 11 new stores across most regions. 
As we continue to increase Tiffany's worldwide store base, our ultimate objective is to ensure that we are best positioned in every market where we have a presence. 
We were pleased with customer reaction to the new design that we've introduced in 2015. Those designs included extraordinary statement pieces in the art of the C collection in our Blue Book that was introduced to very strong demand. 
And at the other extreme, we worked toward improving our entry-level silver jewelry assortment with some encouraging early results. 
We were also very proud to make our official strategic reentry into the watch category and double our watch sales albeit on a very small base. 
I also believe that our marketing footprint and digital media and catalogs is more effectively communicating Tiffany as a global luxury brand with appeal to both the gift giver and the self purchaser. 
With an extraordinary product assortment and a 178 year heritage, we have strong messages to convey to customers. 
I'm pleased to say that we attracted some highly skilled new members of management at various levels and in different areas of responsibility over the past year and now have experienced teams in place at the global and regional levels to execute our strategies. 
And despite the pressure on sales and earnings in 2015, I was pleased that we increased our gross margin and managed expenses prudently and we've all maintained a strong financial position. 
While we invested in our business, in stores, in product sourcing and in developing new IT systems, we were still able to return a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders. 
I'll close by reiterating our objective to reinforce Tiffany's position amongst the world's most important luxury brands. External pressures on our business will eventually abate and we believe that the long-term global growth opportunities for the Tiffany brand are compelling. 
We will remain committed to building on Tiffany's great heritage by delivering the finest products and experiences to a growing number of customers. 
I hope that many of you will participate in our Investor Day meeting on April 12, whether in person or on the webcast, and I look forward to seeing many of you throughout the year and updating you on our progress. 
I'll now turn the call back to Mark, and we can open up the call to answer some questions."

And lastly, just on your comment on China. Frankly, we are quite pleased with Mainland China and our performance in China. We have had very solid performances in '15, in China, and we have no reason to think that our performance won't be good in Mainland China in '16.

And you know that the line is changing in the world, so some of our stores where may be perfectly located 10 or 15 years ago and they are not anymore. So this is why you can see us relocating or even closing some places. But the future, our future, is not about opening a very high number of stores per year. We have still the very unique position of being able to continue to grow geographically and to reinforce our position, but it's more critical for us to reinforce the customer experience through new designs, better seating, better lightings. And by designing, I'm talking about the store design, the store concept and always working on that than opening a very high number of stores. So we are very selective and very picky and making the case for this kind of long-term 2% growth in term of square footage. In term of marketing, because your question was a branch of different questions, in term of marketing and communication specifically, 2 things. You've seen the beginning of the year and this is what we are doing right now that we've introduced a 360 marketing approach behind our bridal and SDR [ph]. This is the year of the celebration of the 130th anniversary of the introduction of our 6-prong setting, the Tiffany Setting. And frankly, we are using that as an alibi to highlight our craftsmanship, heritage and authority that we have on a category that is quite pivotal to the jewelry segment. And lastly, on digital, we are spending -- we have been spending and we are trying to be state-of-the-art on digital. Are we? No. Will we ever be? No, because there's always someone who will do better than us the month after, but not in luxury actually. I will argue that we are probably more leading the pack in the group in luxury than following all the luxury players. Do we have a lot of things to improve? Absolutely. Will you see some new things in digital? Frankly, you will see from us new things on digital every day because this is the pace. And this is very demanding. This is the high cost of doing business because you need to have your own team, you have to -- you need to work with a lot of different partners and nevertheless, you need to try the right balance between allowing social media to and the word of mouth to do a part of the job for you, but also to control the key messaging."

It's -- and formally, there's not a D day about that. There is not the day where things are done, but really we are investing time and money, significant time and money behind that. And it's also, as you rightly pointed out, about the constant optimization of our store design to provide a better experience in term of basic things, comfort, lighting, seating. It's depending of the categories or range of products that we are talking about. We need seatings or we don't need seatings.

So the design director, by definition, doesn't have any opinion about the number of collections because any design director will have to develop 100 or 200 different collections. And we are clearly not on this school of thought. Now the SKUs. It is clear that when we are introducing news SKU, we are also using that as an opportunity to review the SKU base and we are not about proliferation of SKU. So if anything, within the past few years, we've reduced the number of SKUs and we need to do a better job and specifically on the net, on our site, because we are presenting too many SKUs that are -- that some of them you won't find them in the stores and it's a little bit the tail of the collections. So it's probably -- and we are considering that right now, it's not making a good service and it's not helping us in this direction. So no SKU proliferation. If anything, less SKUs than more SKUs. About the number of collections, frankly, we've got 6 or 7 key collections. Will we introduce new collection in the future? Yes, absolutely, we will. And the life of some of the collections that are maybe smaller in some, we will focus less in the future on some of them. But remember that those collections, a lot of them, have the capabilities and the ability to cover different price points. Not necessarily for all of them below $500 price points, but let you -- T today or T tomorrow, it's, yes, we've got 1 or 2 SKUs actually at $500 price point, but we all know that the core offering of T is more around $1,500 than anything else, but this is a collection that can go much higher. And today, it's going as high as $5,000, but there is no reason not to consider in the future this collection to have more accent diamonds and some other things. So those collections can play a role at very different price points. So it will be a mix of reworking, refreshing collections and innovating in existing collections, but it will also be completed by a new T or something totally different but in the coming few years."

First, not that long ago we got into manufacturing on a vertically integrated basis and so we have been building the capability. And in time -- and over time, we've been doing this. We've been finding more and more ways to be more efficient within the operations we have. So the one element of this is within the manufacturing footprint we have to continue to invest in capabilities to improve our efficiency. Second is, and I talked about this a little bit around systems, we have systems today that support our manufacturing and distribution network to our stores that was in place 20 years ago or more and -- when we were basically a smaller U.S. company. And as we upgrade some of those systems capabilities, it's going to enable us to be much more nimble in terms of how we manage inventory, much more efficient in the movement of our products and the accuracy of how we deploy and replenish our stores. So those kinds of areas all bring us a significant amount of cost inventory and service opportunity for us. So those are a couple of examples and then maybe the last one I would add is, just the area of procurement. And this runs both in SG&A and then also in indirect costs, in particular, that sit inside of a gross margin. This year, we really created a procurement, a global procurement function, and it's because we weren't really leveraging our global scale and footprint. And we've put that in place. We've got a very good start to it this year. We're going to see benefits in 2016 and it's going to build over time. And that's an area and capability that we think there's a lot of runway at and that will help us manage costs as well."

First, I think on overall working capital, our focus in this past year, and you could see from our results, has been an inventory management. And there, I just want to frame a little bit that the way we think about it -- and I'd also say our inventory management process and the results that we have has really been an internal team effort here. It's a cross functional group of our merchandising, marketing, sales and finance teams really working hard at this and you could see the benefits. But as we think about it, we're thinking about inventory management as a way to enable sales and improve cash flow. Both, not one or the other but both. And so it's about getting more efficient on the role impacting material in front and diamond side link to having better deployment and accuracy on the product placement in our stores and getting -- improving turnover there. So that's one clear aspect of it. We have a lot of runway for improvement there and -- but it cuts, and why I've framed it this way because it cuts in 2 directions.  One, there's an effort through this process to remove some of the excess that we have that is inefficient and not working for us. But as we better deploy our inventory, we're also going to improve the turnover, and that's the other side of it. So we can improve our turns as we get better in terms of how and where we replenish. So that's how we're thinking about it. We have a lot of runway, that's why I'm confident that over time we can manage our inventory growth, lower rate of sales growth. As it relates to the other parts of the balance sheet, I think -- frankly, I think, we're in good shape on capital. We're getting very sharp around our discipline around the costs side of capital. We've always been disciplined on the location and strategy side by getting sharper, principally through deployment -- I'm sorry, procurement on capital. And then areas of payables and accounts receivable and what I would call cash conversion cycle, frankly, we haven't put a lot of focus on that. I think we've been operating it pretty well.

Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
Now let's proceed. I think we can begin with a candid assessment that overall financial results in 2015 were disappointing. On the positive side, we accomplished many ongoing strategic initiatives tied to expanding and optimizing our store base and web presence, introducing new product designs that resonated with customers, managing inventories well and achieving strong free cash flow. 
We improved Tiffany's gross margin by a full point in the year and managed our SG&A expenses prudently while increasing marketing spending. However, a worldwide sales increase of only 2% on a constant-exchange-rate basis and a 3% decline as reported, combined with a 9% decline in EPS, excluding charges in 2014 and 2015, clearly did not meet our initial targets. 
For a good part of the year, we achieved healthy sales growth on a constant-exchange-rate basis in most regions outside the U.S. But sales were negatively affected by the translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar. 
In the Americas, our largest region, we faced the daunting challenges in the U.S. of sharply lower foreign tourist spending, along with weaker sales to domestic customers. And then the year concluded on a softer note in most markets around the world. 
While we can attribute some of the pressure on results to the strong U.S. dollar and other macro factors that affected consumer spending, both with local customers and foreign tourists, which we expect will continue into 2016, as Frederic will discuss, we continue to focus on catalysts to drive our business effectively and efficiently as we invest in longer-term growth opportunities. 
And wrapping up the summary on a positive note, our disciplined inventory management enabled us to exceed our objective for free cash flow. While a portion of that cash gets reinvested into growing our business, we also were pleased to return cash to shareholders through dividend, including our 14th dividend increase in the past 13 years and share repurchases with our board authorizing a new and larger repurchase program in January. 
So now let's look at sales performance in our various regions. First, there were no meaningful changes in geographical mix in 2015 versus 2014. With the Americas, again, representing just under 50% of worldwide sales, followed by Asia-Pacific at 24%, Japan at 13% and Europe at 12%. 
In the Americas on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total and comp store sales in the full year were down 2% and 4% and the trends were a bit softer in the fourth quarter with declines of 6% and 8%. 
In dollars, total sales declined 4% in the full year and 8% in the fourth quarter reflecting lower unit volume across categories, especially in the silver jewelry under $500, partly offset by favorable price and mix. 
I already mentioned the adverse effect from the strong U.S. dollar on foreign tourist sales in the Americas. Although it cannot be tracked precisely, we now estimate that foreign tourists sales represent less than 1/4 of U.S. sales, but roughly 40% of sales in the New York flagship store. 
We saw a marked deceleration in Chinese tourists spending in the fourth quarter in the Americas and frankly, in most other regions as well. 
In addition, it's worth noting that domestic sales were also generally soft across the U.S. in varying degrees in the full year and more so in the fourth quarter. However, we were pleased with local currency total sales growth in Canada and Latin America. 
During the year, we added a net of 2 stores in the Americas, opening in the U.S. in the Miami Design District, in Ottawa, Canada, and in Santiago, Chile and closing the U.S. store in the Mohegan Sun Resort. 
We also relocated a few stores in the Americas region in line with our strategy to optimize the store base and continued with our worldwide program to renovate stores to a new design aesthetic. 
In the Asia-Pacific region on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales in the full year rose 3% and comparable store sales were unchanged while total and comp store sales softened in the fourth quarter, declining 3% and 8%. 
Within the region, Greater China is comprised of the 51 total stores we operate across China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau and represents more than half of total sales for the region. 
For the year, we experienced some growth throughout most markets in the Asia-Pacific region, led by strength in Mainland China and Australia, but we also saw a substantial softness in Hong Kong. 
Growth decelerated in the fourth quarter across most of the region, reflecting the further softening of Chinese tourists spending that I alluded to earlier. Spending within China was strong throughout the fourth quarter, but has been more volatile since then. 
In addition, there is clearly no way to predict when sales growth will resume in Hong Kong so we are assuming that softness will continue through 2016. 
When measured in U.S dollars, total Asia-Pacific sales declined 2% in the full year and 8% in the fourth quarter due to generally lower jewelry unit volume in most categories, partly offset by higher average pricing mix. 
We continue to be pleased with our progress in developing brand awareness of Tiffany with the Chinese customer. Volatile economies, currencies and stock markets certainly affect short-term spending by customers of all nationalities, including those in China. However, we remain committed to serving the growing desires of those customers, seeking extraordinary jewelry of the finest quality and with a wonderful in-store experience. 
There was substantial store activity across the Asia-Pacific region during the year with a net addition of 8 stores. We opened 11 stores, including 5 in China, 2 in Macau and 1 each in Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. We also closed 3 existing stores in the region, including 1 each in China, Korea and Taiwan. 
Now turning to Japan. We had a very successful year in 2015. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 10% and comp store sales rose 5% in the full year and we finished with increases of 12% in total sales and 10% in comps in the fourth quarter. 
Throughout the year, our results in Japan benefited from higher foreign tourist spending, predominantly Chinese, while domestic customer spending fluctuated and was roughly unchanged for the full year. 
The weaker yen versus the dollar had a substantially negative effect on the translation of those sales into dollars in the year although less so in the fourth quarter. 
And when measured in dollars, total sales in Japan declined 2% in the full year, but rose 9% in the fourth quarter. 
We kept the number of company-operated stores in Japan unchanged at 56. Although during the year, we expanded 2 stores and relocated 2 others. 
We also achieved strong sales growth in Europe through most of the year on a constant-exchange-rate basis due to a combination of higher foreign tourist spending, likely tied to a weak euro and pound as well as local customer demand. But sales growth decelerated considerably in the fourth quarter especially in France, following the tragedy in Paris that reverberated across other countries in the region as well. 
However, for the full year on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total and comparable store sales rose 12% and 9% with strength across Continental Europe and the U.K., which represents about 40% of our European sales. 
In the fourth quarter, however, total sales rose 2% and comp store sales declined 3% due to the pronounced softness in France and mixed results elsewhere. 
When translated into U.S. dollars, total sales in Europe declined 1% in the full year and 6% in the fourth quarter, partly due to modest declines in jewelry unit volume as well as lower average price that was largely currency-related. 
We were active on the storefront in Europe in 2015, opening our first store in Geneva and our second in Madrid. And we also enhanced our store presence in London with relocations in both Harrods and Selfridges. 
We also now include our Moscow store, which has been posting strong growth since opening in early 2014 within the Europe region instead of in the other segment. 
We concluded 2015 with 41 stores in Europe, and last month, we opened a third store in Rome, on Via Condotti. 
Lastly, other sales declined 13% in the full year and were down 6% in the fourth quarter. Both periods were affected by comp store sales declines in our stores in the UAE and there were lower wholesale sales of diamonds in the full year. 
From my comments on each region, you can see that it was an active year on the store development front as we continued to optimize our store base partly with store openings, but also with a substantial number of renovations and relocations and some closings. The ultimate objective is to drive better top line growth through stronger comparable store sales growth rather than from simply opening substantial numbers of stores. 
For the full year, we opened 16 stores and closed 4, representing a 4% increase in the number of company-operated stores and a corresponding 4% increase in worldwide gross square footage. 
Our plan for 2016 is to open 11 stores across most regions while also closing or relocating some existing ones, resulting in a 2% net increase in company-operated retail square footage. The longer term expectation is to approximately maintain that square footage growth rate. 
In terms of store productivity, worldwide sales per gross square foot for company-operated stores declined slightly $2,900 compared with $3,100 per foot in 2014 resulting from the 4% increase in worldwide square footage, but lesser growth in sales. 
By region, sales productivity in 2015 ranged from $4,300 in Asia-Pacific, to $3,100 in Japan, to $2,900 in Europe, to $2,300 in the Americas region. Of course, keep in mind that the negative translation effect on sales from the strong dollar had a meaningful effect on any declines in productivity. 
Before concluding the regional sales review, it's worth reminding everyone of the meaningful benefits that we derive from complementing our store presence with our websites, which reinforce brand and product awareness and can drive store traffic. 
E-commerce sales in dollars rose modestly in the full year, which was better than the 3% worldwide sales decline and continued to represent 6% of worldwide sales. This dual focus on stores and online supports our global strategy to enhance our relationships with customers and optimize their overall experiences with Tiffany. 
Finally, from a merchandising perspective, the decline in the fourth quarter sales did not include any significant differences in performance among our product categories on a worldwide basis. 
For the full year, the 3% worldwide sales decline in dollars or the 2% increase on the constant-exchange-rate basis included virtually in line performance relative to overall sales for the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry category although with strong sales growth of statement jewelry, in line relative performance for the fashion jewelry category, although with continued strong gold jewelry sales and a slight relative underperformance in the engagement jewelry category, although a new marketing campaign that we launched last month is intended to address that engagement softness. 
We were pleased with customer response to new products that we introduced in the fashion and fine jewelry categories, including design reinterpretations in our Return to Tiffany and Infinity Collection, which have been successful in mitigating some of the softness in silver jewelry sales under $500; our new designs in the Victoria and Bow fine jewelry collections, including diamonds; the continued success of the Tiffany T Collection, which reached the highest sales level ever for a jewelry collection in its first 12 months and we were pleased with sales of our new watch collections, including the CT60 and the East West collections. 
So that covers the regional and product sales highlights, and I'll now turn the call over to Ralph"

Before looking at the rest of the results, I would like to reinforce a few points. Sales growth was challenged by the strong U.S. dollar throughout the year, both from its effect on the translation of results and the effect on tourist spending in the U.S. 
While we saw a higher gross margin in the full year and fourth quarter, the operating margin was pressured all year by the lack of sales growth and the resulting sales deleverage on SG&A expenses. 
A 9% decline in EPS for the full year, excluding charges in 2015 and 2014 was below our initial expectation a year-ago that had called for minimal growth. However, we managed inventories more efficiently, meeting our objective to keep inventory growth below sales growth and finished the year generating higher amount of free cash flow than initially planned. 
We returned cash to shareholders through substantial share repurchases and another increase in dividend and we expect a further strengthening of the dollar, along with challenging and volatile external conditions that affect customer spending to continue to pressure results in 2016 and especially in the first half of the year. 
Let's look at the rest of the earning statement, the balance sheet and our forecast. 
Gross margin rose in the full year and the fourth quarter. We benefited throughout the year to varying degrees from favorable product input costs while sales mix fluctuated during the year. 
We also took price increases during the year that addressed most of the pressure from the strong dollar and has enabled us to restore our global pricing structure pretty much back to normal levels. 
Our forecast for gross margin in 2016 calls for some increase, primarily due to lower product input cost as well as benefits from price increases taken within the past year and anticipated modest increases in the coming year. Our expectation for minimal sales growth will continue to put some pressure on gross margin as it will be difficult to get sales leverage on fixed cost. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 5% in the full year and 6% in the fourth quarter. Both of those results included translation benefits from the strong dollar. You would also note that the full year SG&A expenses included a $38 million of loan impairment charge with $10 million of that in the second quarter and $28 million in the fourth quarter related to a diamond mining company in Sierra Leone and also included a $9 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter for staffing and occupancy reductions. 
Excluding these charges, SG&A growth in the quarter and year was due to store-related spending and higher pension costs, partially offset by a lower variable costs. 
In addition, marketing spending rose in the full year to represent 7.4% of net sales from 6.7% in the prior year. Although marketing spending declined in the fourth quarter, as we expected, due to disproportionately high spending in the fourth quarter of 2014, tied to the launch of the Tiffany T Collection. 
We expect SG&A expenses in 2016 to increase over 2015's SG&A expense, excluding charges, due to increased store-related and marketing expenses with some benefit from lower pension costs. 
Our projections for 2016 of a modest increase in the gross margin and for SG&A expense growth exceeding sales growth, mostly due to higher store-related costs, will result in a decline in operating margin for the year. 
Interest and other expenses net declined in the full year due to our refinancing of long-term debt to lower interest rates in October of 2014. Interest and other expenses net were about flat in the fourth quarter. 
We are projecting interest and other expenses net to be approximately unchanged in 2016. 
The effective tax rate for the full year was slightly higher than last year and we are projecting a fractionally lower rate in 2016. 
Getting it all up, net earnings declined 5% in the fourth quarter and 9% in the full year, excluding charges in both years. This followed a 13% increase in net earnings in 2014, excluding charges. 
Putting together our assumptions for 2016, we arrive at a forecast calling for net earnings ranging from unchanged to a mid-single-digit decline compared to the $3.83 per diluted share excluding charges in 2015. 
While we expect a gradually improving pace of sales over 4 quarters, we also expect a similar progression in terms of earnings, with earnings declining in the first quarter by 15% to 20%, a 5% to 10% decline in the second quarter, and then followed by a resumption of growth in the second half. 
Most importantly, we will continue throughout the year to focus on investing and improving the business despite a choppy and uncertain environment. 
Looking at our balance sheet. We finished the year in a very solid position. Net inventories of $2.2 billion at January 31 were 6% lower than the prior year-end. Raw materials and work-in-process inventories declined 4% and finished goods inventories declined 7%, reflecting more efficient inventory management. 
Even excluding the translation effect from the strong dollar, net inventories would have declined 4% in the year compared with the 2% increase in worldwide net sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis. We are projecting inventories in 2016 to be roughly unchanged. 
Accounts receivable of $206 million was 6% higher than a year-ago, largely reflecting in-house credit tied to strong sales of statement jewelry, but the receivable turnover remained at a very high 21x per year. 
Our capital expenditures totaled $253 million in 2015 versus $247 million in the prior year and represented 6% of sales in both years. 
Approximately half of our CapEx is store-related for openings, renovations and relocations with that store-related mix shifting more towards renovations and relocations. 
CapEx also currently include substantial spending during a multiyear period to introduce new IT systems with a major focus on a global customer relationship management system and a new inventory management system. 
We began 2015 projecting that we would generate free cash flow of at least $400 million and later in the year, revised the forecast upward to at least $500 million based on better inventory management. We are pleased to now report that actual free cash flow for 2015 amounted to $561 million, and for 2016, we are projecting to generate free cash flow of at least $400 million. 
In addition to continuing to reinvest some in the business, we regularly evaluate opportunities to return cash to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. We were quite active in this area in 2015. 
In the second quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 5%, which represented the 14th dividend increase in the past 13 years and as the year progressed, we stepped up the pace of share repurchases to take advantage of a lower stock price. 
For the full year, we spent $220 million to repurchase 2.8 million shares at an average cost of $78 per share. 
In January, our board replaced an existing $300 million repurchase program that had only about $59 million of authorization remaining and replaced it with a new authorization permitting repurchase of up to $500 million of common stock. 
At January 31, approximately $494 million remained available for repurchase under that new program that expires in January of 2019. 
Factoring everything we've highlighted, we finished the year with cash and short-term investments of $887 million and $1 billion of short-term and long-term debt that represented 38% of stockholders' equity. 
Despite the lower earnings, Tiffany's full year return on assets, as reported, was approximately 9% and the return on stockholders' equity was approximately 16% close to our long-term objectives for at least a 10% ROA and at least a 15% ROE. 
Looking out longer-term, we believe that by continuing to invest in sales growth opportunities and managing cost effectively, helped by more favorable external environment, Tiffany will be well positioned to achieve improved and sustainable financial performance. 
Given this, our earnings objective ultimately includes reaching high single digits net earnings growth, driven by mid-single-digit worldwide net sales growth on a constant-exchange-rate basis by also continuing to generate strong free cash flow. 
Wrapping up my remarks, it was a challenging year with overall disappointing financial performance. However, that should not overshadow the progress we are making to operate Tiffany's business more profitably over the longer term. 
I will now turn the call over to Frederic and then we'll take some questions."

While our financial results in 2015 were clearly disappointing, I also believe that challenges can help us to learn and sharpen our focus on a number of important initiatives within our control in order to derive better financial performance going forward. And I believe that Tiffany has many fantastic growth opportunities available. 
On our call a year-ago, I talked about a clear roadmap for the future, focused on the store experience, products, marketing, the supply chain and margin improvement. I believe we made progress in all of those areas in 2015 and we have continued opportunities to do more in 2016 and beyond. 
Our overall objective is to drive superior total shareholder return through sales growth, improving margins and cash flow, strengthening the brand and the customer experience and achieving operational excellence. 
The key strategy focuses on clientele and what I mean by that is to better engage with our customers through a more conservative approach in our stores through enhanced visual merchandising presentations through better customer data analytics using a new global CRM system and through optimizing our store base. 
In regard to stores, we were active in 2015 through openings, relocations, renovations and a few closings. In the coming year, we will continue to be very focused on optimizing our existing store base with a 2% net increase in worldwide square footage that includes opening 11 new stores across most regions. 
As we continue to increase Tiffany's worldwide store base, our ultimate objective is to ensure that we are best positioned in every market where we have a presence. 
We were pleased with customer reaction to the new design that we've introduced in 2015. Those designs included extraordinary statement pieces in the art of the C collection in our Blue Book that was introduced to very strong demand. 
And at the other extreme, we worked toward improving our entry-level silver jewelry assortment with some encouraging early results. 
We were also very proud to make our official strategic reentry into the watch category and double our watch sales albeit on a very small base. 
I also believe that our marketing footprint and digital media and catalogs is more effectively communicating Tiffany as a global luxury brand with appeal to both the gift giver and the self-purchaser. 
With an extraordinary product assortment and a 178-year heritage, we have strong messages to convey to customers. 
I'm pleased to say that we attracted some highly skilled new members of management at various levels and in different areas of responsibility over the past year and now have experienced teams in place at the global and regional levels to execute our strategies. 
And despite the pressure on sales and earnings in 2015, I was pleased that we increased our gross margin and managed expenses prudently and we've all the while, maintained a strong financial position. 
While we invested in our business, in stores, in product sourcing and in developing new IT systems, we were still able to return a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders. 
I'll close by reiterating our objective to reinforce Tiffany's position amongst the world's most important luxury brands. External pressures on our business will eventually abate and we believe that the long-term global growth opportunities for the Tiffany brand are compelling. 
We will remain committed to building on Tiffany's great heritage by delivering the finest products and experiences to a growing number of customers. 
I hope that many of you will participate in our Investor Day meeting on April 12, whether in person or on the webcast, and I look forward to seeing many of you throughout the year and updating you on our progress.

So it's difficult to get expense leverage and that put some pressure on the EPS , particularly in the first half of the year, and most acutely, in the first quarter."

You also remember that Q1 of last year, we have had, by comparison to Q1 of '13 -- of '14, sorry, a very good performance in Japan. We, despite the fact that we are continuing to grow and we plan to continue to grow in Japan, frankly, we won't enjoy such higher growth than the one that we had been able to enjoy during the first part of the year of '15. And lastly, just on your comment on China. Frankly, we are quite pleased with Mainland China and our performance in China. We have had very solid performances in '15, in China, and we have no reason to think that our performance won't be good in Mainland China in '16. Truth is that Greater China, because of Hong Kong, Hong Kong,
continues to be a nightmare. There is no other word. And I believe this is the same for all of us, all the luxury player. We don't know when we will bottom-up and we don't believe that the situation will significantly improve in Hong Kong during '16. So this is why we are not too bullish and Hong Kong is a significant market despite a decrease in '15 and this is why despite our overall good performance or we plan for good performance in '16 overall in Asia, but it will be negatively impacted by a low performance in Hong Kong."

And building out our global capabilities in terms of how we source from a procurement standpoint, how and where we manufacture are all areas that we're taking a hard look at and have some action plans on to expanding our capabilities there. So there is -- so on the, I'll call on the infrastructure side, we are taking steps that over the next few years is going to make us I'd say better positioned to manage a strong dollar environment, or frankly, an over -- a more volatile currency environment over time in any direction that the dollar moves. So we're taking a lot of steps in that direction. And then on capital allocation, these, what I'll call volatile conditions, from a strategic standpoint on capital allocation doesn't deter us from investing in key locations in key markets that we think strategically are important to be at.

And brands, as powerful as we can be or as powerful as some of the brands can be, we -- there is not a lot of things that we can do to counter this perception. Frankly, when we look internally at our price differentials in the world, we are not any cheaper in Europe than we are in the U.S. So for Chinese consumers, I mean, buying Tiffany in Europe is not really a better deal than buying Tiffany in the U.S. But they believe that everything in Europe is cheaper and there is nothing that I can do. We are not going to enter in term of promotional -- we're not going to reinforce promotional activities and starting to discount things and -- we will never do that.

And the life of some of the collections that are maybe smaller in sum, we will focus less in the future on some of them. But remember that those collections, a lot of them, have the capabilities and the ability to cover different price points. Not necessarily for all of them below $500 price points, but let you -- T today or T tomorrow, it's, yes, we've got 1 or 2 SKUs actually at $500 price point, but we all know that the core offering of T is more around $1,500 than anything else, but this is a collection that can go much higher. And today, it's going as high as $5,000, but there is no reason not to consider in the future this collection to have more accent diamonds and some other things. So those collections can play a role at very different price points. So it will be a mix of reworking, refreshing collections and innovating in existing collections, but it will also be completed by a new T or something totally different but in the coming few years."

First, not that long ago we got into manufacturing on a vertically integrated basis and so we have been building the capability. And in time -- and over time, we've been doing this. We've been finding more and more ways to be more efficient within the operations we have. So the one element of this is within the manufacturing footprint we have to continue to invest in capabilities to improve our efficiency. Second is, and I talked about this a little bit around systems, we have systems today that support our manufacturing and distribution network to our stores that was in place 20 years ago or more and -- when we were basically a smaller U.S. company. And as we upgrade some of those systems capabilities, it's going to enable us to be much more nimble in terms of how we manage inventory, much more efficient in the movement of our products and the accuracy of how we deploy and replenish our stores. So those kinds of areas all bring us a significant amount of cost inventory and service opportunity for us. So those are a couple of examples and then maybe the last one I would add is, just the area of procurement. And this runs both in SG&A and then also in indirect costs, in particular, that sit inside of a gross margin. This year, we really created a procurement, a global procurement function, and it's because we weren't really leveraging our global scale and footprint. And we've put that in place. We've got a very good start to it this year. We're going to see benefits in 2016 and it's going to build over time. And that's an area and capability that we think there's a lot of runway at and that will help us manage costs as well."

First, I think on overall working capital, our focus in this past year, and you could see from our results, has been an inventory management. And there, I just want to frame a little bit that the way we think about it -- and I'd also say our inventory management process and the results that we have has really been an internal team effort here. It's a cross functional group of our merchandising, marketing, sales and finance teams really working hard at this and you could see the benefits. But as we think about it, we're thinking about inventory management as a way to enable sales and improve cash flow. Both, not one or the other but both. And so it's about getting more efficient on the role in packaging material in front and diamond side linked to having better deployment and accuracy on the product placement in our stores and getting -- improving turnover there. So that's one clear aspect of it. We have a lot of runway for improvement there and -- but it cuts, and why I've framed it this way because it cuts in 2 directions. One, there's an effort through this process to remove some of the excess that we have that is inefficient and not working for us. But as we better deploy our inventory, we're also going to improve the turnover, and that's the other side of it. So we can improve our turns as we get better in terms of how and where we replenish. So that's how we're thinking about it. We think we have a lot of runway, that's why I'm confident that over time we can manage our inventory growth, lower rate of sales growth. As it relates to the other parts of the balance sheet, I think -- frankly, I think, we're in good shape on capital. We're getting very sharp around our discipline around the costs side of capital. We've always been disciplined on the location and strategy side by getting sharper, principally through deployment -- I'm sorry, procurement on capital. And then areas of payables and accounts receivable and what I would call cash conversion cycle, frankly, we haven't put a lot of focus on that. I think we've been operating it pretty well. And that being an area in the future that we take a look at, but I don't think the opportunities are as big as the areas I just spoke about."

Okay. So now let's review the results. Overall, these first quarter results generally represented a continuation of the softness in sales trends that we experienced in the latter part of 2015 and were largely what we expected. Our earnings forecast that we first provided in March assumed that we would begin the year with lower sales in most regions, which combined with a higher gross margin and SG&A expense deleverage, led us to anticipate a 15% to 20% decline in EPS in the first quarter, and it essentially did. The actual 15% EPS decline, which included a tax benefit and a 21% decline, excluding the benefit, were generally in line with our expectation. Most relevant, however, is that despite the persistence of well-known macroeconomic challenges, we are continuing to pursue a number of important strategic initiatives designed to strengthen Tiffany's position as one of the world's most important luxury brands.
So let's look at the quarter's results. Starting with the top line, worldwide net sales declined 7%, both as reported and on a constant-exchange-rate basis, due to softness in most regions. There was no overall translation effect on sales as the recently strengthening yen offset any negative translation effects of the stronger U.S. dollar against other currencies. 
Looking at sales performance by region. In the Americas, total sales declined 9% and comparable-store sales declined 10%. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales declined 8% in the first quarter and comp store sales declined 9%. We attribute the overall lower sales to softness in domestic customer spending in many U.S. markets as well as lower spending by foreign tourists of many nationalities in New York and other high tourism markets. The total sales decline was due to unit-related softness across most jewelry categories. Beyond the U.S., results were mixed in our stores in Latin America and Canada. We didn't add any stores to the Americas store base in the first quarter, nor do we anticipate any growth in store locations in the Americas throughout the remainder of fiscal 2016. However, as part of our ongoing store optimization strategy, we are in the midst of significant renovations of our stores in San Francisco, Beverly Hills and Vancouver, similar in scale to what we completed in Chicago last year. 
Moving to the Asia-Pacific region. Total sales declined 8% and comp store sales declined 15% in the quarter. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, however, sales declined 5% in total and comp store sales were down 12% with softness across much of the region. We achieved total sales growth in China fueled by strong results in some significant newly opened stores, which we believe may have affected comp store sales in the near term for a few existing stores. We also saw a solid sales growth in Korea. However, that growth in China and Korea was more than offset by continued significant decline in Hong Kong as well as more moderate declines in some other markets. We continue to assume that results in Hong Kong will be pressured throughout the year. As reported in U.S. dollars, the total Asia-Pacific sales decline in the quarter was due to roughly equal declines in jewelry units and in changes in average price and product mix. 
Our Asia-Pacific store count was unchanged during the quarter, although we do expect to add stores later in the year in China, Australia, Korea and New Zealand, while also closing some older ones in a few countries. 
I'm pleased to say that we had a good quarter in Japan. Total sales in Japan rose 8% and comparable-store sales rose 12% in the quarter. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, which excludes the recent dramatic strengthening of the yen, comp store sales rose 5%, which we attribute to increased spending by local customers, but that growth was mostly offset by lower wholesale sales, resulting in a total sales increase of 1%. 
In looking at comp store sales great on a constant-exchange-rate basis, it's also important to note that comp store sales had declined 24% in last year's first quarter after surging 30% in the first quarter of 2014 when consumers accelerated their purchasing prior to an increase in Japan's consumption tax. So we're really looking at a modestly positive 3-year average annual run rate, as we would expect for Japan. 
Total sales in Japan increased largely from higher jewelry unit volume. During the quarter, we closed a department store location in Yonago and plan to relocate a few stores in Japan over the course of this year. 
Tiffany's business in Europe remained under pressure in the first quarter, particularly on the continent, which continued the trend we experienced late last year following the tragedy in Paris and also affected by the more recent tragedy in Brussels. 
Total sales in Europe declined 9% and comp store sales declined 15% in the quarter. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total European sales declined 7% in the quarter and comp store sales declined 14%, although you should remember that that was on top of a very strong 18% comp increase in last year's first quarter. 
In addition to the difficult year-over-year comparison, we attributed the lower sales primarily to softness in foreign tourist spending across the continent. It's worth noting that our sales in the U.K. were relatively better than results on the continent and our business in Russia continued to perform very well. 
The total sales decline in Europe in the quarter was entirely due to lower jewelry unit volume. During the first quarter, we were pleased to add 2 stores in Italy. One on the fashionable Via Condotti, marking our third store in Rome, and a new store in beautiful Venice. There's additional store activity planned for later in the year in Europe. 
Lastly, other sales were 30% lower in the first quarter, primarily reflecting softness in our retail sales in the UAE as well as in wholesale sales to other markets in the Middle East. 
In an effort to improve our performance around the world, we continue to be focused on further enhancing the consumer experience through in-store training and systems to even more effectively engage with our customers, optimizing our store base with renovations and relocations, and of course, introducing new designs across all product categories and price points. The objective is to increase the frequency of customer visits to our stores and the conversion rate. Complementing Tiffany's company-operated stores is our web presence around the world, with e-commerce sales accounting for 6% of worldwide sales in 2015. I think it's worth noting that worldwide e-commerce sales rose slightly in the first quarter. We continue to believe that our dual focus on stores and online reinforces global brand and product awareness while enhancing customers' overall experiences with Tiffany. And on a related note, we were pleased last month to launch Tiffany's relationship with NET-A-PORTER, which we view as another step toward building greater awareness among a worldwide group of fashion-conscious luxury shoppers. 
Touching on a few product category highlights in the quarter. While the 7% decline in worldwide sales was reflected in varying degrees of softness across all product categories, it is worth noting that both the engagement jewelry and wedding band category and the fashion jewelry category performed relatively better than the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry categories. Fashion jewelry sales continue to reflect the success of our Tiffany T and ATLAS collection. And while we've seen lower overall unit volumes in fashion silver jewelry in certain regions, we're pleased with the initial reaction to new silver jewelry pieces that have been added to Return to Tiffany and Infinity collections to address softness at price points under $500. Our goals in fashion jewelry are to sustain growth in gold jewelry and stabilize sales in silver jewelry, and we plan to continue to pursue those objectives with new designs and advertising. 
We've spoken about some softness in the engagement jewelry and wedding bands category in some regions over the past year, and we're now focusing our marketing communications on more directly, conveying the competitive strength of our engagement assortment. The ads not only celebrate the 130th anniversary of Tiffany introducing its extraordinarily beautiful 6-pronged diamond ring setting in 1886, but they also emphasize the exceptional quality and rarity of our diamonds. We believe that's a compelling message to couple's who plan to marry. 
In the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry category, there are a few key takeaways. At the highest end of our product offerings, we were pleased with the result of the annual Blue Book event that we held in New York in April. While the year-over-year sales comparison was quite difficult due to record-setting results at last year's event, customers nonetheless showed their enthusiasm for the unique collection of statement jewelry that was focused on the theme, The Art of Transformation. 
Rounding out that category, we saw continued success with our important and recently expanded Victoria collection, but this was offset by soft and mixed performance in other collections. Lastly, we continue to be pleased with our progress in building a larger and more significant watch business as we increase awareness of new design and Tiffany's heritage in that category. So that covers the sales review. 
Let's now take a look at the rest of the earnings results. Gross margin rose 2.1 points to 61.2% in the first quarter due to a continuation of favorable product input cost, price increases taken over the past year and sales mix, partly offset by the effect of currency translation and a lack of sales leverage on fixed cost coming from the sales decline. Our forecast continues to assume an increase in gross margin for the full year, in fact, more than we had initially expected. However, we continue to also expect the full year increase to be more modest than we experienced in the first quarter as we anniversary some of the positive effect of favorable product input cost from last year as well as some of our pricing actions. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 3% in the quarter. The bulk of the modest increase was for labor, occupancy and depreciation costs, much of which was store-related. We continue to expect deleveraging of SG&A expenses for the full year. 
The effective tax rate declined to 29% in the quarter from 34.7% last year, and the reduction reflected an unanticipated benefit related to the conclusion of a tax examination. For the full year, our forecast continues to be based on an assumed rate slightly lower than in 2015. As a result, EPS for the quarter of $0.69 was 15% lower than a year ago, and as I mentioned earlier, would have declined 21% excluding the tax benefit. Either way, results were generally in line with our expectation that called for 15% to 20% decline in the first quarter. 
We believe our balance sheet places us in a strong position to support our growth initiatives while also providing flexibility and opportunities to return cash to shareholders and generate an attractive total shareholder return over the long term. 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $790 million at April 30 compared with $715 million a year ago. Short-term and long-term debt totaled $1.1 billion, and as a percentage of stockholders' equity, was unchanged versus a year ago at 37%. 
Net inventories at April 30 were 2% lower than a year ago, and the effect of foreign currency translation was negligible. Accounts receivable of $221 million was 15% higher than a year ago, partly reflecting the timing of collections at quarter-end as well as in-house credit related to both statement jewelry and wholesale sales. The receivable turnover rate remained high at 20x per year. 
Capital expenditures were $46 million in the first quarter versus $37 million in last year's first quarter. Beyond reinvesting some of our free cash flow in our business, our objective is to provide opportunities to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As a reminder, at the end of last year, our board terminated a previously existing $300 million repurchase program that had only about $59 million of authorization remaining and replaced it with a new authorization permitting the repurchase of up to $500 million of common stock. Under our stock repurchase plan, in light of our share price, we maintained a healthy pace of repurchases in the first quarter, spending $78 million to repurchase shares at an average cost of $66 per share. At April 30, approximately $416 million remained available for repurchases under the new program that expires in January 2019. 
So in terms of our outlook for the year, we believe it is prudent that this early point of the year to moderate our annual forecast and call for a mid-single-digit decline in diluted EPS in 2016 versus last year's diluted EPS excluding charges. We do acknowledge some of the specific risks to the guidance for the remainder of the year, primarily related to the difficulty in assessing the potential for a slower-than-expected improvement in U.S. activity, continued substantial softness in Europe and weakness in foreign tourist spending among the Chinese and other nationalities. 
Beyond this full year forecast, we are modifying our near-term expectations and now forecast diluted EPS in the second quarter to decline by a percentage similar to what we just experienced in the first quarter. For the full year, this assumes net worldwide sales declining by a low single-digit percentage. It also factors in a bit more upside to gross margin than we initially expected. I should add that our forecast also continues to assume a moderate strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the balance of the year and about a 2% net increase in worldwide gross square footage. Our full year assumptions for inventories, CapEx and free cash flow are unchanged from the previous guidance. So that covers the outlook for this year. 
We're all well aware of the near-term external headwinds. However, we believe that the initiatives we're currently pursuing, combined with an assumption that these headwinds will begin to abate at some point, will eventually set the stage for Tiffany to achieve its longer-term objectives that call for high single-digit net earnings growth driven by mid-single-digit worldwide net sales growth on a constant-exchange-rate basis and continued generation of strong free cash flow. 
We were pleased with the large attendance and interest at our recent Investor Day in New York and with the substantial webcast audience as well. As we emphasized in the management presentation, which are available on our investor website, we are focused on generating an attractive total shareholder return in the long term. As I noted before, this focus revolves around our objective to strengthen Tiffany's position as one of the world's most important luxury brands. Strategically, this is premised on initiatives to effectively communicate with and serve our customers, to optimize our store base, to delight customers with new product designs and to improve our cost structure and enhance our supply chain. We believe we have a strong balance sheet and the right management team to execute on those strategies. And on a related note, we've begun the search to fill our recently vacated CFO position.

Tiffany reported its first quarter results earlier today, and I hope you've had a chance to review the news release. On today's call, I'll elaborate on the results as well as on management's outlook for the full year.

Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Okay. So now let's review the results. Overall, these first quarter results generally represented a continuation of the softness in sales trends that we experienced in the latter part of 2015 and were largely what we expected. Our earnings forecast that we first provided in March assumed that we would begin the year with lower sales in most regions, which, combined with a higher gross margin and SG&A expense deleverage, led us to anticipate a 15% to 20% decline in EPS in the first quarter, and it essentially did. The actual 15% EPS decline, which included a tax benefit and a 21% decline excluding the benefit, were generally in line with our expectation. Most relevant, however, is that despite the persistence of well-known macroeconomic challenges, we are continuing to pursue a number of important strategic initiatives designed to strengthen Tiffany's position as one of the world's most important luxury brands.
So let's look at the quarter's results. Starting with the top line, worldwide net sales declined 7%, both as reported and on a constant exchange rate basis, due to softness in most regions. There was no overall translation effect on sales as the recently strengthening yen offset any negative translation effects of the stronger U.S. dollar against other currencies. 
Looking at sales performance by region. In the Americas, total sales declined 9% and comparable store sales declined 10%. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales declined 8% in the first quarter and comp store sales declined 9%. We attribute the overall lower sales to softness in domestic customer spending in many U.S. markets as well as lower spending by foreign tourists of many nationalities in New York and other high-tourism markets. The total sales decline was due to unit-related softness across most jewelry categories. Beyond the U.S., results were mixed in our stores in Latin America and Canada. We didn't add any stores to the Americas store base in the first quarter, nor do we anticipate any growth in store locations in the Americas throughout the remainder of fiscal 2016. However, as part of our ongoing store optimization strategy, we are in the midst of significant renovations of our stores in San Francisco, Beverly Hills and Vancouver, similar in scale to what we completed in Chicago last year. 
Moving to the Asia Pacific region. Total sales declined 8% and comp store sales declined 15% in the quarter. On a constant exchange rate basis, however, sales declined 5% in total and comp store sales were down 12% with softness across much of the region. We achieved total sales growth in China fueled by strong results in some significant newly opened stores, which we believe may have affected comp store sales in the near term for a few existing stores. We also saw a solid sales growth in Korea. However, that growth in China and Korea was more than offset by continued significant decline in Hong Kong as well as more moderate declines in some other markets. We continue to assume that results in Hong Kong will be pressured throughout the year. As reported in U.S. dollars, the total Asia Pacific sales decline in the quarter was due to roughly equal declines in jewelry units and in changes in average price and product mix. 
Our Asia Pacific store count was unchanged during the quarter, although we do expect to add stores later in the year in China, Australia, Korea and New Zealand while also closing some older ones in a few countries. 
I'm pleased to say that we had a good quarter in Japan. Total sales in Japan rose 8% and comparable store sales rose 12% in the quarter. On a constant exchange rate basis, which excludes the recent dramatic strengthening of the yen, comp store sales rose 5%, which we attribute to increased spending by local customers. But that growth was mostly offset by lower wholesale sales, resulting in a total sales increase of 1%. 
In looking at comp store sales growth on a constant exchange rate basis, it's also important to note that comp store sales had declined 24% in last year's first quarter after surging 30% in the first quarter of 2014 when consumers accelerated their purchasing prior to an increase in Japan's consumption tax. So we're really looking at a modestly positive 3-year average annual run rate, as we would expect for Japan. 
Total sales in Japan increased largely from a higher jewelry unit volume. During the quarter, we closed a department store location in Yonago and plan to relocate a few stores in Japan over the course of this year. 
Tiffany's business in Europe remained under pressure in the first quarter, particularly on the continent, which continued the trend we experienced late last year following the tragedy in Paris and also affected by the more recent tragedy in Brussels. 
Total sales in Europe declined 9% and comp store sales declined 15% in the quarter. On a constant exchange rate basis, total European sales declined 7% in the quarter and comp store sales declined 14%, although you should remember that, that was on top of a very strong 18% comp increase in last year's first quarter. 
In addition to the difficult year-over-year comparison, we attributed the lower sales primarily to softness in foreign tourist spending across the continent. It's worth noting that our sales in the U.K. were relatively better than results on the continent and our business in Russia continued to perform very well. The total sales decline in Europe in the quarter was entirely due to lower jewelry unit volume. 
During the first quarter, we were pleased to add 2 stores in Italy, one on the fashionable Via Condotti, marking our third store in Rome, and a new store in beautiful Venice. There's additional store activity planned for later in the year in Europe. 
Lastly, other sales were 30% lower in the first quarter, primarily reflecting softness in our retail sales in the UAE as well as in the wholesale sales to other markets in the Middle East. 
In an effort to improve our performance around the world, we continue to be focused on further enhancing the consumer experience through in-store training and systems to even more effectively engage with our customers, optimizing our store base with renovations and relocations and, of course, introducing new designs across all product categories and price points. The objective is to increase the frequency of customer visits to our stores and the conversion rate. 
Complementing Tiffany's company-operated stores is our web presence around the world with e-commerce sales accounting for 6% of worldwide sales in 2015. I think it's worth noting that worldwide e-commerce sales rose slightly in the first quarter. We continue to believe that our dual focus on stores and online reinforces global brand and product awareness while enhancing customers' overall experiences with Tiffany. And on a related note, we were pleased last month to launch Tiffany's relationship with NET-A-PORTER, which we view as another step towards building greater awareness among a worldwide group of fashion-conscious luxury shoppers. 
Touching on a few product category highlights in the quarter. While the 7% decline in worldwide sales was reflected in varying degrees of softness across all product categories, it is worth noting that both the engagement jewelry and wedding band category and the fashion jewelry category performed relatively better than the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry category. Fashion jewelry sales continue to reflect the success of our Tiffany T and ATLAS collections. And while we've seen lower overall unit volumes in fashion silver jewelry in certain regions, we're pleased with the initial reaction to new silver jewelry pieces that have been added to the Return to Tiffany and Infinity collections to address softness at price points under $500. Our goals in fashion jewelry are to sustain growth in gold jewelry and stabilize sales in silver jewelry, and we plan to continue to pursue those objectives with new designs and advertising. 
We've spoken about some softness in the engagement jewelry and wedding bands category in some regions over the past year, and we're now focusing our marketing communications on more directly conveying the competitive strength of our engagement assortment. The ads not only celebrate the 130th anniversary of Tiffany introducing its extraordinarily beautiful 6-prong diamond ring Setting in 1886, but they also emphasize the exceptional quality and rarity of our diamonds. We believe that's a compelling message to couples who plan to marry. 
In the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry category, there are a few key takeaways. At the highest end of our product offerings, we were pleased with the results of the annual Blue Book event that we held in New York in April. While the year-over-year sales comparison was quite difficult due to record-setting results at last year's event, customers nonetheless showed their enthusiasm for the unique collection of statement jewelry that was focused on the theme The Art of Transformation. 
Rounding out that category, we saw continued success with our important and recently expanded Victoria collection, but this was offset by soft and mixed performance in other collections. 
Lastly, we continue to be pleased with our progress in building a larger and more significant watch business as we increased awareness of new designs and Tiffany's heritage in that category. 
So that covers the sales review. Let's now take a look at the rest of the earnings results. 
Gross margin rose 2.1 points to 61.2% in the first quarter due to a continuation of favorable product input costs, price increases taken over the past year and sales mix, partly offset by the effect of currency translation and a lack of sales leverage on fixed costs coming from the sales decline. Our forecast continues to assume an increase in gross margin for the full year, in fact more than we had initially expected. However, we continue to also expect the full year increase to be more modest than we experienced in the first quarter as we anniversary some of the positive effects of favorable product input costs from last year as well as some of our pricing actions. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 3% in the quarter. The bulk of the modest increase was for labor, occupancy and depreciation costs, much of which was store related. We continue to expect deleveraging of SG&A expenses for the full year. 
The effective tax rate declined to 29% in the quarter from 34.7% last year, and the reduction reflected an unanticipated benefit related to the conclusion of a tax examination. For the full year, our forecast continues to be based on an assumed rate slightly lower than in 2015. 
As a result, EPS for the quarter of $0.69 was 15% lower than a year ago and, as I mentioned earlier, would have declined 21% excluding the tax benefit. Either way, results were generally in line with our expectation that called for a 15% to 20% decline in the first quarter. 
We believe our balance sheet places us in a strong position to support our growth initiatives while also providing flexibility and opportunities to return cash to shareholders and generate an attractive total shareholder return over the long term. 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $790 million at April 30 compared with $715 million a year ago. Short-term and long-term debt totaled $1.1 billion and as a percentage of stockholders' equity was unchanged versus a year ago at 37%. 
Net inventories at April 30 were 2% lower than a year ago and the effect of foreign currency translation was negligible. 
Accounts receivable of $221 million was 15% higher than a year ago, partly reflecting the timing of collections at quarter-end as well as in-house credit related to both statement jewelry and wholesale sales. The receivable turnover rate remained high at 20x per year. 
Capital expenditures were $46 million in the first quarter versus $37 million in last year's first quarter. Beyond reinvesting some of our free cash flow in our business, our objective is to provide opportunities to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As a reminder, at the end of last year, our board terminated a previously existing $300 million repurchase program that had only about $59 million of authorization remaining and replaced it with a new authorization permitting the repurchase of up to $500 million of common stock. Under our stock repurchase plan, in light of our share price, we maintained a healthy pace of repurchases in the first quarter, spending $78 million to repurchase shares at an average cost of $66 per share. At April 30, approximately $416 million remained available for repurchases under the new program that expires in January 2019. 
So in terms of our outlook for the year, we believe it is prudent at this early point of the year to moderate our annual forecasts and call for a mid-single-digit decline in diluted EPS in 2016 versus last year's diluted EPS excluding charges. We do acknowledge some of the specific risks to the guidance for the remainder of the year primarily related to the difficulty in assessing the potential for a slower-than-expected improvement in U.S. activity, continued substantial softness in Europe and weakness in foreign tourist spending among the Chinese and other nationalities. 
Beyond this full year forecast, we are modifying our near-term expectations and now forecast diluted EPS in the second quarter to decline by a percentage similar to what we just experienced in the first quarter. For the full year, this assumes net worldwide sales declining by a low single-digit percentage. It also factors in a bit more upside to gross margin than we initially expected.

So in terms of our outlook for the year, we believe it is prudent at this early point of the year to moderate our annual forecasts and call for a mid-single-digit decline in diluted EPS in 2016 versus last year's diluted EPS excluding charges. We do acknowledge some of the specific risks to the guidance for the remainder of the year primarily related to the difficulty in assessing the potential for a slower-than-expected improvement in U.S. activity, continued substantial softness in Europe and weakness in foreign tourist spending among the Chinese and other nationalities. 
Beyond this full year forecast, we are modifying our near-term expectations and now forecast diluted EPS in the second quarter to decline by a percentage similar to what we just experienced in the first quarter. For the full year, this assumes net worldwide sales declining by a low single-digit percentage. It also factors in a bit more upside to gross margin than we initially expected. I should add that our forecast also continues to assume a moderate strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the balance of the year and about a 2% net increase in worldwide gross square footage. Our full year assumptions for inventories, CapEx and free cash flow are unchanged from the previous guidance. 
So that covers the outlook for this year. We're all well aware of the near-term external headwinds. However, we believe that the initiatives we're currently pursuing, combined with an assumption that these headwinds will begin to abate at some point, will eventually set the stage for Tiffany to achieve its longer-term objectives that call for a high single-digit net earnings growth driven by mid-single-digit worldwide net sales growth on a constant exchange rate basis and continued generation of strong free cash flow. 
We were pleased with the large attendance and interest at our recent Investor Day in New York and with the substantial webcast audience as well. As we emphasized in the management presentation, which are available on our investor website, we are focused on generating an attractive total shareholder return in the long term. As I noted before, this focus revolves around our objective to strengthen Tiffany's position as one of the world's most important luxury brands. Strategically, this is premised on initiatives to effectively communicate with and serve our customers, to optimize our store base, to delight customers with new product designs and to improve our cost structure and enhance our supply chain. We believe we have a strong balance sheet and the right management team to execute on those strategies. And on a related note, we've begun the search to fill our recently vacated CFO position.

Tiffany reported its first quarter results earlier today, and I hope you've had a chance to review the news release. On today's call, I'll elaborate on the results as well as on management's outlook for the full year.

Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Okay. So now let's review the results. Overall, these first quarter results generally represented a continuation of the softness in sales trends that we experienced in the latter part of 2015 and were largely what we expected. Our earnings forecast that we first provided in March assumed that we would begin the year with lower sales in most regions, which, combined with a higher gross margin and SG&A expense deleverage, led us to anticipate a 15% to 20% decline in EPS in the first quarter, and it essentially did. The actual 15% EPS decline, which included a tax benefit and a 21% decline excluding the benefit, were generally in line with our expectation. Most relevant, however, is that despite the persistence of well-known macroeconomic challenges, we are continuing to pursue a number of important strategic initiatives designed to strengthen Tiffany's position as one of the world's most important luxury brands.
So let's look at the quarter's results. Starting with the top line, worldwide net sales declined 7%, both as reported and on a constant exchange rate basis, due to softness in most regions. There was no overall translation effect on sales as the recently strengthening yen offset any negative translation effects of the stronger U.S. dollar against other currencies. 
Looking at sales performance by region. In the Americas, total sales declined 9% and comparable store sales declined 10%. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales declined 8% in the first quarter and comp store sales declined 9%. We attribute the overall lower sales to softness in domestic customer spending in many U.S. markets as well as lower spending by foreign tourists of many nationalities in New York and other high-tourism markets. The total sales decline was due to unit-related softness across most jewelry categories. Beyond the U.S., results were mixed in our stores in Latin America and Canada. We didn't add any stores to the Americas store base in the first quarter, nor do we anticipate any growth in store locations in the Americas throughout the remainder of fiscal 2016. However, as part of our ongoing store optimization strategy, we are in the midst of significant renovations of our stores in San Francisco, Beverly Hills and Vancouver, similar in scale to what we completed in Chicago last year. 
Moving to the Asia Pacific region. Total sales declined 8% and comp store sales declined 15% in the quarter. On a constant exchange rate basis, however, sales declined 5% in total and comp store sales were down 12% with softness across much of the region. We achieved total sales growth in China fueled by strong results in some significant newly opened stores, which we believe may have affected comp store sales in the near term for a few existing stores. We also saw a solid sales growth in Korea. However, that growth in China and Korea was more than offset by a continued significant decline in Hong Kong as well as more moderate declines in some other markets. We continue to assume that results in Hong Kong will be pressured throughout the year. As reported in U.S. dollars, the total Asia Pacific sales decline in the quarter was due to roughly equal declines in jewelry units and in changes in average price and product mix. 
Our Asia Pacific store count was unchanged during the quarter, although we do expect to add stores later in the year in China, Australia, Korea and New Zealand while also closing some older ones in a few countries. 
I'm pleased to say that we had a good quarter in Japan. Total sales in Japan rose 8% and comparable store sales rose 12% in the quarter. On a constant exchange rate basis, which excludes the recent dramatic strengthening of the yen, comp store sales rose 5%, which we attribute to increased spending by local customers. But that growth was mostly offset by lower wholesale sales, resulting in a total sales increase of 1%. 
In looking at comp store sales growth on a constant exchange rate basis, it's also important to note that comp store sales had declined 24% in last year's first quarter after surging 30% in the first quarter of 2014 when consumers accelerated their purchasing prior to an increase in Japan's consumption tax. So we're really looking at a modestly positive 3-year average annual run rate, as we would expect for Japan. 
Total sales in Japan increased largely from a higher jewelry unit volume. During the quarter, we closed a department store location in Yonago and plan to relocate a few stores in Japan over the course of this year. 
Tiffany's business in Europe remained under pressure in the first quarter, particularly on the continent, which continued the trend we experienced late last year following the tragedy in Paris and also affected by the more recent tragedy in Brussels. 
Total sales in Europe declined 9% and comp store sales declined 15% in the quarter. On a constant exchange rate basis, total European sales declined 7% in the quarter and comp store sales declined 14%, although you should remember that, that was on top of a very strong 18% comp increase in last year's first quarter. 
In addition to the difficult year-over-year comparison, we attributed the lower sales primarily to softness in foreign tourist spending across the continent. It's worth noting that our sales in the U.K. were relatively better than results on the continent and our business in Russia continued to perform very well. The total sales decline in Europe in the quarter was entirely due to lower jewelry unit volume. 
During the first quarter, we were pleased to add 2 stores in Italy, one on the fashionable Via Condotti, marking our third store in Rome, and a new store in beautiful Venice. There's additional store activity planned for later in the year in Europe. 
Lastly, other sales were 30% lower in the first quarter, primarily reflecting softness in our retail sales in the UAE as well as in the wholesale sales to other markets in the Middle East. 
In an effort to improve our performance around the world, we continue to be focused on further enhancing the consumer experience through in-store training and systems to even more effectively engage with our customers, optimizing our store base with renovations and relocations and, of course, introducing new designs across all product categories and price points. The objective is to increase the frequency of customer visits to our stores and the conversion rate. 
Complementing Tiffany's company-operated stores is our web presence around the world with e-commerce sales accounting for 6% of worldwide sales in 2015. I think it's worth noting that worldwide e-commerce sales rose slightly in the first quarter. We continue to believe that our dual focus on stores and online reinforces global brand and product awareness while enhancing customers' overall experiences with Tiffany. And on a related note, we were pleased last month to launch Tiffany's relationship with NET-A-PORTER, which we view as another step towards building greater awareness among a worldwide group of fashion-conscious luxury shoppers. 
Touching on a few product category highlights in the quarter. While the 7% decline in worldwide sales was reflected in varying degrees of softness across all product categories, it is worth noting that both the engagement jewelry and wedding band category and the fashion jewelry category performed relatively better than the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry category. Fashion jewelry sales continue to reflect the success of our Tiffany T and ATLAS collections. And while we've seen lower overall unit volumes in fashion silver jewelry in certain regions, we're pleased with the initial reaction to new silver jewelry pieces that have been added to the Return to Tiffany and Infinity collections to address softness at price points under $500. Our goals in fashion jewelry are to sustain growth in gold jewelry and stabilize sales in silver jewelry, and we plan to continue to pursue those objectives with new designs and advertising. 
We've spoken about some softness in the engagement jewelry and wedding bands category in some regions over the past year, and we're now focusing our marketing communications on more directly conveying the competitive strength of our engagement assortment. The ads not only celebrate the 130th anniversary of Tiffany introducing its extraordinarily beautiful 6-prong diamond ring Setting in 1886, but they also emphasize the exceptional quality and rarity of our diamonds. We believe that's a compelling message to couples who plan to marry. 
In the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry category, there are a few key takeaways. At the highest end of our product offerings, we were pleased with the results at our annual Blue Book event that we held in New York in April. While the year-over-year sales comparison was quite difficult due to record-setting results at last year's event, customers nonetheless showed their enthusiasm for the unique collection of statement jewelry that was focused on the theme The Art of Transformation. 
Rounding out that category, we saw continued success with our important and recently expanded Victoria collection, but this was offset by soft and mixed performance in other collections. 
Lastly, we continue to be pleased with our progress in building a larger and more significant watch business as we increased awareness of new designs and Tiffany's heritage in that category. 
So that covers the sales review. Let's now take a look at the rest of the earnings results. 
Gross margin rose 2.1 points to 61.2% in the first quarter due to a continuation of favorable product input costs, price increases taken over the past year and sales mix, partly offset by the effect of currency translation and a lack of sales leverage on fixed costs coming from the sales decline. Our forecast continues to assume an increase in gross margin for the full year, in fact, more than we had initially expected. However, we continue to also expect the full year increase to be more modest than we experienced in the first quarter as we anniversary some of the positive effects of favorable product input costs from last year as well as some of our pricing actions. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 3% in the quarter. The bulk of the modest increase was for labor, occupancy and depreciation costs, much of which was store related. We continue to expect deleveraging of SG&A expenses for the full year. 
The effective tax rate declined to 29% in the quarter from 34.7% last year, and the reduction reflected an unanticipated benefit related to the conclusion of a tax examination. For the full year, our forecast continues to be based on an assumed rate slightly lower than in 2015. 
As a result, EPS for the quarter of $0.69 was 15% lower than a year ago and, as I mentioned earlier, would have declined 21% excluding the tax benefit. Either way, results were generally in line with our expectation that called for a 15% to 20% decline in the first quarter. 
We believe our balance sheet places us in a strong position to support our growth initiatives while also providing flexibility and opportunities to return cash to shareholders and generate an attractive total shareholder return over the long term. 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $790 million at April 30 compared with $715 million a year ago. Short-term and long-term debt totaled $1.1 billion and as a percentage of stockholders' equity was unchanged versus a year ago at 37%. 
Net inventories at April 30 were 2% lower than a year ago and the effect of foreign currency translation was negligible. 
Accounts receivable of $221 million was 15% higher than a year ago, partly reflecting the timing of collections at quarter-end as well as in-house credit related to both statement jewelry and wholesale sales. The receivable turnover rate remained high at 20x per year. 
Capital expenditures were $46 million in the first quarter versus $37 million in last year's first quarter. Beyond reinvesting some of our free cash flow in our business, our objective is to provide opportunities to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As a reminder, at the end of last year, our board terminated a previously existing $300 million repurchase program that had only about $59 million of authorization remaining and replaced it with a new authorization permitting the repurchase of up to $500 million of common stock. Under our stock repurchase plan, in light of our share price, we maintained a healthy pace of repurchases in the first quarter, spending $78 million to repurchase shares at an average cost of $66 per share. At April 30, approximately $416 million remained available for repurchases under the new program that expires in January 2019. 
So in terms of our outlook for the year, we believe it is prudent at this early point of the year to moderate our annual forecasts and call for a mid-single-digit decline in diluted EPS in 2016 versus last year's diluted EPS excluding charges. We do acknowledge some of the specific risks to the guidance for the remainder of the year primarily related to the difficulty in assessing the potential for a slower-than-expected improvement in U.S. activity, continued substantial softness in Europe and weakness in foreign tourist spending among the Chinese and other nationalities. 
Beyond this full year forecast, we are modifying our near-term expectations and now forecast diluted EPS in the second quarter to decline by a percentage similar to what we just experienced in the first quarter. For the full year, this assumes net worldwide sales declining by a low single-digit percentage. It also factors in a bit more upside to gross margin than we initially expected. I should add that our forecast also continues to assume a moderate strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the balance of the year and about a 2% net increase in worldwide gross square footage. Our full year assumptions for inventories, CapEx and free cash flow are unchanged from the previous guidance. 
So that covers the outlook for this year. We're all well aware of the near-term external headwinds.

Okay. Now let's look at the results. Taking overall assessment of the second quarter, a modest increase in EPS on a GAAP basis and a modest decline on an adjusted basis that excludes a prior year charge were better than the expected decline that we have communicated 3 months ago. Worldwide sales were close to what we anticipated, declining 6% on both a GAAP basis and on a constant-exchange-rate basis and generally continued to reflect the soft trends across regions that we've experienced for several quarters, which we attribute partly to domestic customer spending, but also to lower tourist spending, predominantly by Chinese tourists. However, we had a solid increase in gross margin and experienced less deleveraging of SG&A expenses than we had anticipated due to a slight SG&A expense decline. And our balance sheet remains strong. Looking forward, while the results for the quarter were a little better than we expected, we think it's prudent to maintain our existing outlook for the full year. A number of well-known challenges and uncertainties that we discussed over the past several quarters continue to persist. And while we believe we are managing cost efficiently and of course continuing to pursue opportunities to more effectively reach customers with extraordinary products, marketing campaigns and experiences, we think it's most appropriate to maintain a stance of near-term caution. Our long-term goal remains to strengthen Tiffany's position as one of the world's most important luxury brands. 
So looking at second quarter's sales results in more detail. The 6% decline in worldwide sales reflected varying degrees of softness in all regions. There was no translation effect on total sales as the stronger yen offset the negative translation effects from the stronger U.S. dollar against other currencies. In the Americas, both total sales and comparable store sales declined 9%, which we attribute to generally soft demand in U.S. customer spending as well as lower spending in the U.S. by Chinese and other tourists, especially in New York and in other tourism markets. Beyond the U.S., results were mixed in Latin America and Canada. The overall sales declines in the second quarter in the Americas reflected unit-related softness across all jewelry categories. And total sales and comps declined 8% and 9% on a constant-exchange-rate basis. We can only speculate on why domestic U.S. consumer spending at the high end has been generally soft, but we believe that macro market and political uncertainties are likely playing a role in restrained consumer behavior. Regardless, our long-term plan is to mitigate these headwinds by better engaging with existing and potential customers and enhancing their experiences both in our stores and online. We added 1 store in the Americas during the second quarter when we opened in the luxurious new Holt Renfrew store at the Square One Center in Mississauga, which is the sixth largest city in Canada. Beyond opening new stores, our strategy to optimize our store base includes renovations, relocations and closing. Right now, we are in the midst of major renovation of our stores in San Francisco, Beverly Hills and Vancouver, similar to the renovation last year in Chicago of our Michigan Avenue store. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, total sales and comparable store sales declined 6% and 12% in the quarter. The sales declines were due to a combination of lower average price, lower unit volume and a shift in mix and reflected softness across much of the region. We were pleased with healthy total and comparable store sales growth in China as well as in Korea. However, continued meaningful sales declines in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and Singapore contributed to the overall regional softness. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, the total and comp store sales declines in the Asia-Pacific region were 3% and 9%. During the quarter, we expanded our successful presence in Australia when we opened 2 stores, 1 at the Pacific Fair Center on the Gold Coast and 1 at the Sydney International Airport. And we now operate 9 stores in Australia. In Japan, total sales and comparable store sales increased 10% and 13% in the quarter, but that increase entirely reflected the translation benefit from the recent and substantial strengthening of the yen against the dollar. This translation benefit more than offset lower spending that we estimate comes from foreign tourists especially from China. There was also a decline in wholesale sales. An increase in average price was currency-related, but we did have a modest increase in jewelry unit volume as well. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, however, total and comp store sales declined 5% and 3%, reflecting the lower tourist spending I just mentioned as well as the decline in wholesale sales. We've noted that, based on our estimates, spending by local customers held up reasonably well in the quarter, despite Japan's weak economy. The store count in Japan remained at 55 locations at the end of the quarter, although we are pursuing a number of renovations and 3 store relocations this year. 
In Europe, soft demand on the continent continued the weak trend that began in last year's fourth quarter with the tragedy in Paris. Total sales and comparable store sales in Europe declined 12% and 17% in the quarter. The sales declines were due to lower jewelry unit volumes, and we believe the sales declines reflected softness in foreign tourist spending across the continent, with a smaller decline in local spending by Europeans. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total European sales dropped 8% and comp store sales declined 13%. On a positive note, we continue to see strong sales growth in Russia. And it's also worth noting that we saw solid sales growth on a constant-exchange-rate basis in the U.K. in the quarter, although it was slightly down on a GAAP basis. There is obviously uncertainty and anxiety regarding the economic implications of Brexit. But interestingly, we saw an uptrend in the U.K. sales almost immediately following the vote. We believe that the weakening of the pound has made London a more attractive tourist shopping destination. 
During the second quarter, we opened a store in the luxury department store, representing our second store in Amsterdam, and we closed a small store in the Frankfurt Airport. 
Lastly, other sales declined 3% in the quarter, reflecting continued weak retail demand in the 5 stores we operate in the UAE, with comps down 22% and lower wholesale sales in other Middle East countries. However, those declines were mostly offset by an increase in wholesale sales of diamonds. 
Our multidimensional initiatives to improve sales performance revolved around a few core elements: enhancing the customer experience through in-store training and systems to more effectively engage with our customers; optimizing our store base with renovations, relocations and select closings; introducing new designs across product categories and price points; and effective messaging through marketing campaigns to communicate Tiffany's relevancy to a wide audience. The overall objective of these efforts is to increase the frequency of customer visits to our stores and the conversion rate. 
With respect to our store base, in total, we opened 4 stores during the quarter and closed 1. For the full year, we expect to add 11 stores, close 9 and relocate 6, which will represent about a 2% net increase in gross retail square footage. And we expect to maintain that low single-digit growth rate in the foreseeable future. 
Beyond our stores is a strong web presence around the world, with e-commerce sales in 13 countries accounting for 6% of worldwide sales in 2015. Worldwide e-commerce sales in the second quarter were roughly unchanged from the prior year, but we also believe that our online presence enhances brand and product awareness and can drive store traffic, too. 
From a merchandising perspective in the quarter, performance among the product categories is pretty consistent with the first quarter. All categories were below prior year to one degree or another. But once again, the fashion jewelry category and the engagement jewelry and wedding bands category performed relatively better than the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry category. Within that category, statement jewelry, representing the highest price points, has been the weakest performer in 2016 after posting very impressive growth last year. We're encouraged with steady progress toward improving sales in the fashion jewelry category as we have seen a moderation in year-over-year sales declines. Our plan is to grow gold jewelry sales and to establish sales in silver jewelry. Through a recent innovation, with more to come, and with support from new advertising campaigns, we believe we are well positioned to provide a compelling message to consumers across a wide age range, and by doing so, improve our performance in this category. 
One example of innovation in the fashion jewelry category is our new Return to Tiffany Love designs and the supporting #lovenotlike social digital marketing campaign. Also recently, Tiffany became the first luxury brand to sponsor a SnapChat lens on July 28 that was instrumental to the campaign. The SnapChat lens received millions of user plays and substantial media coverage. 
Additional new silver designs are intended to address softness at price points under $500. In fact, we've increased the number of silver jewelry SKUs under $500 by a double-digit percentage versus a year ago. At higher price points, we focused on new designs in our important Tiffany T and ATLAS collections. 
The engagement jewelry and wedding band category also posted a relatively modest sales decline this quarter relative to last year. We believe we're increasing awareness of Tiffany's competitive strength in this category via a bold new advertising campaign this year that accentuates the rarity of our diamonds as well as our craftsmanship and heritage. 
While Tiffany is certainly renowned for its classic 6-prong settings, our Harmony Diamond Ring collection is generating strong results, as is our extraordinary assortment of wedding bands. 
Lastly, in the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry category, the softness in statement jewelry has overshadowed more mixed results in other parts of that category. We're pleased with continued success in our recently expanded Victoria collection, but saw a mixed performance in other collections. And later this year, we plan to add new designs within our T Collection among others. 
And I should point out our new ad campaign, Legendary Style, which will be debuting in the coming days, highlighting a few of our important jewelry collections. Created in collaboration with fashion visionary, Grace Coddington, this campaign features women of style and substance, known for their unique points of view, wearing iconic Tiffany designs. The campaign will appear in print, video and across digital properties. 
Beyond jewelry, we're pleased with progress in building our watch business as we intend to introduce new designs in our CT60 and East West collections, add new jeweled watches and increase customer appreciation of Tiffany's heritage in that category, which dates back to the 1800s. 
Also extending beyond jewelry, during the second quarter, we were pleased to announce our collaboration with renowned designer Reed Krakoff to develop gift home and accessory collections for introduction in 2017. 
So that completes the sales review. Let's now take a look at the rest of the results. Gross margin rose 2 points to 61.9% in the quarter, which was higher than we expected, largely due to sales mix. We continue to see margin improvement from a continuation of favorable product input costs and price increases taken over the past 12 months as well as the shift in sales mix toward fashion jewelry in contrast with lower statement jewelry sales. We continue to assume some increase in gross margin for the full year, but at a rate in the second half considerably less than what we experienced in the first half. This is because we will anniversary the benefits from last year's pricing actions and also have a smaller benefit from favorable product input costs. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses came in lower than we expected, declining 4% in the quarter. The decline was 2% when excluding the effect of a loan impairment charge last year. Measured either way, higher store-related costs were more than offset by lower variable costs as well as lower benefit and incentive compensation expenses. Marketing expense also declined, although a portion of the marketing variance was timing-related and will occur later in the year as we intend to maintain the marketing-to-sales ratio at a level roughly equal to the prior year. 
Even with the lower SG&A, we experienced sales deleverage on SG&A expenses due to the sales decline. And despite the expected improving sales trends in the second half, we still expect some deleveraging for the full year. 
Putting it all together, the operating margin of 18.8% in the second quarter was slightly higher than last year, but the first half margin of 17% remained below last year. 
There's not much to say about the effect of tax rate, which is 34.5% in the quarter, was roughly in line with last year's rate. For the full year, our earnings outlook continues to be based on an assumed rate that will be lower than 2015. 
As I said, in my opening remarks, we're investing in a number of initiatives related to our store base, product assortment, marketing and systems that are all intended to better engage and excite our customers and to grow sales. Having a strong balance sheet and generating healthy free cash flow enables us to continue to invest, but it also enables us to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend growth and generate an attractive total shareholder return over the long term. 
Net inventories at the end of the quarter were 1% below a year ago. We intend to manage inventories with consideration of our sales performance, while at the same time maintaining high availability and deep assortments in our stores, which we believe is a competitive advantage. 
Accounts receivable was 20% higher than a year ago, partly reflecting, as it did in the first quarter, the timing of third-party credit card collections when the quarter ends on a weekend. In addition, there was increased use of in-house credit related to higher-priced jewelry sales and a small increase related to timing of sales in our wholesale business. The rate of receivable turnover was a high 20x per year. 
Capital expenditures were $101 million in the first half of the year versus $98 million in last year's first half, and the vast majority of CapEx is related to stores and IT spending. 
We maintained an active pace of share repurchases in the quarter, spending $72 million to repurchase shares at an average cost of $63 per share, and we spent $150 million for share repurchases in the first half of this year, and at July 31, had $344 million available for repurchases under the program that expires in January 2019. 
Tying it all together, we had cash and short-term investments of $720 million on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter, total short-term and long-term debt of $1.1 billion, represented 37% of stockholders' equity. 
I just want to make a couple of comments about our outlook. I mentioned earlier that sales were close to what we had anticipated for the second quarter. Gross margin was better and SG&A was somewhat lower than expected, partly due to a shift in marketing spending. However, in light of the many macro challenges that we believe were affecting consumer behavior, we believe it is prudent to not change our sales and earnings outlook for the full year. Therefore, we continue to expect net worldwide sales declining by a low single-digit percentage for the full year and EPS declining by a mid-single-digit percentage from last year's adjusted EPS, which had excluded loan impairment and certain staffing and occupancy charges. 
In terms of currency translation, we are now assuming that the dollar is unchanged from current spot rates for the balance of the year. And we are continuing to expect operating cash flow of at least $660 million for the year and free cash flow of at least $400 million based on these and other assumptions and plans. 
Of course, there are risks to any outlook. And in a volatile environment, it's more even challenging to predict the timing of sustainable improvement in U.S. activity or when a turnaround will occur in Europe or the patterns of travel and tourist the spending by Chinese and other nationalities. However, we believe we can expect improving trends in sales and earnings in the second half of the year as we continue to execute on the plethora of initiatives we are pursuing and also benefit from what we consider to be easier year-over-year comparisons. 
In summary, we intend to remain focused on key strategic pillars that call for effectively communicating within serving our customers, optimizing our store base, delighting customers with new product designs and improving our cost structure and enhancing our supply chain. We believe our brand and management team are well suited to achieve those objectives.

Good day, everyone, and thanks for joining me for a review of Tiffany's second quarter financial results and the full year outlook that we reported earlier today. By now, I hope you've had a chance to read the news release.

Additional information concerning factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K.

Okay, now let's look at the results.
Taking an overall assessment of the second quarter. A modest increase in EPS on a GAAP basis and a modest decline on an adjusted basis that excludes a prior year charge were better than the expected decline that we had communicated 3 months ago. Worldwide sales were close to what we anticipated, declining 6% on both a GAAP basis and on a constant exchange rate basis; and generally continued to reflect the soft trends across regions that we've experienced for several quarters, which we attribute partly to domestic customer spending but also to lower tourist spending, predominantly by Chinese tourists. However, we had a solid increase in gross margins and experienced less deleveraging of SG&A expenses than we had anticipated due to a slight SG&A expense decline. And our balance sheet remained strong.
Looking forward, while the results for the quarter were a little better than we expected, we think it's prudent to maintain our existing outlook for the full year. A number of well-known challenges and uncertainties that we've discussed over the past several quarters continue to persist. And while we believe we are managing costs efficiently; and of course, continuing to pursue opportunities to more effectively reach customers with extraordinary products, marketing campaigns and experiences, we think it's most appropriate to maintain a stance of near-term caution. Our long-term goal remains to strengthen Tiffany's position as one of the world's most important luxury brands.
So looking at second quarter sales results in more detail. The 6% decline in worldwide sales reflected varying degrees of softness in all regions. There was no translation effect on total sales, as the stronger yen offset the negative translation effects from the stronger U.S. dollar against other currencies.
In the Americas, both total sales and comparable store sales declined 9%, which we attribute to generally soft demand in U.S. customer spending as well as lower spending in the U.S. by Chinese and other tourists, especially in New York and in other high-tourism markets. Beyond the U.S., results were mixed in our stores in Latin America and Canada. The overall sales declines in the second quarter in the Americas reflected unit-related softness across all jewelry categories. And total sales and comps declined 8% and 9% on a constant exchange rate basis.
We can only speculate on why domestic U.S. consumer spending at the high end has been generally soft, but we believe that macro, market and political uncertainties are likely playing a role in restrained consumer behavior. Regardless, our long-term plan is to mitigate these headwinds by better engaging with existing and potential customers and enhancing their experiences both in our stores and online. We added one store in the Americas during the second quarter when we opened in the luxurious new Holt Renfrew store at the Square One center in Mississauga, which is the sixth largest city in Canada. Beyond opening new stores, our strategy to optimize our store base includes renovations, relocations and closings. Right now, we are in the midst of major renovations of our stores in San Francisco, Beverly Hills and Vancouver, similar to the renovation last year in Chicago of our Michigan Avenue store.
In the Asia Pacific region, total sales and comparable store sales declined 6% and 12% in the quarter. The sales declines were due to a combination of lower average price, lower unit volume and a shift in mix; and reflected softness across much of the region. We were pleased with healthy total and comparable store sales growth in China as well as in Korea. However, continued meaningful sales declines in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and Singapore contributed to the overall regional softness. On a constant exchange rate basis, the total and comp store sales declines in the Asia Pacific region were 3% and 9%.
During the quarter, we expanded our successful presence in Australia when we opened 2 stores: 1 at the Pacific Fair center on the Gold Coast and 1 at the Sydney international airport. And we now operate 9 stores in Australia.
In Japan, total sales and comparable store sales increased 10% and 13% in the quarter, but that increase entirely reflected the translation benefit from the recent and substantial strengthening of the yen against the dollar. This translation benefit more than offset lower spending that we estimate comes from foreign tourists, especially from China. There was also a decline in wholesale sales. An increase in average price was currency related, but we did have a modest increase in jewelry unit volume as well. On a constant exchange rate basis, however, total and comp store sales declined 5% and 3%, reflecting the lower tourist spending I just mentioned as well as the decline in wholesale sales. We've noted that, based on our estimates, spending by local customers held up reasonably well in the quarter despite Japan's weak economy.
The store count in Japan remained at 55 locations at the end of the quarter, although we are pursuing a number of renovations and 3 store relocations this year.
In Europe, soft demand on the continent continued the weak trend that began in last year's fourth quarter with the tragedy in Paris. Total sales and comparable store sales in Europe declined 12% and 17% in the quarter. The sales declines were due to lower jewelry unit volumes. And we believe the sales declines reflected softness in foreign tourist spending across the continent, with a smaller decline in local spending by Europeans. On a constant exchange rate basis, total European sales dropped 8% and comp store sales declined 13%.
On a positive note, we continued to see strong sales growth in Russia. And it's also worth noting that we saw solid sales growth on a constant exchange rate basis in the U.K. in the quarter, although it was slightly down on a GAAP basis. There is obviously uncertainty and anxiety regarding the economic implications of Brexit, but interestingly, we saw an uptrend in the U.K. sales almost immediately following the vote. We believe that the weakening of the pound has made London a more attractive tourist shopping destination.
During the second quarter, we opened a store in the De Bijenkorf luxury department store, representing our second store in Amsterdam. And we closed a small store in the Frankfurt Airport. 
Lastly, other sales declined 3% in the quarter, reflecting continued weak retail demand in the 5 stores we operate in the UAE, with comps down 22% and lower wholesale sales in other Middle East countries. However, those declines were mostly offset by an increase in wholesale sales of diamonds.
Our multidimensional initiatives to improve sales performance revolve around a few core elements: enhancing the customer experience through in-store training and systems to more effectively engage with our customers; optimizing our store base with renovations, relocations and select closings; introducing new designs across product categories and price points; and effective messaging through marketing campaigns to communicate Tiffany's relevancy to a wide audience. The overall objective of these efforts is to increase the frequency of customer visits to our stores and the conversion rate.
With respect to our store base, in total we opened 4 stores during the quarter and closed 1. For the full year, we expect to add 11 stores, close 9 and relocate 6, which will represent about a 2% net increase in gross retail square footage. And we expect to maintain that low single-digit growth rate in the foreseeable future. Beyond our stores is a strong web presence around the world, with e-commerce sales in 13 countries accounting for 6% of worldwide sales in 2015. Worldwide e-commerce sales in the second quarter were roughly unchanged from the prior year, but we also believe that our online presence enhances brand and product awareness and can drive store traffic too.
From a merchandising perspective, in the quarter, performance among the product categories was pretty consistent with the first quarter. All categories were below prior year to one degree or another, but once again the fashion jewelry category and the engagement jewelry and wedding bands category performed relatively better than the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry category. Within that category, statement jewelry, representing the highest price points, has been the weakest performer in 2016 after posting very impressive growth last year. We're encouraged with steady progress toward improving sales in the fashion jewelry category, as we have seen a moderation in year-over-year sales declines. Our plan is to grow gold jewelry sales and to stabilize sales in silver jewelry. Through recent innovations, with more to come, and with support from new advertising campaigns, we believe we are well positioned to provide a compelling message to consumers across a wide age range; and by doing so, improve our performance in this category. One example of innovation in the fashion jewelry category is our new Return to Tiffany Love designs and the supporting #LoveNotLike social digital marketing campaign. Also recently, Tiffany became the first luxury brand to sponsor a SnapChat lens on July 28 that was instrumental to the campaign. The SnapChat lens received millions of user plays and substantial media coverage. Additional new silver designs are intended to address softness at price points under $500. In fact, we've increased the number of silver jewelry SKUs under $500 by a double-digit percentage versus a year ago. At higher price points, we've focused on new designs in our important Tiffany T and Atlas collections.
The engagement jewelry and wedding band category also posted a relatively modest sales decline this quarter relative to last year. We believe we're increasing awareness of Tiffany's competitive strength in this category via a bold, new advertising campaign this year that accentuates the rarity of our diamonds as well as our craftsmanship and heritage. While Tiffany is certainly renowned for its classic 6-prong setting, our Harmony diamond ring collection is generating strong results, as is our extraordinary assortment of wedding bands. Lastly, in the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry category, the softness in statement jewelry has overshadowed more mixed results in other parts of that category. We're pleased with continued success in our recently expanded Victoria collection but saw a mixed performance in other collections. And later this year, we plan to add new designs within our keys collection, among others.
And I should point out our new ad campaign Legendary Style, which will be debuting in the coming days, highlighting a few of our important jewelry collections. Created in collaboration with fashion visionary Grace Coddington, this campaign features women of style and substance, known for their unique points of view, wearing iconic Tiffany designs. The campaign will appear in print, video and across digital properties. 
Beyond jewelry, we're pleased with progress in building our watch business as we intend to introduce new designs in our CT60 and East West collections; add new jeweled watches; and increase customer appreciation of Tiffany's heritage in that category, which dates back to the 1800s. Also extending beyond jewelry, during the second quarter, we were pleased to announce our collaboration with renowned designer Reed Krakoff to develop gift, home and accessory collections for introduction in 2017.
So that completes the sales review. Let's now take a look at the rest of the results.
Gross margin rose 2 points to 61.9% in the quarter, which was higher than we expected largely due to sales mix. We continued to see margin improvement from a continuation of favorable product input costs and price increases taken over the past 12 months as well as the shift in sales mix toward fashion jewelry in contrast with lower statement jewelry sales. We continue to assume some increase in gross margin for the full year but at a rate in the second half considerably less than what we experienced in the first half. This is because we will anniversary the benefits from last year's pricing actions and also have a smaller benefit from favorable product input costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses came in lower than we expected, declining 4% in the quarter. The decline was 2% when excluding the effect of a loan impairment charge last year. Measured either way, higher store-related costs were more than offset by lower variable costs as well as lower benefit and incentive compensation expenses. Marketing expense also declined, although a portion of the marketing variance was timing related and will occur later in the year as we intend to maintain the marketing-to-sales ratio at a level roughly equal to the prior year. Even with the lower SG&A, we experienced sales deleverage on SG&A expenses due to the sales decline. And despite the expected improving sales trends in the second half, we still expect some deleveraging for the full year.
Putting it all together, the operating margin of 18.8% in the second quarter was slightly higher than last year, but the first half margin of 17% remained below last year.
There is not much to say about the effective tax rate, which at 34.5% in the quarter was roughly in line with last year's rate. For the full year, our earnings outlook continues to be based on an assumed rate slightly lower than 2015.
As I said in my opening remarks, we're investing in a number of initiatives related to our store base, product assortment, marketing and systems that are all intended to better engage and excite our customers and to grow sales. Having a strong balance sheet and generating healthy free cash flow enables us to continue to invest, but it also enables us to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend growth and generate an attractive total shareholder return over the long term.
Net inventories at the end of the quarter were 1% below a year ago. We intend to manage inventories with consideration of our sales performance while at the same time maintaining high availability and deep assortments in our stores, which we believe is a competitive advantage.
Accounts receivable was 20% higher than a year ago, partly reflecting, as it did in the first quarter, the timing of third-party credit card collections when the quarter ends on a weekend. In addition, there was increased use of in-house credit related to higher-priced jewelry sales and a small increase related to timing of sales in our wholesale business. The rate of receivable turnover was a high 20x per year.
Capital expenditures were $101 million in the first half of the year versus $98 million in last year's first half, and the vast majority of CapEx is related to stores and IT spending.
We maintained an active pace of share repurchases in the quarter, spending $72 million to repurchase shares at an average cost of $63 per share. And we spent $150 million for share repurchases in the first half of this year and, at July 31, had $344 million available for repurchases under the program that expires in January 2019.
Tying it all together, we had cash and short-term investments of $720 million on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter. Total short-term and long-term debt of $1.1 billion represented 37% of stockholders' equity.
I just want to make a couple of comments about our outlook.
I mentioned earlier that sales were close to what we had anticipated for the second quarter. Gross margin was better and SG&A was somewhat lower than expected, partly due to a shift in marketing spending. However, in light of the many macro challenges that we believe are affecting consumer behavior, we believe it is prudent to not change our sales and earnings outlooks for the full year.

Okay, now let's look at the results.

In the Americas, both total sales and comparable store sales declined 9%, which we attribute to generally soft demand in U.S. customer spending as well as lower spending in the U.S. by Chinese and other tourists, especially in New York and in other high-tourism markets. Beyond the U.S., results were mixed in our stores in Latin America and Canada.

And it's also worth noting that we saw solid sales growth on a constant exchange rate basis in the U.K. in the quarter, although it was slightly down on a GAAP basis. There is obviously uncertainty and anxiety regarding the economic implications of Brexit, but interestingly, we saw an uptrend in the U.K. sales almost immediately following the vote. We believe that the weakening of the pound has made London a more attractive tourist shopping destination.
During the second quarter, we opened a store in the De Bijenkorf luxury department store, representing our second store in Amsterdam. And we closed a small store in the Frankfurt Airport.

We're encouraged with steady progress toward improving sales in the fashion jewelry category, as we have seen a moderation in year-over-year sales declines. Our plan is to grow gold jewelry sales and to stabilize sales in silver jewelry. Through recent innovations, with more to come, and with support from new advertising campaigns, we believe we are well positioned to provide a compelling message to consumers across a wide age range; and by doing so, improve our performance in this category. One example of innovation in the fashion jewelry category is our new Return to Tiffany Love designs and the supporting #LoveNotLike social digital marketing campaign. Also recently, Tiffany became the first luxury brand to sponsor a SnapChat lens on July 28 that was instrumental to the campaign. The SnapChat lens received millions of user plays and substantial media coverage. Additional new silver designs are intended to address softness at price points under $500. In fact, we've increased the number of silver jewelry SKUs under $500 by a double-digit percentage versus a year ago. At higher price points, we've focused on new designs in our important Tiffany T and Atlas collections.
The engagement jewelry and wedding band category also posted a relatively modest sales decline this quarter relative to last year. We believe we're increasing awareness of Tiffany's competitive strength in this category via a bold, new advertising campaign this year that accentuates the rarity of our diamonds as well as our craftsmanship and heritage. While Tiffany is certainly renowned for its classic 6-prong setting, our Harmony diamond ring collection is generating strong results, as is our extraordinary assortment of wedding bands. Lastly, in the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry category, the softness in statement jewelry has overshadowed more mixed results in other parts of that category. We're pleased with continued success in our recently expanded Victoria collection but saw a mixed performance in other collections. And later this year, we plan to add new designs within our keys collection, among others.
And I should point out our new ad campaign Legendary Style, which will be debuting in the coming days, highlighting a few of our important jewelry collections. Created in collaboration with fashion visionary, Grace Coddington, this campaign features women of style and substance, known for their unique points of view, wearing iconic Tiffany designs. The campaign will appear in print, video and across digital properties. 
Beyond jewelry, we're pleased with progress in building our watch business as we intend to introduce new designs in our CT60 and East West collections; add new jeweled watches; and increase customer appreciation of Tiffany's heritage in that category, which dates back to the 1800s. Also extending beyond jewelry, during the second quarter, we were pleased to announce our collaboration with renowned designer Reed Krakoff to develop gift, home and accessory collections for introduction in 2017.
So that completes the sales review. Let's now take a look at the rest of the results.
Gross margin rose 2 points to 61.9% in the quarter, which was higher than we expected largely due to sales mix. We continued to see margin improvement from a continuation of favorable product input costs and price increases taken over the past 12 months as well as the shift in sales mix toward fashion jewelry in contrast with lower statement jewelry sales. We continue to assume some increase in gross margin for the full year but at a rate in the second half considerably less than what we experienced in the first half. This is because we will anniversary the benefits from last year's pricing actions and also have a smaller benefit from favorable product input costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses came in lower than we expected, declining 4% in the quarter. The decline was 2% when excluding the effect of a loan impairment charge last year. Measured either way, higher store-related costs were more than offset by lower variable costs as well as lower benefit and incentive compensation expenses. Marketing expense also declined, although a portion of the marketing variance was timing related and will occur later in the year as we intend to maintain the marketing-to-sales ratio at a level roughly equal to the prior year. Even with the lower SG&A, we experienced sales deleverage on SG&A expenses due to the sales decline. And despite the expected improving sales trends in the second half, we still expect some deleveraging for the full year.
Putting it all together, the operating margin of 18.8% in the second quarter was slightly higher than last year, but the first half margin of 17% remained below last year.
There is not much to say about the effective tax rate, which at 34.5% in the quarter was roughly in line with last year's rate. For the full year, our earnings outlook continues to be based on an assumed rate slightly lower than 2015.
As I said in my opening remarks, we're investing in a number of initiatives related to our store base, product assortment, marketing and systems that are all intended to better engage and excite our customers and to grow sales. Having a strong balance sheet and generating healthy free cash flow enables us to continue to invest, but it also enables us to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend growth and generate an attractive total shareholder return over the long term.
Net inventories at the end of the quarter were 1% below a year ago. We intend to manage inventories with consideration of our sales performance while at the same time maintaining high availability and deep assortments in our stores, which we believe is a competitive advantage.
Accounts receivable was 20% higher than a year ago, partly reflecting, as it did in the first quarter, the timing of third-party credit card collections when the quarter ends on a weekend. In addition, there was increased use of in-house credit related to higher-priced jewelry sales and a small increase related to timing of sales in our wholesale business. The rate of receivable turnover was a high 20x per year.
Capital expenditures were $101 million in the first half of the year versus $98 million in last year's first half, and the vast majority of CapEx is related to stores and IT spending.
We maintained an active pace of share repurchases in the quarter, spending $72 million to repurchase shares at an average cost of $63 per share. And we spent $150 million for share repurchases in the first half of this year and, at July 31, had $344 million available for repurchases under the program that expires in January 2019.
Tying it all together, we had cash and short-term investments of $720 million on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter. Total short-term and long-term debt of $1.1 billion represented 37% of stockholders' equity.
I just want to make a couple of comments about our outlook.
I mentioned earlier that sales were close to what we had anticipated for the second quarter. Gross margin was better and SG&A was somewhat lower than expected, partly due to a shift in marketing spending. However, in light of the many macro challenges that we believe are affecting consumer behavior, we believe it is prudent to not change our sales and earnings outlooks for the full year. Therefore, we continue to expect net worldwide sales declining by a low single-digit percentage for the full year; and EPS declining by a mid-single-digit percentage from last year's adjusted EPS, which had excluded loan impairment and certain staffing and occupancy charges. In terms of currency translation, we are now assuming that the dollar is unchanged from current spot rates for the balance of the year. And we are continuing to expect operating cash flow of at least $660 million for the year and free cash flow of at least $400 million based on these and other assumptions and plans.
Of course, there are risks to any outlook, and in a volatile environment it's even more challenging to predict the timing of a sustainable improvement in U.S. activity or when a turnaround will occur in Europe or the patterns of travel and tourist spending by Chinese and other nationalities. However, we believe we can expect improving trends in sales and earnings in the second half of the year as we continue to execute on the plethora of initiatives we are pursuing and also benefit from what we consider to be easier year-over-year comparisons.
In summary, we intend to remain focused on key strategic pillars that call for effectively communicating within serving our customers, optimizing our store base, delighting customers with new product designs and improving our cost structure and enhancing our supply chain. We believe our brand and management team are well suited to achieve those objectives.

Additional information concerning factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K.

Okay, now let's look at the results.
Taking an overall assessment of the second quarter, a modest increase in EPS on a GAAP basis and a modest decline on an adjusted basis that excludes a prior year charge were better than the expected decline that we had communicated 3 months ago. Worldwide sales were close to what we anticipated, declining 6% on both a GAAP basis and on a constant exchange rate basis; and generally continued to reflect the soft trends across regions that we've experienced for several quarters, which we attribute partly to domestic customer spending but also to lower tourist spending, predominantly by Chinese tourists. However, we had a solid increase in gross margins and experienced less deleveraging of SG&A expenses than we had anticipated due to a slight SG&A expense decline. And our balance sheet remained strong.
Looking forward, while the results for the quarter were a little better than we expected, we think it's prudent to maintain our existing outlook for the full year. A number of well-known challenges and uncertainties that we've discussed over the past several quarters continue to persist. And while we believe we are managing costs efficiently; and of course, continuing to pursue opportunities to more effectively reach customers with extraordinary products, marketing campaigns and experiences, we think it's most appropriate to maintain a stance of near-term caution. Our long-term goal remains to strengthen Tiffany's position as one of the world's most important luxury brands.
So looking at second quarter sales results in more detail, the 6% decline in worldwide sales reflected varying degrees of softness in all regions. There was no translation effect on total sales, as the stronger yen offset the negative translation effects from the stronger U.S. dollar against other currencies.
In the Americas, both total sales and comparable store sales declined 9%, which we attribute to generally soft demand in U.S. customer spending as well as lower spending in the U.S. by Chinese and other tourists, especially in New York and in other high-tourism markets. Beyond the U.S., results were mixed in our stores in Latin America and Canada. The overall sales declines in the second quarter in the Americas reflected unit-related softness across all jewelry categories. And total sales and comps declined 8% and 9% on a constant exchange rate basis.
We can only speculate on why domestic U.S. consumer spending at the high end has been generally soft, but we believe that macro, market and political uncertainties are likely playing a role in restrained consumer behavior. Regardless, our long-term plan is to mitigate these headwinds by better engaging with existing and potential customers and enhancing their experiences both in our stores and online. We added one store in the Americas during the second quarter when we opened in the luxurious new Holt Renfrew store at the Square One Center in Mississauga, which is the sixth largest city in Canada. Beyond opening new stores, our strategy to optimize our store base includes renovations, relocations and closings. Right now, we are in the midst of major renovations of our stores in San Francisco, Beverly Hills and Vancouver, similar to the renovation last year in Chicago of our Michigan Avenue store.
In the Asia Pacific region, total sales and comparable store sales declined 6% and 12% in the quarter. The sales declines were due to a combination of lower average price, lower unit volume and a shift in mix; and reflected softness across much of the region. We were pleased with healthy total and comparable store sales growth in China as well as in Korea. However, continued meaningful sales declines in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and Singapore contributed to the overall regional softness. On a constant exchange rate basis, the total and comp store sales declines in the Asia Pacific region were 3% and 9%.
During the quarter, we expanded our successful presence in Australia when we opened 2 stores: one at the Pacific Fair Center on the Gold Coast and 1 at the Sydney international airport. And we now operate 9 stores in Australia.
In Japan, total sales and comparable store sales increased 10% and 13% in the quarter, but that increase entirely reflected the translation benefit from the recent and substantial strengthening of the yen against the dollar. This translation benefit more than offset lower spending that we estimate comes from foreign tourists, especially from China. There was also a decline in wholesale sales. An increase in average price was currency related, but we did have a modest increase in jewelry unit volume as well. On a constant exchange rate basis, however, total and comp store sales declined 5% and 3%, reflecting the lower tourist spending I just mentioned as well as the decline in wholesale sales. We've noted that, based on our estimates, spending by local customers held up reasonably well in the quarter despite Japan's weak economy.
The store count in Japan remained at 55 locations at the end of the quarter, although we are pursuing a number of renovations and 3 store relocations this year.
In Europe, soft demand on the continent continued the weak trend that began in last year's fourth quarter with the tragedy in Paris. Total sales and comparable store sales in Europe declined 12% and 17% in the quarter. The sales declines were due to lower jewelry unit volumes. And we believe the sales declines reflected softness in foreign tourist spending across the continent, with a smaller decline in local spending by Europeans. On a constant exchange rate basis, total European sales dropped 8% and comp store sales declined 13%.
On a positive note, we continued to see strong sales growth in Russia. And it's also worth noting that we saw solid sales growth on a constant exchange rate basis in the U.K. in the quarter, although it was slightly down on a GAAP basis. There is obviously uncertainty and anxiety regarding the economic implications of Brexit, but interestingly, we saw an uptrend in the U.K. sales almost immediately following the vote. We believe that the weakening of the pound has made London a more attractive tourist shopping destination.
During the second quarter, we opened a store in the De Bijenkorf luxury department store, representing our second store in Amsterdam. And we closed a small store in the Frankfurt Airport. 
Lastly, other sales declined 3% in the quarter, reflecting continued weak retail demand in the 5 stores we operate in the UAE, with comps down 22% and lower wholesale sales in other Middle East countries. However, those declines were mostly offset by an increase in wholesale sales of diamonds.
Our multidimensional initiatives to improve sales performance revolve around a few core elements: enhancing the customer experience through in-store training and systems to more effectively engage with our customers; optimizing our store base with renovations, relocations and select closings; introducing new designs across product categories and price points; and effective messaging through marketing campaigns to communicate Tiffany's relevancy to a wide audience. The overall objective of these efforts is to increase the frequency of customer visits to our stores and the conversion rate.
With respect to our store base, in total, we opened 4 stores during the quarter and closed 1. For the full year, we expect to add 11 stores, close 9 and relocate 6, which will represent about a 2% net increase in gross retail square footage. And we expect to maintain that low single-digit growth rate in the foreseeable future. Beyond our stores is a strong web presence around the world, with e-commerce sales in 13 countries accounting for 6% of worldwide sales in 2015. Worldwide e-commerce sales in the second quarter were roughly unchanged from the prior year, but we also believe that our online presence enhances brand and product awareness and can drive store traffic too.
From a merchandising perspective, in the quarter, performance among the product categories was pretty consistent with the first quarter. All categories were below prior year to one degree or another, but once again the fashion jewelry category and the engagement jewelry and wedding bands category performed relatively better than the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry category. Within that category, statement jewelry, representing the highest price points, has been the weakest performer in 2016 after posting very impressive growth last year. We're encouraged with steady progress toward improving sales in the fashion jewelry category, as we have seen a moderation in year-over-year sales declines. Our plan is to grow gold jewelry sales and to stabilize sales in silver jewelry. Through recent innovations, with more to come, and with support from new advertising campaigns, we believe we are well positioned to provide a compelling message to consumers across a wide age range; and by doing so, improve our performance in this category. One example of innovation in the fashion jewelry category is our new Return to Tiffany Love designs and the supporting #LoveNotLike social digital marketing campaign. Also recently, Tiffany became the first luxury brand to sponsor a SnapChat lens on July 28 that was instrumental to the campaign. The SnapChat lens received millions of user plays and substantial media coverage. Additional new silver designs are intended to address softness at price points under $500. In fact, we've increased the number of silver jewelry SKUs under $500 by a double-digit percentage versus a year ago. At higher price points, we've focused on new designs in our important Tiffany T and Atlas collections.
The engagement jewelry and wedding band category also posted a relatively modest sales decline this quarter relative to last year. We believe we're increasing awareness of Tiffany's competitive strength in this category via a bold, new advertising campaign this year that accentuates the rarity of our diamonds as well as our craftsmanship and heritage. While Tiffany is certainly renowned for its classic 6-prong setting, our Harmony diamond ring collection is generating strong results, as is our extraordinary assortment of wedding bands. Lastly, in the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry category, the softness in statement jewelry has overshadowed more mixed results in other parts of that category. We're pleased with continued success in our recently expanded Victoria collection but saw a mixed performance in other collections. And later this year, we plan to add new designs within our keys collection, among others.
And I should point out our new ad campaign Legendary Style, which will be debuting in the coming days, highlighting a few of our important jewelry collections. Created in collaboration with fashion visionary, Grace Coddington, this campaign features women of style and substance, known for their unique points of view, wearing iconic Tiffany designs. The campaign will appear in print, video and across digital properties. 
Beyond jewelry, we're pleased with progress in building our watch business as we intend to introduce new designs in our CT60 and East West collections; add new jeweled watches; and increase customer appreciation of Tiffany's heritage in that category, which dates back to the 1800s. Also extending beyond jewelry, during the second quarter, we were pleased to announce our collaboration with renowned designer Reed Krakoff to develop gift, home and accessory collections for introduction in 2017.
So that completes the sales review. Let's now take a look at the rest of the results.

In addition, there was increased use of in-house credit related to higher-priced jewelry sales and a small increase related to timing of sales in our wholesale business. The rate of receivable turnover was a high 20x per year.
Capital expenditures were $101 million in the first half of the year versus $98 million in last year's first half, and the vast majority of CapEx is related to stores and IT spending.
We maintained an active pace of share repurchases in the quarter, spending $72 million to repurchase shares at an average cost of $63 per share. And we spent $150 million for share repurchases in the first half of this year and, at July 31, had $344 million available for repurchases under the program that expires in January 2019.
Tying it all together, we had cash and short-term investments of $720 million on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter. Total short-term and long-term debt of $1.1 billion represented 37% of stockholders' equity.

Before proceeding, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission; including the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K.

Okay, by now, you should have had a chance to read the news release which we issued earlier today which indicated worldwide sales increased 1%, net earnings were up 5% and net earnings per diluted share were up 9% during the third quarter versus a year ago. So in order to make the most efficient use of today's call, I will provide some additional perspective on segment sales and product trends, after which, Mark will take us through the rest of the P&L and comment on Tiffany's outlook for the remainder of the year. And as always, you can refer to the report on Form 10-Q we filed earlier today for additional details.
Starting in the Americas. Total sales were 2% below prior year, as a modest decline in jewelry units was mostly offset by an increase in the average price per unit sold. Comparable store sales improved to a 2% decline, with no effect from currency translation, after a 10% decline in the first half. While this is encouraging, we did have an easier comparison to last year. Sales in the U.S. were again pressured by lower spending attributable to local customers, which we believe was tied to macro, market and political uncertainties. Interestingly, spending by customers that we identify as foreign tourists actually rose in the quarter, in contrast to a decline in the first half, as continued lower spending attributed to Chinese tourists was more than offset by increased spending attributed to visitors from Japan and elsewhere.
I presume you saw the comment in today's news release regarding our Fifth Avenue flagship store in New York. Sales in that store in every quarter of last year represented less than 10% of worldwide sales and have been at similar levels so far this year in the third quarter and year-to-date through October 31. There certainly has been a lot of attention focused on the potential effect of activities related to the recent U.S. presidential election on stores along the relevant part of Fifth Avenue. What we've seen has been some adverse effect on traffic in our flagship store as well as a continuation of sales softness relative to last year and to our other U.S. stores this year. Because of obvious uncertainty, we will maintain a cautious outlook in the near term, and we cannot provide any assurance that sales in this [ph][ph]  during the fourth quarter and beyond will not be negatively affected.
During the quarter, we relocated one of our Canadian stores located within the Holt Renfrew department store in Vancouver; and also relocated one of our U.S. stores located within the King of Prussia mall, which is in the Philadelphia market.
In the Asia Pacific region, we were pleased to return to sales growth [indiscernible][indiscernible]  in the third quarter, with total sales up 4% as reported and 3% on a constant exchange rate basis. There was an increase in jewelry units and a decline in the average price per unit sold. Comp store sales declined 7%. Currency translation had no year-over-year effect on comps in the quarter.
The growth in the region partly reflected a continuation of solid total and comp store sales growth in mainland China. We were also pleased to experience a smaller sequential sales decline in Hong Kong. And elsewhere in the region, sales were strong in both our retail and the wholesale business in Korea but remained especially soft in Australia and Singapore.
The Asia Pacific region had a lot of store activity in the quarter, where we opened 4 stores and closed 2. In China, we opened a store in Ningbo-Heyi and one in Tianjin Hisense. Also in China, we closed at a very small store in Beijing, in The Peninsula hotel; and we closed 1 in the Tianjin Friendship store. We also opened our 15th store in Korea, in the Shinsegae Department Store, and we opened our first store in New Zealand in Auckland's magnificent Britomart precinct. 
Sales in Japan in the quarter were mixed. Total sales rose 13% and comp store sales rose 20% but that entirely resulted from the favorable translation effect of the stronger yen versus the dollar. However, translation aside, there was a solid increase in jewelry units sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales declined 4% in the quarter and comps rose 2%. I should point out that the disparity between the total sales decline and the comp sales increase reflected lower wholesale sales in Japan. The strengthening of the yen this year has made purchasing by foreigners more expensive in Japan which we believe is negatively affecting our business as a result of the reduced tourist spending. In addition, while the modest comp increase in yen that I noted earlier was a sharp contrast to the substantial local currency sales increase in last year's third quarter, when spending attributed to domestic customers and Chinese tourists likely tied to the weak yen at the time was exceptionally strong, the 2-year run rate is still quite positive. It's also worth noting that in addition to higher local spending attributed to Japanese customers in this latest quarter, we are seeing, as I mentioned earlier, a solid increase in spending attributable to Japanese tourists in other regions. 
In Europe, total sales declined 10% due to a combination of lower jewelry unit sold and a lower average price per unit sold and comp store sales declined 14%. On a constant exchange rate basis, comp store sales were down 7% which compared with a healthy increase in last year's third quarter. Demand across Continental Europe remains soft although at varying degrees and it has been especially soft in Paris since the tragic events of last year. Economic conditions also likely contributed to weak spending by domestic customers in many countries. On the other hand, the bright spot for us in Europe was the U.K. where we attribute sales growth to spending by foreign tourists reacting favorably to the weakening of the pound after the Brexit vote. It's worth noting that we recently took a single-digit price increase in the U.K. to partly offset the effect of the weaker pound. 
Lastly, sales in our other segment increased 18% in the quarter, but that entirely reflected an increase in wholesale sales of diamonds since comp store sales actually declined [indiscernible] due to continued weak sales in our 5 stores in the United Arab Emirates. 
In terms of product categories, trends in the quarter were similar to what we experienced in the first half of the year with jewelry at lower price points outperforming pieces at higher price points. The best performing jewelry category was fashion jewelry which posted a modest increase over last year. This was driven by an increase in gold jewelry sales tied to the strength of the T Collection, which we have continued to build upon with new designs. In addition, fashion silver jewelry stabilized with sales up slightly from the prior year although that varied by region and was led by the popularity of the Return to Tiffany Love collection. We've added quite a bit of product newness in silver jewelry this year with a double-digit percentage increase in the number of new SKUs under $500. 
At the other extreme was continued softness across the statement fine and solitaire jewelry category led by a decline in the high-end statement sales which, in contrast, had posted strong growth last year. Performing roughly in line with the prior year on a worldwide basis was the engagement jewelry and wedding bands category with the results varying by region. 
Rounding out the product review is the watch category which posted strong growth albeit from a still small base as we continue to be pleased with our customers' interest in new designs. 
Finally, worldwide e-commerce sales in the third quarter increased in line with overall sales growth. 
To summarize our top line results, we would say that third quarter results were mixed with some improvement in certain geographies and product categories but with softness in other areas making it premature to say that there has been a meaningful turn in the business. 
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mark Erceg."

Before jumping straight into the P&L, let me take a minute to explain why I joined Tiffany. Simply put, I joined Tiffany because I believe we have tremendous opportunity to increase the profitability of our business and in so doing create attractive total shareholder returns in the years ahead. Consistent with this, my 3 primary objectives will be helping Frederick and the rest of Tiffany's strong management team to first identify profitable and sustainable growth opportunities; second, to invest behind those opportunities with funds generated from tight cost control efforts and the efficient deployment of capital; and third, to drive execution discipline in order to enable us to achieve that growth in a way that enhances shareholder value. 
Now let's quickly look at the rest of the income statement. Gross margin was up 80 basis points versus a year ago to 61% as we continue to see some benefit from lower product input costs and a continued shift in product sales away from statement jewelry and towards fashion jewelry which, as you know, carries a higher gross margin. SG&A rose 4% in the third quarter after having declined 4% in the second quarter. The increase partly resulted from some marketing spending that was shifted from the second quarter into the second half of the year. The increase also reflected higher store occupancy and depreciation costs along with higher labor and incentive compensation costs. Interest and other expenses were lower than last year due to a combination of reduced foreign currency transaction losses and lower interest expense and our effective tax rate came in at 34.6%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We believe Tiffany's strong balance sheet is a competitive advantage, and given our cash balance available liquidity and modest leverage, we are well positioned to support all of our key business initiatives going forward. That said, we will continue to explore ways to improve asset productivity including through the proactive management of inventory both at the store level and throughout the entire supply chain in order to generate healthy levels of free cash flow. 
And speaking of free cash flow, inventory at quarter-end was 2% lower than a year ago. Our long-term objective of keeping inventory growth below the rate of sales growth remains unchanged. Accounts receivable were 4% higher than at this time last year with the increase being mostly currency related. Capital expenditures were $157 million in the first 9 months of the year versus $159 million during the same period last year. A large part of that spending was to support our global store network. For the full year, our plan is to open 11 company-operated stores. We also plan to relocate 6 stores and close 6 stores. [indiscernible] square footage to increase by approximately 3%. We've also been devoting significant portions of our CapEx budget to upgrade and enhance our IT systems which we continue to assess and evaluate. We believe these investments will, over time, make our supply chain more efficient, improve our in-store experience and generate incremental sales by leveraging both our CRM and omnichannel capabilities. 
Share repurchase activity continued throughout the quarter with approximately 455,000 shares purchased at an average cost of just under $68 per share, which, along with the dividend increase from earlier this year, continues to demonstrate our practice of returning excess cash to our shareholders. 
Total short-term and long-term debt represented 38% of stockholders' equity versus 37% last year. Looking forward, despite some modest sales improvement in the third quarter, we remain cautious about the near-term outlook for several reasons. First, overall global economic conditions remain highly volatile, so we would like to see several quarters of sales acceleration before making any conclusion about the trend in global luxury goods spending. Second, and as a practical matter, given the close proximity of our Fifth Avenue flagship store to the Trump Tower, we've noted that recent election-related activity has caused a minor disruptions to pedestrians' foot traffic around the store. Federal state and local officials and Tiffany security personnel are all doing a fabulous job trying to minimize any disruptions. However, given the importance of the holiday selling season to our flagship store, we remain understandably cautious as to how this situation might impact sales over the coming weeks. 
Finally, we're mindful of the uncertainty which surrounds the upcoming Hong Kong elections next year and how that might impact tourism and spending in one of our largest markets. So taking all of this into account, and despite third quarter results coming in better than expected, we are holding to our previous annual forecast. Specifically, we continue to expect that full year sales will decline by a low single-digit percentage from the prior year and diluted EPS will decline by a mid-single-digit percentage from last year's adjusted EPS, which you may recall excluded loan impairment and certain staffing and occupancy charges. These expectations are based on our plans and assumptions including those set forth in the news release we issued earlier today. We expect to report Tiffany's holiday period sales results on January 17 and plan to follow that up with our year-end report later in March when Frederick will join Mark and I for commentary and your questions. 
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Mark."

Before proceeding, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law or regulation.
Okay, by now, you should have had a chance to read the news release which we issued earlier today, which indicated worldwide sales increased 1%, net earnings were up 5% and net earnings per diluted share were up 9% during the third quarter versus a year ago. So in order to make the most efficient use of today's call, I will provide some additional perspective on segment sales and product trends, after which Mark will take us through the rest of the P&L and comment on Tiffany's outlook for the remainder of the year. And as always, you can refer to the report on Form 10-Q we filed earlier today for additional details.
Starting in the Americas. Total sales were 2% below prior year, and a modest decline in jewelry units was mostly offset by an increase in the average price per unit sold. Comparable store sales improved to a 2% decline, with no effect from currency translation, after a 10% decline in the first half. While this is encouraging, we did have an easier comparison to last year. Sales in the U.S. were again pressured by lower spending attributable to local customers, which we believe was tied to macro, market and political uncertainties. Interestingly, spending by customers that we identify as foreign tourists actually rose in the quarter, in contrast to a decline in the first half, as continued lower spending attributed to Chinese tourists was more than offset by increased spending attributed to visitors from Japan and elsewhere.
I presume you saw the comment in today's news release regarding our Fifth Avenue flagship store in New York. Sales in that store in every quarter of last year represented less than 10% of worldwide sales; and have been at similar levels so far this year, in the third quarter and year-to-date through October 31. There certainly has been a lot of attention focused on the potential effect of activities related to the recent U.S. presidential election on stores along the relevant part of Fifth Avenue. What we've seen has been some adverse effect on traffic in our flagship store as well as a continuation of sales softness relative to last year and to our other U.S. stores this year. Because of obvious uncertainty, we will maintain a cautious outlook in the near term, and we cannot provide any assurance that sales in this store in the fourth quarter and beyond will not be negatively affected.
During the quarter, we relocated one of our Canadian stores located within the Holt Renfrew department store in Vancouver; and also relocated one of our U.S. stores located within the King of Prussia mall, which is in the Philadelphia market.
In the Asia Pacific region, we were pleased to return to sales growth in the third quarter, with total sales up 4% as reported and 3% on a constant exchange rate basis. There was an increase in jewelry units and a decline in the average price per unit sold. Comp store sales declined 7%. Currency translation had no year-over-year effect on comps in the quarter. The growth in the region partly reflected a continuation of solid total and comp store sales growth in mainland China. We were also pleased to experience a smaller sequential sales decline in Hong Kong. And elsewhere in the region, sales were strong in both our retail and wholesale business in Korea but remained especially soft in Australia and Singapore.
The Asia Pacific region had a lot of store activity in the quarter, where we opened 4 stores and closed 2. In China, we opened a store in Ningbo-Heyi and 1 in Tianjin Hisense. Also in China, we closed at a very small store in Beijing, in The Peninsula hotel; and we closed 1 in the Tianjin Friendship store. We also opened our 15th store in Korea, in the Shinsegae Hanam department store. And we opened our first store in New Zealand, in Auckland's magnificent Britomart precinct.
Sales in Japan in the quarter were mixed. Total sales rose 13% and comp store sales rose 20%, but that entirely resulted from the favorable translation effect of the stronger yen versus the dollar. However, translation aside, there was a solid increase in jewelry units sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales declined 4% in the quarter and comps rose 2%. I should point out that the disparity between the total sales decline and the comp sales increase reflected lower wholesale sales in Japan.

It's also worth noting that, in addition to higher local spending attributed to Japanese customers in this latest quarter, we are seeing, as I mentioned earlier, a solid increase in spending attributable to Japanese tourists in other regions.
In Europe, total sales declined 10% due to a combination of lower jewelry units sold and a lower average price per unit sold, and comp store sales declined 14%. On a constant exchange rate basis, comp store sales were down 7%, which compared with a healthy increase in last year's third quarter. Demand across Continental Europe remained soft, although to varying degrees, and has been especially soft in Paris since the tragic events of last year. Economic conditions also likely contributed to weak spending by domestic customers in many countries. On the other hand, the bright spot for us in Europe was the U.K., where we attribute sales growth to spending by foreign tourists reacting favorably to the weakening of the pound after the Brexit vote. It is worth noting that we recently took a single-digit price increase in the U.K. to partly offset the effect of the weaker pound.
Lastly, sales in our Other segment increased 18% in the quarter, but that entirely reflected an increase in wholesale sales of diamonds since comp store sales actually declined 12% due to continued weak sales in our 5 stores in the United Arab Emirates.
In terms of product categories, trends in the quarter were similar to what we experienced in the first half of the year with jewelry at lower price points outperforming pieces at higher price points. The best-performing jewelry category was fashion jewelry, which posted a modest increase over last year. This was driven by an increase in gold jewelry sales tied to the strength of the T collection, which we have continued to build upon with new designs. In addition, fashion silver jewelry stabilized, with sales up slightly from the prior year, although that varied by region and was led by the popularity of the Return to Tiffany Love collection. We've added quite a bit of product newness in silver jewelry this year, with a double-digit percentage increase in the number of new SKUs under $500.
At the other extreme was continued softness across the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry category led by a decline in the high-end statement sales, which in contrast had posted strong growth last year. Performing roughly in line with the prior year on a worldwide basis was the engagement jewelry and wedding bands category, with results varying by region.
Rounding out the product review is the watch category, which posted strong growth, albeit from a still small base, as we continue to be pleased with our customers' interest in new designs.
Finally, worldwide e-commerce sales in the third quarter increased in line with overall sales growth.
To summarize our top line results, we would say that third quarter results were mixed with some improvement in certain geographies and product categories but with softness in other areas, making it premature to say that there has been a meaningful turn in the business.
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mark Erceg."

Before jumping straight into the P&L, let me take a minute to explain why I joined Tiffany. Simply put, I joined Tiffany because I believe we have tremendous opportunity to increase the profitability of our business and in so doing create attractive total shareholder returns in the years ahead. Consistent with this, my 3 primary objectives will be helping Frederic and the rest of Tiffany's strong management team to, first, identify profitable and sustainable growth opportunities; second, to invest behind those opportunities with funds generated from tight cost-control efforts and the efficient deployment of capital; and third, to drive execution discipline in order to enable us to achieve that growth in a way that enhances shareholder value.
Now let's quickly look at the rest of the income statement.
Gross margin was up 80 basis points versus a year ago to 61% as we continue to see some benefit from lower product input costs; and a continued shift in product sales away from statement jewelry and towards fashion jewelry, which as you know carries a higher gross margin. SG&A rose 4% in the third quarter after having declined 4% in the second quarter. The increase partly resulted from some marketing spending that was shifted from the second quarter into the second half of the year. The increase also reflected higher store occupancy and depreciation costs along with higher labor and incentive compensation costs. Interest and other expenses were lower than last year due to a combination of reduced foreign currency transaction losses and lower interest expense. And our effective tax rate came in at 34.6%.
Turning to the balance sheet. We believe Tiffany's strong balance sheet is a competitive advantage. And giving our cash balance, available liquidity and modest leverage, we are well positioned to support all of our key business initiatives going forward. That said, we will continue to explore ways to improve asset productivity, including through the proactive management of inventory both at the store level and throughout the entire supply chain, in order to generate healthy levels of free cash flow.
And speaking of free cash flow. Inventory at quarter end was 2% lower than a year ago. Our long-term objective of keeping inventory growth below the rate of sales growth remains unchanged. Accounts receivable were 4% higher than at this time last year, with the increase being mostly currency related.
Capital expenditures were $157 million in the first 9 months of the year versus $159 million during the same period last year. A large part of that spending was to support our global store network. For the full year, our plan is to open 11 company-operated stores. We also plan to relocate 6 stores and close 6 stores. [indiscernible] we expect [ph] square footage to increase by approximately 3%. We've also been devoting significant portions of our CapEx budget to upgrade and enhance our IT systems, which we continue to assess and evaluate. We believe these investments will, over time, make our supply chain more efficient, improve our in-store experience and generate incremental sales by leveraging both our CRM and omnichannel capabilities.
Share repurchase activity continued throughout the quarter, with approximately 455,000 shares purchased at an average cost of just under $68 per share, which along with the dividend increase from earlier this year continues to demonstrate our practice of returning excess cash to our shareholders.
Total short-term and long-term debt represented 38% of stockholders' equity versus 37% last year.
Looking forward, despite some modest sales improvement in the third quarter, we remain cautious about the near-term outlook for several reasons. First, overall global economic conditions remain highly volatile, so we would like to see several quarters of sales acceleration before making any conclusion about a turn in global luxury goods spending. Second and as a practical matter, given the close proximity of our Fifth Avenue flagship store to the Trump Tower, we've noted that recent election-related activity has caused some minor disruptions to pedestrian foot traffic around that store. Federal, state and local officials and Tiffany security personnel are all doing a fabulous job trying to minimize any disruptions. However, given the importance of the holiday selling season to our flagship store, we remain understandably cautious as to how this situation might impact sales over the coming weeks. Finally, we're mindful of the uncertainty which surrounds the upcoming Hong Kong elections next year and how that might impact tourism and spending in one of our largest markets.
So taking all this into account and despite third quarter results coming in better than expected, we are holding to our previous annual forecast. Specifically, we continue to expect that full year sales will decline by a low single-digit percentage from the prior year; and diluted EPS will decline by a mid-single-digit percentage from last year's adjusted EPS, which you may recall excluded loan impairment and certain staffing and occupancy charges. These expectations are based on our plans and assumptions, including those set forth in the news release we issued earlier today.
We expect to report Tiffany's holiday period sales results on January 17; and plan to follow that up with our year-end report later in March, when Frederic will join Mark and I for commentary and your questions.
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Mark."

Before proceeding, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law or regulation.
Okay, by now, you should have had a chance to read the news release which we issued earlier today, which indicated worldwide sales increased 1%, net earnings were up 5% and net earnings per diluted share were up 9% during the third quarter versus a year ago. So in order to make the most efficient use of today's call, I will provide some additional perspective on segment sales and product trends, after which Mark will take us through the rest of the P&L and comment on Tiffany's outlook for the remainder of the year. And as always, you can refer to the report on Form 10-Q we filed earlier today for additional details.
Starting in the Americas. Total sales were 2% below prior year, and a modest decline in jewelry units was mostly offset by an increase in the average price per unit sold. Comparable store sales improved to a 2% decline, with no effect from currency translation, after a 10% decline in the first half. While this is encouraging, we did have an easier comparison to last year. Sales in the U.S. were again pressured by lower spending attributable to local customers, which we believe was tied to macro, market and political uncertainties. Interestingly, spending by customers that we identify as foreign tourists actually rose in the quarter, in contrast to a decline in the first half, as continued lower spending attributed to Chinese tourists was more than offset by increased spending attributed to visitors from Japan and elsewhere.
I presume you saw the comment in today's news release regarding our Fifth Avenue flagship store in New York. Sales in that store in every quarter of last year represented less than 10% of worldwide sales and have been at similar levels so far this year, in the third quarter and year-to-date through October 31. There certainly has been a lot of attention focused on the potential effect of activities related to the recent U.S. presidential election on stores along the relevant part of Fifth Avenue. What we've seen has been some adverse effect on traffic in our flagship store as well as a continuation of sales softness relative to last year and to our other U.S. stores this year. Because of obvious uncertainty, we will maintain a cautious outlook in the near term, and we cannot provide any assurance that sales in this store in the fourth quarter and beyond will not be negatively affected.
During the quarter, we relocated one of our Canadian stores located within the Holt Renfrew department store in Vancouver; and also relocated one of our U.S. stores located within the King of Prussia mall, which is in the Philadelphia market.
In the Asia Pacific region, we were pleased to return to sales growth in the third quarter, with total sales up 4% as reported and 3% on a constant exchange rate basis. There was an increase in jewelry units and a decline in the average price per unit sold. Comp store sales declined 7%. Currency translation had no year-over-year effect on comps in the quarter. The growth in the region partly reflected a continuation of solid total and comp store sales growth in mainland China. We were also pleased to experience a smaller sequential sales decline in Hong Kong. And elsewhere in the region, sales were strong in both our retail and wholesale business in Korea but remained especially soft in Australia and Singapore.
The Asia Pacific region had a lot of store activity in the quarter, where we opened 4 stores and closed 2. In China, we opened a store in Ningbo Heyi and one in Tianjin Hisense. Also in China, we closed a very small store in Beijing, in The Peninsula hotel; and we closed one in the Tianjin Friendship store. We also opened our 15th store in Korea, in the Shinsegae Hanam department store. And we opened our first store in New Zealand, in Auckland's magnificent Britomart precinct.
Sales in Japan in the quarter were mixed. Total sales rose 13% and comp store sales rose 20%, but that entirely resulted from the favorable translation effect of the stronger yen versus the dollar. However, translation aside, there was a solid increase in jewelry units sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales declined 4% in the quarter and comps rose 2%. I should point out that the disparity between the total sales decline and the comp sales increase reflected lower wholesale sales in Japan. The strengthening of the yen this year has made purchasing by foreigners more expensive in Japan, which we believe is negatively affecting our business as a result of the reduced tourist spending. In addition, while the modest comp increase in yen that I noted earlier was a sharp contrast to the substantial local currency sales increase in last year's third quarter, when spending attributed to domestic customers and Chinese tourists likely tied to the weak yen at that time was exceptionally strong, the 2-year run rate is still quite positive.
