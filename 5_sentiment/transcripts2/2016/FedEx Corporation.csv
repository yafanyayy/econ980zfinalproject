Let me begin by thanking hundreds of thousands of FedEx teammates for delivering our Purple Promise every day, including a great 2015 peak season. 
FedEx Corporation continues to improve margins, financial performance and competitive position. As noted, our 3Q FY year-over-year earnings per share is up 23%. I should note there are 3 recurring areas of concern, however, expressed in various articles and reports. One, future margins; two, industry disruption; and three, capital spending. Regarding margins, the Express profit improvement program will be exceeded by May 31. Express segment margins in the current fourth fiscal quarter will be approximately 12%. Likewise, FedEx Ground, including SmartPost margins, will increase and be 16 plus percent this quarter, while the FedEx Ground and Supply Chain segment will be 15%. Remember, GENCO is now part of this segment and the margins in this business will not be as high as those of Ground itself. However, the strategic importance of our expanded customer solutions resulting from the GENCO acquisition is profound and will greatly benefit our future financial performance. 
A significant issue for FedEx Ground over the past year has been the extraordinary growth of oversized shipments, which Mike Glenn and Henry Maier will address. It is truly unfortunate that Congress did not increase the federal twin trailer limit from 28 feet each to 33 feet, which would have benefited consumers, lowered fuel consumption and reduced highway accidents. We're optimistic about FedEx Freight improving margins in the future as well, and Mike Ducker can talk about that. 
It's important to note that we manage FedEx operating companies to maximize the corporation's performance over the long term. So in any given quarter, we may spend more in one segment to achieve this result. The concerns about industry disruption continued to be fueled by fantastical, and let me emphasize, I chose this word carefully, articles and reports, which are devoid of in-depth knowledge of logistics systems and the markets which FedEx serves. As we have previously noted, network design, technology, facilities capabilities and route/stop densities are the key elements in the FedEx, UPS and Postal Service systems that make it highly likely these entities will remain the primary carriers for e-commerce shipments in the U.S. for the foreseeable future. 
Finally, FedEx is currently investing in FedEx Express fleet modernization and expansion of FedEx Ground's highly automated facilities. Both these major programs have high returns and are integral to margin expansion. Our cash flows are such that we can easily fund investments at $4 billion to $5 billion per year while retiring debt used to acquire TNT, if the transaction is approved, and stock repurchases. Of course, we include replacement CapEx in this projection. To reiterate, we believe FedEx will continue to improve margins, EPS, capital returns and increase cash flows, which we have told you repeatedly over the last couple of years and again, have demonstrated this quarter. 
Let me now turn to Mike Glenn for our economic outlook, followed by Alan Graf with detailed remarks about our financials. Mike?"

I'll open with our economic outlook -- update and outlook and then discuss our performance and business conditions in each segment, including revenue, volume and yield and provide some commentary on broader industry trends that we're experie",1244,"Thanks, Fred. I'll open with our economic outlook -- update and outlook and then discuss our performance and business conditions in each segment, including revenue, volume and yield and provide some commentary on broader industry trends that we're experiencing. 
On the economic front, we see moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP forecast is 2.2% for calendar '16, 40 basis points lower than our forecast last quarter and 2.5% for calendar '17 led by gains in consumer spending. We expect industrial production growth of 0.6% in calendar '16, 130 basis points lower than last quarter and 2.5% for next year. Our global GDP forecast is 2.5% for calendar '16, which is 30 basis points below last quarter and 2.9% for calendar '17. 
Now I'll review revenue volume and yield trends by segment. In the Express segment, revenue decreased 1% as lower fuel surcharge and unfavorable currency exchange rates more than offset yield growth. U.S. domestic package volume grew by 2% driven by growth in overnight packages. U.S. domestic revenue per package increased 1% despite lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year domestic Express package yields grew 3% primarily due to rate and discounts. FedEx International Economy volume grew 2% while FedEx International Priority volume decreased 3%. International export revenue per package decreased 5% as lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable currency exchange rates negatively impacted yields. Excluding fuel, International Export Express package yield decreased 1%, primarily driven by negative -- the negative impact of exchange rates, which outweighed the positive impact of rate and discount changes. FedEx Ground increased to 30% -- revenue increased 30% in the quarter driven by higher Ground volume and yield, recording of SmartPost revenue on a gross basis versus the previous net treatment [ph] and due to the inclusion of GENCO results. FedEx Ground average daily volume grew 11% in Q3, primarily driven by growth for demand for residential deliveries related to e-commerce. FedEx Ground revenue per package increased 8% year-over-year in Q3 due to the recording of SmartPost revenues on a gross basis and higher base rates, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, Ground yield per package, including SmartPost, increased 11% year-over-year driven primarily by rate and discount and SmartPost customer mix. FedEx Freight increased revenue 1% as LTL shipments increased 7% and revenue per shipment declined 4%. The increase in shipments is driven by our sales efforts with small and medium customers that reflects the speed, reliability and choice of Priority and Economy services for our LTL customers. Revenue per LTL shipment declined due to lower fuel surcharges and average weight per shipment. Excluding the impact of fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per shipment was down 1% year-over-year due to lower weight per shipment. 
Now, I'll discuss in more detail some of the industry dynamics that drove the record peak season and beyond. The 2015 peak season was historic by many measures and it was driven by the continued growth of e-commerce. Demand for residential deliveries across the industry surpassed expectations as consumers increased online shopping in record numbers. Not only was there higher volumes, but the types of goods purchased online increased. FedEx experienced record demand, including multiple days of greater than 25 million packages delivered, which is more than double our average daily volume. We're proud of our team members and the incredible job they did with more than 325 million packages delivered during the peak period. We worked very closely with our large detail and other peak customers to prepare for their needs and to deliver the holidays. It is very clear that e-commerce is now enabled the full scale retail regulation. There are several important trends worth noting. 
First, referring to a specific peak day is quickly becoming a thing of the past. As evidenced of year, there were multiple days where volumes exceeded 25 million packages, as consumers buying habits are changing. We view this as a positive as mother nature can sometimes play havoc with last minute e-commerce shoppers. Smoothing sales throughout peak season is a trend that will benefit retailers and transportation companies alike. We believe online shoppers will have increasing incentives to order earlier in the holiday season. 
Second, more and more retailers are fulfilling e-commerce orders from individual stores and what we call store-to-home delivery. FedEx is well positioned to service this growing market in the years ahead with our broad portfolio of services, including metro delivery and same-day services. 
Third, we're seeing a significant increase in nontraditional items now being purchased online. Mattresses, canoes, swing sets and big-screen TVs, just to name a few. We welcome this opportunity, but it's important that we price these items accordingly to account for the operational complexities such as manual sortation, 2% delivery, et cetera. As a result, we'll be adjusting the additional handling surcharge for FedEx Ground. Today, if the package is greater than 6 -- package length is greater than 60 inches, initial handling surcharge will be applied. Beginning June 1, the maximum length will be reduced from 60 inches to 48 inches. We believe 48 inches is appropriate as it is the standard length of an LTL palette. It's important to note -- to remember that the primary value proposition of e-commerce is the ability to order a product online and have it reliably delivered to the consumer. In that regard, FedEx is and will continue to be a key enabler for e-commerce in the years ahead. By our estimates, more than 95% of all e-commerce orders today are delivered by 1 of 3 entities in the United States: FedEx; the United States Postal Service, with whom we have a strategic relationship to transport their Priority Mail; and UPS. In fact, if we were to isolate our e-commerce business, one could argue that FedEx is one of the most profitable e-commerce companies in business today. 
I'd also like to clarify some of the public discussions, speculation concerning Amazon adding some direct transportation capabilities. First, Amazon is a valuable customer that we've worked with for many years and we expect to work with them for many years to come. We've been in constant dialogue with them to understand their transportation needs as they've experienced significant growth. We've been aware of Amazon's need for supplemental capacity related to inventory management, which is driving some of the investments they're making in transportation. Large retailers have long had their own transportation capabilities primarily to enable movement and positioning inventory across their store and fulfillment locations. While recent stories and reports of a new entity competing with the 3 major carriers in the United States grabs headlines, the reality is it will be a daunting task requiring tens of billions of dollars in capital and years to build sufficient scale and density to replicate existing networks like FedEx. It's also important to note that no one FedEx customer represents more than approximately 3% of total revenue. Additionally, other than the Postal Service, no single customer represents more than approximately 3% of revenue for FedEx Express, FedEx Ground or FedEx Freight. We manage these relationships carefully to ensure we don't become overly dependent on any one customer. We expect these industry trends and dynamics to accelerate this coming holiday season and we will continue to -- and we'll continue to affect the industry year-round. FedEx is well positioned to provide innovative solutions and to meet this growing demand. 
And now I'll turn it over to Alan Graf."
124423,313824573,953634,"FedEx Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 16, 2016",2016-03-16,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike, for that excellent report, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a strong quarter with adjusted earnings of $2.51 per diluted share, up year-over-year, more than 23%. Adjusted consolidated operating margin increased to a healthy 9.2% versu",1385,"Thank you, Mike, for that excellent report, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a strong quarter with adjusted earnings of $2.51 per diluted share, up year-over-year, more than 23%. Adjusted consolidated operating margin increased to a healthy 9.2% versus 8.3% last year. These record earnings proved once again the success of our strategy to manage our portfolio of services to achieve enterprise results. And it's important to remember the strategy does not always translate into each segment's individual earnings and margin performance. We expect our fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings to be up 20% to 22% over last year as we continue to benefit from our execution of the profit improvement program at Express. Our positive financial momentum should continue into our upcoming fiscal 2017 where we expect continued solid growth in earnings and cash flow. 
This quarter, there were 3 expense adjustments. One, [ph] in corporate, eliminations and other. First, during the quarter, we reached agreements in principle to settle all of the 19 cases on appeal in the multidistrict independent contracted litigation. The settlements will require court approval. We recognized a liability for the net expected loss related to these cases and certain other pending independent contractor related proceedings of $204 million or $0.46 per diluted share. These disputes involve a contractor model, which FedEx Ground has not operated since 2011. This is good news because assuming the necessary court approvals are obtained, it resolves all of the remaining multidistrict litigation cases. We are understanding model cases that are no longer -- that are not or no longer part of the multidistrict litigation. These cases are in varying stages of litigation. We do not expect to incur immaterial loss in these cases. Secondly, net expenses related to the settlement of U.S. Customs and Border Protection matter involving FedEx Trade Networks were $69 million or $0.15 per diluted share. And thirdly, our pending acquisition of TNT Express and operating income impact of $23 million and an EPS impact of $0.06 per diluted share. 
Turning to the segments and starting with our star, Express. Express had an outstanding quarter as operating income climbed 51% and operating margin increased despite lower revenues. Let me repeat that. Operating income climbed 51% and operating margin increased despite lower revenues. Who does that? Express operating margin was 9.1%, up 320 basis points versus last year and is the best third quarter margin in Express segment history. The increase was driven primarily by yield management, U.S. domestic volume growth and ongoing benefits from the profit improvement program. Express is efficiently managing volume increases in e-commerce and at the same time, continued softness in International volumes. That profit improvement program that we announced in 2012 continues to improve revenue quality, increase productivity and constrained expenses. 
Turning to Ground. Ground saw unprecedented demand with volumes increasing 11%. However, Ground's operating margin declined. The 390 basis point decline in operating margin was primarily driven by 5 factors: One, 190 basis points from the change in SmartPost revenue reporting in the inclusion of GENCO results; two, 60 basis points from higher cost driven significantly by peak season demand that exceeded both volume and package size expectations as Mike discussed; third, 60 basis points from higher sales insurance reserves; fourth, 30 basis points from increased purchase transportation rates for linehaul; and fifth, 30 basis points from network expansion costs. As Mike said, we are evaluating several Ground pricing initiatives to balance our revenue and cost and increase margins. In addition, over the next 2 years, we are spending additional capital at Ground to expand needed capacity to support both commercial and e-commerce growth, including non-conveyable annexes designed to more efficiently handle those packages that do not fit on our sortation equipment. As Fred mentioned, we expect rents to return to mid-teens margins in the fourth quarter. 
At Freight, Freight continues to adjust to a very challenging LTL market. Freight segment operating results decreased, primarily due to salaries and employee benefits expense, outpacing revenue growth. And revenue growth was negatively impacted by lower fuel surcharges and weight per shipment. 
We have been installing dimensional scanners to more accurately cost and price shipments. Freight currently has 45 dimensional scanners in operation today and another 8 slated to be installed by the end of the fiscal year. These dimensional scanners pay for themselves in less than a year and an important part of our yield improvement program. We also expect Freight's productivity to continue to improve in Q4 as well as throughout 2017. 
From an outlook standpoint, we expect our solid earnings growth to continue in the fourth quarter from the execution of the profit improvement program and from improvements in our Express and Ground segments due to volume and yield growth. We are updating the lower part of the range for our adjusted FY '16 earnings guidance to $10.70 before year-end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments. The new range of $10.70 to $10.90 represents adjusted EPS growth of 20% to 22% year-over-year. Our outlook excludes certain legal costs as well as any TNT integration costs or results. Our expectations for earnings are dependent on several external factors, including fuel prices and moderate growth in the global economy. The capital spending forecast for the fiscal year is now $4.8 billion, which is higher than our previous forecast due to increased investments in FedEx Ground as we continue to expand the network in anticipation of continued high growth. 
FedEx is strongly committed to delivering long-term value for our customers, shareowners and team members. In January, we completed the 15 million share repurchase program authorized in September 2014 and announced our most recent stock repurchase program of up to 25 million shares of FedEx Corporation common stock. Since FY '14, FedEx has returned over $8.3 billion to shareowners through the repurchase of over 60 million shares. And during the past 2 years, has increased its dividend by 33% and 25%, respectively. Our strong balance sheet, profit and cash flow performance give us the flexibility to initiate this stock repurchase program while continuing to execute our strategic growth initiatives. In the near term, we are planning a debt offering, the proceeds of which are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and the prepayment of certain tax exempt debt. We intend to fund the acquisition of TNT Express with cash from operations and proceeds from a planned debt offering in the fourth quarter, which we plan to launch shortly after the other debt offering. We will evaluate assessing the euro market for the TNT funding. The lower Moody's rating was expected -- that we expected and will have a de minimus impact on our upcoming financings. 
Regarding the TNT acquisition, we completed several steps during the third quarter, including unconditional approval by the European Commission of our intention to acquire TNT and TNT's announced agreement to sell its airline operation to comply with the rurals governing foreign ownership of European Airlines. We have many questions submitted by analysts on the TNT acquisition. Many of which we cannot answer in detail at this time. I will say that FY '17 will be a year of investment and integration. And then beginning in fiscal '18, I am expecting TNT to be very accretive to earnings. The TNT acquisition is expected to expand our global portfolio, particularly in Europe, significantly lower our cost to serve our European markets by increasing density in our pickup delivery operations and accelerate our global growth. More than 20 FedEx and TNT operational and geographical teams are planning to make the transition as smooth as possible for customers and team members to position FedEx for long-term profitable growth. We remain confident that we will close the acquisition in the first half of calendar year 2016, and we were very pleased with TNT's recently reported improving operating performance. When improved, this landmark acquisition is expected to bring over 50,000 new team members to our ranks and significantly improve our global competitive position. 
In closing, I am extremely proud of the FedEx team for its impressive efforts. Our financial momentum should continue into FY '17 and while we expect continued solid growth in earnings and cash flow. Thank you for your attention and I'm now going to turn the meeting back over to Fred who will start the Q&A."

So without being too much more specific than we already are, which we've been more specific than we usually are, yes, you can see very strong double-digit margins at Express going forward."

We anticipate FedEx Corporation's margins returns, cash flows and EPS to increase over the foreseeable future. So obviously, with Express and then Ground as our biggest operating companies, that should basically answer your question. Regarding the item on the fleet, I think it's important to note that FedEx Express is operating 20 less airplanes today in 2016 than we were in 2013. Now part of the reason we're able to do that is because the airplanes are much more reliable. We don't need as many spares. There's not many maintenance intervals, and of course, we're always trying to make our assets sweat more and use assets productively whether their hours or someone else's. So that's an integral part of what we do as well."

I think it's important to point out here that we are totally focused to FedEx Ground on long-term profitable growth and we have a number of initiatives underway right now that over the long term will fundamentally change the way we operate FedEx Ground. So let me share a couple of them with you. There are network changes underway that integrate commercial and residential networks and position us to increase our operating days and continue to enhance our service. We are making a number of operating adjustments that enables a cost effective and productive handling for the increased volume of large, noncondensable packages. We're also investing in technology that supports operating 1 consolidated Ground network, which prior to our announcement last September, we had 2. We're also transitioning our U.S. pickup and delivery service providers national to a single operating agreement that enables increased service capacity and improves operational flexibility for these independent businesses. Now these investments, which vary in timetables, but should be essentially complete by the end of -- I'm sorry, prior to FY '21, we'll have a short-term impact on margin, but will ultimately drive cost out of the network, enabling Ground margins to return to historical levels. And we continue to believe that we are uniquely positioned to succeed in this new e-commerce world."

So there is no motivation inside FedEx to do anything other than to achieve those results at the corporate level and sometimes we decide to be aggressive in one segment because we're achieving our corporate goals and you've seen that with the Ground numbers when we were responding to the post '08 [ph] crash in Express and fuel prices running up to $147 a barrel. So we launched the profit improvement program and a lot of the corporate results were funded by the outstanding performance of Ground. Now we're doing a lot of things over on Henry's side of the house.

We have one Internet question from Jeffrey Kauffman, the Buckingham Research Group on the TPP trans-pacific trade agreement. While the agreement reached seemed a reason to celebrate, it seems that popular politics seems to be voting down free trade in this election season. What does TPP mean to FedEx and does management view the risk of TPP not being approved increasing? And can you please provide an update. 
Well, I don't think there's any question about the fact that TPP is going to be harder to pass given that the leading Republican and Democratic candidates for the President of The United States are against it. Free trade and opening markets has been American policy since 1934 when Roosevelt and Hall passed the Trade Agreement Act that overturned the absolutely disastrous Smoot-Hawley tariffs. Those were 2 Republicans that in 1929 -- 1930 put in a lot of tariffs to protect America. So trade contracted by 66% and the Roosevelt Hall action in 34 [ph] turned it around, but there's no question that those tariffs created -- was a big part of the cause of the depression. So after the war, one of the first things that Hall still there and Roosevelt, before his death, worked on, was the International Trade Organization along with the IMF and the World Bank. They couldn't get it passed so they instead came up with this framework called the general agreement on tariffs and trades called GATT and 7x they expanded trade until the World Trade Organization was put in place back in the '90s. So the thought that trade has not been a great thing for the world and America is absolutely blind by fax. Now has there been mercantilist, of course there have, Japan, China in particular, but the lump in all trade with the trade practices of a couple of trading partners is like putting leeches on and bleeding the way they used to during the old days and think you're going to get better. I mean, it's a self-inflicted problem. And in the case of Mexico, the NAFTA agreement has added hundreds of billions of dollars to U.S. business, which is traded with Mexico. Yes, we do have a modest trade deficit with Mexico, but the benefits of trade are always dispersed, lower iPhones, lower TVs, lower priced T-shirts, lower automobile cost, on the non-down the line, which makes everyone standard of living better whereas in the pain is always localized like the unfortunate carrier air conditioner shut down in Indiana that's being so prominently talked about. Now TPP, it should be noticed and everybody makes a big thing out of the fact that it's a 54,000 page document or something like that. What it does in the main is to reduce 18,000 tariffs on U.S. goods. So it helps us a lot and I hope, as we get into the general election, that profound benefits of free trade over many, many decades can be understood and the mercantilist practices of people who are not come porting to the WTO dealt with on an individual basis. So we think that's much more difficult to get TPP past, but I can promise you were going to work as hard as we can to make sure people understand these issues."

All you have to do is Google local delivery and you'll come -- I'm not sure where you live, but Google that and the city where you live and you'll find hundreds of companies that deliver parcels on a local basis everyday. That's not the market that FedEx competes in on a day-to-day basis. We run a broad global network. Having said that, as I mentioned before, no single customer represents over 3% of our total revenue. So we're not exposed to any one my customer and we try to manage our business so that we don't get overexposed in that regard. So we're well positioned for growth long-term, and as I said, Amazon is a good customer. We expect them to be a good customer long-term."

Let me refer you to my friend David Abney's remarks after their last quarterly results. He was on CNBC, did a great job and he pointed out that the essential thing in the delivery business is route density and revenue per delivery stop. And that is why he said virtually the same thing that we have said that in all likelihood, the primary deliverers of e-commerce shipments for the foreseeable future will be UPS, U.S. Postal Service and FedEx. Because input costs, even though you might have a local operator or over the thousands that Mike talked about are trumped by the delivery density and the revenue per stop characteristics of the big carriers. And remember, we're not delivering from 50 fulfillment centers or 100 stores or 60 stores. We have the capability to pick up, transport and deliver an item from 95% of the human beings on the planet, much less, every business on the world within 1 to 2 business days, door-to-door, customs cleared. So that's known as Metcalfe's [ph] Law. Everybody understands this in the telecommunications business. It's the number of nodes on the network squared. If you run a hub-and-spoke system, it's n times n minus 1. [ph] So whether you're a big box retailer or you're an e-tailer, that puts their fulfillment centers, which is a surrogate for the store and delivers the items individually or as you come into the store, the economics are the same. It's network density and revenue per delivery stop that are the determinant of who you're going to deliver these packages in the years to come. The post service delivers to 140 -- 154 million addresses everyday. And so lightweight e-commerce packages are perfect for the Postal Service because they can put it in the mail and deliver them to residences. That's why Parcel Select, as they call it, is partnered with FedEx SmartPost, UPS Share Post, Amazon Direct Injection and another group of smaller competitors in this so-called consolidators space. And it's that misunderstanding that the drivers are network density and revenue per delivery stop that have led to a lot of the misunderstanding about the future evolution of the markets."

Art Hatfield of Raymond James. Do you currently see any new regulatory headwinds on the rise in either here in the U.S. or overseas? 
Art, this, along with bad trade policy and bad tax policy, is why we are seeing low GDP growth rate and why global GDP has slowed down in global trade. I cannot tell you the onslaught of regulatory issues that we deal with everyday here. It's in every possible crevice of the organization from Department of Labor to the FAA to protectionist policies, camouflage the security regulations overseas. If you don't try to stop these things, the natural course of events is they come on the bottom of the ship like barnacles. So that's happening and that's why we have low growth rates, bad policies on taxes and regulations in Europe, in the United States, in China, in Japan. And unless those things turn around, you're going to continue to have low growth rates. So Mickey, you want to finish it up?"

Let me begin by thanking hundreds of thousands of FedEx teammates for delivering our Purple Promise every day, including a great 2015 peak season. 
FedEx Corporation continues to improve margins, financial performance and competitive position. As noted, our 3Q FY year-over-year earnings per share is up 23%. I should note there are 3 recurring areas of concern, however, expressed in various articles and reports: one, future margins; two, industry disruption; and three, capital spending. 
Regarding margins, the Express profit improvement program will be exceeded by May 31. Express segment margins in the current fourth fiscal quarter will be approximately 12%. Likewise, FedEx Ground, including SmartPost margins, will increase and be 16-plus percent this quarter, while the FedEx Ground and supply chain segment will be 15%. 
Remember, GENCO is now part of this segment and the margins in this business will not be as high as those of Ground itself. However, the strategic importance of our expanded customer solutions resulting from the GENCO acquisition is profound and will greatly benefit our future financial performance. 
A significant issue for FedEx Ground over the past year has been the extraordinary growth of oversized shipments, which Mike Glenn and Henry Maier will address. It is truly unfortunate that Congress did not increase the federal twin trailer limit from 28 feet each to 33 feet, which would have benefited consumers, lowered fuel consumption and reduced highway accidents. We're optimistic about FedEx Freight improving margins in the future as well, and Mike Ducker can talk about that. 
It's important to note that we manage FedEx operating companies to maximize the corporation's performance over the long term. So in any given quarter, we may spend more in one segment to achieve this result. The concerns about industry disruption continue to be fueled by fantastical -- and let me emphasize, I chose this word carefully, articles and reports, which are devoid of in-depth knowledge of logistic systems and the markets which FedEx serves. 
As we have previously noted, network design, technology, facilities capabilities and route/stop densities are the key elements in the FedEx, UPS and Postal Service systems that make it highly likely these entities will remain the primary carriers for e-commerce shipments in the U.S. for the foreseeable future. 
Finally, FedEx is currently investing in FedEx Express fleet modernization and expansion of FedEx Ground's highly automated facilities. Both these major programs have high returns and are integral to margin expansion. Our cash flows are such that we can easily fund investments at $4 billion to $5 billion per year, while retiring debt used to acquire TNT, if the transaction is approved and stock repurchases. Of course, we include replacement CapEx in this projection. 
To reiterate, we believe FedEx will continue to improve margins, EPS, capital returns, and increase cash flows, which we have told you repeatedly over the last couple of years and again have demonstrated this quarter. 
Let me now turn to Mike Glenn for our economic outlook, followed by Alan Graf with detailed remarks about our financials. Mike?"

I'll open with our economic update and outlook and then discuss our performance and business conditions in each segment, including revenue, volume and yield and provide some commentary on broader industry trends that we are experiencing. O",1246,"Thanks, Fred. I'll open with our economic update and outlook and then discuss our performance and business conditions in each segment, including revenue, volume and yield and provide some commentary on broader industry trends that we are experiencing. 
On the economic front, we see moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP forecast is 2.2% for calendar '16, 40 basis points lower than our forecast last quarter and 2.5% for calendar '17 led by gains in consumer spending. We expect industrial production growth of 0.6% in calendar '16, 130 basis points lower than last quarter and 2.5% for next year. Our global GDP growth forecast is 2.5% for calendar '16, which is 30 basis points below last quarter and 2.9% for calendar '17. 
Now, I'll review revenue volume and yield trends by segment. In the Express segment, revenue decreased 1% as lower fuel surcharge and unfavorable currency exchange rates more than offset yield growth. U.S. domestic package volume grew by 2% driven by growth in the overnight -- in overnight packages. 
U.S. domestic revenue per package increased 1% despite lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year domestic Express package yields grew 3% primarily due to rate and discounts. FedEx International Economy volume grew 2%, while FedEx International Priority volume decreased 3%. 
International export revenue per package decreased 5% as lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable currency exchange rates negatively impacted yields. Excluding fuel, international export express package yield decreased 1%, primarily driven by negative -- the negative impact of exchange rates, which outweighed the positive impact of rate and discount changes. 
FedEx Ground increased to 30% -- revenue increased 30% in the quarter driven by higher Ground volume and yield, the recording of SmartPost revenue on a gross basis versus the previous net treatment and due to the inclusion of GENCO results. FedEx Ground average daily volume grew 11% in Q3, primarily driven by growth for demand for residential deliveries related to e-commerce. 
FedEx Ground revenue per package increased 8% year-over-year in Q3 due to the recording of SmartPost revenues on a gross basis and higher base rates, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, Ground yield per package including SmartPost increased 11% year-over-year driven primarily by rate and discount and SmartPost customer mix. 
FedEx Freight increased revenue 1% as LTL shipments increased 7% and revenue per shipment declined 4%. The increase in shipments is driven by our sales efforts with small and medium customers and reflects the speed, reliability and choice of Priority and Economy services for our LTL customers. 
Revenue per LTL shipment declined due to lower fuel surcharges and average weight per shipment. Excluding the impact of fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per shipment was down 1% year-over-year due to lower weight per shipment. 
Now, I'll discuss in more detail some of the industry dynamics that drove the record peak season and beyond. The 2015 peak season was historic by many measures and it was driven by the continued growth of e-commerce. Demand for residential deliveries across the industry surpassed expectations as consumers increased online shopping in record numbers. 
Not only was there higher volumes, but the types of goods purchased online increased. FedEx experienced record demand, including multiple days of greater than 25 million packages delivered, which is more than double our average daily volume. We're proud of our team members and the incredible job they did with more than 325 million packages delivered during the peak period. 
We worked very closely with our large e-tail and other peak customers to prepare for their needs and to deliver the holidays. It is very clear that e-commerce has now enabled the full scale retail revolution. There are several important trends worth noting. 
First, referring to a specific peak day is quickly becoming a thing of the past. As evidenced this year, there were multiple days where volumes exceeded 25 million packages as consumers buying habits are changing. We view this as a positive as mother nature can sometimes play havoc with last minute e-commerce shoppers. Smoothing sales throughout peak season is a trend that will benefit retailers and transportation companies alike. We believe online shoppers will have increasing incentives to order earlier in the holiday season. 
Second, more and more retailers are fulfilling e-commerce orders from individual stores or what we call store-to-home delivery. FedEx is well-positioned to service this growing market in the years ahead with our broad portfolio of services, including metro delivery and same-day services. 
Third, we're seeing a significant increase in nontraditional items now being purchased online: mattresses, canoes, swing sets and big-screen TVs, just to name a few. We welcome this opportunity, but it is important that we price these items accordingly to account for the operational complexities such as manual sortation, 2-person delivery, et cetera. 
As a result, we'll be adjusting the initial handling surcharge for FedEx Ground. Today, if a package is greater than 6 -- package length is greater than 60 inches, initial handling surcharge will be applied. Beginning June 1, the maximum length will be reduced from 60 inches to 48 inches. We believe 48 inches is appropriate as it is the standard length of an LTL pallet.
It's important to note -- to remember that the primary value proposition of e-commerce is the ability to order a product online and have it reliably delivered to the consumer. In that regard, FedEx is and will continue to be a key enabler for e-commerce in the years ahead. By our estimates, more than 95% of all e-commerce orders today are delivered by 1 of 3 entities in the United States: FedEx; the United States Postal Service, with whom we have a strategic relationship to transport their priority mail; and UPS. In fact, if we were to isolate our e-commerce business, one could argue that FedEx is one of the most profitable e-commerce companies in business today. 
I'd also like to clarify some of the public discussion and speculation concerning Amazon adding some direct transportation capabilities. First, Amazon is a valuable customer that we've worked with for many years and we expect to work with them for many years to come. We've been in constant dialogue with them to understand their transportation needs as they've experienced significant growth. 
We've been aware of Amazon's need for supplemental capacity related to inventory management, which is driving some of the investments they're making in transportation. Large retailers have long had their own transportation capabilities, primarily to enable movement and positioning of inventory across their store and fulfillment locations. 
While recent stories and reports of a new entity competing with the 3 major carriers in the United States grabs headlines, the reality is it would be a daunting task requiring tens of billions of dollars in capital and years to build sufficient scale and density to replicate existing networks like FedEx. It's also important to note that no one FedEx customer represents more than approximately 3% of total revenue. 
Additionally, other than the Postal Service, no single customer represents more than approximately 3% of revenue for FedEx Express, FedEx Ground or FedEx Freight. We manage these relationships carefully to ensure we don't become overly dependent on any one customer. We expect these industry trends and dynamics to accelerate this coming holiday season and we will continue to continue to affect the industry year-round. FedEx is well-positioned to provide innovative solutions and to meet this growing demand. 
And now, I'll turn it over to Alan Graf."
124423,313824573,953724,"FedEx Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 16, 2016",2016-03-16,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike, for that excellent report, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a strong quarter with adjusted earnings of $2.51 per diluted share, up year-over-year, more than 23%. Adjusted consolidated operating margin increased to a healthy 9.2% versu",1385,"Thank you, Mike, for that excellent report, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a strong quarter with adjusted earnings of $2.51 per diluted share, up year-over-year, more than 23%. Adjusted consolidated operating margin increased to a healthy 9.2% versus 8.3% last year. These record earnings proved once again the success of our strategy to manage our portfolio of services to achieve enterprise results. 
And it's important to remember this strategy does not always translate into each segment's individual earnings and margin performance. We expect our fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings to be up 20% to 22% over last year as we continue to benefit from our execution of the profit improvement program at Express. Our positive financial momentum should continue into our upcoming fiscal 2017, where we expect continued solid growth in earnings and cash flow. 
This quarter, there were 3 expense adjustments within corporate, eliminations and other. First, during the quarter, we reached agreements in principle to settle all of the 19 cases on appeal in the multi-district independent contracted litigation. The settlements will require court approval. 
We recognized a liability for the net expected loss related to these cases and certain other pending independent contractor-related proceedings of $204 million or $0.46 per diluted share. These disputes involve a contractor model, which FedEx Ground has not operated since 2011. This is good news because assuming the necessary court approvals are obtained, it resolves all of the remaining multi-district litigation cases. 
We are defending contractor model cases that are no longer -- that are not or no longer part of the multi-district litigation. These cases are in varying stages of litigation. We do not expect to incur a material loss in these cases. Secondly, net expenses related to the settlement of a U.S. Customs and Border Protection matter involving FedEx Trade Networks were $69 million or $0.15 per diluted share. And thirdly, our pending acquisition of TNT Express and operating income impact of $23 million and an EPS impact of $0.06 per diluted share. 
Turning to the segments and starting with our star, Express. Express had an outstanding quarter as operating income climbed 51% and operating margin increased despite lower revenues. Let me repeat that. Operating income climbed 51% and operating margin increased despite lower revenues. Who does that? 
Express operating margin was 9.1%, up 320 basis points versus last year and is the best third quarter margin in Express segment history. The increase was driven primarily by yield management, U.S. domestic volume growth and ongoing benefits from the profit improvement program. Express is efficiently managing volume increases in e-commerce and at the same time, continued softness in International volumes. The profit improvement program that we announced in 2012 continues to improve revenue quality, increased productivity and constrained expenses. 
Turning to Ground. Ground saw unprecedented demand with volumes increasing 11%. However, Ground's operating margin declined. The 390-basis-point decline in operating margin was primarily driven by 5 factors: one, 190 basis points from the change in SmartPost revenue reporting and the inclusion of GENCO results; two, 60 basis points from higher cost driven significantly by a peak season demand that exceeded both volume and package size expectations as Mike discussed; third, 60 basis points from higher sales insurance reserves; fourth, 30 basis points from increased purchase transportation rates for linehaul; and fifth, 30 basis points from network expansion costs. 
As Mike said, we are evaluating several Ground pricing initiatives to balance our revenue and costs and increase margins. In addition, over the next 2 years, we are spending additional capital at Ground to expand needed capacity to support both commercial and e-commerce growth, including non-conveyable annexes designed to more efficiently handle those packages that do not fit on our sortation equipment. As Fred mentioned, we expect Ground to return to mid-teens margins in the fourth quarter. 
At Freight, Freight continues to adjust to a very challenging LTL market. Freight segment operating results decreased, primarily due to salaries and employee benefits expense outpacing revenue growth. And revenue growth was negatively impacted by lower fuel surcharges and weight per shipment. 
We have been installing dimensional scanners to more accurately cost and price shipments. Freight currently has 45 dimensional scanners in operation today, with another 8 slated to be installed by the end of the fiscal year. These dimensional scanners pay for themselves in less than a year and an important part of our yield improvement program. We also expect Freight's productivity to continue to improve in Q4 as well as throughout 2017. 
From an outlook standpoint, we expect our solid earnings growth to continue in the fourth quarter from the execution of the profit improvement program and from improvements in our Express and Ground segments due to volume and yield growth. We are updating the lower part of the range for our adjusted FY '16 earnings guidance to $10.70 before year-end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments. 
The new range of $10.70 to $10.90 represents adjusted EPS growth of 20% to 22% year-over-year. Our outlook excludes certain legal costs as well as any TNT integration costs or results. Our expectations for earnings are dependent on several external factors, including fuel prices and moderate growth in the global economy. 
The capital spending forecast for the fiscal year is now $4.8 billion, which is higher than our previous forecast due to increased investments in FedEx Ground as we continue to expand the network in anticipation of continued high growth. 
FedEx is strongly committed to delivering long-term value for our customers, shareowners and team members. In January, we completed the 15 million share repurchase program authorized in September 2014 and announced our most recent stock repurchase program of up to 25 million shares of FedEx Corporation common stock. 
Since FY '14, FedEx has returned over $8.3 billion to shareowners through the repurchase of over 60 million shares, and during the past 2 years, has increased its dividend by 33% and 25%, respectively. Our strong balance sheet, profit and cash flow performance give us the flexibility to initiate this stock repurchase program, while continuing to execute our strategic growth initiatives. 
In the near term, we are planning a debt offering, the proceeds of which are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and the prepayment of certain tax exempt debt. We intend to fund the acquisition of TNT Express with cash from operations and proceeds from a planned debt offering in the fourth quarter, which we plan to launch shortly after the other debt offering. We will evaluate assessing the euro market for the TNT funding. The lower Moody's ratings was expected -- that we expected will have a de minimus impact on our upcoming financings. 
Regarding the TNT acquisition, we completed several steps during the third quarter, including unconditional approval by the European Commission of our intention to acquire TNT and TNT's announced agreement to sell its airline operation to comply with the rules governing foreign ownership of European Airlines. 
We had many questions submitted by analysts on the TNT acquisition, many of which we cannot answer in detail at this time. I will say that FY '17 will be a year of investment and integration. And then, beginning in fiscal '18, I am expecting TNT to be very accretive to earnings. The TNT acquisition is expected to expand our global portfolio, particularly in Europe, significantly lower our cost to serve our European markets by increasing density in our pickup and delivery operations and accelerate our global growth. 
More than 20 FedEx and TNT operational and geographical teams are planning to make the transition as smooth as possible for customers and team members to position FedEx for long-term profitable growth. We remain confident that we will close the acquisition in the first half of calendar year 2016, and we were very pleased with TNT's recently reported improving operating performance. 
When approved, this landmark acquisition is expected to bring over 50,000 new team members to our ranks and significantly improve our global competitive position. 
In closing, I am extremely proud of the FedEx team for its impressive efforts. Our financial momentum should continue into FY '17, where we expect continued solid growth in earnings and cash flow. Thank you for your attention, and I'm now going to turn the meeting back to -- over to Fred who will start the Q&A."

But I think on top of that, our FTN, our FedEx Trade Networks organization and their strategic part of our business around the world on ocean shipping with the air freight shipping and obviously, the priority express shipping, you can see that we will continue to grow our profits and our margins and -- for a long, long time.

Regarding the item on the fleet, I think it's important to note that FedEx Express is operating 20 less airplanes today in 2016 than we were in 2013. Now, part of the reason we're able to do that is because the airplanes are much more reliable. We don't need as many spares. There's not as many in maintenance intervals.

There are network changes underway that integrate commercial and residential networks and position us to increase our operating days and continue to enhance our service. We are making a number of operating adjustments that enable the cost-effective and productive handling of the increased volume of large, non-conveyable packages. We're also investing in technology that supports operating 1 consolidated Ground network, which prior to our announcement last September, we had 2. We're also transitioning our U.S. pickup and delivery service providers national to a single operating agreement that enables increased service capacity and improves operational flexibility for these independent businesses. Now, these investments which vary in timetables, but should be essentially complete by the end of -- I'm sorry, prior to FY '21, will have a short-term impact on margin, but will ultimately drive costs out of the network, enabling Ground margins to return to historical levels.

So we have a wide variety of service capabilities, and we're well-suited to participate in that market segment."

Let me again remind the people that follow FedEx that our services are a portfolio, which are broadly used by customers. I think I'm correct, well into the 90% of our customers, Mike, use Express and Ground. Over 70% use Express, Ground and Freight. And I think based on the e-mails and the comments that I get on the Internet, every man, woman and child in America uses FedEx Office. So again, our job is to try to improve earnings, returns, cash flows. And we have told you that we are confident that we can do that. And I think a little bit on this call, not so much as in the past, you -- if you attempt to try to dissect FedEx and do a sum of the parts analysis, you're going to get surprised. I mean, we buy airplanes because they increase earnings, cash flows and returns over a period of time. We add automated Ground facilities because they do the same thing. So there is no motivation inside FedEx to do anything other than to achieve those results at the corporate level. And sometimes, we decide to be aggressive in one segment because we're achieving our corporate goals and you've seen that with the Ground numbers when we were responding to the post '08 crash in Express and fuel prices running up to $147 a barrel. So we launched the profit improvement program and a lot of the corporate results were funded by the outstanding performance of Ground. Now, we're doing a lot of things over on Henry's side of the house. And as Express margins and returns are expanding, we're able to do that, still buying in a lot of stock and pay for a significant acquisition. So it's important to keep that in mind when you're asking these questions."

So I think -- Dave mentioned making the assets sweat. Well, we certainly do that. I think the other thing that's important people on the call to understand is that while we talk a lot about peak, e-commerce buying behavior is really shifting to a peak-like look year-round. We're extremely heavy on Monday because of the e-commerce orders that flow in and are fulfilled over the weekend. And I think long term, I think 6-day-a-week operation is probably the best operation to run because these e-commerce stores never shut down. So I think we're well-positioned there."

We have one Internet question from Jeffrey Kauffman, The Buckingham Research Group on the TPP, Trans-Pacific trade agreement. While the agreement reached seemed a reason to celebrate, it seems that popular politics seems to be voting down free trade in this election season. What does TPP mean to FedEx and does management view the risk of TPP not being approved increasing? And can you please provide an update? Well, I don't think there's any question about the fact that TPP is going to be harder to pass given that the leading Republican and Democratic candidates for President of The United States are against it. Free trade and opening markets has been American policy since 1934 when Roosevelt and Hall passed the Trade Agreement Act that overturned the absolutely disastrous Smoot-Hawley Tariffs. Those were 2 Republicans that in 1929 -- 1930 put in a lot of tariffs to protect America. So trade contracted by 66%, and the Roosevelt-Hall action in '34 turned it around, but there's no question that those tariffs created,was a big part of the cause of the depression. So after the war, one of the first things that Hall, still there, and Roosevelt, before his death, worked on, was the International Trade Organization, along with the IMF and the World Bank. They couldn't get it passed, so they instead came up with this framework called the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trades called GATT. And seven times, they expanded trade until the World Trade Organization was put in place back in the '90s. So the thought that trade has not been a great thing for the world and America is absolutely belied by facts. Now, have there been mercantilists? Of course, there have, Japan, China in particular. But to lump in all trade with the trade practices of a couple of trading partners is like putting leeches on you and then bleeding you the way they used to do during the old days and think you're going to get better. I mean, it's a self-inflicted problem. And in the case of Mexico, the NAFTA agreement has added hundreds of billions of dollars to U.S. business, which is traded with Mexico. Yes, we do have a modest trade deficit with Mexico, but the benefits of trade are always dispersed, lower iPhones, lower TVs, lower priced T-shirts, lower automobile cost, on and on down the line, which makes everyone's standard of living better. Whereas the pain is always localized, like the unfortunate Carrier air conditioner shut down in Indiana that's being so prominently talked about. Now, TPP, it should be noticed -- and everybody makes a big thing out of the fact that it's a 54,000-page document or something like that. What it does in the main is to reduce 18,000 tariffs on U.S. goods. So it helps us a lot. And I hope, as we get into the general election, the profound benefits of free trade over many, many decades can be understood and the mercantilist practices of people who are not comporting to the WTO dealt with on an individual basis. So we think that it's much more difficult to get TPP passed, but I can promise you, we're going to work as hard as we can to make sure people understand these issues."

The more distributions facilities they put up, the more they would like to be close to the end consumer, which by definition, makes more deliveries on a local basis.

All you have to do is Google a local delivery and you'll come -- I'm not sure where you live, but Google that in the city where you live and you'll find hundreds of companies that deliver parcels on a local basis every day. That's not the market that FedEx competes in on a day-to-day basis. We run a broad global network.

Let me refer you to my friend, David Abney's remarks after their last quarterly results. He was on CNBC, did a great job. And he pointed out that the essential thing in the delivery business is route density and revenue per delivery stop. And that is why he said virtually the same thing that we have said that in all likelihood, the primary deliverers of e-commerce shipments for the foreseeable future will be UPS, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx. Because input costs, even though you might have a local operator or over the thousands that Mike talked about are trumped by the delivery density and the revenue per stop characteristics of the big carriers. And remember, we're not delivering from 50 fulfillment centers or 100 stores or 60 stores. We have the capability to pickup, transport and deliver an item from 95% of the human beings on the planet, much less every business in the world within 1 to 2 business days, door-to-door, customs cleared. So that's known as Metcalfe's law. Everybody understands this in the telecommunications business. It's the number of nodes on the network squared. If you run a hub-and-spoke system, it's n times n minus 1. So whether you're a big box retailer or you're an e-tailer, that puts their fulfillment centers, which is a surrogate for the store and delivers the items individually or have you come into the store, the economics are the same. Its network density and revenue per delivery stop that are the determinant of who's going to deliver these packages in the years to come. The Postal Service delivers to 140 -- 154 million addresses every day. And so lightweight e-commerce packages are perfect for the Postal Service because they can put them in with the mail and deliver them to residences. That's why Parcel Select, as they call it, is partnered with FedEx SmartPost, UPS SurePost, Amazon direct injection and another group of smaller competitors in this so-called consolidator space. And it's that misunderstanding that the drivers, our network density and revenue per delivery stop that have led to a lot of the misunderstanding about the future evolution of the markets."

Art Hatfield of Raymond James. Do you currently see any new regulatory headwinds on the rise in either here in the U.S. or overseas? 
Art, this, along with bad trade policy and bad tax policy, is why we are seeing low GDP growth rate and why global GDP has slowed down in global trade.

Let me begin by thanking hundreds of thousands of FedEx teammates for delivering our Purple Promise every day, including a great 2015 peak season. 
FedEx Corporation continues to improve margins, financial performance and competitive position. As noted, our 3Q FY year-over-year earnings per share is up 23%. I should note there are 3 recurring areas of concern, however, expressed in various articles and reports: one, future margins; two, industry disruption; and three, capital spending. 
Regarding margins, the Express profit improvement program will be exceeded by May 31. Express segment margins in the current fourth fiscal quarter will be approximately 12%. Likewise, FedEx Ground, including SmartPost margins, will increase and be 16-plus percent this quarter, while the FedEx Ground and supply chain segment will be 15%. 
Remember, GENCO is now part of this segment and the margins in this business will not be as high as those of Ground itself. However, the strategic importance of our expanded customer solutions resulting from the GENCO acquisition is profound and will greatly benefit our future financial performance. 
A significant issue for FedEx Ground over the past year has been the extraordinary growth of oversized shipments, which Mike Glenn and Henry Maier will address. It is truly unfortunate that Congress did not increase the federal twin trailer limit from 28 feet each to 33 feet, which would have benefited consumers, lowered fuel consumption and reduced highway accidents. We're optimistic about FedEx Freight improving margins in the future as well, and Mike Ducker can talk about that. 
It's important to note that we manage FedEx operating companies to maximize the corporation's performance over the long term. So in any given quarter, we may spend more in one segment to achieve this result. The concerns about industry disruption continue to be fueled by fantastical -- and let me emphasize, I chose this word carefully, articles and reports, which are devoid of in-depth knowledge of logistic systems and the markets which FedEx serves. 
As we have previously noted, network design, technology, facilities capabilities and route/stop densities are the key elements in the FedEx, UPS and Postal Service systems that make it highly likely these entities will remain the primary carriers for e-commerce shipments in the U.S. for the foreseeable future. 
Finally, FedEx is currently investing in FedEx Express fleet modernization and expansion of FedEx Ground's highly automated facilities. Both these major programs have high returns and are integral to margin expansion. Our cash flows are such that we can easily fund investments at $4 billion to $5 billion per year, while retiring debt used to acquire TNT, if the transaction is approved and stock repurchases. Of course, we include replacement CapEx in this projection. 
To reiterate, we believe FedEx will continue to improve margins, EPS, capital returns, and increase cash flows, which we have told you repeatedly over the last couple of years and again have demonstrated this quarter. 
Let me now turn to Mike Glenn for our economic outlook, followed by Alan Graf with detailed remarks about our financials. Mike?"
124423,313824573,953781,"FedEx Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 16, 2016",2016-03-16,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Fred. I'll open with our economic update and outlook and then discuss our performance and business conditions in each segment, including revenue, volume and yield and provide some commentary on broader industry trends that we are experiencing. O",1246,"Thanks, Fred. I'll open with our economic update and outlook and then discuss our performance and business conditions in each segment, including revenue, volume and yield and provide some commentary on broader industry trends that we are experiencing. 
On the economic front, we see moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP forecast is 2.2% for calendar '16, 40 basis points lower than our forecast last quarter and 2.5% for calendar '17 led by gains in consumer spending. We expect industrial production growth of 0.6% in calendar '16, 130 basis points lower than last quarter and 2.5% for next year. Our global GDP growth forecast is 2.5% for calendar '16, which is 30 basis points below last quarter and 2.9% for calendar '17. 
Now, I'll review revenue volume and yield trends by segment. In the Express segment, revenue decreased 1% as lower fuel surcharge and unfavorable currency exchange rates more than offset yield growth. U.S. domestic package volume grew by 2% driven by growth in the overnight -- in overnight packages. 
U.S. domestic revenue per package increased 1% despite lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year domestic Express package yields grew 3% primarily due to rate and discounts. FedEx International Economy volume grew 2%, while FedEx International Priority volume decreased 3%. 
International export revenue per package decreased 5% as lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable currency exchange rates negatively impacted yields. Excluding fuel, international export express package yield decreased 1%, primarily driven by negative -- the negative impact of exchange rates, which outweighed the positive impact of rate and discount changes. 
FedEx Ground increased to 30% -- revenue increased 30% in the quarter driven by higher Ground volume and yield, the recording of SmartPost revenue on a gross basis versus the previous net treatment and due to the inclusion of GENCO results. FedEx Ground average daily volume grew 11% in Q3, primarily driven by growth for demand for residential deliveries related to e-commerce. 
FedEx Ground revenue per package increased 8% year-over-year in Q3 due to the recording of SmartPost revenues on a gross basis and higher base rates, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, Ground yield per package including SmartPost increased 11% year-over-year driven primarily by rate and discount and SmartPost customer mix. 
FedEx Freight increased revenue 1% as LTL shipments increased 7% and revenue per shipment declined 4%. The increase in shipments is driven by our sales efforts with small and medium customers and reflects the speed, reliability and choice of Priority and Economy services for our LTL customers. 
Revenue per LTL shipment declined due to lower fuel surcharges and average weight per shipment. Excluding the impact of fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per shipment was down 1% year-over-year due to lower weight per shipment. 
Now, I'll discuss in more detail some of the industry dynamics that drove the record peak season and beyond. The 2015 peak season was historic by many measures and it was driven by the continued growth of e-commerce. Demand for residential deliveries across the industry surpassed expectations as consumers increased online shopping in record numbers. 
Not only was there higher volumes, but the types of goods purchased online increased. FedEx experienced record demand, including multiple days of greater than 25 million packages delivered, which is more than double our average daily volume. We're proud of our team members and the incredible job they did with more than 325 million packages delivered during the peak period. 
We worked very closely with our large e-tail and other peak customers to prepare for their needs and to deliver the holidays. It is very clear that e-commerce has now enabled the full scale retail revolution. There are several important trends worth noting. 
First, referring to a specific peak day is quickly becoming a thing of the past. As evidenced this year, there were multiple days where volumes exceeded 25 million packages as consumers buying habits are changing. We view this as a positive as mother nature can sometimes play havoc with last minute e-commerce shoppers. Smoothing sales throughout peak season is a trend that will benefit retailers and transportation companies alike. We believe online shoppers will have increasing incentives to order earlier in the holiday season. 
Second, more and more retailers are fulfilling e-commerce orders from individual stores or what we call store-to-home delivery. FedEx is well-positioned to service this growing market in the years ahead with our broad portfolio of services, including metro delivery and same-day services. 
Third, we're seeing a significant increase in nontraditional items now being purchased online: mattresses, canoes, swing sets and big-screen TVs, just to name a few. We welcome this opportunity, but it is important that we price these items accordingly to account for the operational complexities such as manual sortation, 2-person delivery, et cetera. 
As a result, we'll be adjusting the initial handling surcharge for FedEx Ground. Today, if a package is greater than 6 -- package length is greater than 60 inches, initial handling surcharge will be applied. Beginning June 1, the maximum length will be reduced from 60 inches to 48 inches. We believe 48 inches is appropriate as it is the standard length of an LTL pallet.
It's important to note -- to remember that the primary value proposition of e-commerce is the ability to order a product online and have it reliably delivered to the consumer. In that regard, FedEx is and will continue to be a key enabler for e-commerce in the years ahead. By our estimates, more than 95% of all e-commerce orders today are delivered by 1 of 3 entities in the United States: FedEx; the United States Postal Service, with whom we have a strategic relationship to transport their priority mail; and UPS. In fact, if we were to isolate our e-commerce business, one could argue that FedEx is one of the most profitable e-commerce companies in business today. 
I'd also like to clarify some of the public discussion and speculation concerning Amazon adding some direct transportation capabilities. First, Amazon is a valuable customer that we've worked with for many years and we expect to work with them for many years to come. We've been in constant dialogue with them to understand their transportation needs as they've experienced significant growth. 
We've been aware of Amazon's need for supplemental capacity related to inventory management, which is driving some of the investments they're making in transportation. Large retailers have long had their own transportation capabilities, primarily to enable movement and positioning of inventory across their store and fulfillment locations. 
While recent stories and reports of a new entity competing with the 3 major carriers in the United States grabs headlines, the reality is it would be a daunting task requiring tens of billions of dollars in capital and years to build sufficient scale and density to replicate existing networks like FedEx. It's also important to note that no one FedEx customer represents more than approximately 3% of total revenue. 
Additionally, other than the Postal Service, no single customer represents more than approximately 3% of revenue for FedEx Express, FedEx Ground or FedEx Freight. We manage these relationships carefully to ensure we don't become overly dependent on any one customer. We expect these industry trends and dynamics to accelerate this coming holiday season and we will continue to continue to affect the industry year-round. FedEx is well-positioned to provide innovative solutions and to meet this growing demand. 
And now, I'll turn it over to Alan Graf."
124423,313824573,953781,"FedEx Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 16, 2016",2016-03-16,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike, for that excellent report, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a strong quarter with adjusted earnings of $2.51 per diluted share, up year-over-year, more than 23%. Adjusted consolidated operating margin increased to a healthy 9.2% versu",1385,"Thank you, Mike, for that excellent report, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a strong quarter with adjusted earnings of $2.51 per diluted share, up year-over-year, more than 23%. Adjusted consolidated operating margin increased to a healthy 9.2% versus 8.3% last year. These record earnings proved once again the success of our strategy to manage our portfolio of services to achieve enterprise results. 
And it's important to remember this strategy does not always translate into each segment's individual earnings and margin performance. We expect our fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings to be up 20% to 22% over last year as we continue to benefit from our execution of the profit improvement program at Express. Our positive financial momentum should continue into our upcoming fiscal 2017, where we expect continued solid growth in earnings and cash flow. 
This quarter, there were 3 expense adjustments within corporate, eliminations and other. First, during the quarter, we reached agreements in principle to settle all of the 19 cases on appeal in the multi-district independent contractor litigation. The settlements will require court approval. 
We recognized a liability for the net expected loss related to these cases and certain other pending independent contractor-related proceedings of $204 million or $0.46 per diluted share. These disputes involve a contractor model, which FedEx Ground has not operated since 2011. This is good news because assuming the necessary court approvals are obtained, it resolves all of the remaining multi-district litigation cases. 
We are defending contractor model cases that are no longer -- that are not or no longer part of the multi-district litigation. These cases are in varying stages of litigation. We do not expect to incur a material loss in these cases. Secondly, net expenses related to the settlement of a U.S. Customs and Border Protection matter involving FedEx Trade Networks were $69 million or $0.15 per diluted share. And thirdly, our pending acquisition of TNT Express and operating income impact of $23 million and an EPS impact of $0.06 per diluted share. 
Turning to the segments and starting with our star, Express. Express had an outstanding quarter as operating income climbed 51% and operating margin increased despite lower revenues. Let me repeat that. Operating income climbed 51% and operating margin increased despite lower revenues. Who does that? 
Express operating margin was 9.1%, up 320 basis points versus last year and is the best third quarter margin in Express segment history. The increase was driven primarily by yield management, U.S. domestic volume growth and ongoing benefits from the profit improvement program. Express is efficiently managing volume increases in e-commerce and at the same time, continued softness in International volumes. The profit improvement program that we announced in 2012 continues to improve revenue quality, increased productivity and constrained expenses. 
Turning to Ground. Ground saw unprecedented demand with volumes increasing 11%. However, Ground's operating margin declined. The 390-basis-point decline in operating margin was primarily driven by 5 factors: one, 190 basis points from the change in SmartPost revenue reporting and the inclusion of GENCO results; two, 60 basis points from higher cost driven significantly by a peak season demand that exceeded both volume and package size expectations as Mike discussed; third, 60 basis points from higher sales insurance reserves; fourth, 30 basis points from increased purchase transportation rates for linehaul; and fifth, 30 basis points from network expansion costs. 
As Mike said, we are evaluating several Ground pricing initiatives to balance our revenue and costs and increase margins. In addition, over the next 2 years, we are spending additional capital at Ground to expand needed capacity to support both commercial and e-commerce growth, including non-conveyable annexes designed to more efficiently handle those packages that do not fit on our sortation equipment. As Fred mentioned, we expect Ground to return to mid-teens margins in the fourth quarter. 
At Freight, Freight continues to adjust to a very challenging LTL market. Freight segment operating results decreased, primarily due to salaries and employee benefits expense outpacing revenue growth. And revenue growth was negatively impacted by lower fuel surcharges and weight per shipment. 
We have been installing dimensional scanners to more accurately cost and price shipments. Freight currently has 45 dimensional scanners in operation today, with another 8 slated to be installed by the end of the fiscal year. These dimensional scanners pay for themselves in less than a year and an important part of our yield improvement program. We also expect Freight's productivity to continue to improve in Q4 as well as throughout 2017. 
From an outlook standpoint, we expect our solid earnings growth to continue in the fourth quarter from the execution of the profit improvement program and from improvements in our Express and Ground segments due to volume and yield growth. We are updating the lower part of the range for our adjusted FY '16 earnings guidance to $10.70 before year-end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments. 
The new range of $10.70 to $10.90 represents adjusted EPS growth of 20% to 22% year-over-year. Our outlook excludes certain legal costs as well as any TNT integration costs or results. Our expectations for earnings are dependent on several external factors, including fuel prices and moderate growth in the global economy. 
The capital spending forecast for the fiscal year is now $4.8 billion, which is higher than our previous forecast due to increased investments in FedEx Ground as we continue to expand the network in anticipation of continued high growth. 
FedEx is strongly committed to delivering long-term value for our customers, shareowners and team members. In January, we completed the 15 million share repurchase program authorized in September 2014 and announced our most recent stock repurchase program of up to 25 million shares of FedEx Corporation common stock. 
Since FY '14, FedEx has returned over $8.3 billion to shareowners through the repurchase of over 60 million shares, and during the past 2 years, has increased its dividend by 33% and 25%, respectively. Our strong balance sheet, profit and cash flow performance give us the flexibility to initiate this stock repurchase program, while continuing to execute our strategic growth initiatives. 
In the near term, we are planning a debt offering, the proceeds of which are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and the prepayment of certain tax exempt debt. We intend to fund the acquisition of TNT Express with cash from operations and proceeds from a planned debt offering in the fourth quarter, which we plan to launch shortly after the other debt offering. We will evaluate assessing the euro market for the TNT funding. The lower Moody's ratings was expected -- that we expected will have a de minimus impact on our upcoming financings. 
Regarding the TNT acquisition, we completed several steps during the third quarter, including unconditional approval by the European Commission of our intention to acquire TNT and TNT's announced agreement to sell its airline operation to comply with the rules governing foreign ownership of European Airlines. 
We had many questions submitted by analysts on the TNT acquisition, many of which we cannot answer in detail at this time. I will say that FY '17 will be a year of investment and integration. And then, beginning in fiscal '18, I am expecting TNT to be very accretive to earnings. The TNT acquisition is expected to expand our global portfolio, particularly in Europe, significantly lower our cost to serve our European markets by increasing density in our pickup and delivery operations and accelerate our global growth. 
More than 20 FedEx and TNT operational and geographical teams are planning to make the transition as smooth as possible for customers and team members to position FedEx for long-term profitable growth. We remain confident that we will close the acquisition in the first half of calendar year 2016, and we were very pleased with TNT's recently reported improving operating performance. 
When approved, this landmark acquisition is expected to bring over 50,000 new team members to our ranks and significantly improve our global competitive position. 
In closing, I am extremely proud of the FedEx team for its impressive efforts. Our financial momentum should continue into FY '17, where we expect continued solid growth in earnings and cash flow. Thank you for your attention, and I'm now going to turn the meeting back to -- over to Fred who will start the Q&A."

But I think on top of that, our FTN, our FedEx Trade Networks organization and their strategic part of our business around the world on ocean shipping with the air freight shipping and obviously, the priority express shipping, you can see that we will continue to grow our profits and our margins and -- for a long, long time.

We're also investing in technology that supports operating 1 consolidated Ground network, which prior to our announcement last September, we had 2. We're also transitioning our U.S. pickup and delivery service providers national to a single operating agreement that enables increased service capacity and improves operational flexibility for these independent businesses.

I mean, we buy airplanes because they increase earnings, cash flows and returns over a period of time. We add automated Ground facilities because they do the same thing. So there is no motivation inside FedEx to do anything other than to achieve those results at the corporate level. And sometimes, we decide to be aggressive in one segment because we're achieving our corporate goals and you've seen that with the Ground numbers when we were responding to the post '08 crash in Express and fuel prices running up to $147 a barrel. So we launched the profit improvement program and a lot of the corporate results were funded by the outstanding performance of Ground. Now, we're doing a lot of things over on Henry's side of the house. And as Express margins and returns are expanding, we're able to do that, still buying in a lot of stock and pay for a significant acquisition.

I think the other thing that's important people on the call to understand is that while we talk a lot about peak, e-commerce buying behavior is really shifting to a peak-like look year-round. We're extremely heavy on Monday because of the e-commerce orders that flow in and are fulfilled over the weekend.

We have one Internet question from Jeffrey Kauffman, The Buckingham Research Group on the TPP, Trans-Pacific trade agreement. While the agreement reached seemed a reason to celebrate, it seems that popular politics seems to be voting down free trade in this election season. What does TPP mean to FedEx and does management view the risk of TPP not being approved increasing? And can you please provide an update? Well, I don't think there's any question about the fact that TPP is going to be harder to pass given that the leading Republican and Democratic candidates for President of The United States are against it. Free trade and opening markets has been American policy since 1934 when Roosevelt and Hall passed the Trade Agreement Act that overturned the absolutely disastrous Smoot-Hawley Tariffs. Those were 2 Republicans that in 1929 -- 1930 put in a lot of tariffs to protect America. So trade contracted by 66%, and the Roosevelt-Hall action in '34 turned it around, but there's no question that those tariffs created,was a big part of the cause of the depression. So after the war, one of the first things that Hall, still there, and Roosevelt, before his death, worked on, was the International Trade Organization, along with the IMF and the World Bank. They couldn't get it passed, so they instead came up with this framework called the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trades called GATT. And seven times, they expanded trade until the World Trade Organization was put in place back in the '90s. So the thought that trade has not been a great thing for the world and America is absolutely belied by facts. Now, have there been mercantilists? Of course, there have, Japan, China in particular. But to lump in all trade with the trade practices of a couple of trading partners is like putting leeches on you and then bleeding you the way they used to do during the old days and think you're going to get better. I mean, it's a self-inflicted problem. And in the case of Mexico, the NAFTA agreement has added hundreds of billions of dollars to U.S. business, which is traded with Mexico. Yes, we do have a modest trade deficit with Mexico, but the benefits of trade are always dispersed, lower iPhones, lower TVs, lower priced T-shirts, lower automobile cost, on and on down the line, which makes everyone's standard of living better. Whereas the pain is always localized, like the unfortunate Carrier air conditioner shut down in Indiana that's being so prominently talked about. Now, TPP, it should be noticed -- and everybody makes a big thing out of the fact that it's a 54,000-page document or something like that. What it does in the main is to reduce 18,000 tariffs on U.S. goods. So it helps us a lot. And I hope, as we get into the general election, the profound benefits of free trade over many, many decades can be understood and the mercantilist practices of people who are not comporting to the WTO dealt with on an individual basis. So we think that it's much more difficult to get TPP passed, but I can promise you, we're going to work as hard as we can to make sure people understand these issues."

The more distributions facilities they put up, the more they would like to be close to the end consumer, which by definition, makes more deliveries on a local basis. Having said that, all the conversation about new entrants into the local delivery market -- I mean, there are hundreds and thousands of local delivery companies in every market in the country delivering parcels. All you have to do is Google a local delivery and you'll come -- I'm not sure where you live, but Google that in the city where you live and you'll find hundreds of companies that deliver parcels on a local basis every day. That's not the market that FedEx competes in on a day-to-day basis. We run a broad global network.

Let me refer you to my friend, David Abney's remarks after their last quarterly results. He was on CNBC, did a great job. And he pointed out that the essential thing in the delivery business is route density and revenue per delivery stop. And that is why he said virtually the same thing that we have said that in all likelihood, the primary deliverers of e-commerce shipments for the foreseeable future will be UPS, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx. Because input costs, even though you might have a local operator or over the thousands that Mike talked about are trumped by the delivery density and the revenue per stop characteristics of the big carriers. And remember, we're not delivering from 50 fulfillment centers or 100 stores or 60 stores. We have the capability to pickup, transport and deliver an item from 95% of the human beings on the planet, much less every business in the world within 1 to 2 business days, door-to-door, customs cleared. So that's known as Metcalfe's law. Everybody understands this in the telecommunications business. It's the number of nodes on the network squared. If you run a hub-and-spoke system, it's n times n minus 1. So whether you're a big box retailer or you're an e-tailer, that puts their fulfillment centers, which is a surrogate for the store and delivers the items individually or have you come into the store, the economics are the same. Its network density and revenue per delivery stop that are the determinant of who's going to deliver these packages in the years to come. The Postal Service delivers to 140 -- 154 million addresses every day. And so lightweight e-commerce packages are perfect for the Postal Service because they can put them in with the mail and deliver them to residences. That's why Parcel Select, as they call it, is partnered with FedEx SmartPost, UPS SurePost, Amazon direct injection and another group of smaller competitors in this so-called consolidator space. And it's that misunderstanding that the drivers, our network density and revenue per delivery stop that have led to a lot of the misunderstanding about the future evolution of the markets."

Art Hatfield of Raymond James. Do you currently see any new regulatory headwinds on the rise in either here in the U.S. or overseas? 
Art, this, along with bad trade policy and bad tax policy, is why we are seeing low GDP growth rate and why global GDP has slowed down in global trade. I cannot tell you the onslaught of regulatory issues that we deal with every day here. It's in every possible crevice of the organization from Department of Labor to the FAA to protectionist policies camouflaged as security regulations overseas. If you don't try to stop these things, the natural course of events is they come on the bottom of the ship like barnacles. So that's happening and that's why we have low growth rates, bad policies on taxes and regulations in Europe, in the United States, in China, in Japan. And unless those things turn around, you're going to continue to have low growth rates. So Mickey, you want to finish it up?"

Welcome, everyone, to the discussion of our results for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2016, a significant year for FedEx.We announced sometime ago we would complete the acquisition of TNT Express in the first half of cale",400,"Thank you, Mickey. Welcome, everyone, to the discussion of our results for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2016, a significant year for FedEx.
We announced sometime ago we would complete the acquisition of TNT Express in the first half of calendar 2016, and we officially acquired the company on May 25. Greatly appreciate the outstanding work of our express, finance and legal teams in getting this transaction completed without conditions.
Annual revenue exceeded $50 billion for the first time, and we're particularly pleased with our adjusted operating margin improvement of 1% year-over-year to 10% for fiscal year 2016 and our adjusted operating margin of 11.7% for the fourth quarter.
We believe we will continue to increase margins, earnings per share, cash flows and capital returns over the next several years, given expectations for moderate economic growth and excluding TNT financial results and pension mark-to-market costs.
I'd like to congratulate and thank all FedEx team members around the world for their dedication to our Purple Promise, which simply states, ""I will make every FedEx experience outstanding."" As we integrate the acquisitions of TNT, GENCO and FedEx cross-border, we'll continue making investments in modernizing the FedEx Express aircraft fleet and expanding the highly automated FedEx Ground network to extend our leadership in the rapidly growing e-commerce market. These initiatives are integral to achieving our goals.
Let me close with a few brief remarks regarding Friday's successful conclusion of the Internet pharmacy case. First, I'd like to thank our inside and outside counsel. They did an outstanding job representing our company. FedEx has always been innocent of these charges, which should never have been filed. We strongly believe we should not admit the things we did not do and pay millions to avoid a criminal trial. FedEx delivered packages for licensed pharmacies registered by the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Very few companies have done more during the last 4 decades to cooperate with law enforcement and FedEx, as was true in these matters, and we will continue to do so. 
We're especially proud of the hundreds of thousands of FedEx team members worldwide, who demonstrate every day their commitment to provide our important services safely, reliably and at all times, ethically. 
Now let me turn it over to Mike Glenn, who will comment on the economy and our revenue; followed by Alan Graf, who will discuss FedEx's financial performance. Mike?"
124423,313824656,1001500,"FedEx Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 21, 2016",2016-06-21,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Fred. I'll open with our economic update and outlook and then we'll discuss business performance in each of the segments and then I'll have some commentary on broader business trends.On the economic front, we continue to see moderate growth in t",1361,"Thanks, Fred. I'll open with our economic update and outlook and then we'll discuss business performance in each of the segments and then I'll have some commentary on broader business trends.
On the economic front, we continue to see moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP forecast is 1.8% for calendar '16, which is 40 basis points lower than our forecast last quarter. And we forecast 2.4% for calendar '17, led by gains in consumer spending. We expect industrial production to decline 0.6% in calendar '16, 120 basis points lower than last quarter and increase 2.3% next year.
Our global GDP forecast is 2.3% for calendar '16, 20 basis points below last quarter, and calls for 2.8% growth for calendar 2017.
Now I'll review revenue volume and yield trends by segment. In the Express segment, U.S. domestic average daily package volume was essentially flat in the quarter due to the decline in the deferred product category. Yield per package increased approximately 1% year-over-year despite lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact to fuel, year-over-year Express domestic package yield grew 2.3%, primarily due to rate and discounts.
Revenue grew 2.1% year-over-year driven by 1 more operating day in yield growth. Excluding the impact of the fuel surcharge, domestic revenue grew 3.7% year-over-year. FedEx International Economy average daily volume grew 3.5% while FedEx international priority average daily volume declined 2.1%. International export revenue per package decreased 2.6%, as lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable currency exchange rates negatively impacted the yields.
Excluding fuel, international export express package yield was slightly positive, primarily driven by the positive impact of rate and discount changes, which outweighed the negative impact of exchange rates.
In the Ground segment, FedEx Ground revenue increased 20% in the quarter, driven by higher Ground volume and yield and the recording of SmartPost revenues on a gross basis versus the previous net treatment.
FedEx Ground average daily volume grew 10% year-over-year in Q4, primarily driven by continued growth after-peak season for both residential and commercial deliveries. FedEx Ground revenue per package increased 7% year-over-year in Q4 due to the recording of FedEx SmartPost revenues on a gross basis and higher base rates, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges.
Excluding the impact to fuel, Ground yield per package, including SmartPost, increased 8.6% year-over-year, driven primarily by extra service charges and weight per package, offsetting a decrease due to SmartPost volume mix. FedEx Freight revenue increased 2.3%, as average daily segments increased 7.5% year-over-year and revenue per shipment declined 5.3% [ph] year-over-year.
As a reminder, Q4 in FY '16 contained 1 more business day than Q4 in FY '15. The continued strength in shipment volume is driven by our sales efforts with small and medium customers and reflects the speed, reliability and choice to priority and economy service for our LTL customers, and we also saw increased demand from our larger customers during the quarter.
Revenue per LTL shipment declined due to lower fuel surcharge revenue and lower weight per package. Including the impact of fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per shipment was down 2.1% year-over-year due to lower weight per shipment.
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to further discuss and address the growth of e-commerce, which continues to outpace GDP growth, both in the U.S. and globally. E-commerce has become a way of life for consumers acquiring goods around the world, but the success of e-commerce continues to be dependent on transportation companies ability to reliably and quickly make residential deliveries around the world. As we noted during our last conference call on earnings, more than 95% of e-commerce packages in the U.S. are delivered by FedEx, UPS and the United States Postal Service, with whom we have a strategic relationship to transport their priority mail. E-commerce will be impossible without these companies and our expansive networks. If you were to isolate the FedEx e-commerce business, it would become clear, FedEx is one of the most profitable e-commerce companies in business today.
During the past quarter, we've made significant investments in expanding our global transportation portfolio and e-commerce capabilities around the world, including the acquisition of TNT, the introduction of FedEx cross -- and the introduction of FedEx cross-border. The TNT acquisition will transform the global transportation and logistics industry. It is the largest acquisition in FedEx history and instantly accelerates our European and global growth strategy. FedEx now has a strong presence in Europe, with a range of transportation options from express to economy for both partial and freight. This significant enhancement to our portfolio in Europe helps, not only our customers in Europe, but also provides benefits for customers around the world shipping into Europe. In addition, we will substantially enhance our capabilities globally by leveraging TNT's lower-cost road networks in different regions around the world. While the integration will take time to fully execute, we have the benefit of similar and complementary corporate cultures and a common mission of providing superior service and value to customers around the world.
FedEx cross-border offers e-commerce technology solutions that enables E Taylor's to navigate common cross-border selling challenges such as regulatory compliance, secured payment processing, multiple currency pricing or credit card fraud protection and also offers access to e-commerce shoppers around the world. Cross-border is the relaunch of Bongo International, the company FedEx acquired in 2014. When combined with our recent GENCO acquisition, we have significantly strengthened our e-commerce portfolio of services.
Of course, demand for e-commerce increases significantly each year during the peak holiday season, and we're deep into preparations for the upcoming 2016 peak season. We're closely collaborating with large e-tell and retail customers to understand their peak shipping needs, including geographic mix and package characteristics so that we can once again have a resources positioned and ready to provide outstanding service. We'll also be leveraging some new and evolving services to meet the heavy demand during peak, including FedEx Delivery Manager, FedEx same-day and an expansion in FedEx hold-it location services. Delivery Manager allows U.S. package recipients to customize home deliveries to fit their schedules, including changing the time and location of delivery, requesting a signature upon delivery or leaving instructions for the courier.
FedEx SameDay City is available in 24 markets across the country offering customers same-day service with uniformed FedEx drivers, branded vehicles, realtime tracking and world-renowned FedEx reliability. FedEx hold-it location offers secure package pickup at more than 2,400 FedEx locations, including more than 1,800 FedEx Office retail stores. These hold services allow customers to redirect packages for pickup and drop-off at FedEx and many other third-party locations.
One additional point is we continue to get questions concerning Amazon and the evolution of their transportation capabilities and needs. Amazon continues to be a viable customer, and they're among the large E Taylor's that we stay in close dialogue with throughout the year to understand their transportation needs as they continue to experience significant growth and generate demand for FedEx transportation. Because of our close relationship with Amazon and close collaboration, we have a very clear and specific understanding of their needs across the FedEx portfolio during FY '17. And further, we expect them to be a significant customer for many years to come. Having said that, it is important to remember that no single FedEx customer represents more than approximately 3% of total revenue.
Finally, I'd like to mention the introduction of the new FedEx Freight box, which makes transporting less-than-truckload shipments simple with improved flexibility, increased security, better shipment integrity and best of all, no freight classification. The FedEx Freight box comes in 2 sizes, a standard freight box that requires a pallet to ship and a smaller freight box with an integrated pallet. The freedom to choose your freight box makes freight shipping accessible for any business no matter the size. With the business space pricing structure, the FedEx freight box allows you to shift LTL, avoiding the complex and complicated pricing structure used in the industry. The freight box was introduced in selected markets with great success during the second half of FY '16 and is rolling out to customers nationwide this month.
And now I'll turn it over to Alan Graf."
124423,313824656,1001500,"FedEx Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 21, 2016",2016-06-21,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike, for your very informative comments, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter. Adjusted earnings of $3.30 per diluted share increased 24% year-over-year, and our adjusted consolidated operating margin increased 11.7% versus 10.5%",1327,"Thanks, Mike, for your very informative comments, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter. Adjusted earnings of $3.30 per diluted share increased 24% year-over-year, and our adjusted consolidated operating margin increased 11.7% versus 10.5% last year.
Among the operating companies, Express was the most valuable player in the quarter, boasting an impressive double, double. Operating income was 27% higher versus last year's adjusted income, and operating margin climbed to 11.3%. Operating income grew at Ground as average daily volume increased 10%, and freight's operating income was unchanged.
We had profit growth at Express despite essentially flat revenue for Q4 year-over-year is a strong testament to Express' continued yield and cost management efforts. Yield did have a positive impact year-over-year on the quarter while currency exchange rate changes have little net impact. One additional operating day also provided the benefit. 
We expect Express operating income at FY '17 to continue to improve, as we manage network capacity to match customer demand, reduce structural costs, modernize our fleet and drive productivity increases throughout our U.S. and international operations. These benefits will be partially offset due to timing of aircraft maintenance events and 1 fewer operating day.
The cap on our remarkable year was the acquisition of TNT Express. We had a seamless and very successful first day when we acquired TNT on May 25, a few days before our fiscal year end. Today is our 28th [ph] day of owning TNT. We had a solid integration plan that we are in process of validating with live data. Our senior leadership team is in place, and we are partnering together in the marketplace for commercial opportunities to bring the best solutions for our customers.
The transaction, financing and integration plan expenses related to this acquisition were $132 million or $0.45 per diluted share in FY '16, which considers certain nontax deductible costs as a result of the closing of the acquisition. These expenses include TNT's operating results from the time of acquisition, and predominantly included in corporate eliminations and others in FY '16.
In FY '17, we will report the operating results for FedEx Express and TNT separately in 2 different segments. We will also provide an overview of the FedEx Express Group, which combines the 2 segments.
Given the timing and complexity of the acquisition, presentation of TNT on our financial statements, including the allocation of the purchase price, is preliminary and will likely change in future periods. The plan to complete our purchase price allocation now weighted [ph] in the fourth quarter of FY '17.
TNT operates road transportation networks and delivers documents, parcels and freight to over 200 countries. This strategic acquisition broadens our portfolio of international transportation solutions with the combined strength of TNT's strong European road platform and our strength in other regions globally, including North America and Asia.
Prior to our acquisition, TNT announced its Outlook strategy aimed at doubling its adjusted operating income and margin percentage by 2018. That profit improvement program includes various initiatives focused on yield management, operational efficiency and productivity and customer service. We plan to continue these profit improvement initiatives in FY '17, and we'll also begin activities to integrate operations. Our focus will be on combining TNT's strong European capabilities with our strength in other regions globally.
Although we are in the very beginning of the integration process and are continuing to validate our information, we currently expect our FY '17 integration CapEx for TNT to be about $100 million and integration costs to be around $200 million. However, the timing and amount of these costs is subject to change as our plans are refined.
Integration expenses, including professional fees, information technology costs and intangible asset amortization related to TNT, are expected to impact operating income and margin during FY '17. We are very excited about the TNT acquisition, and we'll provide you updates on the operating results and integration costs on a quarterly basis going forward. We do expect TNT to be accretive to earnings in FY '18.
Turning to our Ground segment. Operating income grew year-over-year due to higher volumes and increased revenue per package as well as the benefit of 1 additional operating day. These factors were partially offset by higher operating costs, including network expansion expenses. Operating margin was lower due to the change in SmartPost revenue reporting. We expect Ground revenues and operating income to increase in FY '17, driven by e-commerce volume growth and market share gains. We also anticipate continued yield growth through the yield management programs, including changes to our pricing for larger shipments. However, we anticipate ground operating margin will be negatively impacted by higher operating costs in FY '17, driven again by network expansion. Other operational costs may also impact margins as residential volumes grow from e-commerce.
Capital expenditures at Ground are expected to be about $2 billion in FY '17, as we continue to make investments to grow our highly profitable network through facility expansions and equipment purchases. The impact of the depreciation of these investments will continue to partly offset earnings growth in FY '17 at Ground.
At Freight, operating income was unchanged as improved operating efficiencies, higher revenue and an additional operating day were offset by increased salaries and employee benefits expense and the impact from lower weight per shipment. During FY '17, we expect revenue operating income and operating margin improvement at Freight driven by continued effective yield management as well as modest volume growth from small and midsize customers. Freight earnings growth will also be positively impacted by improvement in productivity and further investments in technology.
We incurred a noncash pretax mark-to-market pension accounting loss of $1.5 billion in 2016. Due to its effect on income for income taxes, the adjustment for mark-to-market accounting reduced our 2016 effective tax rate by 120 basis points. Our effective tax rate was 33.6% in fiscal '16, which was also favorably impacted by an internal corporate restructuring done to facilitate the integration of FedEx Express and TNT, was offset by nondeductible costs incurred as part of the acquisition. For FY '17, we're anticipating making contributions totaling $1.1 billion to our U.S. pension plans.
In FY '16, we continue to buy back shares, repurchasing $2.7 billion of our common stock to open market purchases. From FY '14 to FY '16, we repurchased 63 million shares of FedEx common stock and returned more than $8.8 billion to shareholders at an average [ph] price of $140 per share. As of May 31, 2016, we had approximately 19 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase. 2 weeks ago, we announced that we were boosting our dividend by 60% or [ph] a total of $0.40 per share per quarter.
Turning to our outlook. Based on the outlook that Mike described from an economic standpoint and the momentum we have, we project adjusted earnings to be $11.75 to $12.25 per diluted share for FY '17, excluding TNT financial results, including integration of financing costs and year-end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments.
Our expectations for earnings growth in FY '17 are dependent on key external factors, including fuel prices and global economic conditions. Due to our recent acquisition of TNT, FY '17 will be a year of intense integration activities for our dedicated team at Express. We are committed to the successful integration of these 2 great businesses. Meanwhile, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight will continue to be focused on achieving their goals independent of the integration at Express.
Our capital expenditures are expected to be about $5.1 billion in FY '17, excluding TNT. We anticipate that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our increased capital expenditures in FY '17, which will include spending for network expansion at Ground as I discussed and the continued aircraft fleet modernization at Express. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we are well positioned to continue to increase corporate earnings, cash flows, returns and margins.
With that, we will open up for [indiscernible] questions."

The reality is we don't have any better crystal ball than anybody else, so we don't think it's appropriate for us to be speculating on what may happen in the United Kingdom. And should Brexit take place, obviously, we'll be telling folks what we intend to do to adjust to the new situation, but it's certainly premature.
Second, lots of questions on TNT. We'll take a number of them, but quite a few are focused on areas where it's just too early in the process for us to deal with. For instance, what are the implications of the South American road network of TNT in the Southeast Asian road network of TNT? And our regional presidents and Express management are working to that with the integration team, so we're going to defer those until we get a little bit further along.
Third, there are a fair number that are hypotheticals about what new services we might offer, our adjacencies. And of course, that's not in our best interest to answer from a competitive standpoint. So now let me get to some of them that do get the nail on the head.
With the acquisition of TNT, can you discuss major IT requirements going forward? Specifically, are the current systems robust enough for the combined entity? And are there any needs at the product service levels? So I'm going to ask our great CIO, Rob Carter, to [indiscernible] on this."

This is our largest acquisition, but it's certainly not our first. We've prepared diligently over the years with integrations of acquisitions in Mexico, Brazil, the U.K., Africa, India and others around the world to become really quite good at the process of integrating customers, integrating products into the mix. We also have been working very hard on our systems here at FedEx to modernize and simplify them in ways that really position them to be very effective at integration activities. So that's a key design point for the systems that we've been building and pushing forward. And then lastly, we've had a planning and execution team on the ground with the teams. We've done very robust planning with regard to these integrations, including what it would take on day 1, which was executed flawlessly, what our needs are at day 100. And then as we go forward, the preferred future state of the organizations, the systems that will be needed to operate with the combined entities. So we're very confident in the systems that we have, the team that we have and the efforts that are underway to support our customers."

So obviously, we picked up the TNT revenues and whatever profitability they have plus the integration expenses. That's what I meant when I started early on by saying it's very early days with us, and we'll update this in September. But I will say one thing here that it's obvious to me you're looking at some of the questions and some of the reports that have been published, there's this sort of underlying theme that TNT is its own business and at these low margins, so that's going to go forward. The whole rationale of buying TNT, in fact, it's right in the middle of this whole e-commerce debate. In this business, the #1 item after the linehaul and upstream systems is delivery density, cost per stop, the number of stops per hour and so forth. So the 2 plus 2 equals 7 equation, so to speak, of us buying TNT is extraordinary. And that's why Alan says to you with such authority as we integrate these PED networks and take advantage of the unmatched surface networks with TNT, there's going to be a tremendous opportunity to increase the margins and earnings in the Express segment. So we know we're going to have about $200 million in integration expense. We can't tell you exactly when it us, but offsetting that are going to be the TNT revenues and the profitability of their existing business on a go-forward basis. So I hope that clarified it a bit. Let me take another -- a couple or 3 of these Internet questions submitted in advance. David Byrne of Bernstein. How important are store replenishment activities in the FedEx portfolio of services as e-commerce takes share from traditional retail? Is there a risk that demand for any set of services falls off in a consequential manner? Mike and Henry, you want to comment on that?"

We know from our search that the millennial generation, the largest generational cohort in American history, is not going to stop going to stores. In fact, we had a wonderful presentation about it just a couple of weeks ago at our board meeting. So e-commerce is fantastic, and it's going to continue to grow and we intend to be a major player in that space. But as Mike just said, it's not going to, in our opinion and in the research from very credible sources, going to eliminate retail. What it may do is change the character of retail. And one of the things that you see happening are very focused, integrated product and store networks, to that come to mind that are just fantastically successful our desire, which is a company that's located in Spain and well known for its fast-cycle small shipment replenishment of its stores. They're able to turn on a dime with what's selling and move it around the world. And in Japan, a great company called Uniqlo that does the same sort of thing. So as these types of retail operations continue to proliferate, they'll be a fair amount of B2B business. And as Mike said, remember, of all retail, e-commerce is now about 10% growing fast, taking share, but it's going to be a long time before retail is threatened. And B2B, meaning the underpinnings of the business world medical, production, automotive and things like that, that in the main is not going to be diverted to e-commerce any time soon. And that is the backbone of the FedEx networks.
Let me take one more here while we're queuing up another call. Demand for final mile service by the USPS is outgrowing demand for traditional package services, driven in part by the popularity of SmartPost. Does FedEx see any risks or opportunities associated with the UPS -- USPS's ability to invest and keep pace with that demand? Mike, Henry, you want to take that one?"

So I think I've been the financial markets from a debt standpoint a lot the last couple of years, and we'll probably take a little break on that because as I said we think -- well, we know we have the cash flow coverage for what we're trying to do. So going forward, we've always said we're a capital-intensive growing transportation company. We think the sweet spot for CapEx is 6% to 8% of revenue. The next couple of years, we're going to be above, basically because we're re-fleeting, we're expanding Ground as rapidly as we can, sufficiently as we can and we got the TNT integration put together. But having said that, its very manageable with what's in front of us. As I said, we are going to continue to increase earnings cash flows, returns and margins, and we have been improving our ROICs and we've been definitely improving our return on equity but at the end of the day, that's not the most important metric. Most important metric is shareholder return. So over the last 5 years, we have had a share price return of 88%, which is a CAGR of a little bit over 14.1%. That compares to 53 for UPS, 63 for S&P 500 and 47.5 for the Dow Jones transports. That's the number that's the most important for our shareholders and the same goes for total return. And when I go back longer term, the last 15 years, our total return to shareholders had been 377.6%, UPS has been 170%. So while ROC and ROE and ROIC and ROE are nice metrics, they don't win the ballgame."

On the SmartPost side, we're well along. We haven't integrated all facilities yet. That's largely due to the fact that the growth in that service has been such that we've been little bit concerned constrained by ground capacity in being able to move more volume into the network. But the 2 big IT events, the first occurred in January, which assess to begin manually mashing addresses on packages and moving them into the ground network for final delivery. And then the next big event will come next summer where virtually we can have a system match address and move them. And as I explained in the past, you move a SmartPost package into the Ground network. You can deliver that incremental package for roughly 25% of the postage I supposed to tendering it to the USPS. So we're pretty excited about that. We're looking forward to getting this thing behind us."

I used the word fantastic, although if you recall, because all of these analysis are either unmindful of that or they make assumptions that are erroneous when you actually understand what the real world numbers are.

And so the calculations are done on that."" The maximum cubic revenue payload of a 767, we're pretty damn good at this, is far less than 120,000 pounds.

Welcome, everyone, to the discussion of our results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2016, significant year for FedEx.We announced some time ago we would complete the acquisition of TNT Express in the first half of calendar",400,"Thank you, Mickey. Welcome, everyone, to the discussion of our results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2016, significant year for FedEx.
We announced some time ago we would complete the acquisition of TNT Express in the first half of calendar 2016, and we officially acquired the company on May 25. Greatly appreciate the outstanding work of our express, finance and legal teams in getting this transaction completed without conditions.
Annual revenue exceeded $50 billion for the first time, and we're particularly pleased with our adjusted operating margin improvement of 1% year-over-year to 10% for fiscal year 2016 and our adjusted operating margin of 11.7% for the fourth quarter. We believe we will continue to increase margins, earnings per share, cash flows and capital returns over the next several years given expectations for moderate economic growth and excluding TNT financial results and pension mark-to-market costs.
I'd like to congratulate and thank all FedEx team members around the world for their dedication to our Purple Promise, which simply states, ""I will make every FedEx experience outstanding."" As we integrate the acquisitions of TNT, GENCO and FedEx CrossBorder, we'll continue making investments in modernizing the FedEx Express aircraft fleet and expanding the highly automated FedEx Ground network to extend our leadership in the rapidly growing e-commerce market. These initiatives are integral to achieving our goals.
Let me close with a few brief remarks regarding Friday's successful conclusion of the Internet pharmacy case. First, I'd like to thank our inside and outside counsel. They did an outstanding job representing our company. FedEx has always been innocent of these charges, which should never have been filed. We strongly believe that we should not admit the things we did not do and pay millions to avoid a criminal trial. FedEx delivered packages for licensed pharmacies registered by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Very few companies have done more during the last 4 decades to cooperate with law enforcement than FedEx, as was true in these matters, and we will continue to do so.
We're especially proud of the hundreds of thousands of FedEx team members worldwide, who demonstrate every day their commitment to provide our important services safely, reliably and at all times, ethically.
Now let me turn it over to Mike Glenn, who will comment on the economy and our revenue; followed by Alan Graf, who will discuss FedEx's financial performance. Mike?"
124423,313824656,1001524,"FedEx Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 21, 2016",2016-06-21,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Fred. I'll open with our economic update and outlook, and then we'll discuss business performance in each of the segments. And then I'll have some commentary on broader business trends.On the economic front, we continue to see moderate growth in",1360,"Thanks, Fred. I'll open with our economic update and outlook, and then we'll discuss business performance in each of the segments. And then I'll have some commentary on broader business trends.
On the economic front, we continue to see moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP forecast is 1.8% for calendar '16, which is 40 basis points lower than our forecast last quarter. And we forecast 2.4% for calendar '17, led by gains in consumer spending. We expect industrial production to decline 0.6% in calendar '16, 120 basis points lower than last quarter, and increase 2.3% next year. Our global GDP forecast is 2.3% for calendar '16, 20 basis points below last quarter, and calls for 2.8% growth for calendar 2017.
Now I'll review revenue, volume and yield trends by segment. In the Express segment, U.S. domestic average daily package volume was essentially flat in the quarter due to the decline in the deferred product category. Yield per package increased approximately 1% year-over-year despite lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic package yield grew 2.3%, primarily due to rate and discounts. Revenue grew 2.1% year-over-year, driven by one more operating day in yield growth. Excluding the impact of the fuel surcharge, domestic revenue grew 3.7% year-over-year.
FedEx International Economy average daily volume grew 3.5%, while FedEx International Priority average daily volume declined 2.1%. International export revenue per package decreased 2.6% as lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable currency exchange rates negatively impacted the yields. Excluding fuel, international export express package yield was slightly positive, primarily driven by the positive impact of rate and discount changes, which outweighed the negative impact of exchange rates.
In the Ground segment, FedEx Ground revenue increased 20% in the quarter, driven by higher Ground volume and yield and the recording of SmartPost revenues on a gross basis versus the previous net treatment. FedEx Ground average daily volume grew 10% year-over-year in Q4, primarily driven by continued growth after peak season for both residential and commercial deliveries. FedEx Ground revenue per package increased 7% year-over-year in Q4 due to the recording of FedEx SmartPost revenues on a gross basis and higher base rates, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, Ground yield per package, including SmartPost, increased 8.6% year-over-year, driven primarily by extra service charges and weight per package, offsetting a decrease due to SmartPost volume mix.
FedEx Freight revenue increased 2.3% as average daily segments increased 7.5% year-over-year and revenue per shipment declined 5.3% year-over-year.
As a reminder, Q4 in FY '16 contained one more business day than Q4 in FY '15. The continued strength in shipment volume is driven by our sales efforts with small and medium customers and reflects the speed, reliability and choice of priority and economy service for our LTL customers, and we also saw increased demand from our larger customers during the quarter. Revenue per LTL shipment declined due to lower fuel surcharge revenue and lower weight per package. Including the impact of fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per shipment was down 2.1% year-over-year due to lower weight per shipment.
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to further discuss and address the growth of e-commerce, which continues to outpace GDP growth, both in the U.S. and globally. E-commerce has become a way of life for consumers acquiring goods around the world, but the success of e-commerce continues to be dependent on transportation companies' ability to reliably and quickly make residential deliveries around the world. As we noted during our last conference call on earnings, more than 95% of e-commerce packages in the U.S. are delivered by FedEx, UPS and the United States Postal Service, with whom we have a strategic relationship to transport their priority mail. E-commerce will be impossible without these companies and our expansive networks. If you were to isolate the FedEx e-commerce business, it would become clear FedEx is one of the most profitable e-commerce companies in business today.
During the past quarter, we've made significant investments in expanding our global transportation portfolio and e-commerce capabilities around the world, including the acquisition of TNT, the introduction of FedEx Cross -- and the introduction of FedEx CrossBorder. The TNT acquisition will transform the global transportation and logistics industry. It is the largest acquisition in FedEx history and instantly accelerates our European and global growth strategy. FedEx now has a strong presence in Europe, with a range of transportation options from express to economy for both parcel and freight. This significant enhancement to our portfolio in Europe helps not only our customers in Europe but also provides benefits for customers around the world shipping into Europe.
In addition, we will substantially enhance our capabilities globally by leveraging TNT's lower-cost road networks in different regions around the world. While the integration will take time to fully execute, we have the benefit of similar and complementary corporate cultures and a common mission of providing superior service and value to customers around the world.
FedEx CrossBorder offers e-commerce technology solution that enables e-tailers to navigate common cross-border selling challenges such as regulatory compliance, secure payment processing, multiple currency pricing or credit card fraud protection and also offers access to e-commerce shoppers around the world. CrossBorder is the relaunch of Bongo International, a company FedEx acquired in 2014. When combined with our recent GENCO acquisition, we have significantly strengthened our e-commerce portfolio of services.
Of course, demand for e-commerce increases significantly each year during the peak holiday season, and we're deep into preparations for the upcoming 2016 peak season. We're closely collaborating with large e-tail and retail customers to understand their peak shipping needs, including geographic mix and package characteristics, so that we can once again have our resources positioned and ready to provide outstanding service.
We'll also be leveraging some new and evolving services to meet the heavy demand during peak, including FedEx Delivery Manager, FedEx SameDay and an expansion in FedEx Hold at Location services. Delivery Manager allows U.S. package recipients to customize home deliveries to fit their schedules, including changing the time and location of delivery, requesting a signature upon delivery or leaving instructions for the courier. FedEx SameDay City is available in 24 markets across the country, offering customers same-day service with uniformed FedEx drivers, branded vehicles, realtime tracking and world-renowned FedEx reliability. FedEx Hold at Location offers secure package pickup at more than 2,400 FedEx locations, including more than 1,800 FedEx Office retail stores. These hold services allow customers to redirect packages for pickup and drop-off at FedEx and many other third-party locations.
One additional point is we continue to get questions concerning Amazon and the evolution of their transportation capabilities and needs. Amazon continues to be a valuable customer, and they're among the large e-tailers that we stay in close dialogue with throughout the year to understand their transportation needs as they continue to experience significant growth and generate demand for FedEx transportation. Because of our close relationship with Amazon and close collaboration, we have a very clear and specific understanding of their needs across the FedEx portfolio during FY '17. And further, we expect them to be a significant customer for many years to come. Having said that, it is important to remember that no single FedEx customer represents more than approximately 3% of total revenue.
Finally, I'd like to mention the introduction of the new FedEx Freight box, which makes transporting less-than-truckload shipments simple with improved flexibility, increased security, better shipment integrity and best of all, no freight classification. The FedEx Freight box comes in 2 sizes, a standard freight box that requires a pallet to ship and a smaller freight box with an integrated pallet. The freedom to choose your freight box makes freight shipping accessible for any business no matter the size. With a distance-based pricing structure, the FedEx Freight box allows you to ship LTL, avoiding the complex and antiquated pricing structure used in the industry. The Freight box was introduced in selected markets with great success during the second half of FY '16 and is rolling out to customers nationwide this month.
And now I'll turn it over to Alan Graf."
124423,313824656,1001524,"FedEx Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 21, 2016",2016-06-21,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike, for your very informative comments, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter. Adjusted earnings of $3.30 per diluted share increased 24% year-over-year, and our adjusted consolidated operating margin increased 11.7% versus 10.5%",1324,"Thanks, Mike, for your very informative comments, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter. Adjusted earnings of $3.30 per diluted share increased 24% year-over-year, and our adjusted consolidated operating margin increased 11.7% versus 10.5% last year.
Among the operating companies, Express was the most valuable player of the quarter, posting an impressive double, double. Operating income was 27% higher versus last year's adjusted income, and operating margin climbed to 11.3%. Operating income grew at Ground as average daily volume increased 10%, and Freight's operating income was unchanged.
And profit growth at Express despite essentially flat revenue for Q4 year-over-year is a strong testament to Express' continued yield and cost management efforts. Yield did have a positive impact year-over-year on the quarter, while currency exchange rate changes have little net impact. One additional operating day also provided a benefit.
We expect Express operating income at FY '17 to continue to improve as we manage network capacity to match customer demand, reduce structural costs, modernize our fleet and drive productivity increases throughout our U.S. and international operations. These benefits will be partially offset due to timing of aircraft maintenance events and one fewer operating day.
The capper on our remarkable year was the acquisition of TNT Express. We had a seamless and very successful first day when we acquired TNT on May 25, a few days before our fiscal year-end. Today is our 28th day of owning TNT. We had a solid integration plan that we are in process of validating with live data. Our senior leadership team is in place, and we are partnering together in the marketplace for commercial opportunities to bring the best solutions for our customers.
The transaction, financing and integration plan expenses related to this acquisition were $132 million or $0.45 per diluted share in FY '16, which considers certain nontax deductible costs as a result of the closing of the acquisition. These expenses include TNT's operating results from the time of acquisition and are predominantly included in corporate eliminations and others in FY '16.
In FY '17, we will report the operating results for FedEx Express and TNT separately in 2 different segments. We will also provide an overview of the FedEx Express group, which combines the 2 segments.
Given the timing and complexity of the acquisition, presentation of TNT on our financial statements, including the allocation of the purchase price, is preliminary and will likely change in future periods. We plan to complete our purchase price allocation no later than the fourth quarter of FY '17.
TNT operates road transportation networks and delivers documents, parcels and freight to over 200 countries. This strategic acquisition broadens our portfolio of international transportation solutions with the combined strength of TNT's strong European road platform and our strength in other regions globally, including North America and Asia.
Prior to our acquisition, TNT announced its outlook strategy aimed at doubling its adjusted operating income and margin percentage by 2018. That profit improvement program includes various initiatives focused on yield management, operational efficiency and productivity and customer service. We plan to continue these profit improvement initiatives in FY '17, and we'll also begin activities to integrate operations. Our focus will be on combining TNT's strong European capabilities with our strength in other regions globally.
Although we are in the very beginning of the integration process and are continuing to validate our information, we currently expect our FY '17 integration CapEx for TNT to be about $100 million and integration costs to be around $200 million. However, the timing and amount of these costs is subject to change as our plans are refined. Integration expenses, including professional fees, information technology costs and intangible asset amortization related to TNT, are expected to impact operating income and margin during FY '17.
We are very excited about the TNT acquisition, and we'll provide you updates on the operating results and integration costs on a quarterly basis going forward. We do expect TNT to be accretive to earnings in FY '18.
Turning to our Ground segment. Operating income grew year-over-year due to higher volumes and increased revenue per package as well as the benefit of one additional operating day. These factors were partially offset by higher operating costs, including network expansion expenses. Operating margin was lower due to the change in SmartPost revenue reporting.
We expect Ground revenues and operating income to increase in FY '17, driven by e-commerce volume growth and market share gains. We also anticipate continued yield growth through the yield management programs, including changes to our pricing for larger shipments. However, we anticipate Ground operating margin will be negatively impacted by higher operating costs in FY '17, driven again by network expansion. Other operational costs may also impact margins as residential volumes grow from e-commerce.
Capital expenditures at Ground are expected to be about $2 billion in FY '17 as we continue to make investments to grow our highly profitable network through facility expansions and equipment purchases. The impact of the depreciation of these investments will continue to partly offset earnings growth in FY '17 at Ground.
At Freight, operating income was unchanged as improved operating efficiencies, higher revenue and an additional operating day were offset by increased salaries and employee benefits expense and the impact from lower weight per shipment. During FY '17, we expect revenue, operating income and operating margin improvement at Freight driven by continued effective yield management as well as modest volume growth from small and midsize customers. Freight earnings growth will also be positively impacted by improvement in productivity and further investments in technology.
We incurred a noncash pretax mark-to-market pension accounting loss of $1.5 billion in 2016. Due to its effect on income before income taxes, the adjustment for mark-to-market accounting reduced our 2016 effective tax rate by 120 basis points. Our effective tax rate was 33.6% in fiscal '16, which was also favorably impacted by an internal corporate restructuring done to facilitate the integration of FedEx Express and TNT and was offset by nondeductible costs incurred as part of the acquisition. For FY '17, we're anticipating making contributions totaling $1.1 billion to our U.S. pension plans.
In FY '16, we continued to buy back shares, repurchasing $2.7 billion of our common stock through open market purchases. From FY '14 through FY '16, we repurchased 63 million shares of FedEx common stock and returned more than $8.8 billion to shareholders at an average price of $140 per share. As of May 31, 2016, we had approximately 19 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase. A few weeks ago, we announced that we were boosting our dividend by 60% or a total of $0.40 per share per quarter.
Turning to our outlook. Based on the outlook that Mike described from an economic standpoint and the momentum we have, we project adjusted earnings to be $11.75 to $12.25 per diluted share for FY '17, excluding TNT financial results, including integration and financing costs and year-end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments.
Our expectations for earnings growth in FY '17 are dependent on key external factors, including fuel prices and global economic conditions. Due to our recent acquisition of TNT, FY '17 will be a year of intense integration activities for our dedicated team at Express. We are committed to the successful integration of these 2 great businesses. Meanwhile, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight will continue to be focused on achieving their goals independent of the integration at Express.
Our capital expenditures are expected to be about $5.1 billion in FY '17, excluding TNT. We anticipate that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our increased capital expenditures in FY '17, which will include spending for network expansion at Ground, as I discussed, and the continued aircraft fleet modernization at Express. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we are well positioned to continue to increase corporate earnings, cash flows, returns and margins.
With that, we will open up for strategic questions."

There may have been 1 or 2 others that have come in on the Internet. And Mickey will be looking at the calls coming in, and we'll try to answer as many of these as we can. There are a lot of questions in the 43 that were submitted that we won't address for one reason or another, and let me deal with those. 
One, there were a number about Brexit. The reality is we don't have any better crystal ball than anybody else, so we don't think it's appropriate for us to be speculating on what may happen in the United Kingdom. And should Brexit take place, obviously, we'll be telling folks what we intend to do to adjust to the new situation. But it's certainly premature.
Second, lots of questions on TNT. We'll take a number of them, but quite a few are focused on areas where it's just too early in the process for us to deal with. For instance, what are the implications of the South American road network of TNT and the Southeast Asian road network of TNT? And our regional presidents and the Express management are working through that with the integration team, so we're going to defer those until we get a little bit further along.
Third, there are a fair number that are hypotheticals about what new services we might offer, our adjacencies. And of course, that's not in our best interest to answer from a competitive standpoint. So now let me get to some of them that do hit the nail on the head.
With the acquisition of TNT, can you discuss major IT requirements going forward? Specifically, are the current systems robust enough for the combined entity? And are there any needs at the product service level? So I'm going to ask our great CIO, Rob Carter, to opine on this."

This is our largest acquisition, but it's certainly not our first. We've prepared diligently over the years with integrations of acquisitions in Mexico, Brazil, the U.K., Africa, India and others around the world to become really quite good at the process of integrating customers, integrating products into the mix. We also have been working very hard on our systems here at FedEx to modernize and simplify them in ways that really position them to be very effective at integration activities. So that's a key design point for the systems that we've been building and pushing forward. And then lastly, we've had a planning and execution team on the ground with the teams. We've done very robust planning with regard to these integrations, including what it would take on day 1, which was executed flawlessly, what our needs are at day 100, and then as we go forward, the preferred future state of the organization, the systems that will be needed to operate with the combined entities. So we're very confident in the systems that we have, the team that we have and the efforts that are underway to support our customers."

I already knew that their culture lined up with our culture. I was over there on day 1 for the integration 28 days ago. And I can tell you that they're excited and we're excited.

Let me make sure you understand that comment that was just made. There's nothing in that guidance pro or con from TNT. So obviously, we picked up the TNT revenues and whatever profitability they have plus the integration expenses. That's what I meant when I started early on by saying it's very early days with us, and we'll update this in September. But I will say one thing here that it's obvious to me, looking at some of the questions and some of the reports that have been published. There's this sort of underlying theme that TNT is its own business and it's had these low margins and so that's going to go forward. The whole rationale of buying TNT, in fact, it's right in the middle of this whole e-commerce debate. In this business, the #1 item after the linehaul and upstream systems is delivery density, cost per stop, the number of stops per hour and so forth. So the 2 plus 2 equals 7 equation, so to speak, of us buying TNT is extraordinary. And that's why Alan says to you with such authority, as we integrate these PUD networks and take advantage of the unmatched surface networks with TNT, there's going to be a tremendous opportunity to increase the margins and earnings in the Express segment. So we know we're going to have about $200 million in integration expense. We can't tell you exactly when it is, but offsetting that are going to be the TNT revenues and the profitability of their existing business on a go-forward basis. So I hope that clarified it a bit.
Let me take another -- a couple or 3 of these Internet questions submitted in advance. David Vernon of Bernstein. How important are store replenishment activities in the FedEx portfolio of services as e-commerce takes share from traditional retail? Is there a risk that demand for any set of services falls off in a consequential manner? Mike and Henry, you want to comment on that?"

We know from research that the millennial generation, the largest generational cohort in American history, is not going to stop going to stores. In fact, we had a wonderful presentation about it just a couple of weeks ago at our board meeting. So e-commerce is fantastic, and it's going to continue to grow. And we intend to be a major player in that space. But as Mike just said, it's not going to, in our opinion and in the research from very credible source, is going to eliminate retail. What it may do is change the character of retail. And one of the things that you see happening are very focused, integrated product and store networks. Two that come to mind that are just fantastically successful are Zara, which is a company that's located in Spain and well known for its fast cycle, small shipment replenishment of its stores. They're able to turn on a dime with what's selling and move it around the world. And in Japan, a great company called UNIQLO that does the same sort of thing. So as these types of retail operations continue to proliferate, there'll be a fair amount of B2B business. And as Mike said, remember, of all retail, e-commerce is now about 10%, growing fast, taking share. But it's going to be a long time before retail is threatened. And B2B, meaning the underpinnings of the business world, medical, production, automotive and things like that, that in the main is not going to be diverted to e-commerce anytime soon. And that is the backbone of the FedEx networks.
Let me take one more here while we're queuing up another call. Demand for final mile service by the USPS is outgrowing demand for traditional package services, driven in part by the popularity of SmartPost. Does FedEx see any risk or opportunities associated with the UPS -- USPS's ability to invest and keep pace with that demand? Mike, Henry, you want to take that one?"

And we intend to work on improving those over the next 24 months. So I think I've been in the financial markets, from a debt standpoint, a lot in the last couple of years. And we'll probably take a little break on that because as I said, we think -- well, we know we have the cash flow coverage for what we're trying to do. So going forward, we've always said we're a capital-intensive growing transportation company. We think the sweet spot for CapEx is 6% to 8% of revenue. Next couple of years, we're going to be above that basically because we're re-fleeting, we're expanding Ground as rapidly as we can, as efficiently as we can and we've got the TNT integration put together. But having said that, it's very manageable what's in front of us. As I said, we are going to continue to increase earnings cash flows, returns and margins. And we have been improving our ROICs, and we've been definitely improving our return on equity. But at the end of the day, that's not the most important metric. The most important metric is shareholder return. So over the last 5 years, we have had a share price return of 88%, which is a CAGR of a little bit over 14.1%. That compares to 53 for UPS, 63 for S&P 500 and 47.5 for the Dow Jones Transports. That's the number that's the most important for our shareholders, and the same goes for total return. And when I go back longer term, the last 15 years, our total return to shareholders had been 377.6%. UPS has been 170%. So while ROC and ROE -- ROIC and ROE are nice metrics, they don't win the ballgame."

On the SmartPost side, we're well along. We haven't integrated all the facilities yet, and that's largely due to the fact that the growth in that service has been such that we've been a little bit constrained by Ground capacity and being able to move more volume into the network. But the 2 big IT events, the first occurred in January, which allows us to begin manually matching addresses on packages and moving them into the Ground network for final delivery. And then the next big event will come next summer where virtually we can have the system match addresses and move them. And as I've explained in the past, you move a SmartPost package into the Ground network. You can deliver that incremental package for roughly 25% of the postage as opposed to tendering it to the USPS. So we're pretty excited about that. We're looking forward to getting this thing behind us."

But the way to deal with that is to negotiate with China and not to threaten them or take all of the huge benefits of trade and throw them away. We have thousands and tens of thousands of highly compensated people working for FedEx in the United States that are involved in trade pallets, mechanics, customs clearance people, pickup and delivery personnel.

It is. And I think it's important because there have been several things that have been printed about this, which indicate a lack of clarity out there about this. When Dave and his team did the deal with Boeing on the 767s, it called for 10 firm airplanes per year over a number of years to a total of 50. And then there were options with given dates. And these 6 aircraft were the first options that became due, and they are for delivery in fiscal year '19 and '20. The next options are not due until June of calendar year 2018 when Express will decide whether it wants to exercise a tranche of 6. And then the next one after that is June '19 with a tranche of 6. Basic deal is we have 10 firm airplanes per year and the ability to go up to 16 airplanes. Now it's a little more complicated than that in the outyears. But Dave, you want to add anything on this?"

Problem there is that you cut yourself off from the tens of millions or billions of potential other shippers from every other part of the world that can be co-mingled to lower stop cost by having more stops per hour or more deliveries per stop. And that's the thing that we've been consistently saying. I used the word fantastic, although if you'll recall, because all of these analyses are either unmindful of that or they make assumptions that are erroneous when you actually understand what the real world numbers are. Let me just give you one statistic. I don't mean to impeach any one entity, but there have been several analyst reports that have come out and said, ""Well, 767 airplanes can carry 120,000 pounds. And so the calculations are done on that."" The maximum cubic revenue payload of a 767, and we're pretty damn good at this, is far less than 120,000 pounds. And if you load it up with just palettes, you're probably talking about 2/3 of that, if that. The airport locations to process these things and the containers, they're more difficult than the airplanes by far.

Welcome, everyone, to the discussion of our results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2016, a significant year for FedEx.
We announced some time ago we would complete the acquisition of TNT Express in the first half of calendar 2016, and we officially acquired the company on May 25. Greatly appreciate the outstanding work of our Express, finance and legal teams in getting this transaction completed without conditions.
Annual revenue exceeded $50 billion for the first time, and we're particularly pleased with our adjusted operating margin improvement of 1% year-over-year to 10% for fiscal year 2016 and our adjusted operating margin of 11.7% for the fourth quarter. We believe we will continue to increase margins, earnings per share, cash flows and capital returns over the next several years given expectations for moderate economic growth and excluding TNT financial results and pension mark-to-market costs.
I'd like to congratulate and thank all FedEx team members around the world for their dedication to our Purple Promise, which simply states, ""I will make every FedEx experience outstanding."" As we integrate the acquisitions of TNT, GENCO and FedEx CrossBorder, we'll continue making investments in modernizing the FedEx Express aircraft fleet and expanding the highly automated FedEx Ground network to extend our leadership in the rapidly growing e-commerce market. These initiatives are integral to achieving our goals.
Let me close with a few brief remarks regarding Friday's successful conclusion of the Internet pharmacy case. First, I'd like to thank our inside and outside counsel. They did an outstanding job representing our company. FedEx has always been innocent of these charges, which should never have been filed. We strongly believe that we should not admit to things we did not do and pay millions to avoid a criminal trial. FedEx delivered packages for licensed pharmacies registered by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Very few companies have done more during the last 4 decades to cooperate with law enforcement than FedEx, as was true in these matters, and we will continue to do so.
We're especially proud of the hundreds of thousands of FedEx team members worldwide, who demonstrate every day their commitment to provide our important services safely, reliably and at all times, ethically.
Now let me turn it over to Mike Glenn, who will comment on the economy and our revenue; followed by Alan Graf, who will discuss FedEx's financial performance. Mike?"
124423,313824656,1001530,"FedEx Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 21, 2016",2016-06-21,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Fred. I'll open with our economic update and outlook, and then we'll discuss business performance in each of the segments. And then I'll have some commentary on broader business trends.On the economic front, we continue to see moderate growth in",1360,"Thanks, Fred. I'll open with our economic update and outlook, and then we'll discuss business performance in each of the segments. And then I'll have some commentary on broader business trends.
On the economic front, we continue to see moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP forecast is 1.8% for calendar '16, which is 40 basis points lower than our forecast last quarter. And we forecast 2.4% for calendar '17, led by gains in consumer spending. We expect industrial production to decline 0.6% in calendar '16, 120 basis points lower than last quarter, and increase 2.3% next year. Our global GDP forecast is 2.3% for calendar '16, 20 basis points below last quarter, and calls for 2.8% growth for calendar 2017.
Now I'll review revenue, volume and yield trends by segment. In the Express segment, U.S. domestic average daily package volume was essentially flat in the quarter due to the decline in the deferred product category. Yield per package increased approximately 1% year-over-year despite lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic package yield grew 2.3%, primarily due to rate and discounts. Revenue grew 2.1% year-over-year, driven by one more operating day and yield growth. Excluding the impact of the fuel surcharge, domestic revenue grew 3.7% year-over-year.
FedEx International Economy average daily volume grew 3.5%, while FedEx International Priority average daily volume declined 2.1%. International export revenue per package decreased 2.6% as lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable currency exchange rates negatively impacted the yields. Excluding fuel, international export express package yield was slightly positive, primarily driven by the positive impact of rate and discount changes, which outweighed the negative impact of exchange rates.
In the Ground segment, FedEx Ground revenue increased 20% in the quarter, driven by higher ground volume and yield and the recording of SmartPost revenues on a gross basis versus the previous net treatment. FedEx Ground average daily volume grew 10% year-over-year in Q4, primarily driven by continued growth after peak season for both residential and commercial deliveries. FedEx Ground revenue per package increased 7% year-over-year in Q4 due to the recording of FedEx SmartPost revenues on a gross basis and higher base rates, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, ground yield per package, including SmartPost, increased 8.6% year-over-year, driven primarily by extra service charges and weight per package, offsetting a decrease due to SmartPost volume mix.
FedEx Freight revenue increased 2.3% as average daily shipments increased 7.5% year-over-year and revenue per shipment declined 5.3% year-over-year.
As a reminder, Q4 in FY '16 contained one more business day than Q4 in FY '15. The continued strength in shipment volume is driven by our sales efforts with small and medium customers and reflects the speed, reliability and choice of priority and economy service for our LTL customers, and we also saw increased demand from our larger customers during the quarter. Revenue per LTL shipment declined due to lower fuel surcharge revenue and lower weight per package. Including the impact of fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per shipment was down 2.1% year-over-year due to lower weight per shipment.
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to further discuss and address the growth of e-commerce, which continues to outpace GDP growth, both in the U.S. and globally. E-commerce has become a way of life for consumers acquiring goods around the world, but the success of e-commerce continues to be dependent on transportation companies' ability to reliably and quickly make residential deliveries around the world. As we noted during our last conference call on earnings, more than 95% of e-commerce packages in the U.S. are delivered by FedEx, UPS and the United States Postal Service, with whom we have a strategic relationship to transport their priority mail. E-commerce would be impossible without these companies and our expansive networks. If you were to isolate the FedEx e-commerce business, it would become clear FedEx is one of the most profitable e-commerce companies in business today.
During the past quarter, we've made significant investments in expanding our global transportation portfolio and e-commerce capabilities around the world, including the acquisition of TNT, the introduction of FedEx Cross -- and the introduction of FedEx CrossBorder. The TNT acquisition will transform the global transportation and logistics industry. It is the largest acquisition in FedEx history and instantly accelerates our European and global growth strategy. FedEx now has a strong presence in Europe, with a range of transportation options from express to economy for both parcel and freight. This significant enhancement to our portfolio in Europe helps not only our customers in Europe, but also provides benefits for customers around the world shipping into Europe.
In addition, we will substantially enhance our capabilities globally by leveraging TNT's lower-cost road networks in different regions around the world. While the integration will take time to fully execute, we have the benefit of similar and complementary corporate cultures and a common mission of providing superior service and value to customers around the world.
FedEx CrossBorder offers e-commerce technology solutions that enables e-tailers to navigate common cross-border selling challenges such as regulatory compliance, secure payment processing, multiple currency pricing or credit card fraud protection and also offers access to e-commerce shoppers around the world. CrossBorder is the relaunch of Bongo International, a company FedEx acquired in 2014. When combined with our recent GENCO acquisition, we have significantly strengthened our e-commerce portfolio of services.
Of course, demand for e-commerce increases significantly each year during the peak holiday season, and we're deep into preparations for the upcoming 2016 peak season. We're closely collaborating with large e-tail and retail customers to understand their peak shipping needs, including geographic mix and package characteristics, so that we can once again have our resources positioned and ready to provide outstanding service.
We'll also be leveraging some new and evolving services to meet the heavy demand during peak, including FedEx Delivery Manager, FedEx SameDay and an expansion in FedEx Hold at Location services. Delivery Manager allows U.S. package recipients to customize home deliveries to fit their schedules, including changing the time and location of delivery, requesting a signature upon delivery or leaving instructions for the courier. FedEx SameDay City is available in 24 markets across the country, offering customers same-day service with uniformed FedEx drivers, branded vehicles, realtime tracking and world-renowned FedEx reliability. FedEx Hold at Location offers secure package pickup at more than 2,400 FedEx locations, including more than 1,800 FedEx Office retail stores. These hold services allow customers to redirect packages for pickup and drop-off at FedEx and many other third-party locations.
One additional point is we continue to get questions concerning Amazon and the evolution of their transportation capabilities and needs. Amazon continues to be a valuable customer, and they're among the large e-tailers that we stay in close dialogue with throughout the year to understand their transportation needs as they continue to experience significant growth and generate demand for FedEx transportation. Because of our close relationship with Amazon and close collaboration, we have a very clear and specific understanding of their needs across the FedEx portfolio during FY '17. And further, we expect them to be a significant customer for many years to come. Having said that, it is important to remember that no single FedEx customer represents more than approximately 3% of total revenue.
Finally, I'd like to mention the introduction of the new FedEx Freight box, which makes transporting less-than-truckload shipments simple with improved flexibility, increased security, better shipment integrity and best of all, no freight classification. The FedEx Freight box comes in 2 sizes, a standard freight box that requires a pallet to ship and a smaller freight box with an integrated pallet. The freedom to choose your freight box makes freight shipping accessible for any business, no matter the size. With a distance-based pricing structure, the FedEx Freight box allows you to ship LTL, avoiding the complex and antiquated pricing structure used in the industry. The Freight box was introduced in selected markets with great success during the second half of FY '16 and is rolling out to customers nationwide this month.
And now I'll turn it over to Alan Graf."
124423,313824656,1001530,"FedEx Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 21, 2016",2016-06-21,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike, for your very informative comments, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter. Adjusted earnings of $3.30 per diluted share increased 24% year-over-year, and our adjusted consolidated operating margin increased 11.7% versus 10.5%",1324,"Thanks, Mike, for your very informative comments, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter. Adjusted earnings of $3.30 per diluted share increased 24% year-over-year, and our adjusted consolidated operating margin increased 11.7% versus 10.5% last year.
Among the operating companies, Express was the most valuable player of the quarter, posting an impressive double, double. Operating income was 27% higher versus last year's adjusted income, and operating margin climbed to 11.3%. Operating income grew at Ground as average daily volume increased 10%, and Freight's operating income was unchanged.
And profit growth at Express, despite essentially flat revenue for Q4 year-over-year, is a strong testament to Express' continued yield and cost management efforts. Yield did have a positive impact year-over-year on the quarter, while currency exchange rate changes have little net impact. One additional operating day also provided a benefit.
We expect Express operating income at FY '17 to continue to improve as we manage network capacity to match customer demand, reduce structural costs, modernize our fleet and drive productivity increases throughout our U.S. and international operations. These benefits will be partially offset due to timing of aircraft maintenance events and one fewer operating day.
The capper on our remarkable year was the acquisition of TNT Express. We had a seamless and very successful first day when we acquired TNT on May 25, a few days before our fiscal year-end. Today is our 28th day of owning TNT. We have a solid integration plan that we are in process of validating with live data. Our senior leadership team is in place, and we are partnering together in the marketplace for commercial opportunities to bring the best solutions for our customers.
The transaction, financing and integration plan expenses related to this acquisition were $132 million or $0.45 per diluted share in FY '16, which considers certain nontax deductible costs as a result of the closing of the acquisition. These expenses include TNT's operating results from the time of acquisition and are predominantly included in corporate eliminations and others in FY '16.
In FY '17, we will report the operating results for FedEx Express and TNT separately in 2 different segments. We will also provide an overview of the FedEx Express group, which combines the 2 segments.
Given the timing and complexity of the acquisition, presentation of TNT on our financial statements, including the allocation of the purchase price, is preliminary and will likely change in future periods. We plan to complete our purchase price allocation no later than the fourth quarter of FY '17.
TNT operates road transportation networks and delivers documents, parcels and freight to over 200 countries. This strategic acquisition broadens our portfolio of international transportation solutions with the combined strength of TNT's strong European road platform and our strength in other regions globally, including North America and Asia.
Prior to our acquisition, TNT announced its outlook strategy aimed at doubling its adjusted operating income and margin percentage by 2018. That profit improvement program includes various initiatives focused on yield management, operational efficiency and productivity and customer service. We plan to continue these profit improvement initiatives in FY '17, and we'll also begin activities to integrate operations. Our focus will be on combining TNT's strong European capabilities with our strength in other regions globally.
Although we are in the very beginning of the integration process and are continuing to validate our information, we currently expect our FY '17 integration CapEx for TNT to be about $100 million and integration costs to be around $200 million. However, the timing and amount of these costs is subject to change as our plans are refined. Integration expenses, including professional fees, information technology costs and intangible asset amortization related to TNT, are expected to impact operating income and margin during FY '17.
We are very excited about the TNT acquisition, and we'll provide you updates on the operating results and integration costs on a quarterly basis going forward. We do expect TNT to be accretive to earnings in FY '18.
Turning to our Ground segment. Operating income grew year-over-year due to higher volumes and increased revenue per package as well as the benefit of one additional operating day. These factors were partially offset by higher operating costs, including network expansion expenses. Operating margin was lower due to the change in SmartPost revenue reporting.
We expect Ground revenues and operating income to increase in FY '17, driven by e-commerce volume growth and market share gains. We also anticipate continued yield growth through the yield management programs, including changes to our pricing for larger shipments. However, we anticipate Ground operating margin will be negatively impacted by higher operating costs in FY '17, driven again by network expansion. Other operational costs may also impact margins as residential volumes grow from e-commerce.
Capital expenditures at Ground are expected to be about $2 billion in FY '17 as we continue to make investments to grow our highly profitable network through facility expansions and equipment purchases. The impact of the depreciation of these investments will continue to partly offset earnings growth in FY '17 at Ground.
At Freight, operating income was unchanged as improved operating efficiencies, higher revenue and an additional operating day were offset by increased salaries and employee benefits expense and the impact from lower weight per shipment. During FY '17, we expect revenue, operating income and operating margin improvement at Freight, driven by continued effective yield management as well as modest volume growth from small and midsize customers. Freight earnings growth will also be positively impacted by improvement in productivity and further investments in technology.
We incurred a noncash pretax mark-to-market pension accounting loss of $1.5 billion in 2016. Due to its effect on income before income taxes, the adjustment for mark-to-market accounting reduced our 2016 effective tax rate by 120 basis points. Our effective tax rate was 33.6% in fiscal '16, which was also favorably impacted by an internal corporate restructuring done to facilitate the integration of FedEx Express and TNT and was offset by nondeductible costs incurred as part of the acquisition. For FY '17, we're anticipating making contributions totaling $1.1 billion to our U.S. pension plans.
In FY '16, we continued to buy back shares, repurchasing $2.7 billion of our common stock through open market purchases. From FY '14 through FY '16, we repurchased 63 million shares of FedEx common stock and returned more than $8.8 billion to shareholders at an average price of $140 per share. As of May 31, 2016, we had approximately 19 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase. A few weeks ago, we announced that we were boosting our dividend by 60% for a total of $0.40 per share per quarter.
Turning to our outlook. Based on the outlook that Mike described from an economic standpoint and the momentum we have, we project adjusted earnings to be $11.75 to $12.25 per diluted share for FY '17, excluding TNT financial results, including integration and financing costs and year-end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments.
Our expectations for earnings growth in FY '17 are dependent on key external factors, including fuel prices and global economic conditions. Due to our recent acquisition of TNT, FY '17 will be a year of intense integration activities for our dedicated team at Express. We are committed to the successful integration of these 2 great businesses. Meanwhile, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight will continue to be focused on achieving their goals, independent of the integration at Express.
Our capital expenditures are expected to be about $5.1 billion in FY '17, excluding TNT. We anticipate that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our increased capital expenditures in FY '17, which will include spending for network expansion at Ground, as I discussed, and the continued aircraft fleet modernization at Express. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we are well positioned to continue to increase corporate earnings, cash flows, returns and margins.
With that, we will open up for strategic questions."

And Mickey will be looking at the calls coming in, and",336,"Okay. This is Fred Smith speaking. Mickey asked me to take several of the questions that were sent to us in advance. There were 43. There may have been 1 or 2 others that have come in on the Internet. And Mickey will be looking at the calls coming in, and we'll try to answer as many of these as we can. There are a lot of questions in the 43 that were submitted that we won't address for one reason or another, and let me deal with those. 
One, there were a number about Brexit. The reality is we don't have any better crystal ball than anybody else, so we don't think it's appropriate for us to be speculating on what may happen in the United Kingdom. And should Brexit take place, obviously, we'll be telling folks what we intend to do to adjust to the new situation. But it's certainly premature.
Second, lots of questions on TNT. We'll take a number of them, but quite a few are focused on areas where it's just too early in the process for us to deal with. For instance, what are the implications of the South American road network of TNT and the Southeast Asian road network of TNT? And our regional presidents and the Express management are working through that with the integration team, so we're going to defer those until we get a little bit further along.
Third, there are a fair number that are hypotheticals about what new services we might offer, or adjacencies. And of course, that's not in our best interest to answer from a competitive standpoint. So now let me get to some of them that do hit the nail on the head.
With the acquisition of TNT, can you discuss major IT requirements going forward? Specifically, are the current systems robust enough for the combined entity? And are there any needs at the product service level? So I'm going to ask our great CIO, Rob Carter, to opine on this."

We've prepared diligently over the years with integrations of acquisitions in Mexico, Brazil, the U.K., Africa, India and others around the world to become really quite good at the process of integrating customers, integrating products into the mix. We also have been working very hard on our systems here at FedEx to modernize and simplify them in ways that really position them to be very effective at integration activities. So that's a key design point for the systems that we've been building and pushing forward. And then lastly, we've had a planning and execution team on the ground with the teams. We've done very robust planning with regard to these integrations, including what it would take on day 1, which was executed flawlessly; what our needs are at day 100; and then as we go forward, the preferred future state of the organization and the systems that will be needed to operate with the combined entity.

Let me make sure you understand that comment that was just made. There's nothing in that guidance pro or con from TNT. So obviously, we picked up the TNT revenues and whatever profitability they have plus the integration expenses. That's what I meant when I started early on by saying it's very early days with us, and we'll update this in September. But I will say one thing here, that it's obvious to me, looking at some of the questions and some of the reports that have been published. There's this sort of underlying theme that TNT is its own business and it's had these low margins and so that's going to go forward. The whole rationale of buying TNT, in fact, it's right in the middle of this whole e-commerce debate. In this business, the #1 item after the linehaul and upstream systems is delivery density, cost per stop, the number of stops per hour and so forth. So the 2 plus 2 equals 7 equation, so to speak, of us buying TNT is extraordinary. And that's why Alan says to you with such authority, as we integrate these PUD networks and take advantage of the unmatched surface networks with TNT, there's going to be a tremendous opportunity to increase the margins and earnings in the Express segment. So we know we're going to have about $200 million in integration expense. We can't tell you exactly when it is, but offsetting that are going to be the TNT revenues and the profitability of their existing business on a go-forward basis. So I hope that clarified it a bit.
Let me take another -- a couple or 3 of these Internet questions submitted in advance. David Vernon of Bernstein. How important are store replenishment activities in the FedEx portfolio of services as e-commerce takes share from traditional retail? Is there a risk that demand for any set of services falls off in a consequential manner? Mike and Henry, you want to comment on that?"

We know from research that the millennial generation, the largest generational cohort in American history, is not going to stop going to stores. In fact, we had a wonderful presentation about it just a couple of weeks ago at our board meeting. So e-commerce is fantastic, and it's going to continue to grow. And we intend to be a major player in that space. But as Mike just said, it's not going to, in our opinion and in the research from very credible sources, going to eliminate retail. What it may do is change the character of retail. And one of the things that you see happening are very focused, integrated product and store networks. Two that come to mind that are just fantastically successful are Zara, which is a company that's located in Spain and well known for its fast cycle, small shipment replenishment of its stores. They're able to turn on a dime with what's selling and move it around the world. And in Japan, a great company called UNIQLO that does the same sort of thing. So as these types of retail operations continue to proliferate, there'll be a fair amount of B2B business. And as Mike said, remember, of all retail, e-commerce is now about 10%, growing fast, taking share. But it's going to be a long time before retail is threatened. And B2B, meaning the underpinnings of the business world, medical, production, automotive and things like that, that in the main is not going to be diverted to e-commerce anytime soon. And that is the backbone of the FedEx networks.
Let me take one more here while we're queuing up another call. Demand for final-mile service by the USPS is outgrowing demand for traditional package services, driven in part by the popularity of SmartPost. Does FedEx see any risk or opportunities associated with the UPS -- USPS's ability to invest and keep pace with that demand? Mike, Henry, you want to take that one?"

And we intend to work on improving those over the next 24 months. So I think I've been in the financial markets, from a debt standpoint, a lot in the last couple of years. And we'll probably take a little break on that because as I said, we think -- well, we know we have the cash flow coverage for what we're trying to do. So going forward, we've always said we're a capital-intensive, growing transportation company. We think the sweet spot for CapEx is 6% to 8% of revenue. Next couple of years, we're going to be above that basically because we're re-fleeting, we're expanding Ground as rapidly as we can, as efficiently as we can, and we've got the TNT integration to put together. But having said that, it's very manageable what's in front of us. As I said, we are going to continue to increase earnings, cash flows, returns and margins. And we have been improving our ROICs, and we've been definitely improving our return on equity. But at the end of the day, that's not the most important metric. The most important metric is shareholder return. So over the last 5 years, we have had a share price return of 88%, which is a CAGR of a little bit over 14.1%. That compares to 53% for UPS, 63% for S&P 500 and 47.5% for the Dow Jones Transports. That's the number that's the most important for our shareholders, and the same goes for total return. And when I go back longer term, the last 15 years, our total return to shareholders had been 377.6%. UPS has been 170%. So while ROC and ROE -- ROIC and ROE are nice metrics, they don't win the ballgame."

On the SmartPost side, we're well along. We haven't integrated all the facilities yet, and that's largely due to the fact that the growth in that service has been such that we've been a little bit constrained by Ground capacity and being able to move more volume into the network. But the 2 big IT events, the first occurred in January, which allows us to begin manually matching addresses on packages and moving them into the Ground network for final delivery. And then the next big event will come next summer, where virtually we can have the system match addresses and move them. And as I've explained in the past, you move a SmartPost package into the Ground network, you can deliver that incremental package for roughly 25% of the postage as opposed to tendering it to the USPS.

It is. And I think it's important because there have been several things that have been printed about this, which indicate a lack of clarity out there about this. When Dave and his team did the deal with Boeing on the 767s, it called for 10 firm airplanes per year over a number of years to a total of 50. And then there were options with given dates. And these 6 aircraft were the first options that became due, and they are for delivery in fiscal year '19 and '20. The next options are not due until June of calendar year 2018, when Express will decide whether it wants to exercise a tranche of 6. And then the next one after that is June '19 with a tranche of 6. Basic deal is we have 10 firm airplanes per year and the ability to go up to 16 airplanes. Now it's a little more complicated than that in the outyears. But Dave, you want to add anything on this?"

The miles driven by FedEx Ground per year is 1.2 billon miles, and Freight's in the same capacity level. So these upstream moats are very substantial.

Problem there is that you cut yourself off from the tens of millions or billions of potential other shippers from every other part of the world that can be co-mingled to lower stop cost by having more stops per hour or more deliveries per stop. And that's the thing that we've been consistently saying. I used the word fantastic, although if you'll recall, because all of these analyses are either unmindful of that or they make assumptions that are erroneous when you actually understand what the real world numbers are. Let me just give you one statistic. I don't mean to impeach any one entity, but there have been several analyst reports that have come out and said, ""Well, 767 airplanes can carry 120,000 pounds."" And so the calculations are done on that. The maximum cubic revenue payload of a 767, and we're pretty damn good at this, is far less than 120,000 pounds. And if you load it up with just pallets, you're probably talking about 2/3 of that, if that. The airport locations to process these things and the containers, they're more difficult than the airplanes by far.

Welcome, everyone, to the discussion of our results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2016, a significant year for FedEx.
We announced some time ago we would complete the acquisition of TNT Express in the first half of calendar 2016, and we officially acquired the company on May 25. Greatly appreciate the outstanding work of our Express, finance and legal teams in getting this transaction completed without conditions.
Annual revenue exceeded $50 billion for the first time, and we're particularly pleased with our adjusted operating margin improvement of 1% year-over-year to 10% for fiscal year 2016 and our adjusted operating margin of 11.7% for the fourth quarter. We believe we will continue to increase margins, earnings per share, cash flows and capital returns over the next several years given expectations for moderate economic growth and excluding TNT financial results and pension mark-to-market costs.
I'd like to congratulate and thank all FedEx team members around the world for their dedication to our Purple Promise, which simply states, ""I will make every FedEx experience outstanding."" As we integrate the acquisitions of TNT, GENCO and FedEx CrossBorder, we'll continue making investments in modernizing the FedEx Express aircraft fleet and expanding the highly automated FedEx Ground network to extend our leadership in the rapidly growing e-commerce market. These initiatives are integral to achieving our goals.
Let me close with a few brief remarks regarding Friday's successful conclusion of the Internet pharmacy case. First, I'd like to thank our inside and outside counsel. They did an outstanding job representing our company. FedEx has always been innocent of these charges, which should never have been filed. We strongly believe that we should not admit to things we did not do and pay millions to avoid a criminal trial. FedEx delivered packages for licensed pharmacies registered by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Very few companies have done more during the last 4 decades to cooperate with law enforcement than FedEx, as was true in these matters, and we will continue to do so.
We're especially proud of the hundreds of thousands of FedEx team members worldwide, who demonstrate every day their commitment to provide our important services safely, reliably and at all times, ethically.
Now let me turn it over to Mike Glenn, who will comment on the economy and our revenue; followed by Alan Graf, who will discuss FedEx's financial performance. Mike?"

I'll open with our economic update and outlook, and then we'll discuss business performance in each of the segments. And then I'll have some commentary on broader business trends.On the economic front, we continue to see moderate growth in",1360,"Thanks, Fred. I'll open with our economic update and outlook, and then we'll discuss business performance in each of the segments. And then I'll have some commentary on broader business trends.
On the economic front, we continue to see moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP forecast is 1.8% for calendar '16, which is 40 basis points lower than our forecast last quarter. And we forecast 2.4% for calendar '17, led by gains in consumer spending. We expect industrial production to decline 0.6% in calendar '16, 120 basis points lower than last quarter, and increase 2.3% next year. Our global GDP forecast is 2.3% for calendar '16, 20 basis points below last quarter, and calls for 2.8% growth for calendar 2017.
Now I'll review revenue, volume and yield trends by segment. In the Express segment, U.S. domestic average daily package volume was essentially flat in the quarter due to the decline in the deferred product category. Yield per package increased approximately 1% year-over-year despite lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic package yield grew 2.3%, primarily due to rate and discounts. Revenue grew 2.1% year-over-year, driven by one more operating day and yield growth. Excluding the impact of the fuel surcharge, domestic revenue grew 3.7% year-over-year.
FedEx International Economy average daily volume grew 3.5%, while FedEx International Priority average daily volume declined 2.1%. International export revenue per package decreased 2.6% as lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable currency exchange rates negatively impacted the yields. Excluding fuel, international export express package yield was slightly positive, primarily driven by the positive impact of rate and discount changes, which outweighed the negative impact of exchange rates.
In the Ground segment, FedEx Ground revenue increased 20% in the quarter, driven by higher ground volume and yield and the recording of SmartPost revenues on a gross basis versus the previous net treatment. FedEx Ground average daily volume grew 10% year-over-year in Q4, primarily driven by continued growth after peak season for both residential and commercial deliveries. FedEx Ground revenue per package increased 7% year-over-year in Q4 due to the recording of FedEx SmartPost revenues on a gross basis and higher base rates, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, ground yield per package, including SmartPost, increased 8.6% year-over-year, driven primarily by extra service charges and weight per package, offsetting a decrease due to SmartPost volume mix.
FedEx Freight revenue increased 2.3% as average daily shipments increased 7.5% year-over-year and revenue per shipment declined 5.3% year-over-year.
As a reminder, Q4 in FY '16 contained one more business day than Q4 in FY '15. The continued strength in shipment volume is driven by our sales efforts with small and medium customers and reflects the speed, reliability and choice of priority and economy service for our LTL customers, and we also saw increased demand from our larger customers during the quarter. Revenue per LTL shipment declined due to lower fuel surcharge revenue and lower weight per package. Including the impact of fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per shipment was down 2.1% year-over-year due to lower weight per shipment.
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to further discuss and address the growth of e-commerce, which continues to outpace GDP growth, both in the U.S. and globally. E-commerce has become a way of life for consumers acquiring goods around the world, but the success of e-commerce continues to be dependent on transportation companies' ability to reliably and quickly make residential deliveries around the world. As we noted during our last conference call on earnings, more than 95% of e-commerce packages in the U.S. are delivered by FedEx, UPS and the United States Postal Service, with whom we have a strategic relationship to transport their priority mail. E-commerce would be impossible without these companies and our expansive networks. If you were to isolate the FedEx e-commerce business, it would become clear FedEx is one of the most profitable e-commerce companies in business today.
During the past quarter, we've made significant investments in expanding our global transportation portfolio and e-commerce capabilities around the world, including the acquisition of TNT, the introduction of FedEx Cross -- and the introduction of FedEx CrossBorder. The TNT acquisition will transform the global transportation and logistics industry. It is the largest acquisition in FedEx history and instantly accelerates our European and global growth strategy. FedEx now has a strong presence in Europe, with a range of transportation options from express to economy for both parcel and freight. This significant enhancement to our portfolio in Europe helps not only our customers in Europe, but also provides benefits for customers around the world shipping into Europe.
In addition, we will substantially enhance our capabilities globally by leveraging TNT's lower-cost road networks in different regions around the world. While the integration will take time to fully execute, we have the benefit of similar and complementary corporate cultures and a common mission of providing superior service and value to customers around the world.
FedEx CrossBorder offers e-commerce technology solutions that enables e-tailers to navigate common cross-border selling challenges such as regulatory compliance, secure payment processing, multiple currency pricing or credit card fraud protection and also offers access to e-commerce shoppers around the world. CrossBorder is the relaunch of Bongo International, a company FedEx acquired in 2014. When combined with our recent GENCO acquisition, we have significantly strengthened our e-commerce portfolio of services.
Of course, demand for e-commerce increases significantly each year during the peak holiday season, and we're deep into preparations for the upcoming 2016 peak season. We're closely collaborating with large e-tail and retail customers to understand their peak shipping needs, including geographic mix and package characteristics, so that we can once again have our resources positioned and ready to provide outstanding service.
We'll also be leveraging some new and evolving services to meet the heavy demand during peak, including FedEx Delivery Manager, FedEx SameDay and an expansion in FedEx Hold at Location services. Delivery Manager allows U.S. package recipients to customize home deliveries to fit their schedules, including changing the time and location of delivery, requesting a signature upon delivery or leaving instructions for the courier. FedEx SameDay City is available in 24 markets across the country, offering customers same-day service with uniformed FedEx drivers, branded vehicles, realtime tracking and world-renowned FedEx reliability. FedEx Hold at Location offers secure package pickup at more than 2,400 FedEx locations, including more than 1,800 FedEx Office retail stores. These hold services allow customers to redirect packages for pickup and drop-off at FedEx and many other third-party locations.
One additional point is we continue to get questions concerning Amazon and the evolution of their transportation capabilities and needs. Amazon continues to be a valuable customer, and they're among the large e-tailers that we stay in close dialogue with throughout the year to understand their transportation needs as they continue to experience significant growth and generate demand for FedEx transportation. Because of our close relationship with Amazon and close collaboration, we have a very clear and specific understanding of their needs across the FedEx portfolio during FY '17. And further, we expect them to be a significant customer for many years to come. Having said that, it is important to remember that no single FedEx customer represents more than approximately 3% of total revenue.
Finally, I'd like to mention the introduction of the new FedEx Freight box, which makes transporting less-than-truckload shipments simple with improved flexibility, increased security, better shipment integrity and best of all, no freight classification. The FedEx Freight box comes in 2 sizes, a standard freight box that requires a pallet to ship and a smaller freight box with an integrated pallet. The freedom to choose your freight box makes freight shipping accessible for any business, no matter the size. With a distance-based pricing structure, the FedEx Freight box allows you to ship LTL, avoiding the complex and antiquated pricing structure used in the industry. The Freight box was introduced in selected markets with great success during the second half of FY '16 and is rolling out to customers nationwide this month.
And now I'll turn it over to Alan Graf."
124423,313824656,1001566,"FedEx Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 21, 2016",2016-06-21,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike, for your very informative comments, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter. Adjusted earnings of $3.30 per diluted share increased 24% year-over-year, and our adjusted consolidated operating margin increased 11.7% versus 10.5%",1324,"Thanks, Mike, for your very informative comments, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter. Adjusted earnings of $3.30 per diluted share increased 24% year-over-year, and our adjusted consolidated operating margin increased 11.7% versus 10.5% last year.
Among the operating companies, Express was the most valuable player of the quarter, posting an impressive double, double. Operating income was 27% higher versus last year's adjusted income, and operating margin climbed to 11.3%. Operating income grew at Ground as average daily volume increased 10%, and Freight's operating income was unchanged.
And profit growth at Express, despite essentially flat revenue for Q4 year-over-year, is a strong testament to Express' continued yield and cost management efforts. Yield did have a positive impact year-over-year on the quarter, while currency exchange rate changes have little net impact. One additional operating day also provided a benefit.
We expect Express operating income at FY '17 to continue to improve as we manage network capacity to match customer demand, reduce structural costs, modernize our fleet and drive productivity increases throughout our U.S. and international operations. These benefits will be partially offset due to timing of aircraft maintenance events and one fewer operating day.
The capper on our remarkable year was the acquisition of TNT Express. We had a seamless and very successful first day when we acquired TNT on May 25, a few days before our fiscal year-end. Today is our 28th day of owning TNT. We have a solid integration plan that we are in process of validating with live data. Our senior leadership team is in place, and we are partnering together in the marketplace for commercial opportunities to bring the best solutions for our customers.
The transaction, financing and integration plan expenses related to this acquisition were $132 million or $0.45 per diluted share in FY '16, which considers certain nontax deductible costs as a result of the closing of the acquisition. These expenses include TNT's operating results from the time of acquisition and are predominantly included in corporate eliminations and others in FY '16.
In FY '17, we will report the operating results for FedEx Express and TNT separately in 2 different segments. We will also provide an overview of the FedEx Express group, which combines the 2 segments.
Given the timing and complexity of the acquisition, presentation of TNT on our financial statements, including the allocation of the purchase price, is preliminary and will likely change in future periods. We plan to complete our purchase price allocation no later than the fourth quarter of FY '17.
TNT operates road transportation networks and delivers documents, parcels and freight to over 200 countries. This strategic acquisition broadens our portfolio of international transportation solutions with the combined strength of TNT's strong European road platform and our strength in other regions globally, including North America and Asia.
Prior to our acquisition, TNT announced its outlook strategy aimed at doubling its adjusted operating income and margin percentage by 2018. That profit improvement program includes various initiatives focused on yield management, operational efficiency and productivity and customer service. We plan to continue these profit improvement initiatives in FY '17, and we'll also begin activities to integrate operations. Our focus will be on combining TNT's strong European capabilities with our strength in other regions globally.
Although we are in the very beginning of the integration process and are continuing to validate our information, we currently expect our FY '17 integration CapEx for TNT to be about $100 million and integration costs to be around $200 million. However, the timing and amount of these costs is subject to change as our plans are refined. Integration expenses, including professional fees, information technology costs and intangible asset amortization related to TNT, are expected to impact operating income and margin during FY '17.
We are very excited about the TNT acquisition, and we'll provide you updates on the operating results and integration costs on a quarterly basis going forward. We do expect TNT to be accretive to earnings in FY '18.
Turning to our Ground segment. Operating income grew year-over-year due to higher volumes and increased revenue per package as well as the benefit of one additional operating day. These factors were partially offset by higher operating costs, including network expansion expenses. Operating margin was lower due to the change in SmartPost revenue reporting.
We expect Ground revenues and operating income to increase in FY '17, driven by e-commerce volume growth and market share gains. We also anticipate continued yield growth through the yield management programs, including changes to our pricing for larger shipments. However, we anticipate Ground operating margin will be negatively impacted by higher operating costs in FY '17, driven again by network expansion. Other operational costs may also impact margins as residential volumes grow from e-commerce.
Capital expenditures at Ground are expected to be about $2 billion in FY '17 as we continue to make investments to grow our highly profitable network through facility expansions and equipment purchases. The impact of the depreciation of these investments will continue to partly offset earnings growth in FY '17 at Ground.
At Freight, operating income was unchanged as improved operating efficiencies, higher revenue and an additional operating day were offset by increased salaries and employee benefits expense and the impact from lower weight per shipment. During FY '17, we expect revenue, operating income and operating margin improvement at Freight, driven by continued effective yield management as well as modest volume growth from small and midsize customers. Freight earnings growth will also be positively impacted by improvement in productivity and further investments in technology.
We incurred a noncash pretax mark-to-market pension accounting loss of $1.5 billion in 2016. Due to its effect on income before income taxes, the adjustment for mark-to-market accounting reduced our 2016 effective tax rate by 120 basis points. Our effective tax rate was 33.6% in fiscal '16, which was also favorably impacted by an internal corporate restructuring done to facilitate the integration of FedEx Express and TNT and was offset by nondeductible costs incurred as part of the acquisition. For FY '17, we're anticipating making contributions totaling $1.1 billion to our U.S. pension plans.
In FY '16, we continued to buy back shares, repurchasing $2.7 billion of our common stock through open market purchases. From FY '14 through FY '16, we repurchased 63 million shares of FedEx common stock and returned more than $8.8 billion to shareholders at an average price of $140 per share. As of May 31, 2016, we had approximately 19 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase. A few weeks ago, we announced that we were boosting our dividend by 60% for a total of $0.40 per share per quarter.
Turning to our outlook. Based on the outlook that Mike described from an economic standpoint and the momentum we have, we project adjusted earnings to be $11.75 to $12.25 per diluted share for FY '17, excluding TNT financial results, including integration and financing costs and year-end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments.
Our expectations for earnings growth in FY '17 are dependent on key external factors, including fuel prices and global economic conditions. Due to our recent acquisition of TNT, FY '17 will be a year of intense integration activities for our dedicated team at Express. We are committed to the successful integration of these 2 great businesses. Meanwhile, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight will continue to be focused on achieving their goals, independent of the integration at Express.
Our capital expenditures are expected to be about $5.1 billion in FY '17, excluding TNT. We anticipate that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our increased capital expenditures in FY '17, which will include spending for network expansion at Ground, as I discussed, and the continued aircraft fleet modernization at Express. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we are well positioned to continue to increase corporate earnings, cash flows, returns and margins.
With that, we will open up for strategic questions."

There may have been 1 or 2 others that have come in on the Internet. And Mickey will be looking at the calls coming in, and we'll try to answer as many of these as we can. There are a lot of questions in the 43 that were submitted that we won't address for one reason or another, and let me deal with those. 
One, there were a number about Brexit. The reality is we don't have any better crystal ball than anybody else, so we don't think it's appropriate for us to be speculating on what may happen in the United Kingdom. And should Brexit take place, obviously, we'll be telling folks what we intend to do to adjust to the new situation. But it's certainly premature.
Second, lots of questions on TNT. We'll take a number of them, but quite a few are focused on areas where it's just too early in the process for us to deal with. For instance, what are the implications of the South American road network of TNT and the Southeast Asian road network of TNT? And our regional presidents and the Express management are working through that with the integration team, so we're going to defer those until we get a little bit further along.
Third, there are a fair number that are hypotheticals about what new services we might offer, or adjacencies. And of course, that's not in our best interest to answer from a competitive standpoint. So now let me get to some of them that do hit the nail on the head.
With the acquisition of TNT, can you discuss major IT requirements going forward? Specifically, are the current systems robust enough for the combined entity? And are there any needs at the product service level? So I'm going to ask our great CIO, Rob Carter, to opine on this."

We've prepared diligently over the years with integrations of acquisitions in Mexico, Brazil, the U.K., Africa, India and others around the world to become really quite good at the process of integrating customers, integrating products into the mix. We also have been working very hard on our systems here at FedEx to modernize and simplify them in ways that really position them to be very effective at integration activities. So that's a key design point for the systems that we've been building and pushing forward. And then lastly, we've had a planning and execution team on the ground with the teams. We've done very robust planning with regard to these integrations, including what it would take on day 1, which was executed flawlessly; what our needs are at day 100; and then as we go forward, the preferred future state of the organization and the systems that will be needed to operate with the combined entity.

I already knew that their culture lined up with our culture. I was over there on day 1 for the integration 28 days ago. And I can tell you that they're excited and we're excited. So going forward, you're going to have the integration take place that needs to take place so that we make sure we do it right, and when we come out of the integration process, we have the most powerful service, cultural for people and profitable business that you can have over there in Europe.

Let me make sure you understand that comment that was just made. There's nothing in that guidance pro or con from TNT. So obviously, we picked up the TNT revenues and whatever profitability they have plus the integration expenses. That's what I meant when I started early on by saying it's very early days with us, and we'll update this in September. But I will say one thing here, that it's obvious to me, looking at some of the questions and some of the reports that have been published. There's this sort of underlying theme that TNT is its own business and it's had these low margins and so that's going to go forward. The whole rationale of buying TNT, in fact, it's right in the middle of this whole e-commerce debate. In this business, the #1 item after the linehaul and upstream systems is delivery density, cost per stop, the number of stops per hour and so forth. So the 2 plus 2 equals 7 equation, so to speak, of us buying TNT is extraordinary. And that's why Alan says to you with such authority, as we integrate these PUD networks and take advantage of the unmatched surface networks with TNT, there's going to be a tremendous opportunity to increase the margins and earnings in the Express segment. So we know we're going to have about $200 million in integration expense. We can't tell you exactly when it is, but offsetting that are going to be the TNT revenues and the profitability of their existing business on a go-forward basis. So I hope that clarified it a bit.
Let me take another -- a couple or 3 of these Internet questions submitted in advance. David Vernon of Bernstein. How important are store replenishment activities in the FedEx portfolio of services as e-commerce takes share from traditional retail? Is there a risk that demand for any set of services falls off in a consequential manner? Mike and Henry, you want to comment on that?"

We know from research that the millennial generation, the largest generational cohort in American history, is not going to stop going to stores. In fact, we had a wonderful presentation about it just a couple of weeks ago at our board meeting. So e-commerce is fantastic, and it's going to continue to grow. And we intend to be a major player in that space. But as Mike just said, it's not going to, in our opinion and in the research from very credible sources, going to eliminate retail. What it may do is change the character of retail. And one of the things that you see happening are very focused, integrated product and store networks. Two that come to mind that are just fantastically successful are Zara, which is a company that's located in Spain and well known for its fast cycle, small shipment replenishment of its stores. They're able to turn on a dime with what's selling and move it around the world. And in Japan, a great company called UNIQLO that does the same sort of thing. So as these types of retail operations continue to proliferate, there'll be a fair amount of B2B business. And as Mike said, remember, of all retail, e-commerce is now about 10%, growing fast, taking share. But it's going to be a long time before retail is threatened. And B2B, meaning the underpinnings of the business world, medical, production, automotive and things like that, that in the main is not going to be diverted to e-commerce anytime soon. And that is the backbone of the FedEx networks.
Let me take one more here while we're queuing up another call. Demand for final-mile service by the USPS is outgrowing demand for traditional package services, driven in part by the popularity of SmartPost. Does FedEx see any risk or opportunities associated with the UPS -- USPS's ability to invest and keep pace with that demand? Mike, Henry, you want to take that one?"

And we intend to work on improving those over the next 24 months. So I think I've been in the financial markets, from a debt standpoint, a lot in the last couple of years. And we'll probably take a little break on that because as I said, we think -- well, we know we have the cash flow coverage for what we're trying to do. So going forward, we've always said we're a capital-intensive, growing transportation company. We think the sweet spot for CapEx is 6% to 8% of revenue. Next couple of years, we're going to be above that basically because we're re-fleeting, we're expanding Ground as rapidly as we can, as efficiently as we can, and we've got the TNT integration to put together. But having said that, it's very manageable what's in front of us. As I said, we are going to continue to increase earnings, cash flows, returns and margins. And we have been improving our ROICs, and we've been definitely improving our return on equity. But at the end of the day, that's not the most important metric. The most important metric is shareholder return. So over the last 5 years, we have had a share price return of 88%, which is a CAGR of a little bit over 14.1%. That compares to 53% for UPS, 63% for S&P 500 and 47.5% for the Dow Jones Transports. That's the number that's the most important for our shareholders, and the same goes for total return. And when I go back longer term, the last 15 years, our total return to shareholders had been 377.6%. UPS has been 170%. So while ROC and ROE -- ROIC and ROE are nice metrics, they don't win the ballgame."

On the SmartPost side, we're well along. We haven't integrated all the facilities yet, and that's largely due to the fact that the growth in that service has been such that we've been a little bit constrained by Ground capacity and being able to move more volume into the network. But the 2 big IT events, the first occurred in January, which allows us to begin manually matching addresses on packages and moving them into the Ground network for final delivery. And then the next big event will come next summer, where virtually we can have the system match addresses and move them. And as I've explained in the past, you move a SmartPost package into the Ground network, you can deliver that incremental package for roughly 25% of the postage as opposed to tendering it to the USPS. So we're pretty excited about that. We're looking forward to getting this thing behind us."

But the way to deal with that is to negotiate with China and not to threaten them or take all of the huge benefits of trade and throw them away. We have thousands and tens of thousands of highly compensated people working for FedEx in the United States that are involved in trade: pilots, mechanics, customs clearance people, pickup and delivery personnel. That's the story that never gets told when the tragedy of a local plant closing gets put on the TV.

It is. And I think it's important because there have been several things that have been printed about this, which indicate a lack of clarity out there about this. When Dave and his team did the deal with Boeing on the 767s, it called for 10 firm airplanes per year over a number of years to a total of 50. And then there were options with given dates. And these 6 aircraft were the first options that became due, and they are for delivery in fiscal year '19 and '20. The next options are not due until June of calendar year 2018, when Express will decide whether it wants to exercise a tranche of 6. And then the next one after that is June '19 with a tranche of 6. Basic deal is we have 10 firm airplanes per year and the ability to go up to 16 airplanes. Now it's a little more complicated than that in the outyears. But Dave, you want to add anything on this?"

The miles driven by FedEx Ground per year is 1.2 billon miles, and Freight's in the same capacity level. So these upstream moats are very substantial. And actually, the last mile is the easiest thing to do if you don't have any upstream infrastructure. Problem there is that you cut yourself off from the tens of millions or billions of potential other shippers from every other part of the world that can be co-mingled to lower stop cost by having more stops per hour or more deliveries per stop. And that's the thing that we've been consistently saying. I used the word fantastic, although if you'll recall, because all of these analyses are either unmindful of that or they make assumptions that are erroneous when you actually understand what the real world numbers are. Let me just give you one statistic. I don't mean to impeach any one entity, but there have been several analyst reports that have come out and said, ""Well, 767 airplanes can carry 120,000 pounds."" And so the calculations are done on that. The maximum cubic revenue payload of a 767, and we're pretty damn good at this, is far less than 120,000 pounds. And if you load it up with just pallets, you're probably talking about 2/3 of that, if that.

Welcome to our discussion of results for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Managing our operating companies as a portfolio of solutions helped FedEx achieve strong financial and operating results in the quarter, especially given the global economy's continued low growth. Mike Glenn will offer a more detailed look at economic conditions in FedEx's revenue growth later in today's call. 
We expect FY '17 revenue and earnings to increase, driven by volume growth and improved ratios at all our core transportation companies. The integration of TNT Express, which includes more than 200 countries, is proceeding smoothly and on schedule. The level of team members engagement is outstanding and very much appreciated. More than 20 teams are working in operations, customer solutions, personnel, IT, finance, legal, security and other areas to positively transform FedEx and TNT into a seamless worldwide operation.

I'll open with an economic update and outlook and then discuss our performance and business conditions in each segment including revenue, volume and yield; and provide some commentary from broader industry trends and our plans to what is expected to be another record-breaking holiday shopping season.
On the economic front, we see moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP growth forecast is 1.6% for calendar '16, 20 basis points lower than our last forecast in the last quarter; and 2.3% for calendar '17, led by gains in consumer's amending. Our global GDP growth forecast is 2.2% for calendar '16, 10 basis points below last quarter; and 2.6% for calendar '17. We expect industrial production to decline 0.7% in calendar '16, 10 basis points lower than last quarter and increase 2.2% next year.
Now I'll review revenue volume and yield trends by segment. U.S. domestic Express package revenue grew 3% in Q1, driven by growth in both volume and yield. Excluding the impact of fuel, Domestic Express revenue grew 3.8% year-over-year. Package volume grew 1% year-over-year in the quarter, driven by strong overnight volume growth. Yield per package increased 1% year-over-year despite lower fuel surcharges. Including the impact of fuel, year-over-year express domestic package yield grew 2.5%, primarily due to rating discount.
FedEx International Express package revenue decreased 1% year-over-year in Q1, but increased to 1% if you exclude the impact of fuel. FedEx International Priority volume decreased to 1% while International Economy volume grew 1%. International export package yield decreased 1%. If you exclude the impact of fuel, international export package yield increased 1.4%, primarily driven by a positive -- by the positive impact of rate discount changes, which outweighed the negative impact of exchange rates.
FedEx Ground revenue increased 12% year-over-year in Q1 and increased 12.6% if you exclude the impact of fuel. This growth was driven by higher Ground volume and yield. FedEx Ground [indiscernible] volume grew 10% year-over-year in Q1, driven by robust growth in both residential and commercial segments. FedEx Ground package yield increased 2% year-over-year in Q1. If you'll exclude the impact of fuel, FedEx Ground yield per package increased 3% year-over-year, driven by yield improvements in both ground and SmartPost segments.
FedEx Ground continues to gain revenue market share. In fact, through the end of calendar year 2015, FedEx Ground has gained revenue market share for 17 consecutive years, and we are tracking to continue that trend and make it 18 years through the first half of this calendar year.
FedEx Freight revenue increased 4% in Q1 and 5.4%, excluding the impact of fuel. Average daily shipments increased 8% year-over-year. The continued strength in shipment volume is driven by our outstanding sales efforts with small and medium customers; and reflects the speed, reliability and choice of priority and economy service for our LTL customers. We also saw increased demand from larger customers during the quarter.
Revenue per LTL shipment declined 4% in Q1 due to lower fuel surcharge revenue and lower weight per shipment. Excluding the impact of the fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per shipment was down 1.7%.
I'd now like to spend a few minutes discussing industry dynamics including pricing changes in the upcoming peak holiday season. As announced yesterday, we'll be raising rates effective January 2, 2017. FedEx Express rates will increase by an average of 3.9%. Rates for FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight will increase by an average of 4.9%.
We will also change the dimensional weight advisor for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground from 166 to 139. Our dimensional weight advisor for U.S. domestic and international packages will now be the same after the change is implemented. Beginning in February, we will also be updating the FedEx Express and Ground fuel surcharges weekly as we do with FedEx Freight today. There will be no changes to the fuel surcharge stables. Details of all changes to rates and surcharges are available at fedex.com/rates2017 [ph]. 
We're deep into planning for what is expected to be another record peak holiday shipping season. The rapid growth of e-commerce has driven significant shifts in demand over the last several years. Last year, we experienced 15% growth in peak season volume and delivered more than 325 million packages. Beyond just the dramatic rise in volumes, there are several other shifting industry dynamics. Holiday promotions and buying patterns have increasingly shifted, which has resulted in heavy demand for package delivery on Mondays during peak -- during the peak. The intensity for demand on Monday has accelerated in recent years as more and more retail locations have started serving as fulfillment centers for e-commerce orders. We expect each of the 4 Mondays during the upcoming peak period to be among the busiest in our company's history.
We have also experienced increased demand for transportation of larger and heavier packages. As e-commerce grows, there's demand for online ordering and delivery of everything from large screen TVs to mattresses and trampolines. We've engineered our networks' exportation and delivery capacities for these larger packages, including entire temporary facilities dedicated to the sortation of oversized packages, which will be critically important this upcoming peak season. Beyond oversized packages, we will continue to make investments in technology and facilities that allow us to handle this year-round growth in demand. We've added to what is already the industry's most technologically advanced transportation and delivery network with additional automation and new facilities. In fact, we've added [ph] 19 automated stations and 4 major distribution centers to FedEx Ground since the peak season last year alone. We've also added more reliable and efficient aircraft to the FedEx Express fleet over the last year. And while the advanced automation provides us a competitive advantage in sortation and speed, the key to our success during the peak continues to be our people.
Across the FedEx portfolio, we expect to once again add more than 50,000 seasonal positions to help the holidays arrive. Based upon growth expectations and network expansion, many of these seasonal team members will have an opportunity for full-time work in FedEx after the holidays. These investments in people, facilities, aircraft and technology are all made to enable us to provide outstanding service even during the busiest days of the year.
As a further commitment to delivering outstanding service and in recognition of Christmas falling on Sunday this year, we've adjusted some service commitments for shipments tendered the week of Christmas. FedEx Express will be delivering on Saturday, December 24, Christmas Eve, that is not a service day for FedEx Ground. FedEx Hold at Location's is also a delivery locations for customers on Christmas Eve. All service adjustments have already been communicated to customers as part of an extensive planning and collaboration effort to meet customer needs and enable outstanding service across the FedEx portfolio throughout peak.
And now, I'll turn it over to Alan Graf."

The FedEx Corporation adjusted EPS climbed 20% to [ph] $2.90 per share. Revenues increased 19% to $14.7 billion with the addition of TNT Express.
Consolidated adjusted operating margin was 9.3%. We continue to increase profits while investing in the business. First quarter results improved due to higher operating income at Express, for base shield improved and expense growth was constrained and at Ground where volume and yield grew. Offsetting factors include a higher network expansion costs at Ground. These adjusted numbers exclude the integration and restructuring program costs and intangible asset amortization of TNT Express.
Ground volume continued to grow. Segment operating income increased 14% and margin increased to 14.2%, due to volume and yield growth and lower self-insurance costs. Headwinds included higher operational costs due to network expansion and higher purchased transportation rates.
Comparisons were easier due to higher self-insurance reserves last year. We aren't expecting net benefit to continue, and comparisons for the rest of the year are expected to be more difficult. Ground business continues to grow nicely, driven in large part by e-commerce. We believe continued strategic investments will position Ground for long-term profitable growth by increasing capacity and efficiency to better meet the dynamic needs of our customers. Investments include continued network expansion; integration of commercial and residential networks, including SmartPost; completing transition of our pickup and delivery service providers through a single operating model who have service capacity and operational flexibility; incentives for our small business partners to equip their vehicles to improve safety technology.
Freight's operating income increased 2%, primarily due to higher volumes and a favorable comparison as a result of a charge for facility closure. These benefits were mostly offset by lower LTL revenue per shipment, also drove a small decline in operating margin. Freight continues to face a difficult macro environment and is working hard to manage costs and increase yields.
Express frankly knocked the ball out of park in Q1. Adjusted operating income was up 19%, and adjusted operating margin grew 140 basis points to 9.7%. Adding to the bottom line at Express were base yield improvement, volume growth and cost management efforts. In addition to its day job, [indiscernible] was busy integrating TNT. As a result, integration expenses of $22 million are included in the GAAP results for the FedEx Express segment. FedEx Express continues to manage network capacity to match customer demand, reduce structural costs, modernize its air fleet and drive continued productivity increases.
Beginning this quarter, we are reporting the operating results for FedEx Express and TNT in different segments. In our 10-Q, we will provide an overview of the FedEx Express Group, which is comprised of the 2 segments I just mentioned. Presentation of TNT in our financial statements, including purchase price allocation, is preliminary and will likely change in future periods, perhaps significantly, given the timing and complexity of the acquisition. We plan to complete our purchase price allocation no later than the fourth quarter of FY '17. We believe the TNT acquisition, the largest acquisition in FedEx history, transformed the world's transportation logistics industry, rapidly accelerating our European and global growth strategy as 1/3 of total FedEx Corporation revenue now touches a country outside of the United States.
We have a rich history of success in integrating businesses into FedEx, and we are doubling down our commitment to the TNT integration in terms of our people and financial resources.
TNT's 56,000 team members deliver 1 million packages daily in over 200 countries. TNT's European road network connects more than 40 countries through 19 road hubs over 540 depots and will substantially enhance our global footprint by leveraging TNT's lower-cost road networks in Europe and in the Middle East, in Asia as well.
FedEx now has a strong presence in Europe, transportation options from Express to economy, parcel and freight, helping not only our customers in Europe, but also around the world shipping into Europe. We have similar and complementary corporate cultures and a common history of superior service and value to customers.
We had a seamless and very successful first day when we acquired TNT on May 25. Today is our 119th day of ownership of TNT. Prior to the close of the transaction, we invested about a year building an integration plan, and we are well positioned for success. Our new senior leadership team is established, and all key TNT activities and responsibilities have transitioned to the integrated FedEx senior officer team. Hundreds of town halls have occurred across the enterprise in operations, sales, marketing and other back-office functions.
We have strong talent within the TNT legacy organization. The team members across both organizations are energized about the combination. We also have strong cultural alignment across the teams with a focus on our People-Service-Profit philosophy. We expect the integration to take 4 years and significant investments in people, capital and expense. These are network businesses and require a combination of our pickup and delivery operations at a local level for our stations and depots, our ground and air networks and our extensive operational clearance, sales and back-office IT systems. The IT investments that will be required are significant given the limited investment in IT at TNT over the last decade. This is also a key enabler of the integration and its benefits.
We are bringing together the activities of team members across the globe. These activities and the pace are balanced against continuing to deliver world-class customer experience, drive returns for our shareholders.
Prior to acquisition, TNT announced its outlook strategy to double its adjusted operating income and margin percentage by 2018. That profit improvement program includes various initiatives focused on yield management, operational efficiency and productivity as well as customer service. We are focusing on the initiatives and projects with an outlook to deliver the greatest benefits balance with our 4-year integration plan.
We are projecting TNT to be dilutive on a GAAP basis in FY '17 due to integration expenses, outlook restructuring expenses and non-cash intangible asset amortization. On an as adjusted basis, including non-cash intangible asset amortization, integration expenses and outlook expenses, we expect TNT to be accretive in FY '17, as the TNT outlook restructuring program already started to lower costs.
We have seen almost immediate benefits as we begin the integration. In the U.S. and Canada, we are transitioning TNT's volume, formerly handed by third-party carriers into the FedEx portfolio. In late September, we will begin consolidating depots, and we'll begin transitioning customers in October. We will complete the U.S. and Canada transition by the end of fiscal year '17. In addition, we have realized procurement and sourcing benefits transition for with TNT's third-party, delivery partners into the FedEx direct served operation or move to a single third-party provider. And we'll launch our initial injection of FedEx volume in to 5 select TNT European road network wings later in September. We're off to a very solid start.
We see the combination of these 2 businesses as transformative and expect significant synergies from the integration. We would drive value from 4 key areas: Optimized pickup and delivery operations and integrated global express network; improved efficiency of staff functions and processes and revenue growth; plan to optimize pickup and delivery operations by implementing new technology and processes, optimizing the locations of facilities and stations without impacting service; and benefiting from the new pick-up delivery efficiencies globally [indiscernible] utilized at lower costs the integrated pick-up and delivery network to achieve greater economies of scale. We plan to form 1 Global Express network by developing integrated solutions to track and route parcels and freight and fullly integrating our intercontinental air network. We will have 1 Global Express air network with an optimized linehaul and hub strategy that will deliver the best service to our customers and significantly will improve our costs. We plan to improve the efficiency of our staff functions and processes by optimizing our systems and processes including IT, innovating, transforming and streamlining key support functions such as human resources, legal, security and finance, achieving meaningful sourcing savings, lowering our effective tax rate over the long-term as synergies will drive additional international profits, tax that lower rates, and greater efficiency will lead to greater cost savings.
We will grow revenue with a best-in-class service portfolio with 1 sales team, single online tool for customer inquiries and invoices; revenue management activities that optimize yield, improve market share and increase profitability. As a result, customers will have access to a broader portfolio of services and will see value proposition improvements. We remain supremely confident in our initial views of the value of this acquisition and are targeting to exit the end of the 4-year integration with annual synergies of $750 million.
Similar to our recently completed and successful profit improvement plan at Express, we do not believe that it's meaningful to give initial year-by-year guidance. The integration is complex, and the timing of integration restructuring expenses beyond fiscal year '17 are not yet crystallized. However, we'll ultimately get to our target will evolve as market conditions and other factors change. We are highly confident in our target and our goals.
We currently expect the aggregate integrated program expense over the 4 years to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. Timing and amount of these integration-related estimates are subject to change as we implement and adjust our plans as necessary. In FY '18, TNT will be accretive, including integration and restructuring costs.
Turning to our corporate outlook. Based on the moderate economic forecasts that Mike discussed and the momentum we have, we project adjusted earnings to be $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share for FY '17, which excludes TNT integration, outlook restructuring costs, TNT intangible asset amortization and year-end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments.
We are estimating combined TNT integration and outlook restructuring expenses of about $275 million and TNT-related intangible asset amortization about $115 [ph] million for FY '17. We'll expect our FY '17 integration CapEx for TNT to be about $100 million. [indiscernible] and timing and amount of this integration-related estimates are subject to change as plans are refined. Meanwhile, Ground in freight will continue to be focused on achieving their goals independent of the integration at Express.
Our total capital expenditures forecast remains at $5.6 billion in FY '17, including TNT. We anticipate that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our increased capital expenditures in FY '17, which will include spending for network expansion at Ground to support e-commerce growth and the continued aircraft fleet modernization at Express, which continues to lower our costs. Longer term, we will target CapEx 6% to 8% of revenues.
Our balance sheet remains strong, and we are well positioned to continue to increase corporate earnings, dividends, cash flows, returns and margins.
Now we look forward to answering your strategic questions. I will turn it back over to Fred."

What is the benefit of having the road Freight LTL/grew podge business in addition to the package business? I presume this talks about TNT in Europe. Why it ultimately will just be a small package network in Europe? So let me give you sort of a broad answer and then ask Mike and Dave Bronzack [ph] to jump in with any details they like to add. 
First of all, I'm not sure this is known as well as it should be that FedEx Express carries both pallets or Express freight and packages and package. And we are the market leader in the United States with our Express freight. There are 3 services: Overnight, 2 day and then 2 to 3 days, and that is very profitable service and we have different pickup and delivery vehicles optimized for Express Freight and obviously we have our package delivery vans in the Express network, mostly the sprinter sized vans. And those 2 streams of traffic come together at our airport and hub locations where the pallets are sorted in 1 area and the packages in other and then they're joined together for the linehaul. So TNT is very similar in Europe to the way FedEx is organized in the United States that I just mentioned to you. They have terminals, which have pallet sortation facilities in 1 end, package sortations in the other. The main difference is they have had vehicles which do both pallets and larger business-to-business package deliveries. The attraction of TNT was manyfold, but I have to tell you that one of the key attractions was their unduplicated Express freight network in Europe. And of course, Europe is a high density of population and the ability to move these pallets very fast throughout Western Europe was a tremendous advantage. Now we have a very extensive Express freight capabilities in Brazil, Middle East, Southeast Asia and many other places around the world. So we will definitely continue in the Express freight and the package business in the Express segment. Now let me hasten to add that our Express freight business is very different than Mike Ducker's FedEx Freight unit. The average weight per shipment is almost 4x, the nature of the commodities is quite different, the pricing is quite different and so forth. Similarly, Henry Mayor's FedEx Ground is quite different than FedEx Express' parcel operations. And in Europe, there is a very distinct ground parcel sector where there are a number of competitors, but TNT's aggregate pallets and package business mainly in Europe but around the world was a very attractive feature of that company, which led us to have an interest in buying them, and we will very much continuing to provide international product priority Freight and International Economy freight and intra-European freight and in those other areas and regions I mentioned to you. Mike?"

It's around the world, the same in Dubai, the same Hong Kong, the same Brazil around the world One. Of the big advantages of TNT, and Fred's right, that goes unnoticed is their ability to handle a very profitable freight and that's a part of their business that now we're going to put into our global network of parcels and pallets and it's been very successful for us and it's a nice part of the business that we added with TNT. It's also part of what we actually viewed when we went to Australia just a month ago. Fred Smith and I went to visit our colleagues in Australia TNT and our FedEx Express folks in Australia. The combination down there could be very, very powerful for us. We're looking at a way to make that whole marketplace much more successful, much more profitable, and it gives us an opportunity now to leverage 1 with the other that we didn't have in the past. So to Fred's point, it's a great part of TNT's new business. It's now part of the FedEx business."

Henry and FedEx Ground are real leaders in this regard. In terms of UAVs, in particular, we have 5 separate [indiscernible] would be not be fair to call all them projects but work streams or projects in both aviation and automated vehicles. The difference with us and a lot of other people, we just prefer to keep working those issues and tell you about them when they make a meaningful difference in the company. I will say this much, I think our philosophy, and we know a lot about these technologies. After all, our autopilots in our 777 airplanes are among the most sophisticated robots in the world. They can take off, land the plane and taxi to the gate and turn themselves off if that's what chose to do so. But it's very difficult in the foreseeable future to substitute for the well-trained pilot or driver or person, and we look at the use of automation more as an opportunity to improve the productivity of those types of experts within our system to make the job more comfortable and easy, and above all, to increase safety. So those 5 work streams are underway. You'll hear a lot about them, I'm confident, in the next years. But important in our philosophy, maybe slightly different than a lot of other people, that I think the right over the horizon, everything is going to be an automated vehicle or some sort of UAV, we think that is unlikely. And that this technology, like most technology, particularly aviation technology, will evolve incrementally over time with a great emphasis on safety first. So that's our UAV update.

I think we get criticized a lot about our capital expenditures, but they all carry very solid long-term return on invested capital. We wouldn't be doing them. And then lastly, although we've got a lot of debt, I should tell you that the average coupon on that is 3.6%. So every project that we're doing is going to be earning way more than that on an annual basis. So our credit metrics are good. We've committed to improving our credit metrics like we'll continue to buy back stock, raise dividends and invest in our businesses going forward because we can and we're going to manage it accordingly."

There are a couple of questions in here from Tom Wadewitz of UBS and Allison Landry, essentially about density, improving density levels and the issue of SmartPost deliveries by FedEx Ground and FedEx SmartPost. So let me just make one comment here",452,"Okay. There are a couple of questions in here from Tom Wadewitz of UBS and Allison Landry, essentially about density, improving density levels and the issue of SmartPost deliveries by FedEx Ground and FedEx SmartPost. So let me just make one comment here and then ask Henry to talk about. I have said this over and over again for the last couple of years. There is a continuing misunderstanding of the issue of route densities, revenue per stop and the profundity of those metrics on the e-commerce business. And there's no one, no entity that can provide the type of route density and cost for lightweight residential delivery at the postal services, both in this country and abroad. Postal Service in this country, correct me if I'm wrong year, Henry, makes 156 million stops per day. So they're a mail company that puts parcels in with the mail stream usually in very small vehicles. 200,000, 150 cubic foot jeeps. They are out with an RF fee for somewhat larger vehicles and so forth. The real question about the e-commerce is what's the future of mail? And what implications does that have on the price of the delivery of packages? Put it in a different way. It is mail that subsidizes the delivery of packages, not packages subsidizing delivery of mail. And Postmaster General talks about this in her calls and so forth, and it has been a very good thing for the Postal Service that the big carriers like FedEx and UPS that have these enormous upstream systems can feed these lightweight residential packages into the postal business. They don't have to have that investments, the hubs, the sortations and so forth. And similarly, Amazon of course now has a very substantial direct injection on their own, but there is no comparable entity to the Postal Service in terms of density. And even the most rapid projections of e-commerce growth will not be a fraction of the density that the Postal Service has today. So there are these continuing argument -- I mean, articles about this, and more and more things are going to affect the density. My goodness, they will have to be quantumly [ph] greater than it is the case and so that's the real question about e-commerce, is what are the price of those deliveries on a go-forward basis, which are driver either by density, in the case of the Postal Service or input costs. And so Henry, jump in here. This is the issue and it's very poorly understood and it -- I've called it everything I can think off, mythology or whatever you might want to say. But most of the commentary on this is not accurate."

Even with the 156 million unique addresses that present an opportunity for delivery every day, that base is growing by 900,000 addresses a year. So this is a moving target. I would tell you, even with a tremendous growth, all of us who participate in the e-commerce are seeing are really only delivered to a small percentage of those addresses every single day. We just happen to have very complex state-of-the-art software tools that allow us to take a [indiscernible] packages, I guess, for lack of a better word with what were presented with every day by our customers and optimize those packages for the most efficient delivery. Now what's been going on at FedEx Ground is really an understanding of this phenomenon and what e-commerce is doing with respect to changing our business, our Holy Grail here is just to improve delivery density and revenue per stock. And the only way you can do that in our network is with the network integration we've been going through for the last several years, which includes the integration of ground and home delivery and now, since last September, we're integrating SmartPost in that as well. Over the top of this is the technology needed to manage the most optimal route, a distribution of those packages every single day; having a single contract or network, which we announced in January, we're moving to a single contract. And we expect to be essentially 90% done with all of this by 2020. You layover our ability, beginning earlier this year to be able to statically match packages that are destined to the same residential delivery address every single day, and next summer, the ability to do that virtually plus some additional engineering around deliveries on certain streets and neighborhoods when there's another residential package involved. And what we end up here is a much more efficient, much more flexible, a network that has much lower costs, much better capital asset utilization going forward with the growth in e-commerce than the one we have today."

You've got to work them through the system, and they have a little bit of a drag. That drag is fine to me because I know what the long-term results are going to be. I know the growth that Ground is going to have. And originally, we did get a little surprised by how quickly these non-conveyables and oversized things grew. We're going to lean right into that. We're going to be the best in the business to get most delivered. We're going to get them priced right. They've got to be handled a little bit differently.

Well, I guess, if you stack rank them, the 3 that would be in top-tier categories would be Flying Tiger, which put us into an unprecedented position in the growing Asian market; certainly, calibers/RPS which is now FedEx Ground; and TNT would be right up there, and it's going to be, as Alan said, a very, very significant earnings engine for us. And what's a little bit different about Tigers and Caliber and RPS, those gave us presences and adjacencies in adjacent markets. Tigers in the interconnect business. We were much smaller as FedEx and so we had to go out there and develop the business. Alan will remember this with king detail like I do. We bought it that the optimally worse time that go for started in air cargo basically stopped, which was an interesting set of circumstances, but it put us in an unprecedented position. That's why we're the market leader in air cargo and air express. Caliber RPS, of course, put us in the Ground segment, which we have not been in before. And through a lot of work by a lot of people, Mike Glenn in particular, heading up some of these transition we've made. Of course, it's a fabulous business that.

Welcome to our discussion of results for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Managing our operating companies as a portfolio of solutions helped FedEx achieve strong financial and operating results in the quarter, especially given the global economy's continued low growth. Mike Glenn will offer a more detailed look at economic conditions and FedEx revenue growth later in today's call. We expect FY '17 revenue and earnings to increase, driven by volume growth and improved base yields at all our core transportation companies. 
The integration of TNT Express, which includes more than 200 countries, is proceeding smoothly and on schedule. The level of team members' engagement is outstanding and very much appreciated. More than 20 teams are working in operations, customer solutions, personnel, IT, finance, legal, security and other areas to positively transform FedEx, TNT into a seamless worldwide operation. Alan Graf will provide a more comprehensive update, including our target to exit the end of the 4-year integration process in fiscal 2020 with annual synergies of $750 million [indiscernible]. The integration process continues. I assure you FedEx will maintain our high levels of customer service across all our operating companies with our commitment to the Purple Promise, which states simply, ""I will make every FedEx experience outstanding."" And let me thank hundreds of thousands of FedEx team members in every corner of the globe who do just that every day.

I'll open with an economic update and outlook and then discuss our performance and business conditions in each segment, including revenue, volume and yield, and provide some commentary from broader industry trends and our plans to what is expected to be another record-breaking holiday shopping season.
On the economic front, we see moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP growth forecast is 1.6% for calendar '16, 20 basis points lower than our last forecast in the last quarter; and 2.3% for calendar '17, led by gains in consumer spending. Our global GDP growth forecast is 2.2% for calendar '16, 10 basis points below last quarter; and 2.6% for calendar '17. We expect industrial production to decline 0.7% in calendar '16, 10 basis points lower than last quarter, and increase 2.2% next year.
Now I'll review revenue volume and yield trends by segment. U.S. Domestic Express package revenue grew 3% in Q1, driven by growth in both volume and yield. Excluding the impact of fuel, Domestic Express revenue grew 3.8% year-over-year. Package volume grew 1% year-over-year in the quarter, driven by strong overnight volume growth. Yield per package increased 1% year-over-year despite lower fuel surcharges. Including the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic package yield grew 2.5%, primarily due to rate and discount.
FedEx International Express package revenue decreased 1% year-over-year in Q1 but increased to 1% if you exclude the impact of fuel. FedEx International Priority volume decreased 1%, while International Economy volume grew 1%. International export package yield decreased 1%. If you exclude the impact of fuel, international export package yield increased 1.4%, primarily driven by a positive -- by the positive impact of rate and discount changes, which outweighed the negative impact of exchange rates.
FedEx Ground revenue increased 12% year-over-year in Q1 and increased 12.6% if you exclude the impact of fuel. This growth was driven by higher Ground volume and yield. FedEx Ground average daily volume grew 10% year-over-year in Q1, driven by robust growth in both residential and commercial segments. FedEx Ground package yield increased 2% year-over-year in Q1. If you exclude the impact of fuel, FedEx Ground yield per package increased 3% year-over-year, driven by yield improvements in both Ground and SmartPost segments. FedEx Ground continues to gain revenue market share. In fact, through the end of calendar year 2015, FedEx Ground has gained revenue market share for 17 consecutive years, and we are tracking to continue that trend and make it 18 years through the first half of this calendar year.
FedEx Freight revenue increased 4% in Q1 and 5.4%, excluding the impact of fuel. Average daily shipments increased 8% year-over-year. The continued strength in shipment volume is driven by our outstanding sales efforts with small and medium customers and reflects the speed, reliability and choice of priority and economy service for our LTL customers. We also saw increased demand from larger customers during the quarter. Revenue per LTL shipment declined 4% in Q1 due to lower fuel surcharge revenue and lower weight per shipment. Excluding the impact of the fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per shipment was down 1.7%.
I'd now like to spend a few minutes discussing industry dynamics, including pricing changes and the upcoming peak holiday season. 
As announced yesterday, we'll be raising rates effective January 2, 2017. FedEx Express rates will increase by an average of 3.9%. Rates for FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight will increase by an average of 4.9%. We will also change the dimensional weight divisor for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground from 166 to 139. Our dimensional weight divisor for U.S. domestic and international packages will now be the same after the change is implemented. Beginning in February, we will also be updating the FedEx Express and Ground fuel surcharges weekly as we do with FedEx Freight today. There will be no changes to the fuel surcharge tables. Details of all changes to rates and surcharges are available at fedex.com/rates2017.
We're deep into planning for what is expected to be another record peak holiday shipping season. The rapid growth of e-commerce has driven significant shifts in demand over the last several years. Last year, we experienced 15% growth in peak season volume and delivered more than 325 million packages. Beyond just the dramatic rise in volume, there are several other shifting industry dynamics. Holiday promotions and buying patterns have increasingly shifted, which has resulted in heavy demand for package delivery on Mondays during peak -- during the peak. The intensity for demand on Monday has accelerated in recent years as more and more retail locations have started serving as fulfillment centers for e-commerce orders. We expect each of the 4 Mondays during the upcoming peak period to be among the busiest in our company's history.
We have also experienced increased demand for transportation of larger and heavier packages. As e-commerce grows, there is demand for online ordering and delivery of everything from large screen TVs to mattresses and trampolines. We've engineered our network's sortation and delivery capacity for these larger packages, including entire temporary facilities dedicated to the sortation of oversized packages, which will be critically important this upcoming peak season. Beyond oversized packages, we will continue to make investments in technology and facilities that allow us to handle this year-round growth in demand. We've added to what is already the industry's most technologically advanced Ground sortation and delivery network with additional automation and new facilities. In fact, we've added 19 automated stations and 4 major distribution centers to FedEx Ground since the peak season last year alone. We've also added more reliable and efficient aircraft to the FedEx Express fleet over the last year. 
And while the advanced automation provides us a competitive advantage in sortation and speed, the key to our success during the peak continues to be our people. Across the FedEx portfolio, we expect to once again add more than 50,000 seasonal positions to help the holidays arrive. Based upon growth expectations and network expansion, many of these seasonal team members will have an opportunity for full-time work in FedEx after the holidays. These investments in people, facilities, aircraft and technology are all made to enable us to provide outstanding service even during the busiest days of the year.
As a further commitment to delivering outstanding service and in recognition of Christmas falling on Sunday this year, we've adjusted some service commitments for shipments tendered the week of Christmas. FedEx Express will be delivering on Saturday, December 24, Christmas Eve, but it is not a service day for FedEx Ground. FedEx Hold at Location is also a delivery option for customers on Christmas Eve. All service adjustments have already been communicated to customers as part of an extensive planning and collaboration effort to meet customer needs and enable outstanding service across the FedEx portfolio throughout peak.
And now, I'll turn it over to Alan Graf."

For FedEx Corporation, adjusted EPS climbed 20%, $2.90 per share. Revenues increased 19% to $14.7 billion with the addition of TNT Express. Consolidated adjusted operating margin was 9.3%. We continue to increase profits while investing in the business. First quarter results improved due to higher operating income at Express, where base yields improved and expense growth was constrained; and at Ground, where volume and yield grew. Offsetting factors included higher network expansion costs at Ground. These adjusted numbers exclude the integration and restructuring program costs, intangible asset amortization of TNT Express.
Ground volume continued to grow. Segment operating income increased 14% and margin increased to 14.2% due to volume and yield growth and lower self-insurance cost. Headwinds included higher operational costs due to network expansion and higher purchased transportation rates. Comparisons were easier due to higher self-insurance reserves last year. We aren't expecting that benefit to continue, and comparisons for the rest of the year are expected to be more difficult. Ground business continues to grow nicely, driven in large part by e-commerce. We believe continued strategic investments will position Ground for long-term, profitable growth by increasing capacity and efficiency to better meet the dynamic needs of our customers. Investments include continued network expansion; integration of commercial and residential networks, including SmartPost; completing transition of our pick-up and delivery service providers through a single operating model who have service capacity and operational flexibility; incentives for our small business partners to equip their vehicles improved safety technology.
Freight's operating income increased 2% primarily due to higher volumes and a favorable comparison as a result of a charge for facility closure. These benefits were mostly offset by lower LTL revenue per shipment, also drove a small decline in operating margin. Freight continues to face a difficult macro environment and is working hard to manage costs and increase yields.
Express frankly knocked the ball out of the park in Q1. Adjusted operating income was up 19%, and adjusted operating margin grew 140 basis points to 9.7%. Adding to the bottom line at Express were base yield improvement, volume growth and cost management efforts. In addition to its day job, Express was busy integrating TNT. As a result, integration expenses of $22 million are included in the GAAP results for the FedEx Express segment. FedEx Express continues to manage network capacity to match customer demand, reduce structural cost, modernize its air fleet and drive continued productivity increases.
Beginning this quarter, we are reporting the operating results for FedEx Express and TNT in different segments. In our 10-Q, we will provide an overview of the FedEx Express Group, which is comprised of the 2 segments I just mentioned. Presentation of TNT in our financial statements, including purchase price allocation, is preliminary and will likely change in future periods, perhaps significantly, given the timing and complexity of the acquisition. We plan to complete our purchase price allocation no later than the fourth quarter of FY '17. We believe that TNT acquisition, largest acquisition in FedEx history, transformed the world's transportation logistics industry, rapidly accelerating our European and global growth strategy as 1/3 of total FedEx Corporation revenue now touches a country outside of the United States. 
We have a rich history of success in integrating businesses into FedEx, and we are doubling down our commitment to the TNT integration in terms of our people and financial resources. TNT's 56,000 team members deliver 1 million packages daily in over 200 countries. TNT's European road network connects more than 40 countries through 19 road hubs over 540 depots and will substantially enhance our global footprint by leveraging TNT's lower-cost road networks in Europe and in the Middle East and Asia as well. FedEx now has a strong presence in Europe, transportation options from Express to Economy, parcel and freight, helping not only our customers in Europe but also around the world shipping into Europe. We have similar and complementary corporate cultures and a common history of superior service and value to customers.
We had a seamless and very successful first day when we acquired TNT on May 25. Today is our 119th day of ownership of TNT. Prior to the close of the transaction, we invested about a year building an integration plan, and we are well positioned for success. Our new senior leadership team is established, and all key TNT activities and responsibilities have transitioned to the integrated FedEx senior officer team. Hundreds of town halls have occurred across the enterprise in operations, sales, marketing and other back-office functions. We have strong talent within the TNT legacy organization. The team members across both organizations are energized about the combination. We also have strong cultural alignment across the teams with a focus on our People-Service-Profit philosophy. 
We expect the integration to take 4 years and significant investments in people, capital and expense. These are network businesses and require a combination of our pick-up and delivery operations at a local level for our stations and depots, our ground and air networks and our extensive operational clearance, sales and back-office IT systems. The IT investments that will be required are significant given the limited investment in IT at TNT over the last decade. This is also a key enabler of the integration and its benefits. We are bringing together the activities of team members across the globe. These activities and the pace are balanced against continuing to deliver world-class customer experience, drive returns for our shareholders.
Prior to acquisition, TNT announced its Outlook strategy to double its adjusted operating income and margin percentage by 2018. That profit improvement program includes various initiatives focused on yield management, operational efficiency and productivity as well as customer service. We are focusing on the initiatives and projects within Outlook to deliver the greatest benefits balanced with our 4-year integration plan. We are projecting TNT to be dilutive on a GAAP basis in FY '17 due to integration expenses, Outlook restructuring expenses and noncash intangible asset amortization. On an as-adjusted basis, excluding noncash intangible asset amortization, integration expenses and outlook expenses, we expect TNT to be accretive in FY '17 as the TNT Outlook restructuring program already started to lower cost.
We have seen almost immediate benefits as we begin the integration. In the U.S. and Canada, we are transitioning TNT's volume, formerly handled by third-party carriers, into the FedEx portfolio. In late September, we will begin consolidating depots, and we'll begin transitioning customers in October. We will complete the U.S. and Canada transition by the end of fiscal year '17. In addition, we have realized procurement and sourcing benefits transition for -- of TNT's third-party delivery partners into the FedEx direct-served operation or moved to a single third-party provider. And we'll launch our initial injection of FedEx volume into 5 select TNT European road network lanes later in September. We're off to a very solid start.
We see the combination of these 2 businesses as transformative and expect significant synergies from the integration. We would drive value from 4 key areas: optimized pick-up and delivery operations; an integrated global express network; improved efficiency of staff functions and processes; and revenue growth. 
We plan to optimize pick-up and delivery operations by implementing new technology and processes, optimizing the locations of facilities and stations without impacting service, and benefiting from the new pick-up and delivery efficiencies globally. Parcels would utilize a lower cost, integrated pick-up and delivery network to achieve greater economies of scale. 
We plan to form one global express network by developing integrated solutions to track and route parcels and freight and fully integrating our intercontinental air network. We will have one global express air network with an optimized line-haul and hub strategy that will deliver the best service for our customers and significantly improve our costs. 
We plan to improve the efficiency of our staff functions and processes by optimizing our systems and processes, including IT; innovating, transforming and streamlining key support functions, such as human resources, legal, security and finance; achieving meaningful sourcing savings. Lowering our effective tax rate over the long-term as synergies will drive additional international profits, tax that lower rates, and greater efficiency will lead to greater cost savings.
We will grow revenue with a best-in-class service portfolio with one sales team, single online tool for customer inquiries and invoices; revenue management activities that optimize yield, improve market share and increase profitability. As a result, customers will have access to a broader portfolio of services and will see value proposition improvements. 
We remain supremely confident in our initial views of the value of this acquisition and are targeting to exit the end of the 4-year integration with annual synergies of $750 million. Similar to our recently completed and successful profit improvement plan at Express, we do not believe that it's meaningful to give initial year-by-year guidance. The integration is complex, and the timing of integration restructuring expenses beyond fiscal year '17 are not yet crystallized. However, we ultimately get to our -- how we ultimately get to our target will evolve as market conditions and other factors change. We are highly confident in our target and our goals. We currently expect the aggregate integration program expense over the 4 years to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. Timing and amount of these integration-related estimates are subject to change as we implement and adjust our plans as necessary. In FY '18, TNT will be accretive, including integration and restructuring costs.
Turning to our corporate outlook. Based on the moderate economic forecast that Mike discussed and the momentum we have, we project adjusted earnings to be $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share for FY '17, which excludes TNT integration, Outlook restructuring costs, TNT intangible asset amortization and year-end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments. We are estimating combined TNT integration and Outlook restructuring expenses of about $275 million and TNT-related intangible asset amortization of about $115 million for FY '17. We'll expect our FY '17 integration CapEx for TNT to be about $100 million. Again, the timing and amount of these integration-related estimates are subject to change as our plans are refined. Meanwhile, Ground and Freight will continue to be focused on achieving their goals independent of the integration at Express.
Our total capital expenditures forecast remains at $5.6 billion in FY '17, including TNT. We anticipate that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our increased capital expenditures in FY '17, which will include spending for network expansion at Ground to support e-commerce growth and the continued aircraft fleet modernization at Express, which continues to lower our cost. Longer term, we would target CapEx 6% to 8% of revenues. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we are well positioned to continue to increase corporate earnings, dividends, cash flows, returns and margins.
Now we look forward to answering your strategic questions, and I will turn it back over to Fred."

What is the benefit of having the road Freight LTL/[indiscernible] business in addition to the package business? I presume this talks about TNT in Europe. Might it ultimately just be a small package network in Europe? 
So let me give you sort of a broad answer and then ask Mike and Dave Bronczek to jump in with any details they'd like to add. First of all, I'm not sure it is known as well as it should be that FedEx Express carries both pallets or Express Freight and packages and package, and we are the market leader in the United States with our Express Freight. There are 3 services: overnight; 2 day; and then 2 to 3 day. And that is a very profitable service, and we have different pick-up and delivery vehicles optimized for Express Freight. And obviously, we have our package delivery vans in the Express network, mostly the Sprinter-sized vans. And those 2 streams of traffic come together at our airport and hub locations, where the pallets are sorted in one area and the packages in another and then they're joined together for the line-haul. So TNT is very similar in Europe to the way FedEx is organized in the United States that I just mentioned to you. They have terminals, which have pallet sortation facilities in one end, package sortations in the other. The main difference is they have had vehicles which do both pallets and larger business-to-business package deliveries. The attraction of TNT was manyfold, but I have to tell you that one of the key attractions was their unduplicated Express Freight network in Europe. And of course, Europe has a high density of population, and their ability to move these pallets very fast throughout Western Europe was a tremendous advantage. Now we have a very extensive Express Freight capabilities in Brazil, Middle East, Southeast Asia and many other places around the world. So we will definitely continue in the Express Freight and the package business in the Express segment. Now let me hasten to add that our Express Freight business is very different than Mike Ducker's FedEx Freight unit. Average weight per shipment is almost 4x, the nature of the commodities is quite different, the pricing is quite different and so forth. Similarly, Henry Maier's FedEx Ground is quite different than FedEx Express' parcel operations. And in Europe, there is a very distinct Ground parcel sector where there are a number of competitors, but TNT's aggregate pallet and package business mainly in Europe but around the world was a very attractive feature of that company, which led us to have an interest in buying them. And we will very much continuing to provide International Priority freight and International Economy freight and intra-European freight and in those other areas and regions I mentioned to you.

There's a whole Freight area that you've seen. It's, around the world, the same. Dubai, it's the same. Hong Kong, it's the same; Brazil and around the world. One of the big advantages of TNT -- and Fred's right that it goes unnoticed, is their ability to handle a very profitable freight, and that's a part of their business that now we're going to put into our global network of parcels and pallets. And it's been very successful for us, and it's a nice part of the business that we added with TNT. It's also part of what we actually viewed when we went to Australia just a month ago. Fred Smith and I went to visit our colleagues in Australia TNT and our FedEx Express folks in Australia. The combination down there could be very, very powerful for us. We're looking at a way to make that whole marketplace much more successful, much more profitable, and it gives us an opportunity now to leverage one with the other that we didn't have in the past. So to Fred's point, it's a great part of TNT's new business. It's now part of the FedEx business."

This year at peak we will run 6 of them, which are essentially separate buildings designed to handle just these type packages which don't fit on our standard sortation equipment. We strategically located these facilities in parts of the country where our experience and history has shown that shippers reside to ship these type packages and continue to investigate how we handle these in the future.

A lot of companies are starting to experiment with UAVs. Is FedEx experimenting as well? If so, how is that going and what do you think the timing would be of using UAVs both in the air and on the ground? Also, is it realistic to believe there could be unmanned trucks? Is FedEx going down this route? Grin [ph], LOL, pun intended.
So Helane, obviously we at FedEx are very mindful of these trends. We have a number of activities underway in robotics in particular in the package handling sector. Henry and FedEx Ground are real leaders in this regard. In terms of UAV in particular, we have 5 separate -- I think it would be not fair to call all of them projects, but work streams or projects in both aviation and automated vehicles. The difference with us and a lot of other people, we just prefer to keep working those issues and tell you about them when they make a meaningful difference in the company. I will say this much, I think our philosophy -- and we know a lot about these technologies. After all, our autopilots and our 777 airplanes are among the most sophisticated robots in the world. They can take off, land the plane and taxi to the gate and turn themselves off if that's what we chose to do so. But it's very difficult in the foreseeable future to substitute for the well-trained pilot or driver or person, and we look at the use of automation more as an opportunity to improve the productivity of those types of experts within our system to make their job more comfortable and easy and above all, to increase safety. So those 5 work streams are underway. You'll hear a lot about them, I'm confident, in the next years. But important in our philosophy, maybe slightly different than a lot of other people that think that right over the horizon everything is going to be an automated vehicle or some sort of UAV, we think that is unlikely. And that this technology like most technology, particularly aviation technology, will evolve incrementally over time with a great emphasis on safety first. So that's our UAV update.
Okay. Two questions from the call."

There are a couple of questions in here from Tom Wadewitz of UBS and Allison Landry essentially about density, improving density levels and the issue of SmartPost deliveries by FedEx Ground, FedEx SmartPost. So let me just make one comment here and",447,"Okay. There are a couple of questions in here from Tom Wadewitz of UBS and Allison Landry essentially about density, improving density levels and the issue of SmartPost deliveries by FedEx Ground, FedEx SmartPost. So let me just make one comment here and then ask Henry to talk about. I have said this over and over again for the last couple of years. There is a continuing misunderstanding of the issue of route densities, revenue per stop and the profundity of those metrics on the e-commerce business. And there's no one, no entity, that can provide the type of route density and cost for lightweight residential delivery as the postal services, both in this country and abroad. Postal Service in this country, correct me if I'm wrong here, Henry, makes 156 million stops per day. So they are a mail company that puts parcels in with the mail stream usually in very small vehicles, 200,000, 150 cubic foot jeeps. They are out with an RFP for somewhat larger vehicles and so forth. So the real question about e-commerce is what's the future of mail and what implications does that have on the price of the delivery of packages? Put a different way, it is mail that subsidizes the delivery of packages, not packages subsidizing delivery of mail. And the Postmaster General talks about this in her calls and so forth, and it has been a very, very good thing for the Postal Service that the big carriers like FedEx and UPS that have these enormous upstream systems can feed these lightweight residential packages into the postal business. They don't have to have that investment, the hubs, the sortations and so forth. And similarly, Amazon, of course, now has a very substantial direct injection on their own, but there is no comparable entity to the Postal Service in terms of density. And even the most rapid projections of e-commerce growth will not be a fraction of the density that the Postal Service has today. So there are these continuing, I mean, articles about this and more and more things are going to affect the density. My goodness. They would have to be quantum-ly greater than is the case. And so that's the real question about e-commerce is what are the price of those deliveries on a go-forward basis, which are driven either by density in the case of the Postal Service, or input costs. And so Henry, jump in here. This is the issue and it's very poorly understood and it -- I've called it everything I can think of: mythology or whatever you might want to say. But most of the commentary on this is not accurate."

So this is a moving target. And I would tell you, even with the tremendous growth all of us who participate in e-commerce are seeing, are really only delivered to a small percentage of those addresses every single day. We just happen to have very complex, state-of-the-art software tools that allow us to take a blog [ph] of packages, I guess for lack of a better word, with what we're presented with every day by our customers and optimize those packages for the most efficient delivery. Now what's been going on at FedEx Ground is really an understanding of this phenomenon and what e-commerce is doing with respect to changing our business. Our Holy Grail here is to improve delivery density and revenue per stop, and the only way you can do that in our network is with the network integration we've been going through for the last several years, which includes the integration of Ground and Home Delivery and now, since last September, we announced we're integrating SmartPost in that as well. Over the top of this is the technology needed to manage the most optimal route distribution of those packages every single day; having a single contract or network, which we announced in January we're moving to a single contract; and we expect to be essentially 90% done with all of this by 2020. You lay over our ability beginning earlier this year to be able to statically match packages that are destined to the same residential delivery address every single day and next summer the ability to do that virtually plus some additional engineering around deliveries on certain streets and neighborhoods when there's another residential package involved, and what we end up with here is a much more efficient, much more flexible, a network that has much lower costs, much better capital asset utilization going forward with the growth of e-commerce than the one we have today."

And then also could you quantify the EPS accretion from TNT that is embedded in the adjusted FY '17 guidance?"

So you'll be able to very easily measure that and follow that along. And as I said, we'll talk about this more after we've completed our validation of our strategic business case and met with our Board of Directors about where we stand on that, which is going to take us a little bit of time to get to because we're also right in the middle of the throw of actually integrating as I mentioned to you in my opening remarks. So just have a little patience, but the whole point was to tell you this thing is a home run. It's going to be a home run, and we're going to have that done by 4 years from now, and we will continue to update you along the way. It's going to be a great ride."

I think your investors will too, and we'll also be shipping plenty of trampoline this fourth quarter. Henry, on your ground margins, it looks like you actually got a little bit of improvement year-on-year. I know there's some issues with casualties last year. But nonetheless, as we look forward, I think a lot of folks have been worried that the network integration costs of expanding at such a rapid pace, growing the top line so rapidly, would weigh heavier on the margin. So can you talk to the market dynamics? Has volume gotten better? Is demand better than forecast? Pricing better? Or should we be thinking maybe those headwinds still loom in the near term?"

I'm going to give you a little bit color on where Henry is right at the moment. We have invested and are investing significantly this fiscal year in Ground to get to the next level where we need to get, and it's a big capital step, I would tell you. So it's $2 billion for this year, maybe the same even next year and that, of course, has a cumulative effect. You're not -- when you turn on these new facilities, they're not full day 1. You've got to work them through the systems, and they have a little bit of a drag. That drag is fine to me because I know what the long-term results are going to be. I know the growth that Ground is going to have. And originally, we did get a little surprised by how quickly these non-conveyables and oversized things grew. We're going to lean right into that. We're going to be the best in the business of getting those delivered. We're going to get them priced right. They've got to be handled a little bit different way. So that also has a startup cost associated with itself. I gave you guidance for the full company for the year. Henry's comparisons are going to be a little bit more difficult because of all of those investments that we're making. But the state of the business is as good as it's always been, and I can't wait till we turn the corner from this period of heavy capital investment.

I think Mike has answered that as to what drove it and why we did it. It's to standardize it across the enterprise and basically the realities of the increased cost and handling it.
William Flinn just sent one in. When you think about the acquisitions you made over the past 30 years, which ones do you view as transformational?
Well, I guess if you stack rank them, the 3 that would be in top-tier categories would be Flying Tiger, which put us into an unprecedented position in the growing Asian market; certainly, Caliber/RPS, which is now FedEx Ground; and TNT would be right up there and it's going to be, as Alan said, a very, very significant earnings engine for us. And what's a little bit different about Tigers and Caliber and RPS, those gave us presences in adjacencies, in adjacent markets. Tiger's in the intercontinental business. We were much smaller as FedEx, and so we had to go out there and develop the business. Alan will remember this with keen detail like I do. We bought it at the optimally worst time. The Gulf War started and air cargo basically stopped, which was an interesting set of circumstances, but it put us in an unprecedented position. That's why we're the market leader in air cargo and air express. Caliber/RPS, of course, put us in the Ground segment, which we have not been in before, and through a lot of work by a lot of people, Mike Glenn in particular heading up some of these transitions we've made. Of course, it's a fabulous business now. And TNT, as Alan has told you there, I mean, we're going to get the synergies just from putting the companies together and then we're going to build additional profitability on top of that. So it's going to be a great thing, and I think Dave Bronczek and Alan have all said this, but let me just add to it: just wonderful people. We have just been so thrilled with the folks that we've got. Many, many of the TNT people are now in high executive positions in FedEx, and I think it's going to be a great thing.
Next, we'll take 2 more questions from the call."

I mean, when we bought Flying Tiger and when we bought Ground, there wasn't ""the integrations"" so much to say as there is in this one.

Welcome to our discussion of results for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Managing our operating companies as a portfolio of solutions helped FedEx achieve strong financial and operating results in the quarter, especially given the global economy's continued low growth. Mike Glenn will offer a more detailed look at economic conditions and FedEx revenue growth later in today's call. We expect FY '17 revenue and earnings to increase, driven by volume growth and improved base yields at all our core transportation companies. 
The integration of TNT Express, which includes more than 200 countries, is proceeding smoothly and on schedule. The level of team members' engagement is outstanding and very much appreciated. More than 20 teams are working in operations, customer solutions, personnel, IT, finance, legal, security and other areas to positively transform FedEx, TNT into a seamless worldwide operation. Alan Graf will provide a more comprehensive update, including our target to exit the end of the 4-year integration process in fiscal 2020 with annual synergies of $750 million 
[Audio Gap]
The integration process continues. I assure you FedEx will maintain our high levels of customer service across all our operating companies with our commitment to the Purple Promise, which states simply, ""I will make every FedEx experience outstanding."" And let me thank hundreds of thousands of FedEx team members in every corner of the globe who do just that every day.
Before I turn the call over to Mike, let me reiterate: we are committed to improving margins, earnings per share, cash flows and returns. 
Now Mike and then Alan will provide their insights. Mike?"

I'll open with an economic update and outlook and then discuss our performance and business conditions in each segment, including revenue, volume and yield, and provide some commentary from broader industry trends and our plans for what is e",1148,"Thanks, Fred. I'll open with an economic update and outlook and then discuss our performance and business conditions in each segment, including revenue, volume and yield, and provide some commentary from broader industry trends and our plans for what is expected to be another record-breaking holiday shopping season.
On the economic front, we see moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP growth forecast is 1.6% for calendar '16, 20 basis points lower than our last forecast in the last quarter; and 2.3% for calendar '17, led by gains in consumer spending. Our global GDP growth forecast is 2.2% for calendar '16, 10 basis points below last quarter; and 2.6% for calendar '17. We expect industrial production to decline 0.7% in calendar '16, 10 basis points lower than last quarter, and increase 2.2% next year.
Now I'll review revenue volume and yield trends by segment. U.S. Domestic Express package revenue grew 3% in Q1, driven by growth in both volume and yield. Excluding the impact of fuel, Domestic Express revenue grew 3.8% year-over-year. Package volume grew 1% year-over-year in the quarter, driven by strong overnight volume growth. Yield per package increased 1% year-over-year despite lower fuel surcharges. Including the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic package yield grew 2.5%, primarily due to rate and discount.
FedEx International Express package revenue decreased 1% year-over-year in Q1 but increased 1% if you exclude the impact of fuel. FedEx International Priority volume decreased 1%, while International Economy volume grew 1%. International export package yield decreased 1%. If you exclude the impact of fuel, international export package yield increased 1.4%, primarily driven by a positive -- by the positive impact of rate and discount changes, which outweighed the negative impact of exchange rates.
FedEx Ground revenue increased 12% year-over-year in Q1 and increased 12.6% if you exclude the impact of fuel. This growth was driven by higher Ground volume and yield. FedEx Ground average daily volume grew 10% year-over-year in Q1, driven by robust growth in both residential and commercial segments. FedEx Ground package yield increased 2% year-over-year in Q1. If you exclude the impact of fuel, FedEx Ground yield per package increased 3% year-over-year, driven by yield improvements in both Ground and SmartPost segments. FedEx Ground continues to gain revenue market share. In fact, through the end of calendar year 2015, FedEx Ground has gained revenue market share for 17 consecutive years, and we are tracking to continue that trend and make it 18 years through the first half of this calendar year.
FedEx Freight revenue increased 4% in Q1 and 5.4%, excluding the impact of fuel. Average daily shipments increased 8% year-over-year. The continued strength in shipment volume is driven by our outstanding sales efforts with small and medium customers and reflects the speed, reliability and choice of Priority and Economy service for our LTL customers. We also saw increased demand from larger customers during the quarter. Revenue per LTL shipment declined 4% in Q1 due to lower fuel surcharge revenue and lower weight per shipment. Excluding the impact of the fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per shipment was down 1.7%.
I'd now like to spend a few minutes discussing industry dynamics, including pricing changes and the upcoming peak holiday season. 
As announced yesterday, we'll be raising rates effective January 2, 2017. FedEx Express rates will increase by an average of 3.9%. Rates for FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight will increase by an average of 4.9%. We will also change the dimensional weight divisor for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground from 166 to 139. Our dimensional weight divisor for U.S. domestic and international packages will now be the same after the change is implemented. Beginning in February, we will also be updating the FedEx Express and Ground fuel surcharges weekly as we do with FedEx Freight today. There will be no changes to the fuel surcharge tables. Details of all changes to rates and surcharges are available at fedex.com/rates2017.
We're deep into planning for what is expected to be another record peak holiday shipping season. The rapid growth of e-commerce has driven significant shifts in demand over the last several years. Last year, we experienced 15% growth in peak season volume and delivered more than 325 million packages. Beyond just the dramatic rise in volume, there are several other shifting industry dynamics. Holiday promotions and buying patterns have increasingly shifted, which has resulted in heavy demand for package deliveries on Mondays during peak -- during the peak. The intensity for demand on Monday has accelerated in recent years as more and more retail locations have started serving as fulfillment centers for e-commerce orders. We expect each of the 4 Mondays during the upcoming peak period to be among the busiest in our company's history.
We have also experienced increased demand for transportation of larger and heavier packages. As e-commerce grows, there is demand for online ordering and delivery of everything from large screen TVs to mattresses and trampolines. We've engineered our networks to add sortation and delivery capacity for these larger packages, including entire temporary facilities dedicated to the sortation of oversized packages, which will be critically important this upcoming peak season. Beyond oversized packages, we will continue to make investments in technology and facilities that allow us to handle this year-round growth in demand. We've added to what is already the industry's most technologically advanced Ground sortation and delivery network with additional automation and new facilities. In fact, we've added 19 automated stations and 4 major distribution centers to FedEx Ground since the peak season last year alone. We've also added more reliable and efficient aircraft to the FedEx Express fleet over the last year. 
And while the advanced automation provides us a competitive advantage in sortation and speed, the key to our success during the peak continues to be our people. Across the FedEx portfolio, we expect to once again add more than 50,000 seasonal positions to help the holidays arrive. Based upon growth expectations and network expansion, many of these seasonal team members will have an opportunity for full-time work in FedEx after the holidays. These investments in people, facilities, aircraft and technology are all made to enable us to provide outstanding service even during the busiest days of the year.
As a further commitment to delivering outstanding service and in recognition of Christmas falling on Sunday this year, we've adjusted some service commitments for shipments tendered the week of Christmas. FedEx Express will be delivering on Saturday, December 24, Christmas Eve, but it is not a service day for FedEx Ground. FedEx Hold at Location is also a delivery option for customers on Christmas Eve. All service adjustments have already been communicated to customers as part of an extensive planning and collaboration effort to meet customer needs and enable outstanding service across the FedEx portfolio throughout peak.
And now, I'll turn it over to Alan Graf."

For FedEx Corporation, adjusted EPS climbed 20%, $2.90 per share. Revenues increased 19% to $14.7 billion with the addition of TNT Express. Consolidated adjusted operating margin was 9.3%. We continue to increase profits while investing in the business. First quarter results improved due to higher operating income at Express, where base yields improved and expense growth was constrained; and at Ground, where volume and yield grew. Offsetting factors included higher network expansion costs at Ground. These adjusted numbers exclude the integration and restructuring program costs, intangible asset amortization 
[Audio Gap]
TNT Express.
Ground volume continued to grow. Segment operating income increased 14% and margin increased to 14.2% due to volume and yield growth and lower self-insurance cost. Headwinds included higher operational costs due to network expansion and higher purchased transportation rates. Comparisons were easier due to higher self-insurance reserves last year. We aren't expecting that benefit to continue, and comparisons for the rest of the year are expected to be more difficult. Ground business continues to grow nicely, driven in large part by e-commerce. We believe continued strategic investments will position Ground for long-term, profitable growth by increasing capacity and efficiency to better meet the dynamic needs of our customers. 
Investments include continued network expansion; integration of commercial and residential networks, including SmartPost; completing transition of our pick-up and delivery service providers through a single operating model who have service capacity and operational flexibility and incentives for our small business partners to equip their vehicles improved safety technology.
Freight's operating income increased 2% primarily due to higher volumes and a favorable comparison as a result of a charge for facility closure. These benefits were mostly offset by lower LTL revenue per shipment, also drove a small decline in operating margin. Freight continues to face a difficult macro environment and is working hard to manage costs and increase yields.
Express frankly knocked the ball out of the park in Q1. Adjusted operating income was up 19%, and adjusted operating margin grew 140 basis points to 9.7%. Adding to the bottom line at Express were base yield improvement, volume growth and cost management efforts. In addition to its day job, Express was busy integrating TNT. As a result, integration expenses of $22 million are included in the GAAP results for the FedEx Express segment. FedEx Express continues to manage network capacity to match customer demand, reduce structural cost, modernize its air fleet and drive continued productivity increases.
Beginning this quarter, we are reporting the operating results for FedEx Express and TNT in different segments. In our 10-Q, we will provide an overview of the FedEx Express Group, which is comprised of the 2 segments I just mentioned. Presentation of TNT in our financial statements, including purchase price allocation, is preliminary and will likely change in future periods, perhaps significantly, given the timing and complexity of the acquisition. We plan to complete our purchase price allocation no later than the fourth quarter of FY '17. We believe the TNT acquisition, largest acquisition in FedEx history, transformed the world's transportation logistics industry, rapidly accelerating our European and global growth strategy as 1/3 of total FedEx Corporation revenue now touches a country outside of the United States. 
We have a rich history of success in integrating businesses into FedEx, and we are doubling down our commitment to the TNT integration in terms of our people and financial resources. TNT's 56,000 team members deliver 1 million packages daily in over 200 countries. TNT's European road network connects more than 40 countries through 19 road hubs over 540 depots and will substantially enhance our global footprint by leveraging TNT's lower-cost road networks in Europe and in the Middle East and Asia as well. FedEx now has a strong presence in Europe, transportation options from Express to Economy, parcel and freight, helping not only our customers in Europe but also around the world shipping into Europe. We have similar and complementary corporate cultures and a common history of superior service and value to customers.
We had a seamless and very successful first day when we acquired TNT on May 25. Today is our 119th day of ownership of TNT. Prior to the close of the transaction, we invested about a year building an integration plan, and we are well positioned for success. Our new senior leadership team is established, and all key TNT activities and responsibilities have transitioned to the integrated FedEx senior officer team. Hundreds of town halls have occurred across the enterprise in operations, sales, marketing and other back-office functions. We have strong talent within the TNT legacy organization. The team members across both organizations are energized about the combination. We also have strong cultural alignment across the teams with a focus on our People-Service-Profit philosophy. 
We expect the integration to take 4 years and significant investments in people, capital and expense. These are network businesses and require a combination of our pick-up and delivery operations at a local level throughout stations and depots, our ground and air networks and our extensive operational clearance, sales and back-office IT systems. The IT investments that will be required are significant given the limited investment in IT at TNT over the last decade. This is also a key enabler of the integration and its benefits. We are bringing together the activities of team members across the globe. These activities and the pace are balanced against continuing to deliver world-class customer experience, drive returns for our shareholders.
Prior to acquisition, TNT announced its Outlook strategy to double its adjusted operating income and margin percentage by 2018. That profit improvement program includes various initiatives focused on yield management, operational efficiency and productivity as well as customer service. We are focusing on the initiatives and projects within Outlook to deliver the greatest benefits balanced with our 4-year integration plan. We are projecting TNT to be dilutive on a GAAP basis in FY '17 due to integration expenses, Outlook restructuring expenses and noncash intangible asset amortization. On an as-adjusted basis, excluding noncash intangible asset amortization, integration expenses and outlook expenses, we expect TNT to be accretive in FY '17 as the TNT Outlook restructuring program already started to lower cost.
We have seen almost immediate benefits as we begin the integration. In the U.S. and Canada, we are transitioning TNT's volume, formerly handled by third-party carriers, into the FedEx portfolio. In late September, we will begin consolidating depots, and we'll begin transitioning customers in October. We will complete the U.S. and Canada transition by the end of fiscal year '17. In addition, we have realized procurement and sourcing benefits transitioned 4 of TNT's third-party delivery partners into the FedEx direct-served operation or moved to a single third-party provider. And we'll launch our initial injection of FedEx volume into 5 select TNT European road network lanes later in September. We're off to a very solid start.
We see the combination of these 2 businesses as transformative and expect significant synergies from the integration. We will drive value from 4 key areas: optimized pick-up and delivery operations; an integrated global express network; improved efficiency of staff functions and processes; and revenue growth. 
We plan to optimize pick-up and delivery operations by implementing new technology and processes, optimizing the locations of facilities and stations without impacting service. And benefiting from the new pick-up and delivery efficiencies globally, parcels would utilize a lower cost, integrated pick-up and delivery network to achieve greater economies of scale. 
We plan to form one global express network by developing integrated solutions to track and route parcels and freight and fully integrating our intercontinental air network. We will have one global express air network with an optimized line-haul and hub strategy that will deliver the best service for our customers and significantly improve our costs. 
We plan to improve the efficiency of our staff functions and processes by optimizing our systems and processes, including IT; innovating, transforming and streamlining key support functions, such as human resources, legal, security and finance; achieving meaningful sourcing savings; lowering our effective tax rate over the long-term as synergies will drive additional international profits taxed that lower rates; and greater efficiency will lead to greater cost savings.
We will grow revenue with a best-in-class service portfolio with one sales team, single online tool for customer inquiries and invoices; revenue management activities that optimize yield, improve market share and increase profitability. As a result, customers will have access to a broader portfolio of services and will see value proposition improvements. 
We remain supremely confident in our initial views of the value of this acquisition and are targeting to exit the end of the 4-year integration with annual synergies of $750 million. Similar to our recently completed and successful profit improvement plan at Express, we do not believe that it's meaningful to give initial year-by-year guidance. The integration is complex, and the timing of integration restructuring expenses beyond fiscal year '17 are not yet crystallized. However, we ultimately get to our -- how we ultimately get to our target will evolve as market conditions and other factors change. We are highly confident in our target and our goals. We currently expect the aggregate integration program expense over the 4 years to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. Timing and amount of these integration-related estimates are subject to change as we implement and adjust our plans as necessary. In FY '18, TNT will be accretive, including integration and restructuring costs.
Turning to our corporate outlook. Based on the moderate economic forecast that Mike discussed and the momentum we have, we project adjusted earnings to be $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share for FY '17, which excludes TNT integration, Outlook restructuring costs, TNT intangible asset amortization and year-end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments. We are estimating combined TNT integration and Outlook restructuring expenses of about $275 million and TNT-related intangible asset amortization of about $115 million for FY '17. We'll expect our FY '17 integration CapEx for TNT to be about $100 million. Again, the timing and amount of these integration-related estimates are subject to change as our plans are refined. Meanwhile, Ground and Freight will continue to be focused on achieving their goals independent of the integration at Express.
Our total capital expenditures forecast remains at $5.6 billion in FY '17, including TNT. We anticipate that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our increased capital expenditures in FY '17, which will include spending for network expansion at Ground to support e-commerce growth and the continued aircraft fleet modernization at Express, which continues to lower our cost. Longer term, we would target CapEx 6% to 8% of revenues. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we are well positioned to continue to increase corporate earnings, dividends, cash flows, returns and margins.
Now we look forward to answering your strategic questions, and I will turn it back over to Fred."

What is the benefit of having the road Freight LTL/groupage business in addition to the package business? I presume this talks about TNT in Europe. Might it ultimately just be a small package network in Europe? 
So let me give you sort of a broad answer and then ask Mike and Dave Bronczek to jump in with any details they'd like to add. First of all, I'm not sure it is known as well as it should be that FedEx Express carries both pallets for Express Freight and packages and packets. And we are the market leader in the United States with our Express Freight. There are 3 services: overnight; 2 day; and then 2 to 3 day. And that is a very profitable service, and we have different pick-up and delivery vehicles optimized for Express Freight. And obviously, we have our package delivery vans in the Express network, mostly the Sprinter-sized vans. And those 2 streams of traffic come together at our airport and hub locations, where the pallets are sorted in one area and the packages in another and then they're joined together for the line-haul. So TNT is very similar in Europe to the way FedEx is organized in the United States that I just mentioned to you. They have terminals, which have pallet sortation facilities in one end, package sortations in the other. The main difference is they have had vehicles which do both pallets and larger business-to-business package deliveries. The attraction of TNT was manyfold, but I have to tell you that one of the key attractions was their unduplicated Express Freight network in Europe. And of course, Europe has a high density of population, and their ability to move these pallets very fast throughout Western Europe was a tremendous advantage. Now we have very extensive Express Freight capabilities in Brazil, Middle East, Southeast Asia and many other places around the world. So we will definitely continue in the Express Freight and the package business in the Express segment. Now let me hasten to add that our Express Freight business is very different than Mike Ducker's FedEx Freight unit. Average weight per shipment is almost 4x, the nature of the commodities is quite different, the pricing is quite different and so forth. Similarly, Henry Maier's FedEx Ground is quite different than FedEx Express' parcel operations. And in Europe, there is a very distinct Ground parcel sector where there are a number of competitors, but TNT's aggregate pallet and package business mainly in Europe but around the world was a very attractive feature of that company, which led us to have an interest in buying them. And we will very much continuing to provide International Priority freight and International Economy freight and intra-European freight and in those other areas and regions I mentioned to you. Mike?"

And it's been very successful for us, and it's a nice part of the business that we added with TNT. It's also part of what we actually viewed when we went to Australia just a month ago.

It also goes without saying that these packages create some operational challenges for us. For instance, they don't always fit on our standard sortation equipment and they take up more space in linehaul and delivery vehicles in addition to being more difficult to handle. We recognize customers have few options here so they -- we realize that they look to FedEx for solutions. And in that end, as Mike mentioned, as part of our network expansion strategy, we are now operating temporary, non-conveyable annexes. This year at peak we will run 6 of them, which are essentially separate buildings designed to handle just these type packages which don't fit on our standard sortation equipment. We strategically located these facilities in parts of the country where our experience and history has shown that shippers reside to ship these type packages and continue to investigate how we handle these in the future. We're encouraged because there are some pretty interesting new technologies with respect to material handling equipment coming out that would be targeted directly at this type of package characteristics.

A lot of companies are starting to experiment with UAVs. Is FedEx experimenting as well? If so, how is that going and what do you think the timing would be of using UAVs both in the air and on the ground? Also, is it realistic to believe there could be unmanned trucks? Is FedEx going down this route? Grin, LOL, pun intended.
So Helane, obviously we at FedEx are very mindful of these trends. We have a number of activities underway in robotics in particular in the package handling sector. Henry and FedEx Ground are real leaders in this regard. In terms of UAV in particular, we have 5 separate -- I think it would be not fair to call all of them projects, but work streams or projects in both aviation and automated vehicles. The difference with us and a lot of other people, we just prefer to keep working those issues and tell you about them when they make a meaningful difference in the company. I will say this much, I think our philosophy -- and we know a lot about these technologies. After all, our autopilots and our 777 airplanes are among the most sophisticated robots in the world. They can take off, land the plane and taxi to the gate and turn themselves off if that's what we chose to do so. But it's very difficult in the foreseeable future to substitute for the well-trained pilot or driver or person, and we look at the use of automation more as an opportunity to improve the productivity of those types of experts within our system to make their job more comfortable and easy and above all, to increase safety. So those 5 work streams are underway. You'll hear a lot about them, I'm confident, in the next few years. But important in our philosophy, maybe slightly different than a lot of other people that think that right over the horizon everything is going to be an automated vehicle or some sort of UAV, we think that is unlikely. And that this technology like most technology, particularly aviation technology, will evolve incrementally over time with a great emphasis on safety first. So that's our UAV update.
Okay. Two questions from the call."

So let me just make one comment here an",448,"Okay. There are a couple of questions in here from Tom Wadewitz of UBS and Allison Landry essentially about density -- improving density levels and the issue of SmartPost deliveries by FedEx Ground, FedEx SmartPost. So let me just make one comment here and then ask Henry to talk about. I have said this over and over again for the last couple of years. There is a continuing misunderstanding of the issue of route densities, revenue per stop and the profundity of those metrics on the e-commerce business. And there's no one, no entity, that can provide the type of route density and cost for lightweight residential delivery as the postal services, both in this country and abroad. Postal Service in this country, correct me if I'm wrong here, Henry, makes 156 million stops per day. So they are a mail company that puts parcels in with the mail stream usually in very small vehicles, 200,000, 150 cubic foot jeeps. They are out with an RFP for somewhat larger vehicles and so forth. So the real question about e-commerce is what's the future of mail and what implications does that have on the price of the delivery of packages? Put a different way, it is mail that subsidizes the delivery of packages, not packages subsidizing delivery of mail. And the Postmaster General talks about this in her calls and so forth, and it has been a very, very good thing for the Postal Service that the big carriers like FedEx and UPS that have these enormous upstream systems can feed these lightweight residential packages into the postal business. They don't have to have that investment, the hubs, the sortations and so forth. And similarly, Amazon, of course, now has a very substantial direct injection on their own, but there is no comparable entity to the Postal Service in terms of density. And even the most rapid projections of e-commerce growth will not be a fraction of the density that the Postal Service has today. So there are these continuing, I mean, articles about this and more and more things are going to affect the density. My goodness. They would have to be quantum-ly greater than is the case. And so that's the real question about e-commerce is what are the price of those deliveries on a go-forward basis, which are driven either by density in the case of the Postal Service, or input costs. And so Henry, jump in here. This is the issue and it's very poorly understood and it -- I've called it everything I can think of: mythology or whatever you might want to say. But most of the commentary on this is not accurate."

So this is a moving target. And I would tell you, even with the tremendous growth all of us who participate in e-commerce are seeing, are really only delivered to a small percentage of those addresses every single day. We just happen to have very complex, state-of-the-art software tools that allow us to take a flood of packages, I guess for lack of a better word, with what we're presented with every day by our customers and optimize those packages for the most efficient delivery. Now what's been going on at FedEx Ground is really an understanding of this phenomenon and what e-commerce is doing with respect to changing our business. Our Holy Grail here is to improve delivery density and revenue per stop, and the only way you can do that in our network is with the network integration we've been going through for the last several years, which includes the integration of Ground and Home Delivery and now, since last September, we announced we're integrating SmartPost in that as well. Over the top of this is the technology needed to manage the most optimal route distribution of those packages every single day; having a single contract or network, which we announced in January we're moving to a single contract; and we expect to be essentially 90% done with all of this by 2020. You lay over our ability beginning earlier this year to be able to statically match packages that are destined to the same residential delivery address every single day and next summer the ability to do that virtually plus some additional engineering around deliveries on certain streets and neighborhoods when there's another residential package involved, and what we end up with here is a much more efficient, much more flexible, a network that has much lower costs, much better capital asset utilization going forward with the growth of e-commerce than the one we have today."

William Flinn just sent one in. When you think about the acquisitions you made over the past 30 years, which ones do you view as transformational?
Well, I guess if you stack rank them, the 3 that would be in top-tier categories would be Flying Tigers, which put us into an unprecedented position in the growing Asian market; certainly, Caliber/RPS, which is now FedEx Ground; and TNT would be right up there and it's going to be, as Alan said, a very, very significant earnings engine for us. And what's a little bit different about Tigers and Caliber and RPS, those gave us presences in adjacencies, in adjacent markets. Tiger's in the intercontinental business. We were much smaller as FedEx, and so we had to go out there and develop the business. Alan will remember this with keen detail like I do. We bought it at the optimally worst time. The Gulf War started and air cargo basically stopped, which was an interesting set of circumstances, but it put us in an unprecedented position. That's why we're the market leader in air cargo and air express. Caliber/RPS, of course, put us in the Ground segment, which we have not been in before, and through a lot of work by a lot of people, Mike Glenn in particular heading up some of these transitions we've made. Of course, it's a fabulous business now. And TNT, as Alan has told you there, I mean, we're going to get the synergies just from putting the companies together and then we're going to build additional profitability on top of that. So it's going to be a great thing, and I think Dave Bronczek and Alan have all said this, but let me just add to it: just wonderful people. We have just been so thrilled with the folks that we've got. Many, many of the TNT people are now in high executive positions in FedEx, and I think it's going to be a great thing.
Next, we'll take 2 more questions from the call."

I mean, when we bought Flying Tiger and when we bought Ground, there wasn't ""the integrations"" so much to say as there is in this one.

I'll open with an economic update and outlook and then discuss our performance and business conditions in each segment, including revenue, volume and yield, and provide some commentary from broader industry trends and our plans for what is expected to be another record-breaking holiday shopping season.
On the economic front, we see moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP growth forecast is 1.6% for calendar '16, 20 basis points lower than our last forecast in the last quarter; and 2.3% for calendar '17, led by gains in consumer spending. Our global GDP growth forecast is 2.2% for calendar '16, 10 basis points below last quarter; and 2.6% for calendar '17. We expect industrial production to decline 0.7% in calendar '16, 10 basis points lower than last quarter, and increase 2.2% next year.
Now I'll review revenue volume and yield trends by segment. U.S. Domestic Express package revenue grew 3% in Q1, driven by growth in both volume and yield. Excluding the impact of fuel, Domestic Express revenue grew 3.8% year-over-year. Package volume grew 1% year-over-year in the quarter, driven by strong overnight volume growth. Yield per package increased 1% year-over-year despite lower fuel surcharges. Including the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic package yield grew 2.5%, primarily due to rate and discount.
FedEx International Express package revenue decreased 1% year-over-year in Q1 but increased 1% if you exclude the impact of fuel. FedEx International Priority volume decreased 1%, while International Economy volume grew 1%. International export package yield decreased 1%. If you exclude the impact of fuel, international export package yield increased 1.4%, primarily driven by a positive -- by the positive impact of rate and discount changes, which outweighed the negative impact of exchange rates.
FedEx Ground revenue increased 12% year-over-year in Q1 and increased 12.6% if you exclude the impact of fuel. This growth was driven by higher Ground volume and yield. FedEx Ground average daily volume grew 10% year-over-year in Q1, driven by robust growth in both residential and commercial segments. FedEx Ground package yield increased 2% year-over-year in Q1. If you exclude the impact of fuel, FedEx Ground yield per package increased 3% year-over-year, driven by yield improvements in both Ground and SmartPost segments. FedEx Ground continues to gain revenue market share. In fact, through the end of calendar year 2015, FedEx Ground has gained revenue market share for 17 consecutive years, and we are tracking to continue that trend and make it 18 years through the first half of this calendar year.
FedEx Freight revenue increased 4% in Q1 and 5.4%, excluding the impact of fuel. Average daily shipments increased 8% year-over-year. The continued strength in shipment volume is driven by our outstanding sales efforts with small and medium customers and reflects the speed, reliability and choice of Priority and Economy service for our LTL customers. We also saw increased demand from larger customers during the quarter. Revenue per LTL shipment declined 4% in Q1 due to lower fuel surcharge revenue and lower weight per shipment. Excluding the impact of the fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per shipment was down 1.7%.
I'd now like to spend a few minutes discussing industry dynamics, including pricing changes and the upcoming peak holiday season. 
As announced yesterday, we'll be raising rates effective January 2, 2017. FedEx Express rates will increase by an average of 3.9%. Rates for FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight will increase by an average of 4.9%. We will also change the dimensional weight divisor for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground from 166 to 139. Our dimensional weight divisor for U.S. domestic and international packages will now be the same after the change is implemented. Beginning in February, we will also be updating the FedEx Express and Ground fuel surcharges weekly as we do with FedEx Freight today. There will be no changes to the fuel surcharge tables. Details of all changes to rates and surcharges are available at fedex.com/rates2017.
We're deep into planning for what is expected to be another record peak holiday shipping season. The rapid growth of e-commerce has driven significant shifts in demand over the last several years. Last year, we experienced 15% growth in peak season volume and delivered more than 325 million packages. Beyond just the dramatic rise in volume, there are several other shifting industry dynamics. Holiday promotions and buying patterns have increasingly shifted, which has resulted in heavy demand for package deliveries on Mondays during peak -- during the peak. The intensity for demand on Monday has accelerated in recent years as more and more retail locations have started serving as fulfillment centers for e-commerce orders. We expect each of the 4 Mondays during the upcoming peak period to be among the busiest in our company's history.
We have also experienced increased demand for transportation of larger and heavier packages. As e-commerce grows, there is demand for online ordering and delivery of everything from large screen TVs to mattresses and trampolines. We've engineered our networks to add sortation and delivery capacity for these larger packages, including entire temporary facilities dedicated to the sortation of oversized packages, which will be critically important this upcoming peak season. Beyond oversized packages, we will continue to make investments in technology and facilities that allow us to handle this year-round growth in demand. We've added to what is already the industry's most technologically advanced Ground sortation and delivery network with additional automation and new facilities. In fact, we've added 19 automated stations and 4 major distribution centers to FedEx Ground since the peak season last year alone. We've also added more reliable and efficient aircraft to the FedEx Express fleet over the last year. 
And while the advanced automation provides us a competitive advantage in sortation and speed, the key to our success during the peak continues to be our people. Across the FedEx portfolio, we expect to once again add more than 50,000 seasonal positions to help the holidays arrive. Based upon growth expectations and network expansion, many of these seasonal team members will have an opportunity for full-time work in FedEx after the holidays. These investments in people, facilities, aircraft and technology are all made to enable us to provide outstanding service even during the busiest days of the year.
As a further commitment to delivering outstanding service and in recognition of Christmas falling on Sunday this year, we've adjusted some service commitments for shipments tendered the week of Christmas. FedEx Express will be delivering on Saturday, December 24, Christmas Eve, but it is not a service day for FedEx Ground. FedEx Hold at Location is also a delivery option for customers on Christmas Eve. All service adjustments have already been communicated to customers as part of an extensive planning and collaboration effort to meet customer needs and enable outstanding service across the FedEx portfolio throughout peak.
And now I'll turn it over to Alan Graf."

For FedEx Corporation, adjusted EPS climbed 20%, $2.90 per share. Revenues increased 19% to $14.7 billion with the addition of TNT Express. Consolidated adjusted operating margin was 9.3%. We continue to increase profits while investing in the business. First quarter results improved due to higher operating income at Express, where base yields improved and expense growth was constrained; and at Ground, where volume and yield grew. Offsetting factors included higher network expansion costs at Ground. These adjusted numbers exclude the integration and restructuring program costs, intangible asset amortization

TNT Express.
Ground volume continued to grow. Segment operating income increased 14% and margin increased to 14.2% due to volume and yield growth and lower self-insurance cost. Headwinds included higher operational costs due to network expansion and higher purchased transportation rates. Comparisons were easier due to higher self-insurance reserves last year. We aren't expecting that benefit to continue, and comparisons for the rest of the year are expected to be more difficult. Ground business continues to grow nicely, driven in large part by e-commerce. We believe continued strategic investments will position Ground for long-term, profitable growth by increasing capacity and efficiency to better meet the dynamic needs of our customers. 
Investments include continued network expansion; integration of commercial and residential networks, including SmartPost; completing transition of our pick-up and delivery service providers through a single operating model who have service capacity and operational flexibility and incentives for our small business partners to equip their vehicles improved safety technology.
Freight's operating income increased 2% primarily due to higher volumes and a favorable comparison as a result of a charge for facility closure. These benefits were mostly offset by lower LTL revenue per shipment, also drove a small decline in operating margin. Freight continues to face a difficult macro environment and is working hard to manage costs and increase yields.
Express frankly knocked the ball out of the park in Q1. Adjusted operating income was up 19%, and adjusted operating margin grew 140 basis points to 9.7%. Adding to the bottom line at Express were base yield improvement, volume growth and cost management efforts. In addition to its day job, Express was busy integrating TNT. As a result, integration expenses of $22 million are included in the GAAP results for the FedEx Express segment. FedEx Express continues to manage network capacity to match customer demand, reduce structural cost, modernize its air fleet and drive continued productivity increases.
Beginning this quarter, we are reporting the operating results for FedEx Express and TNT in different segments. In our 10-Q, we will provide an overview of the FedEx Express Group, which is comprised of the 2 segments I just mentioned. Presentation of TNT in our financial statements, including purchase price allocation, is preliminary and will likely change in future periods, perhaps significantly, given the timing and complexity of the acquisition. We plan to complete our purchase price allocation no later than the fourth quarter of FY '17. We believe the TNT acquisition, largest acquisition in FedEx history, transformed the world's transportation logistics industry, rapidly accelerating our European and global growth strategy as 1/3 of total FedEx Corporation revenue now touches a country outside of the United States. 
We have a rich history of success in integrating businesses into FedEx, and we are doubling down our commitment to the TNT integration in terms of our people and financial resources. TNT's 56,000 team members deliver 1 million packages daily in over 200 countries. TNT's European road network connects more than 40 countries through 19 road hubs over 540 depots and will substantially enhance our global footprint by leveraging TNT's lower-cost road networks in Europe and in the Middle East and Asia as well. FedEx now has a strong presence in Europe, transportation options from Express to Economy, parcel and freight, helping not only our customers in Europe but also around the world shipping into Europe. We have similar and complementary corporate cultures and a common history of superior service and value to customers.
We had a seamless and very successful first day when we acquired TNT on May 25. Today is our 119th day of ownership of TNT. Prior to the close of the transaction, we invested about a year building an integration plan, and we are well positioned for success. Our new senior leadership team is established, and all key TNT activities and responsibilities have transitioned to the integrated FedEx senior officer team. Hundreds of town halls have occurred across the enterprise in operations, sales, marketing and other back-office functions. We have strong talent within the TNT legacy organization. The team members across both organizations are energized about the combination. We also have strong cultural alignment across the teams with a focus on our People-Service-Profit philosophy. 
We expect the integration to take 4 years and significant investments in people, capital and expense. These are network businesses and require a combination of our pick-up and delivery operations at a local level throughout stations and depots, our ground and air networks and our extensive operational clearance, sales and back-office IT systems. The IT investments that will be required are significant given the limited investment in IT at TNT over the last decade. This is also a key enabler of the integration and its benefits. We are bringing together the activities of team members across the globe. These activities and the pace are balanced against continuing to deliver world-class customer experience, drive returns for our shareholders.
Prior to acquisition, TNT announced its Outlook strategy to double its adjusted operating income and margin percentage by 2018. That profit improvement program includes various initiatives focused on yield management, operational efficiency and productivity as well as customer service. We are focusing on the initiatives and projects within Outlook to deliver the greatest benefits balanced with our 4-year integration plan. We are projecting TNT to be dilutive on a GAAP basis in FY '17 due to integration expenses, Outlook restructuring expenses and noncash intangible asset amortization. On an as-adjusted basis, excluding noncash intangible asset amortization, integration expenses and outlook expenses, we expect TNT to be accretive in FY '17 as the TNT Outlook restructuring program already started to lower cost.
We have seen almost immediate benefits as we begin the integration. In the U.S. and Canada, we are transitioning TNT's volume, formerly handled by third-party carriers, into the FedEx portfolio. In late September, we will begin consolidating depots, and we'll begin transitioning customers in October. We will complete the U.S. and Canada transition by the end of fiscal year '17. In addition, we have realized procurement and sourcing benefits transitioned 4 of TNT's third-party delivery partners into the FedEx direct-served operation or moved to a single third-party provider. And we'll launch our initial injection of FedEx volume into 5 select TNT European road network lanes later in September. We're off to a very solid start.
We see the combination of these 2 businesses as transformative and expect significant synergies from the integration. We will drive value from 4 key areas: optimized pick-up and delivery operations; an integrated global express network; improved efficiency of staff functions and processes; and revenue growth. 
We plan to optimize pick-up and delivery operations by implementing new technology and processes, optimizing the locations of facilities and stations without impacting service. And benefiting from the new pick-up and delivery efficiencies globally, parcels would utilize a lower cost, integrated pick-up and delivery network to achieve greater economies of scale. 
We plan to form one global express network by developing integrated solutions to track and route parcels and freight and fully integrating our intercontinental air network. We will have one global express air network with an optimized line-haul and hub strategy that will deliver the best service for our customers and significantly improve our costs. 
We plan to improve the efficiency of our staff functions and processes by optimizing our systems and processes, including IT; innovating, transforming and streamlining key support functions, such as human resources, legal, security and finance; achieving meaningful sourcing savings; lowering our effective tax rate over the long-term as synergies will drive additional international profits taxed that lower rates; and greater efficiency will lead to greater cost savings.
We will grow revenue with a best-in-class service portfolio with one sales team, single online tool for customer inquiries and invoices; revenue management activities that optimize yield, improve market share and increase profitability. As a result, customers will have access to a broader portfolio of services and will see value proposition improvements. 
We remain supremely confident in our initial views of the value of this acquisition and are targeting to exit the end of the 4-year integration with annual synergies of $750 million. Similar to our recently completed and successful profit improvement plan at Express, we do not believe that it's meaningful to give initial year-by-year guidance. The integration is complex, and the timing of integration restructuring expenses beyond fiscal year '17 are not yet crystallized. However, we ultimately get to our -- how we ultimately get to our target will evolve as market conditions and other factors change. We are highly confident in our target and our goals. We currently expect the aggregate integration program expense over the 4 years to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. Timing and amount of these integration-related estimates are subject to change as we implement and adjust our plans as necessary. In FY '18, TNT will be accretive, including integration and restructuring costs.
Turning to our corporate outlook. Based on the moderate economic forecast that Mike discussed and the momentum we have, we project adjusted earnings to be $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share for FY '17, which excludes TNT integration, Outlook restructuring costs, TNT intangible asset amortization and year-end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments. We are estimating combined TNT integration and Outlook restructuring expenses of about $275 million and TNT-related intangible asset amortization of about $115 million for FY '17. We'll expect our FY '17 integration CapEx for TNT to be about $100 million. Again, the timing and amount of these integration-related estimates are subject to change as our plans are refined. Meanwhile, Ground and Freight will continue to be focused on achieving their goals independent of the integration at Express.
Our total capital expenditures forecast remains at $5.6 billion in FY '17, including TNT. We anticipate that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our increased capital expenditures in FY '17, which will include spending for network expansion at Ground to support e-commerce growth and the continued aircraft fleet modernization at Express, which continues to lower our cost. Longer term, we would target CapEx 6% to 8% of revenues. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we are well positioned to continue to increase corporate earnings, dividends, cash flows, returns and margins.
Now we look forward to answering your strategic questions, and I will turn it back over to Fred."

What is the benefit of having the road Freight LTL/groupage business in addition to the package business? I presume these talks about TNT in Europe. Might it ultimately just be a small package network in Europe? 
So let me give you sort of a broad answer and then ask Mike and Dave Bronczek to jump in with any details they'd like to add. First of all, I'm not sure it is known as well as it should be that FedEx Express carries both pallets for Express Freight and packages and packets. And we are the market leader in the United States with our Express Freight. There are 3 services: overnight; 2 day; and then 2 to 3 day. And that is a very profitable service, and we have different pick-up and delivery vehicles optimized for Express Freight. And obviously, we have our package delivery vans in the Express network, mostly the Sprinter-sized vans. And those 2 streams of traffic come together at our airport and hub locations, where the pallets are sorted in one area and the packages in another and then they're joined together for the line-haul. So TNT is very similar in Europe to the way FedEx is organized in the United States that I just mentioned to you. They have terminals, which have pallet sortation facilities in one end, package sortations in the other. The main difference is they have had vehicles which do both pallets and larger business-to-business package deliveries. The attraction of TNT was manyfold, but I have to tell you that one of the key attractions was their unduplicated Express Freight network in Europe. And of course, Europe has a high density of population, and their ability to move these pallets very fast throughout Western Europe was a tremendous advantage. Now we have very extensive Express Freight capabilities in Brazil, Middle East, Southeast Asia and many other places around the world. So we will definitely continue in the Express Freight and the package business in the Express segment. Now let me hasten to add that our Express Freight business is very different than Mike Ducker's FedEx Freight unit. Average weight per shipment is almost 4x, the nature of the commodities is quite different, the pricing is quite different and so forth. Similarly, Henry Maier's FedEx Ground is quite different than FedEx Express' parcel operations. And in Europe, there is a very distinct Ground parcel sector where there are a number of competitors, but TNT's aggregate pallet and package business mainly in Europe but around the world was a very attractive feature of that company, which led us to have an interest in buying them. And we will very much continuing to provide International Priority freight and International Economy freight and intra-European freight and in those other areas and regions I mentioned to you. Mike?"

One of the big advantages of TNT -- and Fred's right that goes unnoticed, is their ability to handle a very profitable freight, and that's a part of their business that now we're going to put into our global network of parcels and pallets. And it's been very successful for us, and it's a nice part of the business that we added with TNT. It's also part of what we actually viewed when we went to Australia just a month ago. Fred Smith and I went to visit our colleagues in Australia TNT and our FedEx Express folks in Australia. The combination down there could be very, very powerful for us. We're looking at a way to make that whole marketplace much more successful, much more profitable, and it gives us an opportunity now to leverage one with the other that we didn't have in the past.

We strategically located these facilities in parts of the country where our experience and history has shown that shippers reside to ship these type packages and continue to investigate how we handle these in the future.

A lot of companies are starting to experiment with UAVs. Is FedEx experimenting as well? If so, how is that going and what do you think the timing would be of using UAVs both in the air and on the ground? Also, is it realistic to believe there could be unmanned trucks? Is FedEx going down this route? Grin, LOL, pun intended.
So Helane, obviously we at FedEx are very mindful of these trends. We have a number of activities underway in robotics in particular in the package handling sector. Henry and FedEx Ground are real leaders in this regard. In terms of UAV in particular, we have 5 separate -- I think it would be not fair to call all of them projects, but work streams or projects in both aviation and automated vehicles. The difference with us and a lot of other people, we just prefer to keep working those issues and tell you about them when they make a meaningful difference in the company. I will say this much, I think our philosophy -- and we know a lot about these technologies. After all, our autopilots and our 777 airplanes are among the most sophisticated robots in the world. They can take off, land the plane and taxi to the gate and turn themselves off if that's what we chose to do so. But it's very difficult in the foreseeable future to substitute for the well-trained pilot or driver or person, and we look at the use of automation more as an opportunity to improve the productivity of those types of experts within our system to make their job more comfortable and easy and above all, to increase safety. So those 5 work streams are underway. You'll hear a lot about them, I'm confident, in the next few years. But important in our philosophy, maybe slightly different than a lot of other people that think that right over the horizon everything is going to be an automated vehicle or some sort of UAV, we think that is unlikely. And that this technology like most technology, particularly aviation technology, will evolve incrementally over time with a great emphasis on safety first. So that's our UAV update.
Okay. Two questions from the call."

Both Domestic Express and international shipments will both carry a dim divisor of 139. In addition to that, obviously one of the key issues for us in managing the network is the density per package. And one of the challenges that we do see with the increase in e-commerce transactions is packaging that is not as efficient as it could be, and there are a number of benefits to becoming more efficient. You can use smaller packages, which is, one, obviously it's more sustainable from that perspective. And we encourage customers to take advantage of our state-of-the-art packaging lab to make sure that they maximize the packaging that they have to avoid these charges.

So let me just make one comment here an",448,"Okay. There are a couple of questions in here from Tom Wadewitz of UBS and Allison Landry essentially about density -- improving density levels and the issue of SmartPost deliveries by FedEx Ground, FedEx SmartPost. So let me just make one comment here and then ask Henry to talk about. I have said this over and over again for the last couple of years. There is a continuing misunderstanding of the issue of route densities, revenue per stop and the profundity of those metrics on the e-commerce business. And there's no one, no entity, that can provide the type of route density and cost for lightweight residential delivery as the postal services, both in this country and abroad. Postal Service in this country, correct me if I'm wrong here, Henry, makes 156 million stops per day. So they are a mail company that puts parcels in with the mail stream usually in very small vehicles, 200,000, 150 cubic foot jeeps. They are out with an RFP for somewhat larger vehicles and so forth. So the real question about e-commerce is what's the future of mail and what implications does that have on the price of the delivery of packages? Put a different way, it is mail that subsidizes the delivery of packages, not packages subsidizing delivery of mail. And the Postmaster General talks about this in her calls and so forth, and it has been a very, very good thing for the Postal Service that the big carriers like FedEx and UPS that have these enormous upstream systems can feed these lightweight residential packages into the postal business. They don't have to have that investment, the hubs, the sortations and so forth. And similarly, Amazon, of course, now has a very substantial direct injection on their own, but there is no comparable entity to the Postal Service in terms of density. And even the most rapid projections of e-commerce growth will not be a fraction of the density that the Postal Service has today. So there are these continuing, I mean, articles about this and more and more things are going to affect the density. My goodness. They would have to be quantum-ly greater than is the case. And so that's the real question about e-commerce is what are the price of those deliveries on a go-forward basis, which are driven either by density in the case of the Postal Service, or input costs. And so Henry, jump in here. This is the issue and it's very poorly understood and it -- I've called it everything I can think of: mythology or whatever you might want to say. But most of the commentary on this is not accurate."

So this is a moving target. And I would tell you, even with the tremendous growth all of us who participate in e-commerce are seeing, are really only delivered to a small percentage of those addresses every single day. We just happen to have very complex, state-of-the-art software tools that allow us to take a flood of packages, I guess for lack of a better word, with what we're presented with every day by our customers and optimize those packages for the most efficient delivery. Now what's been going on at FedEx Ground is really an understanding of this phenomenon and what e-commerce is doing with respect to changing our business. Our Holy Grail here is to improve delivery density and revenue per stop, and the only way you can do that in our network is with the network integration we've been going through for the last several years, which includes the integration of Ground and Home Delivery and now, since last September, we announced we're integrating SmartPost in that as well. Over the top of this is the technology needed to manage the most optimal route distribution of those packages every single day; having a single contract or network, which we announced in January we're moving to a single contract; and we expect to be essentially 90% done with all of this by 2020. You lay over our ability beginning earlier this year to be able to statically match packages that are destined to the same residential delivery address every single day and next summer the ability to do that virtually plus some additional engineering around deliveries on certain streets and neighborhoods when there's another residential package involved, and what we end up with here is a much more efficient, much more flexible, a network that has much lower costs, much better capital asset utilization going forward with the growth of e-commerce than the one we have today."

William Flinn just sent one in. When you think about the acquisitions you made over the past 30 years, which ones do you view as transformational?
Well, I guess if you stack rank them, the 3 that would be in top-tier categories would be Flying Tigers, which put us into an unprecedented position in the growing Asian market; certainly, Caliber/RPS, which is now FedEx Ground; and TNT would be right up there and it's going to be, as Alan said, a very, very significant earnings engine for us. And what's a little bit different about Tigers and Caliber and RPS, those gave us presences in adjacencies, in adjacent markets. Tiger's in the intercontinental business. We were much smaller as FedEx, and so we had to go out there and develop the business. Alan will remember this with keen detail like I do. We bought it at the optimally worst time. The Gulf War started and air cargo basically stopped, which was an interesting set of circumstances, but it put us in an unprecedented position. That's why we're the market leader in air cargo and air express. Caliber/RPS, of course, put us in the Ground segment, which we have not been in before, and through a lot of work by a lot of people, Mike Glenn in particular heading up some of these transitions we've made. Of course, it's a fabulous business now. And TNT, as Alan has told you there, I mean, we're going to get the synergies just from putting the companies together and then we're going to build additional profitability on top of that. So it's going to be a great thing, and I think Dave Bronczek and Alan have all said this, but let me just add to it: just wonderful people.

Welcome to our discussion of results for FedEx' Second Quarter Fiscal 2017, and happy holidays to everyone. Let me note on the front end, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 earnings forecast, and remember that the earnings forecast is",653,"Thank you, Mickey. Welcome to our discussion of results for FedEx' Second Quarter Fiscal 2017, and happy holidays to everyone. 
Let me note on the front end, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 earnings forecast, and remember that the earnings forecast is before year-end mark-to-market pension adjustments and excluding TNT Express integration and TNT's Outlook restructuring program costs and intangible asset amortization. But given those considerations, the range we put out there was $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share. And of course, Alan has more detail on that later. 
This will be a record peak for FedEx, and to date, with the exception of several local weather issues, our service levels have been outstanding. We appreciate the efforts of hundreds of thousands of FedEx team members who work very hard to make peak operations successful and to try to keep our Purple Promise daily, which states, I will make every FedEx experience outstanding. 
Our driving mix this year is a bit different by design as part of our longer-term commitment to continue to grow earnings, margins, cash flows and returns. Christmas falling on a Sunday has created anomalies and shipping patterns, and this week, we'll see disproportionately higher demand versus other holiday seasonal patterns in the past. 
FedEx' integration of TNT and FedEx Ground's continued integration of GENCO are well along and going very well with high morale and excellent execution. FedEx Express' integration expenses will peak next year in FY '18, and Express operating margins should widen and in fiscal years '18, '19 and '20. As previously noted, there are significant operational synergies in the TNT transaction, particularly in Europe. 
FedEx Express peak operations this year will result in excellent year-over-year profit and margin improvements, foreshadowing the longer-term outlook I just mentioned. Of course, our earnings outlook assumes continued modest global economic growth. 
Now FedEx Ground results will be affected this peak, followed with improving margins later this fiscal year versus the current quarter. This is due to the recent opening of 4 major hubs and 19 automated stations year-over-year. It's one of the most remarkable things I've seen since I've been in the business, to tell you the truth. And two, an effort to grow ground traffic in a more profitable manner than last year's trend at peak, which showed challenging growth of 20%. 
While we're committed to being a leader in the e-commerce market, it's important to recognize that non-e-commerce deliveries to residences and business-to-business traffic represents the vast majority of FedEx Corporation's estimated $60 billion in FY '17 revenues. 
Regarding business-to-business traffic, we are making major systems investments at FedEx Freight, which will result in significant margin improvement by year-end FY 2020. We believe this initiative will change the LTL landscape in a major way. 
Let me emphasize, FedEx is much more than a last-mile carrier. FedEx is a global transport and logistics company that can connect almost every person and business in the world in 1 to 2 business days door-to-door, and we provide unique value-added services across many industries. It's also important to reiterate that we do not manage our operating companies to maximize margins in each segment all the time, much less each quarter. 
Over 92% of our U.S. revenue comes from customers using both Express and Ground, and 76% of that U.S. revenue is generated by customers that use Express, Ground and Freight. We, therefore, may be investing in one segment of the portfolio at any given time to produce improved results for the corporation as a whole in the future. 
Now before I ask Mike Glenn to comment on the economic environment and traffic trends, let me again thank him for his 35 years of dedicated service to FedEx. At the end of the call, I'll have a few concluding comments about Mike's contribution before his retirement at the end of this month. Alan Graf will follow Mike with more detailed financial analysis. Mike?"

I'll open with our economic update and outlook and then discuss our performance and business conditions in each segment, including revenue, volume and yield; and provide some commentary on broader industry trends as we come to the close of another record holiday shopping season. 
We see moderate growth in the global economy. After growing just 1.6% in calendar '16, we expect U.S. GDP growth of 2.2% in calendar '17, anchored by continued robust consumer spending and strong business investment. Industrial production should rebound after contracting 0.9% in calendar '16 to a forecasted 1.6% growth next year. For the global economy, we forecast growth of 2.2% for calendar '16 and 2.6% for calendar '17. 
Now I'll review revenue volume and yield trends by segment. U.S. Domestic Express package revenue grew 2% year-over-year during the second quarter. Yield per package increased 3% as a result of improved rate and discount. Fuel, for the first time in a long time, did not have a material impact on yield per package and revenue during the quarter. Domestic Express package volume declined 1% year-over-year during the quarter. FedEx International export package revenue increased 2% year-over-year in Q2. FedEx International Priority volume increased 2%, while International Economy volume also grew 2%. International export yield increased 1%, primarily driven by the positive impact of rate and discount changes; higher weight per package and regional mix, which outweighed the negative impact of exchange rates. Again, fuel did not have a material impact on yields. 
Ground transportation revenue increased 9% year-over-year, while average daily volume increased 5% year-over-year. Ground yield per package increased 4% year-over-year, benefiting from yield improvement in both Ground and SmartPost. Fuel did not have a material impact on increases in revenue or yield per package. 
FedEx Freight segment revenue increased 3% year-over-year in Q2. If you exclude the impact of the fuel surcharge revenue, Freight revenue increased 3.6%. 
Average daily LTL shipments increased 4% year-over-year. The continued strength in shipment volume is driven by our sales efforts and reflects the speed, reliability and choice of priority and economy service for our LTL customers. 
Revenue per LTL shipment in Q2 was flat year-over-year and was impacted by a slightly lower diesel fuel prices and lower weight per LTL shipment. Excluding fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per LTL shipment was up slightly. 
We're closing out what has been another busy peak season for FedEx, largely driven by the continued rapid growth of e-commerce. Trends continued to evolve, as Fred noted, and we're proud of the year-long preparation and collaboration with customers that has allowed us to deliver outstanding service during this period of intense increase in demand. 
As e-commerce grows, so does the challenge of peak, with multiple days of volume levels approaching or surpassing double our average daily volume. It should be noted that this surge in demand is driven primarily by a relatively small number of customers. Less than 50 large retail and e-tail customer's responsible for the majority of peak demand, so it's extremely important that we understand their forecast well in advance to allow us to plan resources properly. 
While a few customers this year have experienced demand below their forecast, the majority of our large retail and e-tail customers are meeting expectations. Again, we're proud of the outstanding service that we've been able to provide. The secret, of course, is our people. We continue to work hard to deliver for our customers throughout the holiday season and beyond. 
The rapid rise in e-commerce continues to drive the need for alternative delivery options. FedEx understands that the ways people live, work and connect are ever changing. We have long recognized that information about the packages is as important as the package itself, and our long-term investments and focus on IT and mobile technologies has allowed us to offer customers truly innovative and useful alternative delivery options. This, of course, includes FedEx Delivery Manager, which gives customers access with a phone or tablet to options such as appointment delivery and the ability to reroute packages to one of our FedEx Offices or locations -- FedEx Office locations or third-party locations for secure pick up. 
We continue to have strong growth and demand for Pack Plus, which features dedicated packing professionals and supplies inside FedEx Office locations. The professionals at FedEx Office work with customers, large and small, to provide standard and customized packaging options for even large bulk and fragile items. None of this would be possible without the dedication of our more than 400,000 team members at work right now around the world to help the holidays arrive. 
Our service levels have been outstanding, with on-time deliveries at record levels even on some of the busiest days in the history of FedEx, and it's all because of our people. I want to share a special acknowledgment and commend them for their hard work and outstanding effort this peak season. Alan?"

I have a couple of introductory comments and will then move to my financial review and outlook. First to Mike Glenn. 
Mike, in our 35 years of working together, we have done literally scores of earnings calls. As this is your last one, I want to thank you for everything you have done to help make this company great. You are a consummate professional and the best marketing sales and communications executive anywhere. You've been a fantastic business partner. I look forward to many future years of friendship with you. Okay. 
The FedEx Corporation second quarter FY '17 results. Today, we announced the second quarter FY '17 adjusted earnings per share climbed 8.5% to $2.80. Adjusted operating income increased, with the inclusion of TNT Express and improved results at FedEx Express, as it continues to grow base yields and control costs. This performance was partially offset by lower operating income at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight. 
Our effective tax rate was 35.1% for the second quarter and 36.3% for the first half of 2017 compared with 34.5% in the second quarter and 35.3% in the first half of 2016. The first half tax rate in 2017 has been negatively impacted by local country losses in some entities within TNT Express for which no tax benefit could be recognized due to the uncertainty as to the utilization of these losses. This year-to-date negative impact was partially offset from the benefit of early adopting the accounting standards update for share-based payments in the second quarter. 
Longer term, as the synergies from the TNT Express acquisition result in greater international profits, we expect our effective tax rate to be lower than the rate in recent years. The tax rates in 2016 were favorably impacted by the resolution of a estate tax matter. There was also a gain from the sale of an investment in other income that added $0.08 per diluted share. 
Looking at Express. Revenues increased 2% to $6.7 billion, as base yields improved and package volume grew. Adjusted operating profit increased by $32 million or 5%. Adjusted operating income and margin improved as higher base yields drove revenue growth. Base yield growth was driven by U.S. domestic and international export package. Revenue growth due to volume increases was driven by International Priority package and Freight. Expense growth was driven by merit pay increases, higher insurance costs and increased depreciation due to aircraft introductions. Fuel price and exchange rate changes had little net impact for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin increased to 9.7%. 
At TNT, revenues were $1.9 billion, with an adjusted operating profit of $90 million. Adjusted operating margin was 4.7%. The TNT Express integration continues to proceed as planned. We estimate approximately $250 million in expenses during FY '17 as a result of the TNT Express integration and Outlook restructuring programs. We continue to expect the aggregate integration program expense over the 4 years to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. 
The TNT Express intangible asset amortization declined to $10 million in Q2, as we continue to update our purchase price allocation. We now expect the intangible asset amortization to be $38 million in the second half of FY '17 and $75 million for the full year. We still expect our FY '17 integration CapEx for TNT to be about $100 million, with total TNT CapEx at about USD 500 million. We expect annual pretax synergies, following the completion of the integration program in fiscal 2020, to be $750 million. We will have a full update on the TNT integration and outlook on the March call, and I'm not going to say much more about that today. 
At FedEx Freight, higher average daily LTL shipments helped FedEx Freight increase revenues 3%. Freight's competitive advantage of having the fastest published transit science in the LTL industry is driving higher growth in its priority service. The impact of lower weight per shipment and higher information technology expenses drove operating income lower. Freight continues to face a difficult macro environment and is working to manage costs and increase yields. 
For FedEx Ground, volume growth in residential services and commercial business, along with yield growth, helped push revenues up 9%. 
Operating income fell 12%, and operating margin declined to 10.5% due to increased rent, depreciation and staffing related to network expansion as well as higher purchased transportation rates. 
E-commerce continues to drive revenue growth, which provides a great opportunities as well as a difficult challenges. 
After challenges from higher-than-expected volumes in certain parts of the country during last peak, Ground invested in increased capacity and technology. This year, we completed 185 facility projects, including 4 major distribution hubs, 19 fully automated stations and 69 relocations. This equates to more than 10 million square feet of additional sortation space in the network. And all that comes at a cost above and beyond CapEx investment, including rent, building insurance and property tax. We also incurred higher costs from significant additional staffing as we hired and trained people, sometimes months in advance of the facility opening. And of course, purchased transportation increased as we pay contracted service providers to pick up, deliver and transport a growing number of packages. While these buildings and their state-of-the-art technology are a significant investment, they ensure that we have the capacity, flexibility and efficiency needed to handle e-commerce and commercial growth. 
Although our network projects are impacting Ground's near-term profitability, the investments will enhance long-term returns and cash flow. We are also working to better balance capacity and volume to improve revenue quality and margins. These actions contributed to the second quarter volume results and are also expected to mute third quarter volume growth. 
At FedEx Ground, home delivery and SmartPost network integration and delivery optimization initiatives continue. They will increase facility productivity and delivery density over time. We are also investing in technology to improve safety and mitigate rising insurance costs. We are committed to increasing margins at Ground over the longer term. 
Turning to our corporate outlook. Based on a moderate economic forecast that Mike discussed, we reaffirm expected earnings before year-end mark-to-market pension adjustments, and excluding TNT Express integration and Outlook restructuring cost and intangible asset amortization of $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share for FY '17. Our total capital expenditure forecast remains at $5.6 billion in FY '17, including TNT. This month, we made a $178 million contribution that was required to our pension fund, and next month, we plan to make a $1 billion debt-funded voluntary contribution to our tax-qualified U.S. domestic pension plans. 
Now we look forward to answering your strategic questions."

Let me make a comment about Ground expansion and then ask Mike to put more color on my remarks about Ground growth and our effort to manage our traffic a bit better than was the case in the past, and then Henry can jump in on margins. First, as it applies to the network expansion, I mentioned this in my remarks. But these facilities that FedEx Ground had put in place are enormous operations. Some of these things, correct me if I'm wrong, Henry, here -- like 250 acres plus. And the amount of sortation equipment inside are measured in miles, not in feet, and they're able to sort tens and tens of thousands of packages. So as the scale of this network has increased, the reality is we have to put the employees and the training in there. You can't just sort of open them up when the traffic is required. And the only reason I bring this up is that I'm consistently surprised, maybe more so by the popular media, with just the misunderstanding of the gigantic scale of the FedEx and UPS operations and, of course, the Postal Service as well, but the Postal Service is much more last mile rather than upstream. So I just want to put that in perspective. And given the level of capital that we put into the Ground business, it is very important for us that we get a good return on it. Now we don't have to get an immediate return. As I've said over and over again, and again today, we don't manage FedEx Corporation as a sum of the parts. We manage it as a broad market segment. And a few years ago, when Ground had less residential traffic, I mean, it was basically supporting increased growth in the corporation's earnings when we put a lot of effort into reengineering the Express system. So with that in mind, let me talk -- let me ask Mike then to give some color to give some color to our traffic management efforts."

But as I've said many times on this call, our objective is to strike the right balance between volume growth and yield improvement to maximize operating margins at each operating company. In that regard, we're constantly looking at opportunities to do that. And over the last several month or so, we've made some decisions to discontinue relationships with a few customers where we couldn't candidly agree on pricing and capacity requirements for this peak season. And that's something we do on a regular basis, but we made that decision earlier this year. And as a result of that, we have been managing volumes, and we'll continue to do that. But clearly, it's had some effect on this peak season, but that was intentional on our part, and we'll continue to do that going forward."

So is that where the margin degradation really is occurring? Or is there some competitive pressure from the post office? Can you guys talk more?

In addition, in the second quarter, not only did we have to staff those facilities, and as Fred noted, these are sizable operations. Some of them take, not hundreds, but up to almost 1,000 people to staff and train. And in addition to that, at the same period of time that these facilities are coming online, we're staffing up for peak. So those are the 2 major expense drivers. Obviously, when volume goes up, revenue goes up. We must pay higher purchase transportation expenses because we pay contractors more. There's higher postage and higher linehaul settlement in moving that volume. So those are the drivers here."

Let me just add one other thing here because I think you hit the nail on the head and it relates back to Mike Glenn's comments. As I mentioned in my remarks, what keeps the lights on here, the vast majority of our revenue in FedEx Corporation is business-to-business. And a lot of it is business to consumer but it's not e-commerce. It may be all kinds of things. We look at these accounts every day, you'd be surprised. So e-commerce is basically residential deliveries. And you have to keep in balance the business-to-business and the business-to-consumer e-commerce or you can put extreme pressure on our Ground business. And so that is exactly what we were doing in making the decisions on these accounts that Mike mentioned. So no question, we're trying to manage that in an appropriate manner because just business-to-residential business -- I mean, the Postal Service is the biggest at all makes no money out of it. That should tell you something right there, and they're making millions of stops a day. So you can't be in our side of the business and not manage this.

Where can you continue to increase technology investments to decrease the need for peak seasonal hiring? 
We're going to ask Rob Carter to mention this, but let me just emphasize one more time. The FedEx Ground system is the most automated such system that you could possibly imagine. The reason for that is FedEx Ground was built in the age of computerization, so if you go to these great, big facilities, it may require a lot of people to offload and load trucks, but that requires no people to sort things. Now the FedEx Express system is a bit different because you have to have the flexibility to move things from one ramp to another and on down the line. But these things are marvels of automation, and over time, we will get even more out of this automation. And in that regard, I'll ask Rob Carter to comment on it."

I mean,, in fact, we have 105 fully automated facilities in the Ground network now, not just the hubs that we're talking about, but the audit stations that exist that drive incredible automation in that network. And that automation contributes not only during peak, for Ken's question, but all year long. But virtually, all of our technology investments and operations contribute to increased efficiency and productivity throughout the operation, and they are incredibly valuable to us. Route optimization, for example, is driving incredible efficiencies as we're out on the road. We're increasing route density and stop density all across the network in Freight, Ground and Express with the route technology. But Mike also mentioned in his comments the customer-facing technologies, which are improving these efficiencies as well. Things like Delivery Manager that are giving customers more choices that increase security and convenience. But at the same time, with those choices, customers are then driving into some of our convenience network. Increased stop density and route density, that improves our operational efficiency as well. So all down the line, everything from analytics about better ways to load trailers to sensors that are automating and optimizing scan technology are driving really incredible efficiencies in the network. And all this is already in market today, but is being perfected year by year by year to increase and improve efficiency in the network. So the answer is yes, Ken, but the reality is it's improving efficiencies all year round, not just in peak."

And actually, since the profit improvement plan went in, in FY '13, we're up 140%. So how about those numbers? On the issue of the volume in United States domestic, we had some issues in the volume off the West -- East Coast, primarily due to Hurricane Matthew. We had a typhoon, too, that actually had the West Coast. So we had a little bit of an issue on both sides of the coast for us. But in the main, we are about where we thought we were to -- would be.

These huge facilities that we're opening up at FedEx Ground are being opened with the firm belief that our FedEx Ground traffic is going to grow, whether it's B2B or whether it's B2C. And for all of the reasons that Rob Carter mentioned to you and Henry commented upon, these facilities, when they open up, aren't nearly at their max capacity. So as more volume goes through these sorting facilities, the marginal cost of sorting, because it's all automated, is shockingly low. So there's huge amount of leverage into these network investments, or as Alan and I both have said, we wouldn't be making them. Now you get to the point on the yield side of the house because you start talking about pickup and delivery and linehaul expenses versus the network infrastructure. There's where it's important to have the appropriate mix of traffic so that you keep your linehaul and your PUD costs at a reasonable relationship, but the bow wave of putting these fixed facilities out will be accretive to margins as more volume goes through there, regardless of whether it's B2B or B2C, and particularly, as Henry puts one network together with these initiatives that he's described to you and which culminates I think in FY '19 or 20? 20.

Listen, there's 3 distinct phases of the integration of SmartPost into Ground, and I apologize because we probably haven't been as clear on this as we need to be. The first was dissolving the corporate entity and moving SmartPost employees and management into Ground. That happened back in September of last year, September 15. What I would call Phase 2 was beginning of the diversion of outbound SmartPost volume from their facilities into ground hubs, which helped improve load factor, drove down linehaul costs and improved service. There are 2 parts to what we call delivery optimization or internally here, we call it the Terminator. The first part of that came in January of 2016, which was really the ability to manually divert volume that we knew had a high likelihood of matching the Ground package or better yet, just needed to be in the Ground network. The second phase or the second part of this comes in July of '17, next summer, when we will get the ability to virtually divert packages, where the system will see matches and automatically divert them out of SmartPost into FedEx Ground. We won't fully realize the benefits of that capability until fiscal '19 and beyond."

It involves discussing the potential impact of 100% expense in -- expensing significant earnings that could be outside U.S., could be repatriated and impact to our health care plan. So let me take that those in reverse order. We have an outstanding health care plan to our teammates, but it does not meet the definition of a Cadillac plan. So like everyone else, we'll be watching this developments as they unfold but we're very pleased with what are delivering for our teammates. At May 31, we had about 1.6 billion of permanently reinvested offshore and have about $775 million in cash offshore, but we currently plan to use that cash to fund Express TNT needs offshore and have no plans to repatriate that to the U.S. That also is a statement that says we're not going to be taxed on those earnings that we've left [ph] outside. If we are, we'll probably bring some of that back to pay those taxes. The bigger issue for all of you to look at longer-term for us is the features that are in the GOP blueprint in President-elect Trump plan that we like a lot. And those include materially lowering the tax rate, the effective territorial treatment of foreign earnings and current expensing of CapEx. We think that will positively impact our top line through stronger economic growth. And of course, the bottom line potentially a very big way through the lower tax rate. Having said that, we are concerned about the border adjustability concept and are trying to figure out how it will affect us directly as well as our customers and trade and global growth in general. And right now, there's a huge debate going on that. So as always, the devil's [ph] going to be into details, and we'll just have to report back to you later as this begins to unfold. But if you think about our tax rate this year in the 36% to 37% range, 20% tax rate would be mighty fine Christmas gift."

Alan mentioned that we're not a Cadillac plan at the moment. The reason we're not a Cadillac plan is because we adjusted our plan when the Affordable Care Act to move to more consumer-driven health care with much better tools for our teammates to buy health care more expertly in a lower costs. We did things like put in clinics at our high employment locations, and we also keep all of our employees HRAs in order for them to pay for some of their deductibles and so forth. So we avoided hitting the Cadillac tax because of the steps that we took. Now if ACA is not modified in that respect, given health care inflation, there's a good chance we would hit the Cadillac tax in the out years, which would result in truly onerous taxes on the benefits above the Cadillac tax level of 40%. So one of the most important things that we would like to see in the reform of the Affordable Care Act is to do away with the Cadillac tax limit. And that will give us the freedom to do some other things in our health care that we might not be able to do as long as we're on the trajectory towards a 40% excise tax. It really penalizes excellent health care plans like we have relative to other folks. So it's important to understand that context of our health care plan design, which was a reaction to the Affordable Care Act and act in a very significant cost that will be incurred in the excise tax in the Cadillac tax plan. I might say this parenthetically to that, that this past year, we paid how much it ACA taxes was it, Alan? $65 million?"

Okay. One more. So there are about 3 or 4 questions here on macro and trade in particular. There's 1 from David Vernon. There's another 1 from Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank, David Vaux of Stifel. So I'm going to put this all together, if you don't mind. 
Obviously, we are very concerned about the trade issue, which is one of the reasons that I gave a speech on the night of December at the Competitiveness Institute [ph], which was scheduled long before the election results were known because both the Democrats and the Republicans were running on anti-trade platform. So if you go to policy.fedex.com, you can read that speech. It is not a polemic and it's not a political speech. It is just a factual speech, which points out that 1 in 5 Americans jobs are related to trade, and we have a trade surplus and services in trade. We have a surplus when you take the 20 countries that we have free trade agreements with. So the prospect of significantly reducing trade is, in our opinion, significantly dangerous, and the proper approach is to leap into trade and try to remove barriers, which by the way, the Trans-Pacific partnership did to our exports, not to stop people from selling products and services to us. So I hope that, that will make a difference in the debate out there. I would point out, there's an excellent article in Barron's, but I forget the gentleman's first name, Epstein, which sound very similar themes. And again, it's fact-based, it's not politically based. So we hope these things would be considered. And I think what Alan said to you about the border adjustable tax is spot on. This is just very destructive of trade. It's not a proper solution to the problem. I think they lowered the tax rate and went to territorial. It would accomplish 95% of all of the benefits they're looking for and ignite a significant investment in the United States. It would solve the inversion problem. So they've got some very, very good people in this cabinet. And finally, I think the second-largest economy in the world is China. In the speech I just mentioned, we were very direct on our own experiences with China and Japan. In terms of their tendencies to engage in mercantile-less [ph] practices. And we feel very strongly it's in China's best interest to open up their markets and many of the things that the Chinese administrations are trying to accomplish would be facilitated by opening up rather than keeping their markets closed. So we're worried about it, but we hope that all of these facts will be carefully considered before the Congress or the administration does anything, which might be injurious based on the facts of the matter."

So traffic levels are affected on the margin by exchange rates. So when you have the dollar running up to the extent that it has here recently, which has been significant, U.S. exports are not as affordable and attractive to people on -- in other areas. So it puts a lot of pressure on U.S. exports. On the other side of the coin, with the diminution in the value of the euro or in other currency, it obviously makes their goods less expensive to the United States. So you will see with some adjustment disproportionate traffic growth there given the fact that we've got a great sales people on both sides off all of the oceans. So I don't think you should read into that on these small prohibitions anything more than exchange rates adjustments. Now over the longer haul, assuming there's good macroeconomic policy, which quite frankly is not the case in most places around and hopefully will be the case with tax reform here, you'll see economic growth.

As to the gain on the sale of investment, because this rose to the level that it did, a materiality of $0.08, we thought we'd alert you to that. We have hundreds of little bitty items that go plus and minus in every quarter that we don't talk to you about because they don't which the level of materiality, but this one did. So it's also in the range, but it's only $0.08 and the range is $0.50 wide. I will point out in the second quarter, year-over-year, our tax rate was higher, and our tax rate is complicated as we absorbed TNT and work through our new tax planning structure and I went to see what comes out of Washington. So standby. That's the one that I got the least confident about, but we'll keep at it."

So I would say that this is that we will stick with. I think we still have some work to do in terms of where we cite them. And I think I mentioned this on other calls in here. There's also some pretty promising advancements and material handling technology to handle these kind of packages. And as we learn more about that and as we experience whether the benefits that are promised actually there, I think the next step will be trying to figure out how we retrofit existing facilities with that new material handling technology."

We've been saying for a couple of years now that we believe FedEx Corporation's earnings, margins, cash flows and returns will go up. So let me reiterate that again that we believe that to be the case. The reason we think that they're going to go up is because the structure of our networks are such that there is leverage in those networks. And in the Express system, for instance, we're refleeting much more efficient. We're moving our International Economy and not offset systems. We have much more capacity in Europe, the pick-up and delivery density in Europe than the Ground situation. I just mentioned, the fact that these investments in these facilities, as more and more volume goes through there, they are accretive of and by themselves. In the Freight area, we are very confident that the technologies that we have, which by the way, allowed us for the first time in the history of the LTL business to offer both a priority and economy service. Nobody had a technology to do that. It would have been literally a scheduling impossibility absent the sophistication of the technology. Now we're applying that same technology to get more leverage out of our facilities in terms of throughput, cross dock, if you will, on Freight, better loading. We have robots under test that I could go on here all afternoon. There are just numerous places where we think we have increased earnings leverage with increased volume. An equal part of that, however, is to be, as Mike Glenn has said several times, you have to be disciplined. The reality in the transportation business, and for that matter, brought it into the transportation and logistics business, these markets are so huge. You can get a lot of volume that is completely noncompensatory and just not make any money. And there are a large number of transportation and logistics companies that prove that every quarter making no money. And some of them are pretty damn big. So we just have a lot of leverage points, and that's why we say what we have said. If that changes,  we'll say that, too. But we're not prepared to give you, despite my best efforts to do so, over the General Counsel's objections to do what that is. But Alan is very good at giving you the ranges at the start of the year, and we're very confident that we can increase our margins, cash flows, earnings per share and our returns with what we're doing. I'm going to say one thing again that I've said in my opening remark. This is an enormous enterprise, and I can't tell you on any 1 given quarter that we're going to have everything lined up in every segment. If I did that, it would be incorrect and misleading. What I can say is that we think we can manage those metrics I just gave you."

Welcome to our discussion of results for FedEx' Second Quarter Fiscal 2017, and happy holidays to everyone. Let me note on the front end, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 earnings forecast, and remember that the earnings forecast is",653,"Thank you, Mickey. Welcome to our discussion of results for FedEx' Second Quarter Fiscal 2017, and happy holidays to everyone. 
Let me note on the front end, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 earnings forecast, and remember that the earnings forecast is before year-end mark-to-market pension adjustments and excluding TNT Express integration and TNT's Outlook restructuring program costs and intangible asset amortization. But given those considerations, the range we put out there was $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share. And of course, Alan has more detail on that later. 
This will be a record peak for FedEx, and to date, with the exception of several local weather issues, our service levels have been outstanding. We appreciate the efforts of hundreds of thousands of FedEx team members who work very hard to make peak operations successful and to try to keep our Purple Promise daily, which states, I will make every FedEx experience outstanding. 
Our driving mix this year is a bit different by design as part of our longer-term commitment to continue to grow earnings, margins, cash flows and returns. Christmas falling on a Sunday has created anomalies and shipping patterns, and this week, we'll see disproportionately higher demand versus other holiday seasonal patterns in the past. 
FedEx' integration of TNT and FedEx Ground's continued integration of GENCO are well along and going very well with high morale and excellent execution. FedEx Express' integration expenses will peak next year in FY '18, and Express operating margins should widen and in fiscal years '18, '19 and '20. As previously noted, there are significant operational synergies in the TNT transaction, particularly in Europe. 
FedEx Express peak operations this year will result in excellent year-over-year profit and margin improvements, foreshadowing the longer-term outlook I just mentioned. Of course, our earnings outlook assumes continued modest global economic growth. 
Now FedEx Ground results will be affected this peak, followed with improving margins later this fiscal year versus the current quarter. This is due to the recent opening of 4 major hubs and 19 automated stations year-over-year. It's one of the most remarkable things I've seen since I've been in the business, to tell you the truth. And two, an effort to grow ground traffic in a more profitable manner than last year's trend at peak, which showed challenging growth of 20%. 
While we're committed to being a leader in the e-commerce market, it's important to recognize that non-e-commerce deliveries to residences and business-to-business traffic represents the vast majority of FedEx Corporation's estimated $60 billion in FY '17 revenues. 
Regarding business-to-business traffic, we are making major systems investments at FedEx Freight, which will result in significant margin improvement by year-end FY 2020. We believe this initiative will change the LTL landscape in a major way. 
Let me emphasize, FedEx is much more than a last-mile carrier. FedEx is a global transport and logistics company that can connect almost every person and business in the world in 1 to 2 business days door-to-door, and we provide unique value-added services across many industries. It's also important to reiterate that we do not manage our operating companies to maximize margins in each segment all the time, much less each quarter. 
Over 92% of our U.S. revenue comes from customers using both Express and Ground, and 76% of that U.S. revenue is generated by customers that use Express, Ground and Freight. We, therefore, may be investing in one segment of the portfolio at any given time to produce improved results for the corporation as a whole in the future. 
Now before I ask Mike Glenn to comment on the economic environment and traffic trends, let me again thank him for his 35 years of dedicated service to FedEx. At the end of the call, I'll have a few concluding comments about Mike's contribution before his retirement at the end of this month. Alan Graf will follow Mike with more detailed financial analysis. Mike?"

I'll open with our economic update and outlook and then discuss our performance and business conditions in each segment, including revenue, volume and yield; and provide some commentary on broader industry trends as we come to the close of another record holiday shopping season. 
We see moderate growth in the global economy. After growing just 1.6% in calendar '16, we expect U.S. GDP growth of 2.2% in calendar '17, anchored by continued robust consumer spending and strong business investment. Industrial production should rebound after contracting 0.9% in calendar '16 to a forecasted 1.6% growth next year. For the global economy, we forecast growth of 2.2% for calendar '16 and 2.6% for calendar '17. 
Now I'll review revenue volume and yield trends by segment. U.S. Domestic Express package revenue grew 2% year-over-year during the second quarter. Yield per package increased 3% as a result of improved rate and discount. Fuel, for the first time in a long time, did not have a material impact on yield per package and revenue during the quarter. Domestic Express package volume declined 1% year-over-year during the quarter. FedEx International export package revenue increased 2% year-over-year in Q2. FedEx International Priority volume increased 2%, while International Economy volume also grew 2%. International export yield increased 1%, primarily driven by the positive impact of rate and discount changes; higher weight per package and regional mix, which outweighed the negative impact of exchange rates. Again, fuel did not have a material impact on yields. 
Ground transportation revenue increased 9% year-over-year, while average daily volume increased 5% year-over-year. Ground yield per package increased 4% year-over-year, benefiting from yield improvement in both Ground and SmartPost. Fuel did not have a material impact on increases in revenue or yield per package. 
FedEx Freight segment revenue increased 3% year-over-year in Q2. If you exclude the impact of the fuel surcharge revenue, Freight revenue increased 3.6%. 
Average daily LTL shipments increased 4% year-over-year. The continued strength in shipment volume is driven by our sales efforts and reflects the speed, reliability and choice of priority and economy service for our LTL customers. 
Revenue per LTL shipment in Q2 was flat year-over-year and was impacted by a slightly lower diesel fuel prices and lower weight per LTL shipment. Excluding fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per LTL shipment was up slightly. 
We're closing out what has been another busy peak season for FedEx, largely driven by the continued rapid growth of e-commerce. Trends continued to evolve, as Fred noted, and we're proud of the year-long preparation and collaboration with customers that has allowed us to deliver outstanding service during this period of intense increase in demand. 
As e-commerce grows, so does the challenge of peak, with multiple days of volume levels approaching or surpassing double our average daily volume. It should be noted that this surge in demand is driven primarily by a relatively small number of customers. Less than 50 large retail and e-tail customer's responsible for the majority of peak demand, so it's extremely important that we understand their forecast well in advance to allow us to plan resources properly. 
While a few customers this year have experienced demand below their forecast, the majority of our large retail and e-tail customers are meeting expectations. Again, we're proud of the outstanding service that we've been able to provide. The secret, of course, is our people. We continue to work hard to deliver for our customers throughout the holiday season and beyond. 
The rapid rise in e-commerce continues to drive the need for alternative delivery options. FedEx understands that the ways people live, work and connect are ever changing. We have long recognized that information about the packages is as important as the package itself, and our long-term investments and focus on IT and mobile technologies has allowed us to offer customers truly innovative and useful alternative delivery options. This, of course, includes FedEx Delivery Manager, which gives customers access with a phone or tablet to options such as appointment delivery and the ability to reroute packages to one of our FedEx Offices or locations -- FedEx Office locations or third-party locations for secure pickup. 
We continue to have strong growth and demand for Pack Plus, which features dedicated packing professionals and supplies inside FedEx Office locations. The professionals at FedEx Office work with customers, large and small, to provide standard and customized packaging options for even large bulk and fragile items. None of this would be possible without the dedication of our more than 400,000 team members at work right now around the world to help the holidays arrive. 
Our service levels have been outstanding, with on-time deliveries at record levels even on some of the busiest days in the history of FedEx, and it's all because of our people. I want to share a special acknowledgment and commend them for their hard work and outstanding effort this peak season. Alan?"

Mike, in our 35 years of working together, we have done literally scores of earnings calls. As this is your last one, I want to thank you for everything you have done to help make this company great. You are a consummate professional and the best marketing sales and communications executive anywhere. You've been a fantastic business partner. I look forward to many future years of friendship with you. Okay. 
The FedEx Corporation second quarter FY '17 results. Today, we announced the second quarter FY '17 adjusted earnings per share climbed 8.5% to $2.80. Adjusted operating income increased, with the inclusion of TNT Express and improved results at FedEx Express, as it continues to grow base yields and control costs. This performance was partially offset by lower operating income at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight. 
Our effective tax rate was 35.1% for the second quarter and 36.3% for the first half of 2017 compared with 34.5% in the second quarter and 35.3% in the first half of 2016. The first half tax rate in 2017 has been negatively impacted by local country losses in some entities within TNT Express for which no tax benefit could be recognized due to the uncertainty as to the utilization of these losses. This year-to-date negative impact was partially offset from the benefit of early adopting the accounting standards update for share-based payments in the second quarter. 
Longer term, as the synergies from the TNT Express acquisition result in greater international profits, we expect our effective tax rate to be lower than the rate in recent years. The tax rates in 2016 were favorably impacted by the resolution of a estate tax matter. There was also a gain from the sale of an investment in other income that added $0.08 per diluted share. 
Looking at Express. Revenues increased 2% to $6.7 billion, as base yields improved and package volume grew. Adjusted operating profit increased by $32 million or 5%. Adjusted operating income and margin improved as higher base yields drove revenue growth. Base yield growth was driven by U.S. domestic and international export package. Revenue growth due to volume increases was driven by International Priority package and Freight. Expense growth was driven by merit pay increases, higher insurance costs and increased depreciation due to aircraft introductions. Fuel price and exchange rate changes had little net impact for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin increased to 9.7%. 
At TNT, revenues were $1.9 billion, with an adjusted operating profit of $90 million. Adjusted operating margin was 4.7%. The TNT Express integration continues to proceed as planned. We estimate approximately $250 million in expenses during FY '17 as a result of the TNT Express integration and Outlook restructuring programs. We continue to expect the aggregate integration program expense over the 4 years to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. 
The TNT Express intangible asset amortization declined to $10 million in Q2, as we continue to update our purchase price allocation. We now expect the intangible asset amortization to be $38 million in the second half of FY '17 and $75 million for the full year. We still expect our FY '17 integration CapEx for TNT to be about $100 million, with total TNT CapEx at about USD 500 million. We expect annual pre-tax synergies, following the completion of the integration program in fiscal 2020, to be $750 million. We will have a full update on the TNT integration and outlook on the March call, and I'm not going to say much more about that today. 
At FedEx Freight, higher average daily LTL shipments helped FedEx Freight increase revenues 3%. Freight's competitive advantage of having the fastest published transit science in the LTL industry is driving higher growth in its priority service. The impact of lower weight per shipment and higher information technology expenses drove operating income lower. Freight continues to face a difficult macro environment and is working to manage costs and increase yields. 
For FedEx Ground, volume growth in residential services and commercial business, along with yield growth, helped push revenues up 9%. 
Operating income fell 12%, and operating margin declined to 10.5% due to increased rent, depreciation and staffing related to network expansion as well as higher purchased transportation rates. 
E-commerce continues to drive revenue growth, which provides a great opportunities as well as a difficult challenges. 
After challenges from higher-than-expected volumes in certain parts of the country during last peak, Ground invested in increased capacity and technology. This year, we completed 185 facility projects, including 4 major distribution hubs, 19 fully automated stations and 69 relocations. This equates to more than 10 million square feet of additional sortation space in the network. And all that comes at a cost above and beyond CapEx investment, including rent, building insurance and property tax. We also incurred higher costs from significant additional staffing as we hired and trained people, sometimes months in advance of the facility opening. And of course, purchased transportation increased as we pay contracted service providers to pick up, deliver and transport a growing number of packages. While these buildings and their state-of-the-art technology are a significant investment, they ensure that we have the capacity, flexibility and efficiency needed to handle e-commerce and commercial growth. 
Although our network projects are impacting Ground's near-term profitability, the investments will enhance long-term returns and cash flow. We are also working to better balance capacity and volume to improve revenue quality and margins. These actions contributed to the second quarter volume results and are also expected to mute third quarter volume growth. 
At FedEx Ground, home delivery and SmartPost network integration and delivery optimization initiatives continue. They will increase facility productivity and delivery density over time. We are also investing in technology to improve safety and mitigate rising insurance costs. We are committed to increasing margins at Ground over the longer term. 
Turning to our corporate outlook. Based on a moderate economic forecast that Mike discussed, we reaffirm expected earnings before year-end mark-to-market pension adjustments, and excluding TNT Express integration and Outlook restructuring cost and intangible asset amortization of $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share for FY '17. Our total capital expenditure forecast remains at $5.6 billion in FY '17, including TNT. This month, we made a $178 million contribution that was required to our pension fund, and next month, we plan to make a $1 billion debt-funded voluntary contribution to our tax-qualified U.S. domestic pension plans. 
Now we look forward to answering your strategic questions."

Let me make a comment about Ground expansion and then ask Mike to put more color on my remarks about Ground growth and our effort to manage our traffic a bit better than was the case in the past, and then Henry can jump in on margins. First, as it applies to the network expansion, I mentioned this in my remarks. But these facilities that FedEx Ground had put in place are enormous operations. Some of these things, correct me if I'm wrong, Henry, here -- like 250 acres plus. And the amount of sortation equipment inside are measured in miles, not in feet, and they're able to sort tens and tens of thousands of packages. So as the scale of this network has increased, the reality is we have to put the employees and the training in there. You can't just sort of open them up when the traffic is required. And the only reason I bring this up is that I'm consistently surprised, maybe more so by the popular media, with just the misunderstanding of the gigantic scale of the FedEx and UPS operations and, of course, the Postal Service as well, but the Postal Service is much more last mile rather than upstream. So I just want to put that in perspective. And given the level of capital that we put into the Ground business, it is very important for us that we get a good return on it. Now we don't have to get an immediate return. As I've said over and over again, and again today, we don't manage FedEx Corporation as a sum of the parts. We manage it as a broad market segment. And a few years ago, when Ground had less residential traffic, I mean, it was basically supporting increased growth in the corporation's earnings when we put a lot of effort into re-engineering the Express system. So with that in mind, let me talk -- let me ask Mike, then, to give some color to give some color to our traffic management efforts."

But as I've said many times on this call, our objective is to strike the right balance between volume growth and yield improvement to maximize operating margins at each operating company. In that regard, we're constantly looking at opportunities to do that. And over the last several month or so, we've made some decisions to discontinue relationships with a few customers where we couldn't candidly agree on pricing and capacity requirements for this peak season. And that's something we do on a regular basis, but we made that decision earlier this year. And as a result of that, we have been managing volumes, and we'll continue to do that. But clearly, it's had some effect on this peak season, but that was intentional on our part, and we'll continue to do that going forward."

So is that where the margin degradation really is occurring? Or is there some competitive pressure from the post office? Can you guys talk more?

Some of them take, not hundreds, but up to almost 1,000 people to staff and train. And in addition to that, at the same period of time that these facilities are coming online, we're staffing up for peak. So those are the 2 major expense drivers. Obviously, when volume goes up, revenue goes up. We must pay higher purchase transportation expenses because we pay contractors more.

Let me just add one other thing here because I think you hit the nail on the head and it relates back to Mike Glenn's comments. As I mentioned in my remarks, what keeps the lights on here, the vast majority of our revenue in FedEx Corporation is business-to-business. And a lot of it is business to consumer but it's not e-commerce. It may be all kinds of things. We look at these accounts every day, you'd be surprised. So e-commerce is basically residential deliveries. And you have to keep in balance the business-to-business and the business-to-consumer e-commerce or you can put extreme pressure on our Ground business. And so that is exactly what we were doing in making the decisions on these accounts that Mike mentioned. So no question, we're trying to manage that in an appropriate manner because just business-to-residential business -- I mean, the Postal Service is the biggest at all makes no money out of it. That should tell you something right there, and they're making millions of stops a day. So you can't be in our side of the business and not manage this.

Where can you continue to increase technology investments to decrease the need for peak seasonal hiring? 
We're going to ask Rob Carter to mention this, but let me just emphasize one more time. The FedEx Ground system is the most automated such system that you could possibly imagine. The reason for that is FedEx Ground was built in the age of computerization, so if you go to these great, big facilities, it may require a lot of people to offload and load trucks, but that requires no people to sort things. Now the FedEx Express system is a bit different because you have to have the flexibility to move things from one ramp to another and on down the line. But these things are marvels of automation, and over time, we will get even more out of this automation. And in that regard, I'll ask Rob Carter to comment on it."

I mean, in fact, we have 105 fully automated facilities in the Ground network now, not just the hubs that we're talking about, but the audit stations that exist that drive incredible automation in that network. And that automation contributes not only during peak, for Ken's question, but all year long. But virtually, all of our technology investments and operations contribute to increased efficiency and productivity throughout the operation, and they are incredibly valuable to us. Route optimization, for example, is driving incredible efficiencies as we're out on the road. We're increasing route density and stop density all across the network in Freight, Ground and Express with the route technology. But Mike also mentioned in his comments the customer-facing technologies, which are improving these efficiencies as well. Things like Delivery Manager that are giving customers more choices that increase security and convenience. But at the same time, with those choices, customers are then driving into some of our convenience network. Increased stop density and route density, that improves our operational efficiency as well. So all down the line, everything from analytics about better ways to load trailers to sensors that are automating and optimizing scan technology are driving really incredible efficiencies in the network. And all this is already in market today, but is being perfected year by year by year to increase and improve efficiency in the network. So the answer is yes, Ken, but the reality is it's improving efficiencies all year round, not just in peak."

And actually, since the profit improvement plan went in, in FY '13, we're up 140%. So how about those numbers? On the issue of the volume in United States domestic, we had some issues in the volume off the West -- East Coast, primarily due to Hurricane Matthew. We had a typhoon, too, that actually had the West Coast. So we had a little bit of an issue on both sides of the coast for us. But in the main, we are about where we thought we were to -- would be.

These huge facilities that we're opening up at FedEx Ground are being opened with the firm belief that our FedEx Ground traffic is going to grow, whether it's B2B or whether it's B2C. And for all of the reasons that Rob Carter mentioned to you and Henry commented upon, these facilities, when they open up, aren't nearly at their max capacity. So as more volume goes through these sorting facilities, the marginal cost of sorting, because it's all automated, is shockingly low. So there's huge amount of leverage into these network investments, or as Alan and I both have said, we wouldn't be making them. Now you get to the point on the yield side of the house because you start talking about pickup and delivery and linehaul expenses versus the network infrastructure. There's where it's important to have the appropriate mix of traffic so that you keep your linehaul and your PUD costs at a reasonable relationship, but the bow wave of putting these fixed facilities out will be accretive to margins as more volume goes through there, regardless of whether it's B2B or B2C, and particularly, as Henry puts one network together with these initiatives that he's described to you and which culminates I think in FY '19 or 20? 20. So that's why we say with some confidence, these results will pop back up. You can't just put these facilities out and operate them at full capacity day 1.

Listen, there's 3 distinct phases of the integration of SmartPost into Ground, and I apologize because we probably haven't been as clear on this as we need to be. The first was dissolving the corporate entity and moving SmartPost employees and management into Ground. That happened back in September of last year, September 15. What I would call Phase 2 was beginning of the diversion of outbound SmartPost volume from their facilities into ground hubs, which helped improve load factor, drove down linehaul costs and improved service. There are 2 parts to what we call delivery optimization or internally here, we call it the Terminator. The first part of that came in January of 2016, which was really the ability to manually divert volume that we knew had a high likelihood of matching the Ground package or better yet, just needed to be in the Ground network. The second phase or the second part of this comes in July of '17, next summer, when we will get the ability to virtually divert packages, where the system will see matches and automatically divert them out of SmartPost into FedEx Ground. We won't fully realize the benefits of that capability until fiscal '19 and beyond."

It involves discussing the potential impact of 100% expense in -- expensing, significant earnings that could be -- outside the U.S. could be repatriated, and impact to our healthcare plan. So let me take that those in reverse order. We have an outstanding healthcare plan for our teammates, but it does not meet the definition of a Cadillac plan. So like everyone else, we'll be watching these developments as they unfold, but we're very pleased with what we're delivering for our teammates. At May 31, we had about $1.6 billion of permanently reinvested offshore and have about $775 million in cash offshore. We currently plan to use that cash to fund Express TNT needs offshore and have no plans to repatriate that to the U.S. That, also, is a statement that says we're not going to be taxed on those earnings that we've left outside. If we are, we'll probably bring some of those back to pay those taxes. The bigger issue for all of you to look at longer-term for us is the features that are in the GOP blueprint in President-elect Trump's plans that we like a lot, and those include materially lowering the tax rate, the effective territorial treatment of foreign earnings and current expensing of CapEx. We think that will positively impact our top line through stronger economic growth, and of course, the bottom line, potentially in a very big way, through the lower tax rate. Having said that, we are concerned about the border adjustability concept and are trying to figure out how it would affect us directly as well as our customers and trade and global growth in general. And right now, there's a huge debate going on that. So as always, the devil's going to be in the details, and we'll just have to report back to you later as this begins to unfold. But if you think about our tax rate this year in the 36% to 37% range, a 20% tax rate would be mighty fine Christmas gift."

Alan mentioned that we're not a Cadillac plan at the moment. The reason we're not a Cadillac plan is because we adjusted our plan when the Affordable Care Act -- to move to more consumer-driven healthcare with much better tools for our teammates to buy healthcare more expertly and at lower cost. We did things like put in clinics at our high-employment locations, and we also gave all of our employees HRAs in order for them to pay for some of their deductibles and so forth. So we avoided hitting the Cadillac tax because of the steps that we took. Now if ACA is not modified in that respect, given healthcare inflation, there's a good chance we would hit the Cadillac tax in the out-years, which would result in truly onerous taxes on the benefits above the Cadillac tax level of 40%. So one of the most important things that we would like to see in the reform of the Affordable Care Act is to do away with the Cadillac tax limit. And that would give us the freedom to do some other things in our healthcare that we might not be able to do as long as we're on that trajectory towards a 40% excise tax. It really penalizes excellent healthcare plans like we have relative to other folks. So it's important to understand that context of our healthcare plan design, which was a reaction to the Affordable Care Act and act in a very significant cost that would be incurred in the excise tax in the Cadillac tax plan. I might say this parenthetically to that, that this past year, we paid -- how much in ACA taxes was it, Alan? $65 million?"

Okay. One more. So there are about 3 or 4 questions here on macro and trade, in particular. There's 1 from David Vernon. There's another 1 from Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank, David Ross of Stifel. So I'm going to put this all together, if you don't mind. 
Obviously, we are very concerned about the trade issue, which is one of the reasons that I gave a speech on the night of December at the Competitiveness Institute [ph], which was scheduled long before the election results were known because both the Democrats and the Republicans were running on anti-trade platforms. So if you go to policy.fedex.com, you can read that speech. It is not a polemic and it's not a political speech. It is just a factual speech, which points out that 1 in 5 American's jobs are related to trade, and we have a trade surplus and services in trade. We have a surplus, when you take the 20 countries that we have free trade agreements with. So the prospect of significantly reducing trade is, in our opinion, significantly dangerous, and the proper approach is to lean into trade and try to remove barriers, which, by the way, the Trans-Pacific Partnership did to our exports, not to stop people from selling products and services to us. So I hope that, that will make a difference in the debate out there. I would point out, there's an excellent article in Barron's by -- I forget the gentleman's first name, Epstein, which sound -- very similar themes. And again, it's fact based, it's not politically based. So we hope these things will be considered. And I think what Alan said to you about the border-adjustable tax is spot on. This is just very destructive of trade. It's not a proper solution to the problem. I think if they lowered the tax rate and went to territorial, it would accomplish 95% of all of the benefits they're looking for and ignite a significant investment boom in the United States. It would solve the inversion problem. So they've got some very, very good people in this cabinet. And finally, I think the second-largest economy in the world is China. In the speech I just mentioned, we were very direct on our own experiences with China and Japan in terms of their tendencies to engage in mercantilist practices. And we feel very strongly it's in China's best interest to open up their markets. And many of the things that the Chinese administration's are trying to accomplish would be facilitated by opening up rather than keeping their markets closed. So we're worried about it, but we hope that all of these facts will be carefully considered before the Congress or the administration does anything, which might be injurious based on the facts of the matter."

So traffic levels are affected on the margin by exchange rates. So when you have the dollar running up to the extent that it has here recently, which has been significant, U.S. exports are not as affordable and attractive to people on -- in other areas. So it puts a lot of pressure on U.S. exports. On the other side of the coin, with the diminution in the value of the euro or any other currency, it obviously makes their goods less expensive to the United States. So you will see, with some adjustment, disproportionate traffic growth there given the fact that we've got great sales people on both sides of all of the oceans. So I don't think you should read into that on these small perturbations anything more than exchange rates adjustments. Now over the longer haul, assuming there's good macroeconomic policy, which, quite frankly, is not the case in most places around, and hopefully, will be the case with tax reform here, you'll see economic growth. And even with the exchange rates, you'll see volumes growing.

So it's in the tax rate range I gave you as well for the year and it's in the adjusted guidance I gave you for the year. As to the gain on the sale of an investment, because this rose to the level that it did, a materiality of $0.08, we thought we'd alert you to that. We have hundreds of little bitty items that go plus and minus in every quarter that we don't talk to you about because they don't reach the level of materiality, but this one did. So it's also in the range, but it's only $0.08, and the range is $0.50 wide. I would put out -- point out in the second quarter, year-over-year, our tax rate was higher. And our tax rate is complicated, as we absorb TNT and work through our new tax planning structure. And we'll wait to see what comes out of Washington, so standby. That's the one that I got the least confidence about, but we'll keep at it."

I think the change is the rapid growth rate we're seeing in these things as people get more comfortable ordering just about anything over the Internet. We had 8 annexes for non-conveyables this year at peak. I think only 2 of those we intended to be permanent post peak. But I will tell you that we still have some peak left here, but the early reports are this has been a home run in terms of keeping large, very difficult to handle packages out of our hubs by virtue of the fact that we've had such terrific service performance this year, and our hub productivity has been excellent as well. So I would say that this is something that we will stick with. I think we still have some work to do in terms of where we sight them. And I think I mentioned this on other calls in here, there's also some pretty promising advancements in material handling technology to handle these kind of packages. And as we learn more about that and as we experience whether the benefits that are promised are actually there, I think the next step will be trying to figure out how we retrofit existing facilities with that new material handling technology."

We've been saying for a couple of years now that we believe FedEx Corporation's earnings, margins, cash flows and returns will go up. So let me reiterate that again that we believe that to be the case. The reason we think that they're going to go up is because the structure of our networks are such that there is leverage in those networks. And in the Express system, for instance, we're re-fleeting much more efficient. We're moving our International Economy in non-asset systems. We have much more capacity in Europe, the pickup and delivery density in Europe. And the Ground situation, I just mentioned the fact that these investments in these facilities, as more and more volume goes through there, they are accretive of and by themselves. In the Freight area, we are very confident that the technologies that we have, which, by the way, allowed us, for the first time in the history of the LTL business, to offer both a priority and economy service. Nobody had the technology to do that. It would have been literally a scheduling impossibility, absent the sophistication of the technology. Now we're applying that same technology to get more leverage out of our facilities in terms of throughput; cross-dock, if you will, in Freight; better loading. We have robots under test that -- I could go on here all afternoon. There are just numerous places where we think we have increased earnings leverage with increased volume. An equal part of that, however, is to be, as Mike Glenn has said several times, you have to be disciplined. The reality in the transportation business, and for that matter, broadening it to the transportation and logistics business, these markets are so huge. You can get a lot of volume that is completely non-compensatory and just not make any money. And there are a large number of transportation and logistics companies that prove that every quarter making no money. And some of them are pretty damn big. So we just have a lot of leverage points, and that's why we say what we have said. If that changes,  we'll say that, too. But we're not prepared to give you, despite my best efforts to do so, over the General Counsel's objections, to do what that is. But Alan is very good at giving you the ranges at the start of the year, and we're very confident that we can increase our margins, cash flows, earnings per share and our returns with what we're doing. I'm going to say one thing again that I said in my opening remarks. This is an enormous enterprise, and I can't tell you on any one given quarter that we're going to have everything lined up in every segment. If I did that, it would be incorrect and misleading. What I can say is that we think we can manage those metrics I just gave you."

And if we could get it better than that, I have to tell you, I'd be happy about it to see it inside. But it's -- there's just too many moving parts to do it otherwise. Fred, do you have concluding remarks? 
Yes. Let me conclude first by thanking you all for being on this call. I'd like to Express the appreciation, not just to myself, which I'll come back to, but the SMC, who's all sitting around here and the Board of Directors who met in our normal quarterly meeting just a week or so and past one of the most effusive resolutions of praise I've ever seen in the business, and I've seen a lot of these. So all of us, your partners here at FedEx, Mike, thank you for your 35 years. 
Mike and I have worked together for 25 years directly. I've told other people his office was right next door. There's nobody that has made more contributions to this company's success than you have, Mike. And that includes the speaker. And I have to tell you the professionalism and industry knowledge; the sales and marketing prowess, in particular; your sense of humor, wry, though, that may be, on everything other than old miss football results. And I think it's the measure of the man -- I've said this publicly, that I think knowing him, all things considered, Mike would have loved to stay here, and stayed in the band and had some fun over the next 2 to 3 years because we believe, just as I was saying to David there, we think they're going to be very good years. But he and Donna have a special needs child, and they're making the right priorities. And I think that says everything you need to know about Mike Glenn's character and his commitment to his family in putting priorities in the right place. 
So thanks, Mike, for a job well done. I have Mike for 30 hours -- how often? A month? 30 hours a month. So we've been calculating, does that start when he comes in the door or when he comes on the fourth floor as a consultant, and we'll be utilizing that treasure trove of knowledge that he has. So thanks, again, Mike, and well done."

Welcome to our discussion of results for FedEx' Second Quarter Fiscal 2017, and happy holidays to everyone.

Welcome to our discussion of results for FedEx' Second Quarter Fiscal 2017, and happy holidays to everyone. 
Let me note on the front end, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 earnings forecast, and remember that the earnings forecast is before year-end mark-to-market pension adjustments and excluding TNT Express integration and TNT's Outlook restructuring program costs and intangible asset amortization. But given those considerations, the range we put out there was $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share. And of course, Alan has more detail on that later. 
This will be a record peak for FedEx, and to date, with the exception of several local weather issues, our service levels have been outstanding. We appreciate the efforts of hundreds of thousands of FedEx team members who work very hard to make peak operations successful and to try to keep our Purple Promise daily, which states, I will make every FedEx experience outstanding. 
Our traffic mix this year is a bit different by design as part of our longer-term commitment to continue to grow earnings, margins, cash flows and returns. Christmas falling on a Sunday has created anomalies and shipping patterns, and this week, we'll see disproportionately higher demand versus other holiday seasonal patterns in the past. 
FedEx' integration of TNT and FedEx Ground's continued integration of GENCO are well along and going very well with high morale and excellent execution. FedEx Express' integration expenses will peak next year in FY '18, and Express operating margins should widen and in fiscal years '18, '19 and '20. As previously noted, there are significant operational synergies in the TNT transaction, particularly in Europe. 
FedEx Express peak operations this year will result in excellent year-over-year profit and margin improvements, foreshadowing the longer-term outlook I just mentioned. Of course, our earnings outlook assumes continued modest global economic growth. 
Now FedEx Ground results will be affected this peak, followed with improving margins later this fiscal year versus the current quarter. This is due to the recent opening of 4 major hubs and 19 automated stations year-over-year. It's one of the most remarkable things I've seen since I've been in the business, to tell you the truth. And two, an effort to grow ground traffic in a more profitable manner than last year's trend at peak, which saw challenging growth of 20%. 
While we're committed to being a leader in the e-commerce market, it's important to recognize that non-e-commerce deliveries to residences and business-to-business traffic represents the vast majority of FedEx Corporation's estimated $60 billion in FY '17 revenues. 
Regarding business-to-business traffic, we are making major systems investments at FedEx Freight, which will result in significant margin improvement by year-end FY 2020. We believe this initiative will change the LTL landscape in a major way. 
Let me emphasize, FedEx is much more than a last-mile carrier. FedEx is a global transport and logistics company that can connect almost every person and business in the world in 1 to 2 business days door-to-door, and we provide unique value-added services across many industries. It's also important to reiterate that we do not manage our operating companies to maximize margins in each segment all the time, much less each quarter. 
Over 92% of our U.S. revenue comes from customers using both Express and Ground, and 76% of that U.S. revenue is generated by customers that use Express, Ground and Freight. We, therefore, may be investing in one segment of the portfolio at any given time to produce improved results for the corporation as a whole in the future. 
Now before I ask Mike Glenn to comment on the economic environment and traffic trends, let me again thank him for his 35 years of dedicated service to FedEx. At the end of the call, I'll have a few concluding comments about Mike's contribution before his retirement at the end of this month. Alan Graf will follow Mike with more detailed financial analysis. Mike?"

I'll open with our economic update and outlook and then discuss our performance and business conditions in each segment, including revenue, volume and yield; and provide some commentary on broader industry trends as we come to the close of another record holiday shopping season. 
We see moderate growth in the global economy. After growing just 1.6% in calendar '16, we expect U.S. GDP growth of 2.2% in calendar '17, anchored by continued robust consumer spending and strong business investment. Industrial production should rebound after contracting 0.9% in calendar '16 to a forecasted 1.6% growth next year. For the global economy, we forecast growth of 2.2% for calendar '16 and 2.6% for calendar '17. 
Now I'll review revenue volume and yield trends by segment. U.S. Domestic Express package revenue grew 2% year-over-year during the second quarter. Yield per package increased 3% as a result of improved rate and discount. Fuel, for the first time in a long time, did not have a material impact on yield per package and revenue during the quarter. Domestic Express package volume declined 1% year-over-year during the quarter. FedEx International export package revenue increased 2% year-over-year in Q2. FedEx International Priority volume increased 2%, while International Economy volume also grew 2%. International export yield increased 1%, primarily driven by the positive impact of rate and discount changes; higher weight per package and regional mix, which outweighed the negative impact of exchange rates. Again, fuel did not have a material impact on yields. 
Ground transportation revenue increased 9% year-over-year, while average daily volume increased 5% year-over-year. Ground yield per package increased 4% year-over-year, benefiting from yield improvement in both Ground and SmartPost. Fuel did not have a material impact on increases in revenue or yield per package. 
FedEx Freight segment revenue increased 3% year-over-year in Q2. If you exclude the impact of the fuel surcharge revenue, Freight revenue increased 3.6%. 
Average daily LTL shipments increased 4% year-over-year. The continued strength in shipment volume is driven by our sales efforts and reflects the speed, reliability and choice of priority and economy service for our LTL customers. 
Revenue per LTL shipment in Q2 was flat year-over-year and was impacted by a slightly lower diesel fuel prices and lower weight per LTL shipment. Excluding fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per LTL shipment was up slightly. 
We're closing out what has been another busy peak season for FedEx, largely driven by the continued rapid growth of e-commerce. Trends continued to evolve, as Fred noted, and we're proud of the year-long preparation and collaboration with customers that has allowed us to deliver outstanding service during this period of intense increase in demand. 
As e-commerce grows, so does the challenge of peak, with multiple days of volume levels approaching or surpassing double our average daily volume. It should be noted that this surge in demand is driven primarily by a relatively small number of customers. Less than 50 large retail and e-tail customer's responsible for the majority of peak demand, so it's extremely important that we understand their forecast well in advance to allow us to plan resources properly. 
While a few customers this year have experienced demand below their forecast, the majority of our large retail and e-tail customers are meeting expectations. Again, we're proud of the outstanding service that we've been able to provide. The secret, of course, is our people. We continue to work hard to deliver for our customers throughout the holiday season and beyond. 
The rapid rise in e-commerce continues to drive the need for alternative delivery options. FedEx understands that the ways people live, work and connect are ever changing. We have long recognized that information about the packages is as important as the package itself, and our long-term investments and focus on IT and mobile technologies has allowed us to offer customers truly innovative and useful alternative delivery options. This, of course, includes FedEx Delivery Manager, which gives customers access with a phone or tablet to options such as appointment delivery and the ability to reroute packages to one of our FedEx Offices or locations -- FedEx Office locations or third-party locations for secure pickup. 
We continue to have strong growth and demand for Pack Plus, which features dedicated packing professionals and supplies inside FedEx Office locations. The professionals at FedEx Office work with customers, large and small, to provide standard and customized packaging options for even large bulk and fragile items. None of this would be possible without the dedication of our more than 400,000 team members at work right now around the world to help the holidays arrive. 
Our service levels have been outstanding, with on-time deliveries at record levels even on some of the busiest days in the history of FedEx, and it's all because of our people. I want to share a special acknowledgment and commend them for their hard work and outstanding effort this peak season. Alan?"

Mike, in our 35 years of working together, we have done literally scores of earnings calls. As this is your last one, I want to thank you for everything you have done to help make this company great. You are a consummate professional and the best marketing, sales and communications executive anywhere. You've been a fantastic business partner.

The FedEx Corporation second quarter FY '17 results. Today, we announced the second quarter FY '17 adjusted earnings per share climbed 8.5% to $2.80. Adjusted operating income increased, with the inclusion of TNT Express and improved results at FedEx Express, as it continues to grow base yields and control costs. This performance was partially offset by lower operating income at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight. 
Our effective tax rate was 35.1% for the second quarter and 36.3% for the first half of 2017 compared with 34.5% in the second quarter and 35.3% in the first half of 2016. The first half tax rate in 2017 has been negatively impacted by local country losses in some entities within TNT Express for which no tax benefit could be recognized due to the uncertainty as to the utilization of these losses. This year-to-date negative impact was partially offset from the benefit of early adopting the accounting standards update for share-based payments in the second quarter. 
Longer term, as the synergies from the TNT Express acquisition result in greater international profits, we expect our effective tax rate to be lower than the rate in recent years. The tax rates in 2016 were favorably impacted by the resolution of a state tax matter. There was also a gain from the sale of an investment in other income that added $0.08 per diluted share. 
Looking at Express. Revenues increased 2% to $6.7 billion, as base yields improved and package volume grew. Adjusted operating profit increased by $32 million or 5%. Adjusted operating income and margin improved as higher base yields drove revenue growth. Base yield growth was driven by U.S. domestic and international export package. Revenue growth due to volume increases was driven by International Priority package and Freight. Expense growth was driven by merit pay increases, higher insurance costs and increased depreciation due to aircraft introductions. Fuel price and exchange rate changes had little net impact for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin increased to 9.7%. 
At TNT, revenues were $1.9 billion, with an adjusted operating profit of $90 million. Adjusted operating margin was 4.7%. The TNT Express integration continues to proceed as planned. We estimate approximately $250 million in expenses during FY '17 as a result of the TNT Express integration and Outlook restructuring programs. We continue to expect the aggregate integration program expense over the 4 years to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. 
The TNT Express intangible asset amortization declined to $10 million in Q2, as we continue to update our purchase price allocation. We now expect the intangible asset amortization to be $38 million in the second half of FY '17 and $75 million for the full year. We still expect our FY '17 integration CapEx for TNT to be about $100 million, with total TNT CapEx at about USD 500 million. We expect annual pre-tax synergies, following the completion of the integration program in fiscal 2020, to be $750 million. We will have a full update on the TNT integration and outlook on the March call, and I'm not going to say much more about that today. 
At FedEx Freight, higher average daily LTL shipments helped FedEx Freight increase revenues 3%. Freight's competitive advantage of having the fastest published transit times in the LTL industry is driving higher growth in its priority service. The impact of lower weight per shipment and higher information technology expenses drove operating income lower. Freight continues to face a difficult macro environment and is working to manage costs and increase yields. 
For FedEx Ground, volume growth in residential services and commercial business, along with yield growth, helped push revenues up 9%. 
Operating income fell 12%, and operating margin declined to 10.5% due to increased rent, depreciation and staffing related to network expansion as well as higher purchased transportation rates. 
E-commerce continues to drive revenue growth, which provides a great opportunities as well as a difficult challenges. 
After challenges from higher-than-expected volumes in certain parts of the country during last peak, Ground invested in increased capacity and technology. This year, we completed 185 facility projects, including 4 major distribution hubs, 19 fully automated stations and 69 relocations. This equates to more than 10 million square feet of additional sortation space in the network. And all that comes at a cost above and beyond CapEx investment, including rent, building insurance and property tax. We also incurred higher costs from significant additional staffing as we hired and trained people, sometimes months in advance of the facility opening. And of course, purchased transportation increased as we pay contracted service providers to pick up, deliver and transport a growing number of packages. While these buildings and their state-of-the-art technology are a significant investment, they ensure that we have the capacity, flexibility and efficiency needed to handle e-commerce and commercial growth. 
Although our network projects are impacting Ground's near-term profitability, the investments will enhance long-term returns and cash flow. We are also working to better balance capacity and volume to improve revenue quality and margins. These actions contributed to the second quarter volume results and are also expected to mute third quarter volume growth. 
At FedEx Ground, home delivery and SmartPost network integration and delivery optimization initiatives continue. They will increase facility productivity and delivery density over time. We are also investing in technology to improve safety and mitigate rising insurance costs. We are committed to increasing margins at Ground over the longer term. 
Turning to our corporate outlook. Based on a moderate economic forecast that Mike discussed, we reaffirm expected earnings before year-end mark-to-market pension adjustments, and excluding TNT Express integration and Outlook restructuring cost and intangible asset amortization of $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share for FY '17. Our total capital expenditure forecast remains at $5.6 billion in FY '17, including TNT. This month, we made a $178 million contribution that was required to our pension fund, and next month, we plan to make a $1 billion debt-funded voluntary contribution to our tax-qualified U.S. domestic pension plans. 
Now we look forward to answering your strategic questions."

Let me make a comment about Ground expansion and then ask Mike to put more color on my remarks about Ground growth and our effort to manage our traffic a bit better than was the case in the past, and then Henry can jump in on margins. First, as it applies to the network expansion, I mentioned this in my remarks. But these facilities that FedEx Ground had put in place are enormous operations. Some of these things, correct me if I'm wrong, Henry, here -- like 250 acres plus. And the amount of sortation equipment inside are measured in miles, not in feet, and they're able to sort tens and tens of thousands of packages. So as the scale of this network has increased, the reality is we have to put the employees and the training in there. You can't just sort of open them up when the traffic is required. And the only reason I bring this up is that I'm consistently surprised, maybe more so by the popular media, with just the misunderstanding of the gigantic scale of the FedEx and UPS operations and, of course, the Postal Service as well, but the Postal Service is much more last mile rather than upstream. So I just want to put that in perspective. And given the level of capital that we put into the Ground business, it is very important for us that we get a good return on it. Now we don't have to get an immediate return. As I've said over and over again, and again today, we don't manage FedEx Corporation as a sum of the parts. We manage it as a broad market segment. And a few years ago, when Ground had less residential traffic, I mean, it was basically supporting increased growth in the corporation's earnings when we put a lot of effort into re-engineering the Express system. So with that in mind, let me talk -- let me ask Mike, then, to give some color to give some color to our traffic management efforts."

But as I've said many times on this call, our objective is to strike the right balance between volume growth and yield improvement to maximize operating margins at each operating company. In that regard, we're constantly looking at opportunities to do that. And over the last several month or so, we've made some decisions to discontinue relationships with a few customers where we couldn't candidly agree on pricing and capacity requirements for this peak season. And that's something we do on a regular basis, but we made that decision earlier this year. And as a result of that, we have been managing volumes, and we'll continue to do that. But clearly, it's had some effect on this peak season, but that was intentional on our part, and we'll continue to do that going forward."

So is that where the margin degradation really is occurring? Or is there some competitive pressure from the post office? Can you guys talk more?

Some of them take, not hundreds, but up to almost 1,000 people to staff and train. And in addition to that, at the same period of time that these facilities are coming online, we're staffing up for peak. So those are the 2 major expense drivers. Obviously, when volume goes up, revenue goes up. We must pay higher purchase transportation expenses because we pay contractors more. There's higher postage and higher linehaul settlement in moving that volume. So those are the drivers here."

Let me just add one other thing here because I think you hit the nail on the head and it relates back to Mike Glenn's comments. As I mentioned in my remarks, what keeps the lights on here, the vast majority of our revenue in FedEx Corporation is business-to-business. And a lot of it is business to consumer but it's not e-commerce. It may be all kinds of things. We look at these accounts every day, you'd be surprised. So e-commerce is basically residential deliveries. And you have to keep in balance the business-to-business and the business-to-consumer e-commerce or you can put extreme pressure on our Ground business. And so that is exactly what we were doing in making the decisions on these accounts that Mike mentioned. So no question, we're trying to manage that in an appropriate manner because just business-to-residential business -- I mean, the Postal Service is the biggest at all makes no money out of it. That should tell you something right there, and they're making millions of stops a day. So you can't be in our side of the business and not manage this.

Where can you continue to increase technology investments to decrease the need for peak seasonal hiring? 
We're going to ask Rob Carter to mention this, but let me just emphasize one more time. The FedEx Ground system is the most automated such system that you could possibly imagine. The reason for that is FedEx Ground was built in the age of computerization, so if you go to these great, big facilities, it may require a lot of people to offload and load trucks, but that requires no people to sort things. Now the FedEx Express system is a bit different because you have to have the flexibility to move things from one ramp to another and on down the line. But these things are marvels of automation, and over time, we will get even more out of this automation. And in that regard, I'll ask Rob Carter to comment on it."

I mean, in fact, we have 105 fully automated facilities in the Ground network now, not just the hubs that we're talking about, but the audit stations that exist that drive incredible automation in that network. And that automation contributes not only during peak, per Ken's question, but all year long. But virtually, all of our technology investments and operations contribute to increased efficiency and productivity throughout the operation, and they are incredibly valuable to us. Route optimization, for example, is driving incredible efficiencies as we're out on the road. We're increasing route density and stop density all across the network in Freight, Ground and Express with the route technology. But Mike also mentioned in his comments the customer-facing technologies, which are improving these efficiencies as well. Things like Delivery Manager that are giving customers more choices that increase security and convenience. But at the same time, with those choices, customers are then driving into some of our convenience network. Increased stop density and route density, that improves our operational efficiency as well. So all down the line, everything from analytics about better ways to load trailers to sensors that are automating and optimizing scan technology are driving really incredible efficiencies in the network. And all this is already in market today, but is being perfected year by year by year to increase and improve efficiency in the network. So the answer is yes, Ken, but the reality is it's improving efficiencies all year round, not just in peak."

And actually, since the profit improvement plan went in, in FY '13, we're up 140%. So how about those numbers? On the issue of the volume in United States domestic, we had some issues in the volume off the West -- East Coast, primarily due to Hurricane Matthew. We had a typhoon, too, that actually hit the West Coast. So we had a little bit of an issue on both sides of the coast for us. But in the main, we are about where we thought we were -- would be.

These huge facilities that we're opening up at FedEx Ground are being opened with the firm belief that our FedEx Ground traffic is going to grow, whether it's B2B or whether it's B2C. And for all of the reasons that Rob Carter mentioned to you and Henry commented upon, these facilities, when they open up, aren't nearly at their max capacity. So as more volume goes through these sorting facilities, the marginal cost of sorting, because it's all automated, is shockingly low. So there's huge amount of leverage into these network investments, or as Alan and I both have said, we wouldn't be making them. Now you get to the point on the yield side of the house because you start talking about pickup and delivery and linehaul expenses versus the network infrastructure. There's where it's important to have the appropriate mix of traffic so that you keep your linehaul and your PUD costs at a reasonable relationship, but the bow wave of putting these fixed facilities out will be accretive to margins as more volume goes through there, regardless of whether it's B2B or B2C, and particularly, as Henry puts one network together with these initiatives that he's described to you and which culminates I think in FY '19 or 20? 20.

Listen, there's 3 distinct phases of the integration of SmartPost into Ground, and I apologize because we probably haven't been as clear on this as we need to be. The first was dissolving the corporate entity and moving SmartPost employees and management into Ground. That happened back in September of last year, September of '15. What I would call Phase 2 was beginning of the diversion of outbound SmartPost volume from their facilities into Ground hubs, which helped improve load factor, drove down linehaul costs and improved service. There are 2 parts to what we call delivery optimization or internally here, we call it the Terminator. The first part of that came in January of 2016, which was really the ability to manually divert volume that we knew had a high likelihood of matching the Ground package or better yet, just needed to be in the Ground network. The second phase or the second part of this comes in July of '17, next summer, when we will get the ability to virtually divert packages, where the system will see matches and automatically divert them out of SmartPost into FedEx Ground. We won't fully realize the benefits of that capability until fiscal '19 and beyond."

It involves discussing the potential impact of 100% expense in -- expensing, significant earnings that could be -- outside the U.S. could be repatriated, and impact to our healthcare plan. So let me take that those in reverse order. We have an outstanding healthcare plan for our teammates, but it does not meet the definition of a Cadillac plan. So like everyone else, we'll be watching these developments as they unfold, but we're very pleased with what we're delivering for our teammates. At May 31, we had about $1.6 billion of permanently reinvested offshore and have about $775 million in cash offshore. We currently plan to use that cash to fund Express TNT needs offshore and have no plans to repatriate that to the U.S. That, also, is a statement that says we're not going to be taxed on those earnings that we've left outside. If we are, we'll probably bring some of those back to pay those taxes. The bigger issue for all of you to look at longer-term for us is the features that are in the GOP blueprint in President-elect Trump's plans that we like a lot, and those include materially lowering the tax rate, the effective territorial treatment of foreign earnings and current expensing of CapEx. We think that will positively impact our top line through stronger economic growth, and of course, the bottom line, potentially in a very big way, through the lower tax rate. Having said that, we are concerned about the border adjustability concept and are trying to figure out how it would affect us directly as well as our customers and trade and global growth in general. And right now, there's a huge debate going on that. So as always, the devil's going to be in the details, and we'll just have to report back to you later as this begins to unfold. But if you think about our tax rate this year in the 36% to 37% range, a 20% tax rate would be a mighty fine Christmas gift."

Alan mentioned that we're not a Cadillac plan at the moment. The reason we're not a Cadillac plan is because we adjusted our plan when the Affordable Care Act -- to move to more consumer-driven healthcare with much better tools for our teammates to buy healthcare more expertly and at lower cost. We did things like put in clinics at our high-employment locations, and we also gave all of our employees HRAs in order for them to pay for some of their deductibles and so forth. So we avoided hitting the Cadillac tax because of the steps that we took. Now if ACA is not modified in that respect, given healthcare inflation, there's a good chance we would hit the Cadillac tax in the out-years, which would result in truly onerous taxes on the benefits above the Cadillac tax level of 40%. So one of the most important things that we would like to see in the reform of the Affordable Care Act is to do away with the Cadillac tax limit. And that would give us the freedom to do some other things in our healthcare that we might not be able to do as long as we're on that trajectory towards a 40% excise tax. It really penalizes excellent healthcare plans like we have relative to other folks. So it's important to understand that context of our healthcare plan design, which was a reaction to the Affordable Care Act and a very significant cost that would be incurred in the excise tax in the Cadillac tax plan. I might say this parenthetically to that, that this past year, we paid -- how much in ACA taxes was it, Alan? $65 million?"

Okay. One more. So there are about 3 or 4 questions here on macro and trade, in particular. There's 1 from David Vernon. There's another 1 from Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank, David Ross of Stifel. So I'm going to put this all together, if you don't mind. 
Obviously, we are very concerned about the trade issue, which is one of the reasons that I gave a speech on December 9 at the Competitiveness Institute [ph], which was scheduled long before the election results were known because both the Democrats and the Republicans were running on anti-trade platforms. So if you go to policy.fedex.com, you can read that speech. It is not a polemic and it's not a political speech. It is just a factual speech, which points out that 1 in 5 American's jobs are related to trade, and we have a trade surplus and services in trade. We have a surplus, when you take the 20 countries that we have free trade agreements with. So the prospect of significantly reducing trade is, in our opinion, significantly dangerous, and the proper approach is to lean into trade and try to remove barriers, which, by the way, the Trans-Pacific Partnership did to our exports, not to stop people from selling products and services to us. So I hope that, that will make a difference in the debate out there. I would point out, there's an excellent article in Barron's by -- I forget the gentleman's first name, Epstein, which sound -- very similar themes. And again, it's fact based, it's not politically based. So we hope these things will be considered. And I think what Alan said to you about the border-adjustable tax is spot on. This is just very destructive of trade. It's not a proper solution to the problem. I think if they lowered the tax rate and went to territorial, it would accomplish 95% of all of the benefits they're looking for and ignite a significant investment boom in the United States. It would solve the inversion problem. So they've got some very, very good people in this cabinet. And finally, I think the second-largest economy in the world is China. In the speech I just mentioned, we were very direct on our own experiences with China and Japan in terms of their tendencies to engage in mercantilist practices. And we feel very strongly it's in China's best interest to open up their markets. And many of the things that the Chinese administration's are trying to accomplish would be facilitated by opening up rather than keeping their markets closed. So we're worried about it, but we hope that all of these facts will be carefully considered before the Congress or the administration does anything, which might be injurious based on the facts of the matter."

So traffic levels are affected on the margin by exchange rates. So when you have the dollar running up to the extent that it has here recently, which has been significant, U.S. exports are not as affordable and attractive to people on -- in other areas. So it puts a lot of pressure on U.S. exports. On the other side of the coin, with the diminution in the value of the euro or any other currency, it obviously makes their goods less expensive to the United States. So you will see, with some adjustment, disproportionate traffic growth there given the fact that we've got great sales people on both sides of all of the oceans. So I don't think you should read into that on these small perturbations anything more than exchange rates adjustments. Now over the longer haul, assuming there's good macroeconomic policy, which, quite frankly, is not the case in most places around, and hopefully, will be the case with tax reform here, you'll see economic growth. And even with the exchange rates, you'll see volumes growing.

So it's in the tax rate range I gave you as well for the year and it's in the adjusted guidance I gave you for the year. As to the gain on the sale of an investment, because this rose to the level that it did, a materiality of $0.08, we thought we'd alert you to that. We have hundreds of little bitty items that go plus and minus in every quarter that we don't talk to you about because they don't reach the level of materiality, but this one did. So it's also in the range, but it's only $0.08, and the range is $0.50 wide. I would put out -- point out in the second quarter, year-over-year, our tax rate was higher. And our tax rate is complicated, as we absorb TNT and work through our new tax planning structure. And we'll wait to see what comes out of Washington, so standby. That's the one that I got the least confidence about, but we'll keep at it."

I think the change is the rapid growth rate we're seeing in these things as people get more comfortable ordering just about anything over the Internet. We had 8 annexes for non-conveyables this year at peak. I think only 2 of those we intended to be permanent post peak. But I will tell you that we still have some peak left here, but the early reports are this has been a home run in terms of keeping large, very difficult to handle packages out of our hubs by virtue of the fact that we've had such terrific service performance this year, and our hub productivity has been excellent as well. So I would say that this is something that we will stick with. I think we still have some work to do in terms of where we site them. And I think I mentioned this on other calls in here, there's also some pretty promising advancements in material handling technology to handle these kind of packages. And as we learn more about that and as we experience whether the benefits that are promised are actually there, I think the next step will be trying to figure out how we retrofit existing facilities with that new material handling technology."

We've been saying for a couple of years now that we believe FedEx Corporation's earnings, margins, cash flows and returns will go up. So let me reiterate that again that we believe that to be the case. The reason we think that they're going to go up is because the structure of our networks are such that there is leverage in those networks. And in the Express system, for instance, we're re-fleeting much more efficient. We're moving our International Economy in non-asset systems. We have much more capacity in Europe, the pickup and delivery density in Europe. And the Ground situation, I just mentioned the fact that these investments in these facilities, as more and more volume goes through there, they are accretive of and by themselves. In the Freight area, we are very confident that the technologies that we have, which, by the way, allowed us, for the first time in the history of the LTL business, to offer both a priority and economy service. Nobody had the technology to do that. It would have been literally a scheduling impossibility, absent the sophistication of the technology. Now we're applying that same technology to get more leverage out of our facilities in terms of throughput; cross-dock, if you will, in Freight; better loading. We have robots under test that -- I could go on here all afternoon. There are just numerous places where we think we have increased earnings leverage with increased volume. An equal part of that, however, is to be, as Mike Glenn has said several times, you have to be disciplined. The reality in the transportation business, and for that matter, broadening it to the transportation and logistics business, these markets are so huge. You can get a lot of volume that is completely non-compensatory and just not make any money. And there are a large number of transportation and logistics companies that prove that every quarter making no money. And some of them are pretty damn big. So we just have a lot of leverage points, and that's why we say what we have said. If that changes,  we'll say that, too. But we're not prepared to give you, despite my best efforts to do so, over the General Counsel's objections, to do what that is. But Alan is very good at giving you the ranges at the start of the year, and we're very confident that we can increase our margins, cash flows, earnings per share and our returns with what we're doing. I'm going to say one thing again that I said in my opening remarks. This is an enormous enterprise, and I can't tell you on any one given quarter that we're going to have everything lined up in every segment. If I did that, it would be incorrect and misleading. What I can say is that we think we can manage to those metrics I just gave you."

And if we could get it better than that, I have to tell you, I'd be happy about it to see it inside. But it's -- there's just too many moving parts to do it otherwise. Fred, do you have concluding remarks? 
Yes. Let me conclude first by thanking you all for being on this call. I'd like to express the appreciation, not just to myself, which I'll come back to, but the SMC, who's all sitting around here and the Board of Directors who met in our normal quarterly meeting just a week or so and passed one of the most effusive resolutions of praise I've ever seen in the business, and I've seen a lot of these. So all of us, your partners here at FedEx, Mike, thank you for your 35 years. 
Mike and I have worked together for 25 years directly. I've told other people his office was right next door. There's nobody that has made more contributions to this company's success than you have, Mike. And that includes this speaker. And I have to tell you the professionalism and industry knowledge; the sales and marketing prowess, in particular; your sense of humor, wry, though, that may be, on everything other than Ole Miss football results. And I think it's the measure of the man -- I've said this publicly, that I think knowing him, all things considered, Mike would have loved to stay here, and stayed in the band and had some fun over the next 2 to 3 years because we believe, just as I was saying to David there, we think they're going to be very good years. But he and Donna have a special needs child, and they're making the right priorities. And I think that says everything you need to know about Mike Glenn's character and his commitment to his family and putting priorities in the right place. 
So thanks, Mike, for a job well done. I have Mike for 30 hours -- how often? A month? 30 hours a month. So we've been calculating, does that start when he comes in the door or when he comes on the fourth floor as a consultant, and we'll be utilizing that treasure trove of knowledge that he has. So thanks, again, Mike, and well done."

Welcome to our discussion of results for FedEx' Second Quarter Fiscal 2017, and happy holidays to everyone.

Welcome to our discussion of results for FedEx' Second Quarter Fiscal 2017, and happy holidays to everyone. 
Let me note on the front end, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 earnings forecast, and remember that the earnings forecast is before year-end mark-to-market pension adjustments and excluding TNT Express integration and TNT's Outlook restructuring program costs and intangible asset amortization. But given those considerations, the range we put out there was $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share. And of course, Alan has more detail on that later. 
This will be a record peak for FedEx, and to date, with the exception of several local weather issues, our service levels have been outstanding. We appreciate the efforts of hundreds of thousands of FedEx team members who work very hard to make peak operations successful and to try to keep our Purple Promise daily, which states, I will make every FedEx experience outstanding. 
Our traffic mix this year is a bit different by design as part of our longer-term commitment to continue to grow earnings, margins, cash flows and returns. Christmas falling on a Sunday has created anomalies and shipping patterns, and this week, we'll see disproportionately higher demand versus other holiday seasonal patterns in the past. 
FedEx' integration of TNT and FedEx Ground's continued integration of GENCO are well along and going very well with high morale and excellent execution. FedEx Express' integration expenses will peak next year in FY '18, and Express operating margins should widen and in fiscal years '18, '19 and '20. As previously noted, there are significant operational synergies in the TNT transaction, particularly in Europe. 
FedEx Express peak operations this year will result in excellent year-over-year profit and margin improvements, foreshadowing the longer-term outlook I just mentioned. Of course, our earnings outlook assumes continued modest global economic growth. 
Now FedEx Ground results will be affected this peak, followed with improving margins later this fiscal year versus the current quarter. This is due to the recent opening of 4 major hubs and 19 automated stations year-over-year. It's one of the most remarkable things I've seen since I've been in the business, to tell you the truth. And two, an effort to grow ground traffic in a more profitable manner than last year's trend at peak, which saw challenging growth of 20%. 
While we're committed to being a leader in the e-commerce market, it's important to recognize that non-e-commerce deliveries to residences and business-to-business traffic represents the vast majority of FedEx Corporation's estimated $60 billion in FY '17 revenues. 
Regarding business-to-business traffic, we are making major systems investments at FedEx Freight, which will result in significant margin improvement by year-end FY 2020. We believe this initiative will change the LTL landscape in a major way. 
Let me emphasize, FedEx is much more than a last-mile carrier. FedEx is a global transport and logistics company that can connect almost every person and business in the world in 1 to 2 business days door-to-door, and we provide unique value-added services across many industries. It's also important to reiterate that we do not manage our operating companies to maximize margins in each segment all the time, much less each quarter. 
Over 92% of our U.S. revenue comes from customers using both Express and Ground, and 76% of that U.S. revenue is generated by customers that use Express, Ground and Freight. We, therefore, may be investing in one segment of the portfolio at any given time to produce improved results for the corporation as a whole in the future. 
Now before I ask Mike Glenn to comment on the economic environment and traffic trends, let me again thank him for his 35 years of dedicated service to FedEx. At the end of the call, I'll have a few concluding comments about Mike's contribution before his retirement at the end of this month. Alan Graf will follow Mike with more detailed financial analysis. Mike?"

I'll open with our economic update and outlook and then discuss our performance and business conditions in each segment, including revenue, volume and yield; and provide some commentary on broader industry trends as we come to the close of another record holiday shopping season. 
We see moderate growth in the global economy. After growing just 1.6% in calendar '16, we expect U.S. GDP growth of 2.2% in calendar '17, anchored by continued robust consumer spending and strong business investment. Industrial production should rebound after contracting 0.9% in calendar '16 to a forecasted 1.6% growth next year. For the global economy, we forecast growth of 2.2% for calendar '16 and 2.6% for calendar '17. 
Now I'll review revenue volume and yield trends by segment. U.S. Domestic Express package revenue grew 2% year-over-year during the second quarter. Yield per package increased 3% as a result of improved rate and discount. Fuel, for the first time in a long time, did not have a material impact on yield per package and revenue during the quarter. Domestic Express package volume declined 1% year-over-year during the quarter. FedEx International export package revenue increased 2% year-over-year in Q2. FedEx International Priority volume increased 2%, while International Economy volume also grew 2%. International export yield increased 1%, primarily driven by the positive impact of rate and discount changes; higher weight per package and regional mix, which outweighed the negative impact of exchange rates. Again, fuel did not have a material impact on yields. 
Ground transportation revenue increased 9% year-over-year, while average daily volume increased 5% year-over-year. Ground yield per package increased 4% year-over-year, benefiting from yield improvement in both Ground and SmartPost. Fuel did not have a material impact on increases in revenue or yield per package. 
FedEx Freight segment revenue increased 3% year-over-year in Q2. If you exclude the impact of the fuel surcharge revenue, Freight revenue increased 3.6%. 
Average daily LTL shipments increased 4% year-over-year. The continued strength in shipment volume is driven by our sales efforts and reflects the speed, reliability and choice of priority and economy service for our LTL customers. 
Revenue per LTL shipment in Q2 was flat year-over-year and was impacted by a slightly lower diesel fuel prices and lower weight per LTL shipment. Excluding fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per LTL shipment was up slightly. 
We're closing out what has been another busy peak season for FedEx, largely driven by the continued rapid growth of e-commerce. Trends continued to evolve, as Fred noted, and we're proud of the year-long preparation and collaboration with customers that has allowed us to deliver outstanding service during this period of intense increase in demand. 
As e-commerce grows, so does the challenge of peak, with multiple days of volume levels approaching or surpassing double our average daily volume. It should be noted that this surge in demand is driven primarily by a relatively small number of customers. Less than 50 large retail and e-tail customer's responsible for the majority of peak demand, so it's extremely important that we understand their forecast well in advance to allow us to plan resources properly. 
While a few customers this year have experienced demand below their forecast, the majority of our large retail and e-tail customers are meeting expectations. Again, we're proud of the outstanding service that we've been able to provide. The secret, of course, is our people. We continue to work hard to deliver for our customers throughout the holiday season and beyond. 
The rapid rise in e-commerce continues to drive the need for alternative delivery options. FedEx understands that the ways people live, work and connect are ever changing. We have long recognized that information about the packages is as important as the package itself, and our long-term investments and focus on IT and mobile technologies has allowed us to offer customers truly innovative and useful alternative delivery options. This, of course, includes FedEx Delivery Manager, which gives customers access with a phone or tablet to options such as appointment delivery and the ability to reroute packages to one of our FedEx Offices or locations -- FedEx Office locations or third-party locations for secure pickup. 
We continue to have strong growth and demand for Pack Plus, which features dedicated packing professionals and supplies inside FedEx Office locations. The professionals at FedEx Office work with customers, large and small, to provide standard and customized packaging options for even large bulk and fragile items. None of this would be possible without the dedication of our more than 400,000 team members at work right now around the world to help the holidays arrive. 
Our service levels have been outstanding, with on-time deliveries at record levels even on some of the busiest days in the history of FedEx, and it's all because of our people. I want to share a special acknowledgment and commend them for their hard work and outstanding effort this peak season. Alan?"

Mike, in our 35 years of working together, we have done literally scores of earnings calls. As this is your last one, I want to thank you for everything you have done to help make this company great. You are a consummate professional and the best marketing, sales and communications executive anywhere. You've been a fantastic business partner.

The FedEx Corporation second quarter FY '17 results. Today, we announced the second quarter FY '17 adjusted earnings per share climbed 8.5% to $2.80. Adjusted operating income increased, with the inclusion of TNT Express and improved results at FedEx Express, as it continues to grow base yields and control costs. This performance was partially offset by lower operating income at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight. 
Our effective tax rate was 35.1% for the second quarter and 36.3% for the first half of 2017 compared with 34.5% in the second quarter and 35.3% in the first half of 2016. The first half tax rate in 2017 has been negatively impacted by local country losses in some entities within TNT Express for which no tax benefit could be recognized due to the uncertainty as to the utilization of these losses. This year-to-date negative impact was partially offset from the benefit of early adopting the accounting standards update for share-based payments in the second quarter. 
Longer term, as the synergies from the TNT Express acquisition result in greater international profits, we expect our effective tax rate to be lower than the rate in recent years. The tax rates in 2016 were favorably impacted by the resolution of a state tax matter. There was also a gain from the sale of an investment in other income that added $0.08 per diluted share. 
Looking at Express. Revenues increased 2% to $6.7 billion, as base yields improved and package volume grew. Adjusted operating profit increased by $32 million or 5%. Adjusted operating income and margin improved as higher base yields drove revenue growth. Base yield growth was driven by U.S. domestic and international export package. Revenue growth due to volume increases was driven by International Priority package and Freight. Expense growth was driven by merit pay increases, higher insurance costs and increased depreciation due to aircraft introductions. Fuel price and exchange rate changes had little net impact for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin increased to 9.7%. 
At TNT, revenues were $1.9 billion, with an adjusted operating profit of $90 million. Adjusted operating margin was 4.7%. The TNT Express integration continues to proceed as planned. We estimate approximately $250 million in expenses during FY '17 as a result of the TNT Express integration and Outlook restructuring programs. We continue to expect the aggregate integration program expense over the 4 years to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. 
The TNT Express intangible asset amortization declined to $10 million in Q2, as we continue to update our purchase price allocation. We now expect the intangible asset amortization to be $38 million in the second half of FY '17 and $75 million for the full year. We still expect our FY '17 integration CapEx for TNT to be about $100 million, with total TNT CapEx at about USD 500 million. We expect annual pre-tax synergies, following the completion of the integration program in fiscal 2020, to be $750 million. We will have a full update on the TNT integration and outlook on the March call, and I'm not going to say much more about that today. 
At FedEx Freight, higher average daily LTL shipments helped FedEx Freight increase revenues 3%. Freight's competitive advantage of having the fastest published transit times in the LTL industry is driving higher growth in its priority service. The impact of lower weight per shipment and higher information technology expenses drove operating income lower. Freight continues to face a difficult macro environment and is working to manage costs and increase yields. 
For FedEx Ground, volume growth in residential services and commercial business, along with yield growth, helped push revenues up 9%. 
Operating income fell 12%, and operating margin declined to 10.5% due to increased rent, depreciation and staffing related to network expansion as well as higher purchased transportation rates. 
E-commerce continues to drive revenue growth, which provides a great opportunities as well as a difficult challenges. 
After challenges from higher-than-expected volumes in certain parts of the country during last peak, Ground invested in increased capacity and technology. This year, we completed 185 facility projects, including 4 major distribution hubs, 19 fully automated stations and 69 relocations. This equates to more than 10 million square feet of additional sortation space in the network. And all that comes at a cost above and beyond CapEx investment, including rent, building insurance and property tax. We also incurred higher costs from significant additional staffing as we hired and trained people, sometimes months in advance of the facility opening. And of course, purchased transportation increased as we pay contracted service providers to pick up, deliver and transport a growing number of packages. While these buildings and their state-of-the-art technology are a significant investment, they ensure that we have the capacity, flexibility and efficiency needed to handle e-commerce and commercial growth. 
Although our network projects are impacting Ground's near-term profitability, the investments will enhance long-term returns and cash flow. We are also working to better balance capacity and volume to improve revenue quality and margins. These actions contributed to the second quarter volume results and are also expected to mute third quarter volume growth. 
At FedEx Ground, home delivery and SmartPost network integration and delivery optimization initiatives continue. They will increase facility productivity and delivery density over time. We are also investing in technology to improve safety and mitigate rising insurance costs. We are committed to increasing margins at Ground over the longer term. 
Turning to our corporate outlook. Based on a moderate economic forecast that Mike discussed, we reaffirm expected earnings before year-end mark-to-market pension adjustments, and excluding TNT Express integration and Outlook restructuring cost and intangible asset amortization of $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share for FY '17. Our total capital expenditure forecast remains at $5.6 billion in FY '17, including TNT. This month, we made a $178 million contribution that was required to our pension fund, and next month, we plan to make a $1 billion debt-funded voluntary contribution to our tax-qualified U.S. domestic pension plans. 
Now we look forward to answering your strategic questions."

Let me make a comment about Ground expansion and then ask Mike to put more color on my remarks about Ground growth and our effort to manage our traffic a bit better than was the case in the past, and then Henry can jump in on margins. First, as it applies to the network expansion, I mentioned this in my remarks. But these facilities that FedEx Ground had put in place are enormous operations. Some of these things, correct me if I'm wrong, Henry, here -- like 250 acres plus. And the amount of sortation equipment inside are measured in miles, not in feet, and they're able to sort tens and tens of thousands of packages. So as the scale of this network has increased, the reality is we have to put the employees and the training in there. You can't just sort of open them up when the traffic is required. And the only reason I bring this up is that I'm consistently surprised, maybe more so by the popular media, with just the misunderstanding of the gigantic scale of the FedEx and UPS operations and, of course, the Postal Service as well, but the Postal Service is much more last mile rather than upstream. So I just want to put that in perspective. And given the level of capital that we put into the Ground business, it is very important for us that we get a good return on it. Now we don't have to get an immediate return. As I've said over and over again, and again today, we don't manage FedEx Corporation as a sum of the parts. We manage it as a broad market segment. And a few years ago, when Ground had less residential traffic, I mean, it was basically supporting increased growth in the corporation's earnings when we put a lot of effort into re-engineering the Express system. So with that in mind, let me talk -- let me ask Mike, then, to give some color to give some color to our traffic management efforts."

But as I've said many times on this call, our objective is to strike the right balance between volume growth and yield improvement to maximize operating margins at each operating company. In that regard, we're constantly looking at opportunities to do that. And over the last several month or so, we've made some decisions to discontinue relationships with a few customers where we couldn't candidly agree on pricing and capacity requirements for this peak season. And that's something we do on a regular basis, but we made that decision earlier this year. And as a result of that, we have been managing volumes, and we'll continue to do that. But clearly, it's had some effect on this peak season, but that was intentional on our part, and we'll continue to do that going forward."

So is that where the margin degradation really is occurring? Or is there some competitive pressure from the post office? Can you guys talk more?

Some of them take, not hundreds, but up to almost 1,000 people to staff and train. And in addition to that, at the same period of time that these facilities are coming online, we're staffing up for peak. So those are the 2 major expense drivers. Obviously, when volume goes up, revenue goes up. We must pay higher purchase transportation expenses because we pay contractors more. There's higher postage and higher linehaul settlement in moving that volume. So those are the drivers here."

Let me just add one other thing here because I think you hit the nail on the head and it relates back to Mike Glenn's comments. As I mentioned in my remarks, what keeps the lights on here, the vast majority of our revenue in FedEx Corporation is business-to-business. And a lot of it is business to consumer but it's not e-commerce. It may be all kinds of things. We look at these accounts every day, you'd be surprised. So e-commerce is basically residential deliveries. And you have to keep in balance the business-to-business and the business-to-consumer e-commerce or you can put extreme pressure on our Ground business. And so that is exactly what we were doing in making the decisions on these accounts that Mike mentioned. So no question, we're trying to manage that in an appropriate manner because just business-to-residential business -- I mean, the Postal Service is the biggest at all makes no money out of it. That should tell you something right there, and they're making millions of stops a day. So you can't be in our side of the business and not manage this.

Where can you continue to increase technology investments to decrease the need for peak seasonal hiring? 
We're going to ask Rob Carter to mention this, but let me just emphasize one more time. The FedEx Ground system is the most automated such system that you could possibly imagine. The reason for that is FedEx Ground was built in the age of computerization, so if you go to these great, big facilities, it may require a lot of people to offload and load trucks, but that requires no people to sort things. Now the FedEx Express system is a bit different because you have to have the flexibility to move things from one ramp to another and on down the line. But these things are marvels of automation, and over time, we will get even more out of this automation. And in that regard, I'll ask Rob Carter to comment on it."

I mean, in fact, we have 105 fully automated facilities in the Ground network now, not just the hubs that we're talking about, but the audit stations that exist that drive incredible automation in that network. And that automation contributes not only during peak, per Ken's question, but all year long. But virtually, all of our technology investments and operations contribute to increased efficiency and productivity throughout the operation, and they are incredibly valuable to us. Route optimization, for example, is driving incredible efficiencies as we're out on the road. We're increasing route density and stop density all across the network in Freight, Ground and Express with the route technology. But Mike also mentioned in his comments the customer-facing technologies, which are improving these efficiencies as well. Things like Delivery Manager that are giving customers more choices that increase security and convenience. But at the same time, with those choices, customers are then driving into some of our convenience network. Increased stop density and route density, that improves our operational efficiency as well. So all down the line, everything from analytics about better ways to load trailers to sensors that are automating and optimizing scan technology are driving really incredible efficiencies in the network. And all this is already in market today, but is being perfected year by year by year to increase and improve efficiency in the network. So the answer is yes, Ken, but the reality is it's improving efficiencies all year round, not just in peak."

And actually, since the profit improvement plan went in, in FY '13, we're up 140%. So how about those numbers? On the issue of the volume in United States domestic, we had some issues in the volume off the West -- East Coast, primarily due to Hurricane Matthew. We had a typhoon, too, that actually hit the West Coast. So we had a little bit of an issue on both sides of the coast for us. But in the main, we are about where we thought we were -- would be.

These huge facilities that we're opening up at FedEx Ground are being opened with the firm belief that our FedEx Ground traffic is going to grow, whether it's B2B or whether it's B2C. And for all of the reasons that Rob Carter mentioned to you and Henry commented upon, these facilities, when they open up, aren't nearly at their max capacity. So as more volume goes through these sorting facilities, the marginal cost of sorting, because it's all automated, is shockingly low. So there's huge amount of leverage into these network investments, or as Alan and I both have said, we wouldn't be making them. Now you get to the point on the yield side of the house because you start talking about pickup and delivery and linehaul expenses versus the network infrastructure. There's where it's important to have the appropriate mix of traffic so that you keep your linehaul and your PUD costs at a reasonable relationship, but the bow wave of putting these fixed facilities out will be accretive to margins as more volume goes through there, regardless of whether it's B2B or B2C, and particularly, as Henry puts one network together with these initiatives that he's described to you and which culminates I think in FY '19 or 20? 20. So that's why we say with some confidence, these results will pop back up. You can't just put these facilities out and operate them at full capacity day 1.

Listen, there's 3 distinct phases of the integration of SmartPost into Ground, and I apologize because we probably haven't been as clear on this as we need to be. The first was dissolving the corporate entity and moving SmartPost employees and management into Ground. That happened back in September of last year, September of '15. What I would call Phase 2 was beginning of the diversion of outbound SmartPost volume from their facilities into Ground hubs, which helped improve load factor, drove down linehaul costs and improved service. There are 2 parts to what we call delivery optimization or internally here, we call it the Terminator. The first part of that came in January of 2016, which was really the ability to manually divert volume that we knew had a high likelihood of matching the Ground package or better yet, just needed to be in the Ground network. The second phase or the second part of this comes in July of '17, next summer, when we will get the ability to virtually divert packages, where the system will see matches and automatically divert them out of SmartPost into FedEx Ground. We won't fully realize the benefits of that capability until fiscal '19 and beyond."

It involves discussing the potential impact of 100% expense in -- expensing, significant earnings that could be -- outside the U.S. could be repatriated, and impact to our healthcare plan. So let me take that those in reverse order. We have an outstanding healthcare plan for our teammates, but it does not meet the definition of a Cadillac plan. So like everyone else, we'll be watching these developments as they unfold, but we're very pleased with what we're delivering for our teammates. At May 31, we had about $1.6 billion of permanently reinvested offshore and have about $775 million in cash offshore. We currently plan to use that cash to fund Express TNT needs offshore and have no plans to repatriate that to the U.S. That, also, is a statement that says we're not going to be taxed on those earnings that we've left outside. If we are, we'll probably bring some of those back to pay those taxes. The bigger issue for all of you to look at longer-term for us is the features that are in the GOP blueprint in President-elect Trump's plans that we like a lot, and those include materially lowering the tax rate, the effective territorial treatment of foreign earnings and current expensing of CapEx. We think that will positively impact our top line through stronger economic growth, and of course, the bottom line, potentially in a very big way, through the lower tax rate. Having said that, we are concerned about the border adjustability concept and are trying to figure out how it would affect us directly as well as our customers and trade and global growth in general. And right now, there's a huge debate going on that. So as always, the devil's going to be in the details, and we'll just have to report back to you later as this begins to unfold. But if you think about our tax rate this year in the 36% to 37% range, a 20% tax rate would be a mighty fine Christmas gift."

Alan mentioned that we're not a Cadillac plan at the moment. The reason we're not a Cadillac plan is because we adjusted our plan when the Affordable Care Act -- to move to more consumer-driven healthcare with much better tools for our teammates to buy healthcare more expertly and at lower cost. We did things like put in clinics at our high-employment locations, and we also gave all of our employees HRAs in order for them to pay for some of their deductibles and so forth. So we avoided hitting the Cadillac tax because of the steps that we took. Now if ACA is not modified in that respect, given healthcare inflation, there's a good chance we would hit the Cadillac tax in the out-years, which would result in truly onerous taxes on the benefits above the Cadillac tax level of 40%. So one of the most important things that we would like to see in the reform of the Affordable Care Act is to do away with the Cadillac tax limit. And that would give us the freedom to do some other things in our healthcare that we might not be able to do as long as we're on that trajectory towards a 40% excise tax. It really penalizes excellent healthcare plans like we have relative to other folks. So it's important to understand that context of our healthcare plan design, which was a reaction to the Affordable Care Act and a very significant cost that would be incurred in the excise tax in the Cadillac tax plan. I might say this parenthetically to that, that this past year, we paid -- how much in ACA taxes was it, Alan? $65 million?"

Okay. One more. So there are about 3 or 4 questions here on macro and trade, in particular. There's 1 from David Vernon. There's another 1 from Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank, David Ross of Stifel. So I'm going to put this all together, if you don't mind. 
Obviously, we are very concerned about the trade issue, which is one of the reasons that I gave a speech on December 9 at the Competitiveness Institute [ph], which was scheduled long before the election results were known because both the Democrats and the Republicans were running on anti-trade platforms. So if you go to policy.fedex.com, you can read that speech. It is not a polemic and it's not a political speech. It is just a factual speech, which points out that 1 in 5 American's jobs are related to trade, and we have a trade surplus and services in trade. We have a surplus, when you take the 20 countries that we have free trade agreements with. So the prospect of significantly reducing trade is, in our opinion, significantly dangerous, and the proper approach is to lean into trade and try to remove barriers, which, by the way, the Trans-Pacific Partnership did to our exports, not to stop people from selling products and services to us. So I hope that, that will make a difference in the debate out there. I would point out, there's an excellent article in Barron's by -- I forget the gentleman's first name, Epstein, which sound -- very similar themes. And again, it's fact based, it's not politically based. So we hope these things will be considered. And I think what Alan said to you about the border-adjustable tax is spot on. This is just very destructive of trade. It's not a proper solution to the problem. I think if they lowered the tax rate and went to territorial, it would accomplish 95% of all of the benefits they're looking for and ignite a significant investment boom in the United States. It would solve the inversion problem. So they've got some very, very good people in this cabinet. And finally, I think the second-largest economy in the world is China. In the speech I just mentioned, we were very direct on our own experiences with China and Japan in terms of their tendencies to engage in mercantilist practices. And we feel very strongly it's in China's best interest to open up their markets. And many of the things that the Chinese administration's are trying to accomplish would be facilitated by opening up rather than keeping their markets closed. So we're worried about it, but we hope that all of these facts will be carefully considered before the Congress or the administration does anything, which might be injurious based on the facts of the matter."

So traffic levels are affected on the margin by exchange rates. So when you have the dollar running up to the extent that it has here recently, which has been significant, U.S. exports are not as affordable and attractive to people on -- in other areas. So it puts a lot of pressure on U.S. exports. On the other side of the coin, with the diminution in the value of the euro or any other currency, it obviously makes their goods less expensive to the United States. So you will see, with some adjustment, disproportionate traffic growth there given the fact that we've got great sales people on both sides of all of the oceans. So I don't think you should read into that on these small perturbations anything more than exchange rates adjustments. Now over the longer haul, assuming there's good macroeconomic policy, which, quite frankly, is not the case in most places around, and hopefully, will be the case with tax reform here, you'll see economic growth. And even with the exchange rates, you'll see volumes growing.

So it's in the tax rate range I gave you as well for the year and it's in the adjusted guidance I gave you for the year. As to the gain on the sale of an investment, because this rose to the level that it did, a materiality of $0.08, we thought we'd alert you to that. We have hundreds of little bitty items that go plus and minus in every quarter that we don't talk to you about because they don't reach the level of materiality, but this one did. So it's also in the range, but it's only $0.08, and the range is $0.50 wide. I would put out -- point out in the second quarter, year-over-year, our tax rate was higher. And our tax rate is complicated, as we absorb TNT and work through our new tax planning structure. And we'll wait to see what comes out of Washington, so standby. That's the one that I got the least confidence about, but we'll keep at it."

I think the change is the rapid growth rate we're seeing in these things as people get more comfortable ordering just about anything over the Internet. We had 8 annexes for non-conveyables this year at peak. I think only 2 of those we intended to be permanent post peak. But I will tell you that we still have some peak left here, but the early reports are this has been a home run in terms of keeping large, very difficult to handle packages out of our hubs by virtue of the fact that we've had such terrific service performance this year, and our hub productivity has been excellent as well. So I would say that this is something that we will stick with. I think we still have some work to do in terms of where we site them. And I think I mentioned this on other calls in here, there's also some pretty promising advancements in material handling technology to handle these kind of packages. And as we learn more about that and as we experience whether the benefits that are promised are actually there, I think the next step will be trying to figure out how we retrofit existing facilities with that new material handling technology."

We've been saying for a couple of years now that we believe FedEx Corporation's earnings, margins, cash flows and returns will go up. So let me reiterate that again that we believe that to be the case. The reason we think that they're going to go up is because the structure of our networks are such that there is leverage in those networks. And in the Express system, for instance, we're re-fleeting much more efficient. We're moving our International Economy in non-asset systems. We have much more capacity in Europe, the pickup and delivery density in Europe. And the Ground situation, I just mentioned the fact that these investments in these facilities, as more and more volume goes through there, they are accretive of and by themselves. In the Freight area, we are very confident that the technologies that we have, which, by the way, allowed us, for the first time in the history of the LTL business, to offer both a priority and economy service. Nobody had the technology to do that. It would have been literally a scheduling impossibility, absent the sophistication of the technology. Now we're applying that same technology to get more leverage out of our facilities in terms of throughput; cross-dock, if you will, in Freight; better loading. We have robots under test that -- I could go on here all afternoon. There are just numerous places where we think we have increased earnings leverage with increased volume. An equal part of that, however, is to be, as Mike Glenn has said several times, you have to be disciplined. The reality in the transportation business, and for that matter, broadening it to the transportation and logistics business, these markets are so huge. You can get a lot of volume that is completely non-compensatory and just not make any money. And there are a large number of transportation and logistics companies that prove that every quarter making no money. And some of them are pretty damn big. So we just have a lot of leverage points, and that's why we say what we have said. If that changes,  we'll say that, too. But we're not prepared to give you, despite my best efforts to do so, over the General Counsel's objections, to do what that is. But Alan is very good at giving you the ranges at the start of the year, and we're very confident that we can increase our margins, cash flows, earnings per share and our returns with what we're doing. I'm going to say one thing again that I said in my opening remarks. This is an enormous enterprise, and I can't tell you on any one given quarter that we're going to have everything lined up in every segment. If I did that, it would be incorrect and misleading. What I can say is that we think we can manage to those metrics I just gave you."

And if we could get it better than that, I have to tell you, I'd be happy about it to see it inside. But it's -- there's just too many moving parts to do it otherwise. Fred, do you have concluding remarks? 
Yes. Let me conclude first by thanking you all for being on this call. I'd like to express the appreciation, not just to myself, which I'll come back to, but the SMC, who's all sitting around here and the Board of Directors who met in our normal quarterly meeting just a week or so and passed one of the most effusive resolutions of praise I've ever seen in the business, and I've seen a lot of these. So all of us, your partners here at FedEx, Mike, thank you for your 35 years. 
Mike and I have worked together for 25 years directly. I've told other people his office was right next door. There's nobody that has made more contributions to this company's success than you have, Mike. And that includes this speaker. And I have to tell you the professionalism and industry knowledge; the sales and marketing prowess, in particular; your sense of humor, wry, though, that may be, on everything other than Ole Miss football results. And I think it's the measure of the man -- I've said this publicly, that I think knowing him, all things considered, Mike would have loved to stay here, and stayed in the band and had some fun over the next 2 to 3 years because we believe, just as I was saying to David there, we think they're going to be very good years. But he and Donna have a special needs child, and they're making the right priorities. And I think that says everything you need to know about Mike Glenn's character and his commitment to his family and putting priorities in the right place. 
So thanks, Mike, for a job well done. I have Mike for 30 hours -- how often? A month? 30 hours a month. So we've been calculating, does that start when he comes in the door or when he comes on the fourth floor as a consultant, and we'll be utilizing that treasure trove of knowledge that he has. So thanks, again, Mike, and well done."

Welcome to our discussion of results for FedEx' Second Quarter Fiscal 2017, and happy holidays to everyone.

Welcome to our discussion of results for FedEx' Second Quarter Fiscal 2017, and happy holidays to everyone. 
Let me note on the front end, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 earnings forecast, and remember that the earnings forecast is before year-end mark-to-market pension adjustments and excluding TNT Express integration and TNT's Outlook restructuring program costs and intangible asset amortization. But given those considerations, the range we put out there was $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share. And of course, Alan has more detail on that later. 
This will be a record peak for FedEx, and to date, with the exception of several local weather issues, our service levels have been outstanding. We appreciate the efforts of hundreds of thousands of FedEx team members who work very hard to make peak operations successful and to try to keep our Purple Promise daily, which states, I will make every FedEx experience outstanding. 
Our traffic mix this year is a bit different by design as part of our longer-term commitment to continue to grow earnings, margins, cash flows and returns. Christmas falling on a Sunday has created anomalies and shipping patterns, and this week, we'll see disproportionately higher demand versus other holiday seasonal patterns in the past. 
FedEx' integration of TNT and FedEx Ground's continued integration of GENCO are well along and going very well with high morale and excellent execution. FedEx Express' integration expenses will peak next year in FY '18, and Express operating margins should widen and in fiscal years '18, '19 and '20. As previously noted, there are significant operational synergies in the TNT transaction, particularly in Europe. 
FedEx Express peak operations this year will result in excellent year-over-year profit and margin improvements, foreshadowing the longer-term outlook I just mentioned. Of course, our earnings outlook assumes continued modest global economic growth. 
Now FedEx Ground results will be affected this peak, followed with improving margins later this fiscal year versus the current quarter. This is due to the recent opening of 4 major hubs and 19 automated stations year-over-year. It's one of the most remarkable things I've seen since I've been in the business, to tell you the truth. And two, an effort to grow ground traffic in a more profitable manner than last year's trend at peak, which saw challenging growth of 20%. 
While we're committed to being a leader in the e-commerce market, it's important to recognize that non-e-commerce deliveries to residences and business-to-business traffic represents the vast majority of FedEx Corporation's estimated $60 billion in FY '17 revenues. 
Regarding business-to-business traffic, we are making major systems investments at FedEx Freight, which will result in significant margin improvement by year-end FY 2020. We believe this initiative will change the LTL landscape in a major way. 
Let me emphasize, FedEx is much more than a last-mile carrier. FedEx is a global transport and logistics company that can connect almost every person and business in the world in 1 to 2 business days door-to-door, and we provide unique value-added services across many industries. It's also important to reiterate that we do not manage our operating companies to maximize margins in each segment all the time, much less each quarter. 
Over 92% of our U.S. revenue comes from customers using both Express and Ground, and 76% of that U.S. revenue is generated by customers that use Express, Ground and Freight. We, therefore, may be investing in one segment of the portfolio at any given time to produce improved results for the corporation as a whole in the future. 
Now before I ask Mike Glenn to comment on the economic environment and traffic trends, let me again thank him for his 35 years of dedicated service to FedEx. At the end of the call, I'll have a few concluding comments about Mike's contribution before his retirement at the end of this month. Alan Graf will follow Mike with more detailed financial analysis. Mike?"

I'll open with our economic update and outlook and then discuss our performance and business conditions in each segment, including revenue, volume and yield; and provide some commentary on broader industry trends as we come to the close of another record holiday shopping season. 
We see moderate growth in the global economy. After growing just 1.6% in calendar '16, we expect U.S. GDP growth of 2.2% in calendar '17, anchored by continued robust consumer spending and strong business investment. Industrial production should rebound after contracting 0.9% in calendar '16 to a forecasted 1.6% growth next year. For the global economy, we forecast growth of 2.2% for calendar '16 and 2.6% for calendar '17. 
Now I'll review revenue volume and yield trends by segment. U.S. Domestic Express package revenue grew 2% year-over-year during the second quarter. Yield per package increased 3% as a result of improved rate and discount. Fuel, for the first time in a long time, did not have a material impact on yield per package and revenue during the quarter. Domestic Express package volume declined 1% year-over-year during the quarter. FedEx International export package revenue increased 2% year-over-year in Q2. FedEx International Priority volume increased 2%, while International Economy volume also grew 2%. International export yield increased 1%, primarily driven by the positive impact of rate and discount changes; higher weight per package and regional mix, which outweighed the negative impact of exchange rates. Again, fuel did not have a material impact on yields. 
Ground transportation revenue increased 9% year-over-year, while average daily volume increased 5% year-over-year. Ground yield per package increased 4% year-over-year, benefiting from yield improvement in both Ground and SmartPost. Fuel did not have a material impact on increases in revenue or yield per package. 
FedEx Freight segment revenue increased 3% year-over-year in Q2. If you exclude the impact of the fuel surcharge revenue, Freight revenue increased 3.6%. 
Average daily LTL shipments increased 4% year-over-year. The continued strength in shipment volume is driven by our sales efforts and reflects the speed, reliability and choice of priority and economy service for our LTL customers. 
Revenue per LTL shipment in Q2 was flat year-over-year and was impacted by a slightly lower diesel fuel prices and lower weight per LTL shipment. Excluding fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per LTL shipment was up slightly. 
We're closing out what has been another busy peak season for FedEx, largely driven by the continued rapid growth of e-commerce. Trends continued to evolve, as Fred noted, and we're proud of the year-long preparation and collaboration with customers that has allowed us to deliver outstanding service during this period of intense increase in demand. 
As e-commerce grows, so does the challenge of peak, with multiple days of volume levels approaching or surpassing double our average daily volume. It should be noted that this surge in demand is driven primarily by a relatively small number of customers. Less than 50 large retail and e-tail customer's responsible for the majority of peak demand, so it's extremely important that we understand their forecast well in advance to allow us to plan resources properly. 
While a few customers this year have experienced demand below their forecast, the majority of our large retail and e-tail customers are meeting expectations. Again, we're proud of the outstanding service that we've been able to provide. The secret, of course, is our people. We continue to work hard to deliver for our customers throughout the holiday season and beyond. 
The rapid rise in e-commerce continues to drive the need for alternative delivery options. FedEx understands that the ways people live, work and connect are ever changing. We have long recognized that information about the packages is as important as the package itself, and our long-term investments and focus on IT and mobile technologies has allowed us to offer customers truly innovative and useful alternative delivery options. This, of course, includes FedEx Delivery Manager, which gives customers access with a phone or tablet to options such as appointment delivery and the ability to reroute packages to one of our FedEx Offices or locations -- FedEx Office locations or third-party locations for secure pickup. 
We continue to have strong growth and demand for Pack Plus, which features dedicated packing professionals and supplies inside FedEx Office locations. The professionals at FedEx Office work with customers, large and small, to provide standard and customized packaging options for even large bulk and fragile items. None of this would be possible without the dedication of our more than 400,000 team members at work right now around the world to help the holidays arrive. 
Our service levels have been outstanding, with on-time deliveries at record levels even on some of the busiest days in the history of FedEx, and it's all because of our people. I want to share a special acknowledgment and commend them for their hard work and outstanding effort this peak season.

Mike, in our 35 years of working together, we have done literally scores of earnings calls. As this is your last one, I want to thank you for everything you have done to help make this company great. You are a consummate professional and the best marketing, sales and communications executive anywhere. You've been a fantastic business partner. I look forward to many future years of friendship with you. Okay. 
The FedEx Corporation second quarter FY '17 results. Today, we announced the second quarter FY '17 adjusted earnings per share climbed 8.5% to $2.80. Adjusted operating income increased, with the inclusion of TNT Express and improved results at FedEx Express, as it continues to grow base yields and control costs. This performance was partially offset by lower operating income at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight. 
Our effective tax rate was 35.1% for the second quarter and 36.3% for the first half of 2017 compared with 34.5% in the second quarter and 35.3% in the first half of 2016. The first half tax rate in 2017 has been negatively impacted by local country losses in some entities within TNT Express for which no tax benefit could be recognized due to the uncertainty as to the utilization of these losses. This year-to-date negative impact was partially offset from the benefit of early adopting the accounting standards update for share-based payments in the second quarter. 
Longer term, as the synergies from the TNT Express acquisition result in greater international profits, we expect our effective tax rate to be lower than the rate in recent years. The tax rates in 2016 were favorably impacted by the resolution of a state tax matter. There was also a gain from the sale of an investment in other income that added $0.08 per diluted share. 
Looking at Express. Revenues increased 2% to $6.7 billion, as base yields improved and package volume grew. Adjusted operating profit increased by $32 million or 5%. Adjusted operating income and margin improved as higher base yields drove revenue growth. Base yield growth was driven by U.S. domestic and international export package. Revenue growth due to volume increases was driven by International Priority package and Freight. Expense growth was driven by merit pay increases, higher insurance costs and increased depreciation due to aircraft introductions. Fuel price and exchange rate changes had little net impact for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin increased to 9.7%. 
At TNT, revenues were $1.9 billion, with an adjusted operating profit of $90 million. Adjusted operating margin was 4.7%. The TNT Express integration continues to proceed as planned. We estimate approximately $250 million in expenses during FY '17 as a result of the TNT Express integration and Outlook restructuring programs. We continue to expect the aggregate integration program expense over the 4 years to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. 
The TNT Express intangible asset amortization declined to $10 million in Q2, as we continue to update our purchase price allocation. We now expect the intangible asset amortization to be $38 million in the second half of FY '17 and $75 million for the full year. We still expect our FY '17 integration CapEx for TNT to be about $100 million, with total TNT CapEx at about USD 500 million. We expect annual pre-tax synergies, following the completion of the integration program in fiscal 2020, to be $750 million. We will have a full update on the TNT integration and outlook on the March call, and I'm not going to say much more about that today. 
At FedEx Freight, higher average daily LTL shipments helped FedEx Freight increase revenues 3%. Freight's competitive advantage of having the fastest published transit times in the LTL industry is driving higher growth in its priority service. The impact of lower weight per shipment and higher information technology expenses drove operating income lower. Freight continues to face a difficult macro environment and is working to manage costs and increase yields. 
For FedEx Ground, volume growth in residential services and commercial business, along with yield growth, helped push revenues up 9%. 
Operating income fell 12%, and operating margin declined to 10.5% due to increased rent, depreciation and staffing related to network expansion as well as higher purchased transportation rates. 
E-commerce continues to drive revenue growth, which provides a great opportunities as well as a difficult challenges. 
After challenges from higher-than-expected volumes in certain parts of the country during last peak, Ground invested in increased capacity and technology. This year, we completed 185 facility projects, including 4 major distribution hubs, 19 fully automated stations and 69 relocations. This equates to more than 10 million square feet of additional sortation space in the network. And all that comes at a cost above and beyond CapEx investment, including rent, building insurance and property tax. We also incurred higher costs from significant additional staffing as we hired and trained people, sometimes months in advance of the facility opening. And of course, purchased transportation increased as we pay contracted service providers to pick up, deliver and transport a growing number of packages. While these buildings and their state-of-the-art technology are a significant investment, they ensure that we have the capacity, flexibility and efficiency needed to handle e-commerce and commercial growth. 
Although our network projects are impacting Ground's near-term profitability, the investments will enhance long-term returns and cash flow. We are also working to better balance capacity and volume to improve revenue quality and margins. These actions contributed to the second quarter volume results and are also expected to mute third quarter volume growth. 
At FedEx Ground, home delivery and SmartPost network integration and delivery optimization initiatives continue. They will increase facility productivity and delivery density over time. We are also investing in technology to improve safety and mitigate rising insurance costs. We are committed to increasing margins at Ground over the longer term. 
Turning to our corporate outlook. Based on a moderate economic forecast that Mike discussed, we reaffirm expected earnings before year-end mark-to-market pension adjustments, and excluding TNT Express integration and Outlook restructuring cost and intangible asset amortization of $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share for FY '17. Our total capital expenditure forecast remains at $5.6 billion in FY '17, including TNT. This month, we made a $178 million contribution that was required to our pension fund, and next month, we plan to make a $1 billion debt-funded voluntary contribution to our tax-qualified U.S. domestic pension plans. 
Now we look forward to answering your strategic questions."

I just wonder if you could elaborate on that, and if I heard that right.

Let me make a comment about Ground expansion and then ask Mike to put more color on my remarks about Ground growth and our effort to manage our traffic a bit better than was the case in the past, and then Henry can jump in on margins. First, as it applies to the network expansion, I mentioned this in my remarks. But these facilities that FedEx Ground had put in place are enormous operations. Some of these things, correct me if I'm wrong, Henry, here -- like 250 acres plus. And the amount of sortation equipment inside are measured in miles, not in feet, and they're able to sort tens and tens of thousands of packages. So as the scale of this network has increased, the reality is we have to put the employees and the training in there. You can't just sort of open them up when the traffic is required. And the only reason I bring this up is that I'm consistently surprised, maybe more so by the popular media, with just the misunderstanding of the gigantic scale of the FedEx and UPS operations and, of course, the Postal Service as well, but the Postal Service is much more last mile rather than upstream. So I just want to put that in perspective. And given the level of capital that we put into the Ground business, it is very important for us that we get a good return on it. Now we don't have to get an immediate return. As I've said over and over again, and again today, we don't manage FedEx Corporation as a sum of the parts. We manage it as a broad market segment. And a few years ago, when Ground had less residential traffic, I mean, it was basically supporting increased growth in the corporation's earnings when we put a lot of effort into re-engineering the Express system. So with that in mind, let me talk -- let me ask Mike, then, to give some color to our traffic management efforts."

But as I've said many times on this call, our objective is to strike the right balance between volume growth and yield improvement to maximize operating margins at each operating company. In that regard, we're constantly looking at opportunities to do that. And over the last several month or so, we've made some decisions to discontinue relationships with a few customers where we couldn't candidly agree on pricing and capacity requirements for this peak season. And that's something we do on a regular basis, but we made that decision earlier this year. And as a result of that, we have been managing volumes, and we'll continue to do that. But clearly, it's had some effect on this peak season, but that was intentional on our part, and we'll continue to do that going forward."

So is that where the margin degradation really is occurring? Or is there some competitive pressure from the post office? Can you guys talk more?

Some of them take, not hundreds, but up to almost 1,000 people to staff and train. And in addition to that, at the same period of time that these facilities are coming online, we're staffing up for peak. So those are the 2 major expense drivers. Obviously, when volume goes up, revenue goes up. We must pay higher purchase transportation expenses because we pay contractors more. There's higher postage and higher linehaul settlement in moving that volume. So those are the drivers here."

Let me just add one other thing here because I think you hit the nail on the head and it relates back to Mike Glenn's comments. As I mentioned in my remarks, what keeps the lights on here, the vast majority of our revenue in FedEx Corporation is business-to-business. And a lot of it is business to consumer but it's not e-commerce. It may be all kinds of things. We look at these accounts every day, you'd be surprised. So e-commerce is basically residential deliveries. And you have to keep in balance the business-to-business and the business-to-consumer e-commerce or you can put extreme pressure on our Ground business. And so that is exactly what we were doing in making the decisions on these accounts that Mike mentioned. So no question, we're trying to manage that in an appropriate manner because just business-to-residential business -- I mean, the Postal Service is the biggest at all makes no money out of it. That should tell you something right there, and they're making millions of stops a day. So you can't be in our side of the business and not manage this.

Where can you continue to increase technology investments to decrease the need for peak seasonal hiring? 
We're going to ask Rob Carter to mention this, but let me just emphasize one more time. The FedEx Ground system is the most automated such system that you could possibly imagine. The reason for that is FedEx Ground was built in the age of computerization, so if you go to these great, big facilities, it may require a lot of people to offload and load trucks, but that requires no people to sort things. Now the FedEx Express system is a bit different because you have to have the flexibility to move things from one ramp to another and on down the line. But these things are marvels of automation, and over time, we will get even more out of this automation. And in that regard, I'll ask Rob Carter to comment on it."

I mean, in fact, we have 105 fully automated facilities in the Ground network now, not just the hubs that we're talking about, but the audit stations that exist that drive incredible automation in that network. And that automation contributes not only during peak, per Ken's question, but all year long. But virtually, all of our technology investments and operations contribute to increased efficiency and productivity throughout the operation, and they are incredibly valuable to us. Route optimization, for example, is driving incredible efficiencies as we're out on the road. We're increasing route density and stop density all across the network in Freight, Ground and Express with the route technology. But Mike also mentioned in his comments the customer-facing technologies, which are improving these efficiencies as well. Things like Delivery Manager that are giving customers more choices that increase security and convenience. But at the same time, with those choices, customers are then driving into some of our convenience network. Increased stop density and route density, that improves our operational efficiency as well. So all down the line, everything from analytics about better ways to load trailers to sensors that are automating and optimizing scan technology are driving really incredible efficiencies in the network. And all this is already in market today, but is being perfected year by year by year to increase and improve efficiency in the network. So the answer is yes, Ken, but the reality is it's improving efficiencies all year round, not just in peak."

And actually, since the profit improvement plan went in, in FY '13, we're up 140%. So how about those numbers? On the issue of the volume in United States domestic, we had some issues in the volume off the West -- East Coast, primarily due to Hurricane Matthew. We had a typhoon, too, that actually hit the West Coast. So we had a little bit of an issue on both sides of the coast for us. But in the main, we are about where we thought we were -- would be.

These huge facilities that we're opening up at FedEx Ground are being opened with the firm belief that our FedEx Ground traffic is going to grow, whether it's B2B or whether it's B2C. And for all of the reasons that Rob Carter mentioned to you and Henry commented upon, these facilities, when they open up, aren't nearly at their max capacity. So as more volume goes through these sorting facilities, the marginal cost of sorting, because it's all automated, is shockingly low. So there's huge amount of leverage into these network investments, or as Alan and I both have said, we wouldn't be making them. Now you get to the point on the yield side of the house because you start talking about pickup and delivery and linehaul expenses versus the network infrastructure. There's where it's important to have the appropriate mix of traffic so that you keep your linehaul and your PUD costs at a reasonable relationship, but the bow wave of putting these fixed facilities out will be accretive to margins as more volume goes through there, regardless of whether it's B2B or B2C, and particularly, as Henry puts one network together with these initiatives that he's described to you and which culminates I think in FY '19 or 20? 20. So that's why we say with some confidence, these results will pop back up. You can't just put these facilities out and operate them at full capacity day 1.

Listen, there's 3 distinct phases of the integration of SmartPost into Ground, and I apologize because we probably haven't been as clear on this as we need to be. The first was dissolving the corporate entity and moving SmartPost employees and management into Ground. That happened back in September of last year, September of '15. What I would call Phase 2 was beginning of the diversion of outbound SmartPost volume from their facilities into Ground hubs, which helped improve load factor, drove down linehaul costs and improved service. There are 2 parts to what we call delivery optimization or internally here, we call it the Terminator. The first part of that came in January of 2016, which was really the ability to manually divert volume that we knew had a high likelihood of matching the Ground package or better yet, just needed to be in the Ground network. The second phase or the second part of this comes in July of '17, next summer, when we will get the ability to virtually divert packages, where the system will see matches and automatically divert them out of SmartPost into FedEx Ground. We won't fully realize the benefits of that capability until fiscal '19 and beyond."

It involves discussing the potential impact of 100% expense in -- expensing, significant earnings that could be -- outside the U.S. could be repatriated, and impact to our healthcare plan. So let me take that those in reverse order. We have an outstanding healthcare plan for our teammates, but it does not meet the definition of a Cadillac plan. So like everyone else, we'll be watching these developments as they unfold, but we're very pleased with what we're delivering for our teammates. At May 31, we had about $1.6 billion of permanently reinvested offshore and have about $775 million in cash offshore. We currently plan to use that cash to fund Express TNT needs offshore and have no plans to repatriate that to the U.S. That, also, is a statement that says we're not going to be taxed on those earnings that we've left outside. If we are, we'll probably bring some of those back to pay those taxes. The bigger issue for all of you to look at longer-term for us is the features that are in the GOP blueprint in President-elect Trump's plans that we like a lot, and those include materially lowering the tax rate, the effective territorial treatment of foreign earnings and current expensing of CapEx. We think that will positively impact our top line through stronger economic growth, and of course, the bottom line, potentially in a very big way, through the lower tax rate. Having said that, we are concerned about the border adjustability concept and are trying to figure out how it would affect us directly as well as our customers and trade and global growth in general. And right now, there's a huge debate going on that. So as always, the devil's going to be in the details, and we'll just have to report back to you later as this begins to unfold. But if you think about our tax rate this year in the 36% to 37% range, a 20% tax rate would be a mighty fine Christmas gift."

Alan mentioned that we're not a Cadillac plan at the moment. The reason we're not a Cadillac plan is because we adjusted our plan when the Affordable Care Act -- to move to more consumer-driven healthcare with much better tools for our teammates to buy healthcare more expertly and at lower cost. We did things like put in clinics at our high-employment locations, and we also gave all of our employees HRAs in order for them to pay for some of their deductibles and so forth. So we avoided hitting the Cadillac tax because of the steps that we took. Now if ACA is not modified in that respect, given healthcare inflation, there's a good chance we would hit the Cadillac tax in the out-years, which would result in truly onerous taxes on the benefits above the Cadillac tax level of 40%. So one of the most important things that we would like to see in the reform of the Affordable Care Act is to do away with the Cadillac tax limit. And that would give us the freedom to do some other things in our healthcare that we might not be able to do as long as we're on that trajectory towards a 40% excise tax. It really penalizes excellent healthcare plans like we have relative to other folks. So it's important to understand that context of our healthcare plan design, which was a reaction to the Affordable Care Act and a very significant cost that would be incurred in the excise tax in the Cadillac tax plan. I might say this parenthetically to that, that this past year, we paid -- how much in ACA taxes was it, Alan? $65 million?"

Okay. One more. So there are about 3 or 4 questions here on macro and trade, in particular. There's 1 from David Vernon. There's another 1 from Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank, David Ross of Stifel. So I'm going to put this all together, if you don't mind. 
Obviously, we are very concerned about the trade issue, which is one of the reasons that I gave a speech on December 9 at the Competitiveness Institute [ph], which was scheduled long before the election results were known because both the Democrats and the Republicans were running on anti-trade platforms. So if you go to policy.fedex.com, you can read that speech. It is not a polemic and it's not a political speech. It is just a factual speech, which points out that 1 in 5 American's jobs are related to trade, and we have a trade surplus and services in trade. We have a surplus, when you take the 20 countries that we have free trade agreements with. So the prospect of significantly reducing trade is, in our opinion, significantly dangerous, and the proper approach is to lean into trade and try to remove barriers, which, by the way, the Trans-Pacific Partnership did to our exports, not to stop people from selling products and services to us. So I hope that, that will make a difference in the debate out there. I would point out, there's an excellent article in Barron's by -- I forget the gentleman's first name, Epstein, which sound -- very similar themes. And again, it's fact based, it's not politically based. So we hope these things will be considered. And I think what Alan said to you about the border-adjustable tax is spot on. This is just very destructive of trade. It's not a proper solution to the problem. I think if they lowered the tax rate and went to territorial, it would accomplish 95% of all of the benefits they're looking for and ignite a significant investment boom in the United States. It would solve the inversion problem. So they've got some very, very good people in this cabinet. And finally, I think the second-largest economy in the world is China. In the speech I just mentioned, we were very direct on our own experiences with China and Japan in terms of their tendencies to engage in mercantilist practices. And we feel very strongly it's in China's best interest to open up their markets. And many of the things that the Chinese administration are trying to accomplish would be facilitated by opening up rather than keeping their markets closed. So we're worried about it, but we hope that all of these facts will be carefully considered before the Congress or the administration does anything, which might be injurious based on the facts of the matter."

So traffic levels are affected on the margin by exchange rates. So when you have the dollar running up to the extent that it has here recently, which has been significant, U.S. exports are not as affordable and attractive to people on -- in other areas. So it puts a lot of pressure on U.S. exports. On the other side of the coin, with the diminution in the value of the euro or any other currency, it obviously makes their goods less expensive to the United States. So you will see, with some adjustment, disproportionate traffic growth there given the fact that we've got great sales people on both sides of all of the oceans. So I don't think you should read into that on these small perturbations anything more than exchange rates adjustments. Now over the longer haul, assuming there's good macroeconomic policy, which, quite frankly, is not the case in most places around, and hopefully, will be the case with tax reform here, you'll see economic growth. And even with the exchange rates, you'll see volumes growing.

So it's in the tax rate range I gave you as well for the year and it's in the adjusted guidance I gave you for the year. As to the gain on the sale of an investment, because this rose to the level that it did, a materiality of $0.08, we thought we'd alert you to that. We have hundreds of little bitty items that go plus and minus in every quarter that we don't talk to you about because they don't reach the level of materiality, but this one did. So it's also in the range, but it's only $0.08, and the range is $0.50 wide. I would put out -- point out in the second quarter, year-over-year, our tax rate was higher. And our tax rate is complicated, as we absorb TNT and work through our new tax planning structure. And we'll wait to see what comes out of Washington, so standby. That's the one that I got the least confidence about, but we'll keep at it."

I think the change is the rapid growth rate we're seeing in these things as people get more comfortable ordering just about anything over the Internet. We had 8 annexes for non-conveyables this year at peak. I think only 2 of those we intended to be permanent post peak. But I will tell you that we still have some peak left here, but the early reports are this has been a home run in terms of keeping large, very difficult to handle packages out of our hubs by virtue of the fact that we've had such terrific service performance this year, and our hub productivity has been excellent as well. So I would say that this is something that we will stick with. I think we still have some work to do in terms of where we site them. And I think I mentioned this on other calls in here, there's also some pretty promising advancements in material handling technology to handle these kind of packages. And as we learn more about that and as we experience whether the benefits that are promised are actually there, I think the next step will be trying to figure out how we retrofit existing facilities with that new material handling technology."

We've been saying for a couple of years now that we believe FedEx Corporation's earnings, margins, cash flows and returns will go up. So let me reiterate that again that we believe that to be the case. The reason we think that they're going to go up is because the structure of our networks are such that there is leverage in those networks. And in the Express system, for instance, we're re-fleeting much more efficient. We're moving our International Economy in non-asset systems. We have much more capacity in Europe, the pickup and delivery density in Europe. And the Ground situation, I just mentioned the fact that these investments in these facilities, as more and more volume goes through there, they are accretive of and by themselves. In the Freight area, we are very confident that the technologies that we have, which, by the way, allowed us, for the first time in the history of the LTL business, to offer both a priority and economy service. Nobody had the technology to do that. It would have been literally a scheduling impossibility, absent the sophistication of the technology. Now we're applying that same technology to get more leverage out of our facilities in terms of throughput; cross-dock, if you will, in Freight; better loading. We have robots under test that -- I could go on here all afternoon. There are just numerous places where we think we have increased earnings leverage with increased volume. An equal part of that, however, is to be, as Mike Glenn has said several times, you have to be disciplined. The reality in the transportation business, and for that matter, broadening it to the transportation and logistics business, these markets are so huge. You can get a lot of volume that is completely non-compensatory and just not make any money. And there are a large number of transportation and logistics companies that prove that every quarter making no money. And some of them are pretty damn big. So we just have a lot of leverage points, and that's why we say what we have said. If that changes, we'll say that, too. But we're not prepared to give you, despite my best efforts to do so, over the General Counsel's objections, to do what that is. But Alan is very good at giving you the ranges at the start of the year, and we're very confident that we can increase our margins, cash flows, earnings per share and our returns with what we're doing. I'm going to say one thing again that I said in my opening remarks. This is an enormous enterprise, and I can't tell you on any one given quarter that we're going to have everything lined up in every segment. If I did that, it would be incorrect and misleading. What I can say is that we think we can manage to those metrics I just gave you."

Welcome, everyone, to the discussion of our results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2016, a significant year for FedEx.
We announced some time ago we would complete the acquisition of TNT Express in the first half of calendar 2016, and we officially acquired the company on May 25. Greatly appreciate the outstanding work of our Express, finance and legal teams in getting this transaction completed without conditions.
Annual revenue exceeded $50 billion for the first time, and we're particularly pleased with our adjusted operating margin improvement of 1% year-over-year to 10% for fiscal year 2016 and our adjusted operating margin of 11.7% for the fourth quarter. We believe we will continue to increase margins, earnings per share, cash flows and capital returns over the next several years given expectations for moderate economic growth and excluding TNT financial results and pension mark-to-market costs.
I'd like to congratulate and thank all FedEx team members around the world for their dedication to our Purple Promise, which simply states, ""I will make every FedEx experience outstanding."" As we integrate the acquisitions of TNT, GENCO and FedEx CrossBorder, we'll continue making investments in modernizing the FedEx Express aircraft fleet and expanding the highly automated FedEx Ground network to extend our leadership in the rapidly growing e-commerce market. These initiatives are integral to achieving our goals.
Let me close with a few brief remarks regarding Friday's successful conclusion of the Internet pharmacy case. First, I'd like to thank our inside and outside counsel. They did an outstanding job representing our company. FedEx has always been innocent of these charges, which should never have been filed. We strongly believe that we should not admit to things we did not do and pay millions to avoid a criminal trial. FedEx delivered packages for licensed pharmacies registered by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Very few companies have done more during the last 4 decades to cooperate with law enforcement than FedEx, as was true in these matters, and we will continue to do so.
We're especially proud of the hundreds of thousands of FedEx team members worldwide, who demonstrate every day their commitment to provide our important services safely, reliably and at all times, ethically.
Now let me turn it over to Mike Glenn, who will comment on the economy and our revenue; followed by Alan Graf, who will discuss FedEx's financial performance. Mike?"

I'll open with our economic update and outlook, and then we'll discuss business performance in each of the segments.

I'll open with our economic update and outlook, and then we'll discuss business performance in each of the segments. And then I'll have some commentary on broader business trends.
On the economic front, we continue to see moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP forecast is 1.8% for calendar '16, which is 40 basis points lower than our forecast last quarter. And we forecast 2.4% for calendar '17, led by gains in consumer spending. We expect industrial production to decline 0.6% in calendar '16, 120 basis points lower than last quarter, and increase 2.3% next year. Our global GDP forecast is 2.3% for calendar '16, 20 basis points below last quarter, and calls for 2.8% growth for calendar 2017.
Now I'll review revenue, volume and yield trends by segment. In the Express segment, U.S. domestic average daily package volume was essentially flat in the quarter due to the decline in the deferred product category. Yield per package increased approximately 1% year-over-year despite lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic package yield grew 2.3%, primarily due to rate and discounts. Revenue grew 2.1% year-over-year, driven by one more operating day and yield growth. Excluding the impact of the fuel surcharge, domestic revenue grew 3.7% year-over-year.
FedEx International Economy average daily volume grew 3.5%, while FedEx International Priority average daily volume declined 2.1%. International export revenue per package decreased 2.6% as lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable currency exchange rates negatively impacted the yields. Excluding fuel, international export express package yield was slightly positive, primarily driven by the positive impact of rate and discount changes, which outweighed the negative impact of exchange rates.
In the Ground segment, FedEx Ground revenue increased 20% in the quarter, driven by higher ground volume and yield and the recording of SmartPost revenues on a gross basis versus the previous net treatment. FedEx Ground average daily volume grew 10% year-over-year in Q4, primarily driven by continued growth after peak season for both residential and commercial deliveries. FedEx Ground revenue per package increased 7% year-over-year in Q4 due to the recording of FedEx SmartPost revenues on a gross basis and higher base rates, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, ground yield per package, including SmartPost, increased 8.6% year-over-year, driven primarily by extra service charges and weight per package, offsetting a decrease due to SmartPost volume mix.
FedEx Freight revenue increased 2.3% as average daily shipments increased 7.5% year-over-year and revenue per shipment declined 5.3% year-over-year.
As a reminder, Q4 in FY '16 contained one more business day than Q4 in FY '15. The continued strength in shipment volume is driven by our sales efforts with small and medium customers and reflects the speed, reliability and choice of priority and economy service for our LTL customers, and we also saw increased demand from our larger customers during the quarter. Revenue per LTL shipment declined due to lower fuel surcharge revenue and lower weight per package. Including the impact of fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per shipment was down 2.1% year-over-year due to lower weight per shipment.
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to further discuss and address the growth of e-commerce, which continues to outpace GDP growth, both in the U.S. and globally. E-commerce has become a way of life for consumers acquiring goods around the world, but the success of e-commerce continues to be dependent on transportation companies' ability to reliably and quickly make residential deliveries around the world. As we noted during our last conference call on earnings, more than 95% of e-commerce packages in the U.S. are delivered by FedEx, UPS and the United States Postal Service, with whom we have a strategic relationship to transport their priority mail. E-commerce would be impossible without these companies and our expansive networks. If you were to isolate the FedEx e-commerce business, it would become clear FedEx is one of the most profitable e-commerce companies in business today.
During the past quarter, we've made significant investments in expanding our global transportation portfolio and e-commerce capabilities around the world, including the acquisition of TNT, the introduction of FedEx Cross -- and the introduction of FedEx CrossBorder. The TNT acquisition will transform the global transportation and logistics industry. It is the largest acquisition in FedEx history and instantly accelerates our European and global growth strategy. FedEx now has a strong presence in Europe, with a range of transportation options from express to economy for both parcel and freight. This significant enhancement to our portfolio in Europe helps not only our customers in Europe, but also provides benefits for customers around the world shipping into Europe.
In addition, we will substantially enhance our capabilities globally by leveraging TNT's lower-cost road networks in different regions around the world. While the integration will take time to fully execute, we have the benefit of similar and complementary corporate cultures and a common mission of providing superior service and value to customers around the world.
FedEx CrossBorder offers e-commerce technology solutions that enables e-tailers to navigate common cross-border selling challenges such as regulatory compliance, secure payment processing, multiple currency pricing or credit card fraud protection and also offers access to e-commerce shoppers around the world. CrossBorder is the relaunch of Bongo International, a company FedEx acquired in 2014. When combined with our recent GENCO acquisition, we have significantly strengthened our e-commerce portfolio of services.
Of course, demand for e-commerce increases significantly each year during the peak holiday season, and we're deep into preparations for the upcoming 2016 peak season. We're closely collaborating with large e-tail and retail customers to understand their peak shipping needs, including geographic mix and package characteristics, so that we can once again have our resources positioned and ready to provide outstanding service.
We'll also be leveraging some new and evolving services to meet the heavy demand during peak, including FedEx Delivery Manager, FedEx SameDay and an expansion in FedEx Hold at Location services. Delivery Manager allows U.S. package recipients to customize home deliveries to fit their schedules, including changing the time and location of delivery, requesting a signature upon delivery or leaving instructions for the courier. FedEx SameDay City is available in 24 markets across the country, offering customers same-day service with uniformed FedEx drivers, branded vehicles, realtime tracking and world-renowned FedEx reliability. FedEx Hold at Location offers secure package pickup at more than 2,400 FedEx locations, including more than 1,800 FedEx Office retail stores. These hold services allow customers to redirect packages for pickup and drop-off at FedEx and many other third-party locations.
One additional point is we continue to get questions concerning Amazon and the evolution of their transportation capabilities and needs. Amazon continues to be a valuable customer, and they're among the large e-tailers that we stay in close dialogue with throughout the year to understand their transportation needs as they continue to experience significant growth and generate demand for FedEx transportation. Because of our close relationship with Amazon and close collaboration, we have a very clear and specific understanding of their needs across the FedEx portfolio during FY '17. And further, we expect them to be a significant customer for many years to come. Having said that, it is important to remember that no single FedEx customer represents more than approximately 3% of total revenue.
Finally, I'd like to mention the introduction of the new FedEx Freight box, which makes transporting less-than-truckload shipments simple with improved flexibility, increased security, better shipment integrity and best of all, no freight classification. The FedEx Freight box comes in 2 sizes, a standard freight box that requires a pallet to ship and a smaller freight box with an integrated pallet. The freedom to choose your freight box makes freight shipping accessible for any business, no matter the size. With a distance-based pricing structure, the FedEx Freight box allows you to ship LTL, avoiding the complex and antiquated pricing structure used in the industry. The Freight box was introduced in selected markets with great success during the second half of FY '16 and is rolling out to customers nationwide this month.
And now I'll turn it over to Alan Graf."

We had a great quarter. Adjusted earnings of $3.30 per diluted share increased 24% year-over-year, and our adjusted consolidated operating margin increased 11.7% versus 10.5%",1324,"Thanks, Mike, for your very informative comments, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter. Adjusted earnings of $3.30 per diluted share increased 24% year-over-year, and our adjusted consolidated operating margin increased 11.7% versus 10.5% last year.
Among the operating companies, Express was the most valuable player of the quarter, posting an impressive double, double. Operating income was 27% higher versus last year's adjusted income, and operating margin climbed to 11.3%. Operating income grew at Ground as average daily volume increased 10%, and Freight's operating income was unchanged.
And profit growth at Express, despite essentially flat revenue for Q4 year-over-year, is a strong testament to Express' continued yield and cost management efforts. Yield did have a positive impact year-over-year on the quarter, while currency exchange rate changes have little net impact. One additional operating day also provided a benefit.
We expect Express operating income at FY '17 to continue to improve as we manage network capacity to match customer demand, reduce structural costs, modernize our fleet and drive productivity increases throughout our U.S. and international operations. These benefits will be partially offset due to timing of aircraft maintenance events and one fewer operating day.
The capper on our remarkable year was the acquisition of TNT Express. We had a seamless and very successful first day when we acquired TNT on May 25, a few days before our fiscal year-end. Today is our 28th day of owning TNT. We have a solid integration plan that we are in process of validating with live data. Our senior leadership team is in place, and we are partnering together in the marketplace for commercial opportunities to bring the best solutions for our customers.
The transaction, financing and integration plan expenses related to this acquisition were $132 million or $0.45 per diluted share in FY '16, which considers certain nontax deductible costs as a result of the closing of the acquisition. These expenses include TNT's operating results from the time of acquisition and are predominantly included in corporate eliminations and others in FY '16.
In FY '17, we will report the operating results for FedEx Express and TNT separately in 2 different segments. We will also provide an overview of the FedEx Express group, which combines the 2 segments.
Given the timing and complexity of the acquisition, presentation of TNT on our financial statements, including the allocation of the purchase price, is preliminary and will likely change in future periods. We plan to complete our purchase price allocation no later than the fourth quarter of FY '17.
TNT operates road transportation networks and delivers documents, parcels and freight to over 200 countries. This strategic acquisition broadens our portfolio of international transportation solutions with the combined strength of TNT's strong European road platform and our strength in other regions globally, including North America and Asia.
Prior to our acquisition, TNT announced its outlook strategy aimed at doubling its adjusted operating income and margin percentage by 2018. That profit improvement program includes various initiatives focused on yield management, operational efficiency and productivity and customer service. We plan to continue these profit improvement initiatives in FY '17, and we'll also begin activities to integrate operations. Our focus will be on combining TNT's strong European capabilities with our strength in other regions globally.
Although we are in the very beginning of the integration process and are continuing to validate our information, we currently expect our FY '17 integration CapEx for TNT to be about $100 million and integration costs to be around $200 million. However, the timing and amount of these costs is subject to change as our plans are refined. Integration expenses, including professional fees, information technology costs and intangible asset amortization related to TNT, are expected to impact operating income and margin during FY '17.
We are very excited about the TNT acquisition, and we'll provide you updates on the operating results and integration costs on a quarterly basis going forward. We do expect TNT to be accretive to earnings in FY '18.
Turning to our Ground segment. Operating income grew year-over-year due to higher volumes and increased revenue per package as well as the benefit of one additional operating day. These factors were partially offset by higher operating costs, including network expansion expenses. Operating margin was lower due to the change in SmartPost revenue reporting.
We expect Ground revenues and operating income to increase in FY '17, driven by e-commerce volume growth and market share gains. We also anticipate continued yield growth through the yield management programs, including changes to our pricing for larger shipments. However, we anticipate Ground operating margin will be negatively impacted by higher operating costs in FY '17, driven again by network expansion. Other operational costs may also impact margins as residential volumes grow from e-commerce.
Capital expenditures at Ground are expected to be about $2 billion in FY '17 as we continue to make investments to grow our highly profitable network through facility expansions and equipment purchases. The impact of the depreciation of these investments will continue to partly offset earnings growth in FY '17 at Ground.
At Freight, operating income was unchanged as improved operating efficiencies, higher revenue and an additional operating day were offset by increased salaries and employee benefits expense and the impact from lower weight per shipment. During FY '17, we expect revenue, operating income and operating margin improvement at Freight, driven by continued effective yield management as well as modest volume growth from small and midsize customers. Freight earnings growth will also be positively impacted by improvement in productivity and further investments in technology.
We incurred a noncash pretax mark-to-market pension accounting loss of $1.5 billion in 2016. Due to its effect on income before income taxes, the adjustment for mark-to-market accounting reduced our 2016 effective tax rate by 120 basis points. Our effective tax rate was 33.6% in fiscal '16, which was also favorably impacted by an internal corporate restructuring done to facilitate the integration of FedEx Express and TNT and was offset by nondeductible costs incurred as part of the acquisition. For FY '17, we're anticipating making contributions totaling $1.1 billion to our U.S. pension plans.
In FY '16, we continued to buy back shares, repurchasing $2.7 billion of our common stock through open market purchases. From FY '14 through FY '16, we repurchased 63 million shares of FedEx common stock and returned more than $8.8 billion to shareholders at an average price of $140 per share. As of May 31, 2016, we had approximately 19 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase. A few weeks ago, we announced that we were boosting our dividend by 60% for a total of $0.40 per share per quarter.
Turning to our outlook. Based on the outlook that Mike described from an economic standpoint and the momentum we have, we project adjusted earnings to be $11.75 to $12.25 per diluted share for FY '17, excluding TNT financial results, including integration and financing costs and year-end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments.
Our expectations for earnings growth in FY '17 are dependent on key external factors, including fuel prices and global economic conditions. Due to our recent acquisition of TNT, FY '17 will be a year of intense integration activities for our dedicated team at Express. We are committed to the successful integration of these 2 great businesses. Meanwhile, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight will continue to be focused on achieving their goals, independent of the integration at Express.
Our capital expenditures are expected to be about $5.1 billion in FY '17, excluding TNT. We anticipate that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our increased capital expenditures in FY '17, which will include spending for network expansion at Ground, as I discussed, and the continued aircraft fleet modernization at Express. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we are well positioned to continue to increase corporate earnings, cash flows, returns and margins.
With that, we will open up for strategic questions."

There may have been 1 or 2 others that have come in on the Internet. And Mickey will be looking at the calls coming in, and we'll try to answer as many of these as we can. There are a lot of questions in the 43 that were submitted that we won't address for one reason or another, and let me deal with those. 
One, there were a number about Brexit. The reality is we don't have any better crystal ball than anybody else, so we don't think it's appropriate for us to be speculating on what may happen in the United Kingdom. And should Brexit take place, obviously, we'll be telling folks what we intend to do to adjust to the new situation. But it's certainly premature.
Second, lots of questions on TNT. We'll take a number of them, but quite a few are focused on areas where it's just too early in the process for us to deal with. For instance, what are the implications of the South American road network of TNT and the Southeast Asian road network of TNT? And our regional presidents and the Express management are working through that with the integration team, so we're going to defer those until we get a little bit further along.
Third, there are a fair number that are hypotheticals about what new services we might offer, or adjacencies. And of course, that's not in our best interest to answer from a competitive standpoint. So now let me get to some of them that do hit the nail on the head.
With the acquisition of TNT, can you discuss major IT requirements going forward? Specifically, are the current systems robust enough for the combined entity? And are there any needs at the product service level? So I'm going to ask our great CIO, Rob Carter, to opine on this."

We've prepared diligently over the years with integrations of acquisitions in Mexico, Brazil, the U.K., Africa, India and others around the world to become really quite good at the process of integrating customers, integrating products into the mix. We also have been working very hard on our systems here at FedEx to modernize and simplify them in ways that really position them to be very effective at integration activities. 
So that's a key design point for the systems that we've been building and pushing forward. And then lastly, we've had a planning and execution team on the ground with the teams. We've done very robust planning with regard to these integrations, including what it would take on day 1, which was executed flawlessly; what our needs are at day 100; and then as we go forward, the preferred future state of the organization and the systems that will be needed to operate with the combined entity. So we're very confident in the systems that we have, the team that we have and the efforts that are underway to support our customers."

I already knew that their culture lined up with our culture. I was over there on day 1 for the integration 28 days ago. And I can tell you that they're excited and we're excited. So going forward, you're going to have the integration take place that needs to take place so that we make sure we do it right, and when we come out of the integration process, we have the most powerful service, cultural for people and profitable business that you can have over there in Europe.

Let me make sure you understand that comment that was just made. There's nothing in that guidance pro or con from TNT. So obviously, we picked up the TNT revenues and whatever profitability they have plus the integration expenses. That's what I meant when I started early on by saying it's very early days with us, and we'll update this in September. 
But I will say one thing here, that it's obvious to me, looking at some of the questions and some of the reports that have been published. There's this sort of underlying theme that TNT is its own business and it's had these low margins and so that's going to go forward. The whole rationale of buying TNT, in fact, it's right in the middle of this whole e-commerce debate. In this business, the #1 item after the linehaul and upstream systems is delivery density, cost per stop, the number of stops per hour and so forth. So the 2 plus 2 equals 7 equation, so to speak, of us buying TNT is extraordinary. 
And that's why Alan says to you with such authority, as we integrate these PUD networks and take advantage of the unmatched surface networks with TNT, there's going to be a tremendous opportunity to increase the margins and earnings in the Express segment. So we know we're going to have about $200 million in integration expense. We can't tell you exactly when it is, but offsetting that are going to be the TNT revenues and the profitability of their existing business on a go-forward basis. So I hope that clarified it a bit.
Let me take another -- a couple or 3 of these Internet questions submitted in advance. David Vernon of Bernstein. How important are store replenishment activities in the FedEx portfolio of services as e-commerce takes share from traditional retail? Is there a risk that demand for any set of services falls off in a consequential manner? Mike and Henry, you want to comment on that?"

So we don't expect any major impact in terms of our volumes going to retail.

We know from research that the millennial generation, the largest generational cohort in American history, is not going to stop going to stores. In fact, we had a wonderful presentation about it just a couple of weeks ago at our board meeting. So e-commerce is fantastic, and it's going to continue to grow. And we intend to be a major player in that space.
But as Mike just said, it's not going to, in our opinion and in the research from very credible sources, going to eliminate retail. What it may do is change the character of retail. And one of the things that you see happening are very focused, integrated product and store networks. Two that come to mind that are just fantastically successful are Zara, which is a company that's located in Spain and well known for its fast cycle, small shipment replenishment of its stores. They're able to turn on a dime with what's selling and move it around the world. And in Japan, a great company called UNIQLO that does the same sort of thing. 
So as these types of retail operations continue to proliferate, there'll be a fair amount of B2B business. And as Mike said, remember, of all retail, e-commerce is now about 10%, growing fast, taking share. But it's going to be a long time before retail is threatened. And B2B, meaning the underpinnings of the business world, medical, production, automotive and things like that, that in the main is not going to be diverted to e-commerce anytime soon. And that is the backbone of the FedEx networks.
Let me take one more here while we're queuing up another call. Demand for final-mile service by the USPS is outgrowing demand for traditional package services, driven in part by the popularity of SmartPost. Does FedEx see any risk or opportunities associated with the UPS -- USPS's ability to invest and keep pace with that demand? Mike, Henry, you want to take that one?"

At some point, it may make more sense for us to deliver a lot of the SmartPost packages in our network. As Henry has talked about, we certainly have the technological capability to do that. And when we do that, our cost goes down. So we think we're pretty well prepared."

And we intend to work on improving those over the next 24 months. So I think I've been in the financial markets, from a debt standpoint, a lot in the last couple of years. And we'll probably take a little break on that because as I said, we think -- well, we know we have the cash flow coverage for what we're trying to do. 
So going forward, we've always said we're a capital-intensive, growing transportation company. We think the sweet spot for CapEx is 6% to 8% of revenue. Next couple of years, we're going to be above that basically because we're re-fleeting, we're expanding Ground as rapidly as we can, as efficiently as we can, and we've got the TNT integration to put together. But having said that, it's very manageable what's in front of us. As I said, we are going to continue to increase earnings, cash flows, returns and margins. And we have been improving our ROICs, and we've been definitely improving our return on equity. But at the end of the day, that's not the most important metric. The most important metric is shareholder return.
So over the last 5 years, we have had a share price return of 88%, which is a CAGR of a little bit over 14.1%. That compares to 53% for UPS, 63% for S&P 500 and 47.5% for the Dow Jones Transports. That's the number that's the most important for our shareholders, and the same goes for total return. And when I go back longer term, the last 15 years, our total return to shareholders had been 377.6%. UPS has been 170%. So while ROC and ROE -- ROIC and ROE are nice metrics, they don't win the ballgame."

And on an average daily volume basis, our volume has doubled over the last 10 years. So you have to expand CapEx to build the capacity you need just to run the business day to day here.
On the SmartPost side, we're well along. We haven't integrated all the facilities yet, and that's largely due to the fact that the growth in that service has been such that we've been a little bit constrained by Ground capacity and being able to move more volume into the network. But the 2 big IT events, the first occurred in January, which allows us to begin manually matching addresses on packages and moving them into the Ground network for final delivery. And then the next big event will come next summer, where virtually we can have the system match addresses and move them.
And as I've explained in the past, you move a SmartPost package into the Ground network, you can deliver that incremental package for roughly 25% of the postage as opposed to tendering it to the USPS. So we're pretty excited about that. We're looking forward to getting this thing behind us."

I would say we would have a hard time putting up a list of the things that don't concern us given the 2 candidates' position. But obviously, we're concerned about the anti-trade rhetoric, a lot of the anti-business positions, and it's very worrisome. But hopefully, after the election, cooler heads will prevail. There are lots of things that need to be addressed. We've talked about it many times. I mean, China has been quite mercantilist in its trade policies. But the way to deal with that is to negotiate with China and not to threaten them or take all of the huge benefits of trade and throw them away. We have thousands and tens of thousands of highly compensated people working for FedEx in the United States that are involved in trade: pilots, mechanics, customs clearance people, pickup and delivery personnel. That's the story that never gets told when the tragedy of a local plant closing gets put on the TV.

It is. And I think it's important because there have been several things that have been printed about this, which indicate a lack of clarity out there about this. When Dave and his team did the deal with Boeing on the 767s, it called for 10 firm airplanes per year over a number of years to a total of 50. And then there were options with given dates. And these 6 aircraft were the first options that became due, and they are for delivery in fiscal year '19 and '20. The next options are not due until June of calendar year 2018, when Express will decide whether it wants to exercise a tranche of 6. And then the next one after that is June '19 with a tranche of 6. Basic deal is we have 10 firm airplanes per year and the ability to go up to 16 airplanes. Now it's a little more complicated than that in the outyears. But Dave, you want to add anything on this?"

Long question, but to net it down, do you think it's feasible for someone to build an efficient national parcel network that combines in-house air and truck linehaul between regions, but outsources the costly last-mile delivery to either the U.S. Postal Service or the low-cost regional local couriers? Is that a competitive threat that concerns you?
The answer to that is no. And the reason for that is that the upstream infrastructure to do that is enormous. I wish I could have a film or something to show you these facilities. Henry has got -- how many hubs with the new opening this year, Henry? 30?"

I mean, the size of these things are 250 to 300 acres. They handle tens of thousands of packages. The miles driven by FedEx Ground per year is 1.2 billion miles, and Freight's in the same capacity level. So these upstream moats are very substantial. And actually, the last mile is the easiest thing to do if you don't have any upstream infrastructure. Problem there is that you cut yourself off from the tens of millions or billions of potential other shippers from every other part of the world that can be co-mingled to lower stop cost by having more stops per hour or more deliveries per stop.
And that's the thing that we've been consistently saying. I used the word fantastic, although if you'll recall, because all of these analyses are either unmindful of that or they make assumptions that are erroneous when you actually understand what the real world numbers are. Let me just give you one statistic. I don't mean to impeach any one entity, but there have been several analyst reports that have come out and said, ""Well, 767 airplanes can carry 120,000 pounds."" And so the calculations are done on that. The maximum cubic revenue payload of a 767, and we're pretty damn good at this, is far less than 120,000 pounds.
And if you load it up with just pallets, you're probably talking about 2/3 of that, if that. The airport locations to process these things and the containers, they're more difficult than the airplanes by far. So I use this opportunity -- thanks for the question, Bascome -- but again, to point out some of the analysis that's being done that's not in accordance with the facts on the ground, literally and figuratively."

Welcome, everyone, to the discussion of our results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2016, a significant year for FedEx.
We announced some time ago we would complete the acquisition of TNT Express in the first half of calendar 2016, and we officially acquired the company on May 25. Greatly appreciate the outstanding work of our Express, finance and legal teams in getting this transaction completed without conditions.
Annual revenue exceeded $50 billion for the first time, and we're particularly pleased with our adjusted operating margin improvement of 1% year-over-year to 10% for fiscal year 2016 and our adjusted operating margin of 11.7% for the fourth quarter. We believe we will continue to increase margins, earnings per share, cash flows and capital returns over the next several years given expectations for moderate economic growth and excluding TNT financial results and pension mark-to-market costs.
I'd like to congratulate and thank all FedEx team members around the world for their dedication to our Purple Promise, which simply states, ""I will make every FedEx experience outstanding."" As we integrate the acquisitions of TNT, GENCO and FedEx CrossBorder, we'll continue making investments in modernizing the FedEx Express aircraft fleet and expanding the highly automated FedEx Ground network to extend our leadership in the rapidly growing e-commerce market. These initiatives are integral to achieving our goals.
Let me close with a few brief remarks regarding Friday's successful conclusion of the Internet pharmacy case. First, I'd like to thank our inside and outside counsel. They did an outstanding job representing our company. FedEx has always been innocent of these charges, which should never have been filed. We strongly believe that we should not admit to things we did not do and pay millions to avoid a criminal trial. FedEx delivered packages for licensed pharmacies registered by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Very few companies have done more during the last 4 decades to cooperate with law enforcement than FedEx, as was true in these matters, and we will continue to do so.
We're especially proud of the hundreds of thousands of FedEx team members worldwide, who demonstrate every day their commitment to provide our important services safely, reliably and at all times, ethically.
Now let me turn it over to Mike Glenn, who will comment on the economy and our revenue; followed by Alan Graf, who will discuss FedEx's financial performance. Mike?"

I'll open with our economic update and outlook, and then we'll discuss business performance in each of the segments.

I'll open with our economic update and outlook, and then we'll discuss business performance in each of the segments. And then I'll have some commentary on broader business trends.
On the economic front, we continue to see moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP forecast is 1.8% for calendar '16, which is 40 basis points lower than our forecast last quarter. And we forecast 2.4% for calendar '17, led by gains in consumer spending. We expect industrial production to decline 0.6% in calendar '16, 120 basis points lower than last quarter, and increase 2.3% next year. Our global GDP forecast is 2.3% for calendar '16, 20 basis points below last quarter, and calls for 2.8% growth for calendar 2017.
Now I'll review revenue, volume and yield trends by segment. In the Express segment, U.S. domestic average daily package volume was essentially flat in the quarter due to the decline in the deferred product category. Yield per package increased approximately 1% year-over-year despite lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic package yield grew 2.3%, primarily due to rate and discounts. Revenue grew 2.1% year-over-year, driven by one more operating day and yield growth. Excluding the impact of the fuel surcharge, domestic revenue grew 3.7% year-over-year.
FedEx International Economy average daily volume grew 3.5%, while FedEx International Priority average daily volume declined 2.1%. International export revenue per package decreased 2.6% as lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable currency exchange rates negatively impacted the yields. Excluding fuel, international export express package yield was slightly positive, primarily driven by the positive impact of rate and discount changes, which outweighed the negative impact of exchange rates.
In the Ground segment, FedEx Ground revenue increased 20% in the quarter, driven by higher ground volume and yield and the recording of SmartPost revenues on a gross basis versus the previous net treatment. FedEx Ground average daily volume grew 10% year-over-year in Q4, primarily driven by continued growth after peak season for both residential and commercial deliveries. FedEx Ground revenue per package increased 7% year-over-year in Q4 due to the recording of FedEx SmartPost revenues on a gross basis and higher base rates, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, ground yield per package, including SmartPost, increased 8.6% year-over-year, driven primarily by extra service charges and weight per package, offsetting a decrease due to SmartPost volume mix.
FedEx Freight revenue increased 2.3% as average daily shipments increased 7.5% year-over-year and revenue per shipment declined 5.3% year-over-year.
As a reminder, Q4 in FY '16 contained one more business day than Q4 in FY '15. The continued strength in shipment volume is driven by our sales efforts with small and medium customers and reflects the speed, reliability and choice of priority and economy service for our LTL customers, and we also saw increased demand from our larger customers during the quarter. Revenue per LTL shipment declined due to lower fuel surcharge revenue and lower weight per package. Including the impact of fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per shipment was down 2.1% year-over-year due to lower weight per shipment.
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to further discuss and address the growth of e-commerce, which continues to outpace GDP growth, both in the U.S. and globally. E-commerce has become a way of life for consumers acquiring goods around the world, but the success of e-commerce continues to be dependent on transportation companies' ability to reliably and quickly make residential deliveries around the world. As we noted during our last conference call on earnings, more than 95% of e-commerce packages in the U.S. are delivered by FedEx, UPS and the United States Postal Service, with whom we have a strategic relationship to transport their priority mail. E-commerce would be impossible without these companies and our expansive networks. If you were to isolate the FedEx e-commerce business, it would become clear FedEx is one of the most profitable e-commerce companies in business today.
During the past quarter, we've made significant investments in expanding our global transportation portfolio and e-commerce capabilities around the world, including the acquisition of TNT, the introduction of FedEx Cross -- and the introduction of FedEx CrossBorder. The TNT acquisition will transform the global transportation and logistics industry. It is the largest acquisition in FedEx history and instantly accelerates our European and global growth strategy. FedEx now has a strong presence in Europe, with a range of transportation options from express to economy for both parcel and freight. This significant enhancement to our portfolio in Europe helps not only our customers in Europe, but also provides benefits for customers around the world shipping into Europe.
In addition, we will substantially enhance our capabilities globally by leveraging TNT's lower-cost road networks in different regions around the world. While the integration will take time to fully execute, we have the benefit of similar and complementary corporate cultures and a common mission of providing superior service and value to customers around the world.
FedEx CrossBorder offers e-commerce technology solutions that enables e-tailers to navigate common cross-border selling challenges such as regulatory compliance, secure payment processing, multiple currency pricing or credit card fraud protection and also offers access to e-commerce shoppers around the world. CrossBorder is the relaunch of Bongo International, a company FedEx acquired in 2014. When combined with our recent GENCO acquisition, we have significantly strengthened our e-commerce portfolio of services.
Of course, demand for e-commerce increases significantly each year during the peak holiday season, and we're deep into preparations for the upcoming 2016 peak season. We're closely collaborating with large e-tail and retail customers to understand their peak shipping needs, including geographic mix and package characteristics, so that we can once again have our resources positioned and ready to provide outstanding service.
We'll also be leveraging some new and evolving services to meet the heavy demand during peak, including FedEx Delivery Manager, FedEx SameDay and an expansion in FedEx Hold at Location services. Delivery Manager allows U.S. package recipients to customize home deliveries to fit their schedules, including changing the time and location of delivery, requesting a signature upon delivery or leaving instructions for the courier. FedEx SameDay City is available in 24 markets across the country, offering customers same-day service with uniformed FedEx drivers, branded vehicles, realtime tracking and world-renowned FedEx reliability. FedEx Hold at Location offers secure package pickup at more than 2,400 FedEx locations, including more than 1,800 FedEx Office retail stores. These hold services allow customers to redirect packages for pickup and drop-off at FedEx and many other third-party locations.
One additional point is we continue to get questions concerning Amazon and the evolution of their transportation capabilities and needs. Amazon continues to be a valuable customer, and they're among the large e-tailers that we stay in close dialogue with throughout the year to understand their transportation needs as they continue to experience significant growth and generate demand for FedEx transportation. Because of our close relationship with Amazon and close collaboration, we have a very clear and specific understanding of their needs across the FedEx portfolio during FY '17. And further, we expect them to be a significant customer for many years to come. Having said that, it is important to remember that no single FedEx customer represents more than approximately 3% of total revenue.
Finally, I'd like to mention the introduction of the new FedEx Freight box, which makes transporting less-than-truckload shipments simple with improved flexibility, increased security, better shipment integrity and best of all, no freight classification. The FedEx Freight box comes in 2 sizes, a standard freight box that requires a pallet to ship and a smaller freight box with an integrated pallet. The freedom to choose your freight box makes freight shipping accessible for any business, no matter the size. With a distance-based pricing structure, the FedEx Freight box allows you to ship LTL, avoiding the complex and antiquated pricing structure used in the industry. The Freight box was introduced in selected markets with great success during the second half of FY '16 and is rolling out to customers nationwide this month.
And now I'll turn it over to Alan Graf."

We had a great quarter. Adjusted earnings of $3.30 per diluted share increased 24% year-over-year, and our adjusted consolidated operating margin increased 11.7% versus 10.5%",1324,"Thanks, Mike, for your very informative comments, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter. Adjusted earnings of $3.30 per diluted share increased 24% year-over-year, and our adjusted consolidated operating margin increased 11.7% versus 10.5% last year.
Among the operating companies, Express was the most valuable player of the quarter, posting an impressive double, double. Operating income was 27% higher versus last year's adjusted income, and operating margin climbed to 11.3%. Operating income grew at Ground as average daily volume increased 10%, and Freight's operating income was unchanged.
And profit growth at Express, despite essentially flat revenue for Q4 year-over-year, is a strong testament to Express' continued yield and cost management efforts. Yield did have a positive impact year-over-year on the quarter, while currency exchange rate changes have little net impact. One additional operating day also provided a benefit.
We expect Express operating income at FY '17 to continue to improve as we manage network capacity to match customer demand, reduce structural costs, modernize our fleet and drive productivity increases throughout our U.S. and international operations. These benefits will be partially offset due to timing of aircraft maintenance events and one fewer operating day.
The capper on our remarkable year was the acquisition of TNT Express. We had a seamless and very successful first day when we acquired TNT on May 25, a few days before our fiscal year-end. Today is our 28th day of owning TNT. We have a solid integration plan that we are in process of validating with live data. Our senior leadership team is in place, and we are partnering together in the marketplace for commercial opportunities to bring the best solutions for our customers.
The transaction, financing and integration plan expenses related to this acquisition were $132 million or $0.45 per diluted share in FY '16, which considers certain nontax deductible costs as a result of the closing of the acquisition. These expenses include TNT's operating results from the time of acquisition and are predominantly included in corporate eliminations and others in FY '16.
In FY '17, we will report the operating results for FedEx Express and TNT separately in 2 different segments. We will also provide an overview of the FedEx Express group, which combines the 2 segments.
Given the timing and complexity of the acquisition, presentation of TNT on our financial statements, including the allocation of the purchase price, is preliminary and will likely change in future periods. We plan to complete our purchase price allocation no later than the fourth quarter of FY '17.
TNT operates road transportation networks and delivers documents, parcels and freight to over 200 countries. This strategic acquisition broadens our portfolio of international transportation solutions with the combined strength of TNT's strong European road platform and our strength in other regions globally, including North America and Asia.
Prior to our acquisition, TNT announced its outlook strategy aimed at doubling its adjusted operating income and margin percentage by 2018. That profit improvement program includes various initiatives focused on yield management, operational efficiency and productivity and customer service. We plan to continue these profit improvement initiatives in FY '17, and we'll also begin activities to integrate operations. Our focus will be on combining TNT's strong European capabilities with our strength in other regions globally.
Although we are in the very beginning of the integration process and are continuing to validate our information, we currently expect our FY '17 integration CapEx for TNT to be about $100 million and integration costs to be around $200 million. However, the timing and amount of these costs is subject to change as our plans are refined. Integration expenses, including professional fees, information technology costs and intangible asset amortization related to TNT, are expected to impact operating income and margin during FY '17.
We are very excited about the TNT acquisition, and we'll provide you updates on the operating results and integration costs on a quarterly basis going forward. We do expect TNT to be accretive to earnings in FY '18.
Turning to our Ground segment. Operating income grew year-over-year due to higher volumes and increased revenue per package as well as the benefit of one additional operating day. These factors were partially offset by higher operating costs, including network expansion expenses. Operating margin was lower due to the change in SmartPost revenue reporting.
We expect Ground revenues and operating income to increase in FY '17, driven by e-commerce volume growth and market share gains. We also anticipate continued yield growth through the yield management programs, including changes to our pricing for larger shipments. However, we anticipate Ground operating margin will be negatively impacted by higher operating costs in FY '17, driven again by network expansion. Other operational costs may also impact margins as residential volumes grow from e-commerce.
Capital expenditures at Ground are expected to be about $2 billion in FY '17 as we continue to make investments to grow our highly profitable network through facility expansions and equipment purchases. The impact of the depreciation of these investments will continue to partly offset earnings growth in FY '17 at Ground.
At Freight, operating income was unchanged as improved operating efficiencies, higher revenue and an additional operating day were offset by increased salaries and employee benefits expense and the impact from lower weight per shipment. During FY '17, we expect revenue, operating income and operating margin improvement at Freight, driven by continued effective yield management as well as modest volume growth from small and midsize customers. Freight earnings growth will also be positively impacted by improvement in productivity and further investments in technology.
We incurred a noncash pretax mark-to-market pension accounting loss of $1.5 billion in 2016. Due to its effect on income before income taxes, the adjustment for mark-to-market accounting reduced our 2016 effective tax rate by 120 basis points. Our effective tax rate was 33.6% in fiscal '16, which was also favorably impacted by an internal corporate restructuring done to facilitate the integration of FedEx Express and TNT and was offset by nondeductible costs incurred as part of the acquisition. For FY '17, we're anticipating making contributions totaling $1.1 billion to our U.S. pension plans.
In FY '16, we continued to buy back shares, repurchasing $2.7 billion of our common stock through open market purchases. From FY '14 through FY '16, we repurchased 63 million shares of FedEx common stock and returned more than $8.8 billion to shareholders at an average price of $140 per share. As of May 31, 2016, we had approximately 19 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase. A few weeks ago, we announced that we were boosting our dividend by 60% for a total of $0.40 per share per quarter.
Turning to our outlook. Based on the outlook that Mike described from an economic standpoint and the momentum we have, we project adjusted earnings to be $11.75 to $12.25 per diluted share for FY '17, excluding TNT financial results, including integration and financing costs and year-end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments.
Our expectations for earnings growth in FY '17 are dependent on key external factors, including fuel prices and global economic conditions. Due to our recent acquisition of TNT, FY '17 will be a year of intense integration activities for our dedicated team at Express. We are committed to the successful integration of these 2 great businesses. Meanwhile, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight will continue to be focused on achieving their goals, independent of the integration at Express.
Our capital expenditures are expected to be about $5.1 billion in FY '17, excluding TNT. We anticipate that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our increased capital expenditures in FY '17, which will include spending for network expansion at Ground, as I discussed, and the continued aircraft fleet modernization at Express. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we are well positioned to continue to increase corporate earnings, cash flows, returns and margins.
With that, we will open up for strategic questions."

There may have been 1 or 2 others that have come in on the Internet. And Mickey will be looking at the calls coming in, and we'll try to answer as many of these as we can. There are a lot of questions in the 43 that were submitted that we won't address for one reason or another, and let me deal with those. 
One, there were a number about Brexit. The reality is we don't have any better crystal ball than anybody else, so we don't think it's appropriate for us to be speculating on what may happen in the United Kingdom. And should Brexit take place, obviously, we'll be telling folks what we intend to do to adjust to the new situation. But it's certainly premature.
Second, lots of questions on TNT. We'll take a number of them, but quite a few are focused on areas where it's just too early in the process for us to deal with. For instance, what are the implications of the South American road network of TNT and the Southeast Asian road network of TNT? And our regional presidents and the Express management are working through that with the integration team, so we're going to defer those until we get a little bit further along.
Third, there are a fair number that are hypotheticals about what new services we might offer, or adjacencies. And of course, that's not in our best interest to answer from a competitive standpoint. So now let me get to some of them that do hit the nail on the head.
With the acquisition of TNT, can you discuss major IT requirements going forward? Specifically, are the current systems robust enough for the combined entity? And are there any needs at the product service level? So I'm going to ask our great CIO, Rob Carter, to opine on this."

We've prepared diligently over the years with integrations of acquisitions in Mexico, Brazil, the U.K., Africa, India and others around the world to become really quite good at the process of integrating customers, integrating products into the mix. We also have been working very hard on our systems here at FedEx to modernize and simplify them in ways that really position them to be very effective at integration activities. 
So that's a key design point for the systems that we've been building and pushing forward. And then lastly, we've had a planning and execution team on the ground with the teams. We've done very robust planning with regard to these integrations, including what it would take on day 1, which was executed flawlessly; what our needs are at day 100; and then as we go forward, the preferred future state of the organization and the systems that will be needed to operate with the combined entity. So we're very confident in the systems that we have, the team that we have and the efforts that are underway to support our customers."

I already knew that their culture lined up with our culture. I was over there on day 1 for the integration 28 days ago. And I can tell you that they're excited and we're excited. So going forward, you're going to have the integration take place that needs to take place so that we make sure we do it right, and when we come out of the integration process, we have the most powerful service, cultural for people and profitable business that you can have over there in Europe.

But I will say one thing here, that it's obvious to me, looking at some of the questions and some of the reports that have been published. There's this sort of underlying theme that TNT is its own business and it's had these low margins and so that's going to go forward. The whole rationale of buying TNT, in fact, it's right in the middle of this whole e-commerce debate. In this business, the #1 item after the linehaul and upstream systems is delivery density, cost per stop, the number of stops per hour and so forth. So the 2 plus 2 equals 7 equation, so to speak, of us buying TNT is extraordinary. 
And that's why Alan says to you with such authority, as we integrate these PUD networks and take advantage of the unmatched surface networks with TNT, there's going to be a tremendous opportunity to increase the margins and earnings in the Express segment. So we know we're going to have about $200 million in integration expense. We can't tell you exactly when it is, but offsetting that are going to be the TNT revenues and the profitability of their existing business on a go-forward basis. So I hope that clarified it a bit.
Let me take another -- a couple or 3 of these Internet questions submitted in advance. David Vernon of Bernstein. How important are store replenishment activities in the FedEx portfolio of services as e-commerce takes share from traditional retail? Is there a risk that demand for any set of services falls off in a consequential manner? Mike and Henry, you want to comment on that?"

I would just say and remind everyone that today, e-commerce is about 10% of total retail. And while growing faster than traditional retail, traditional retail is still growing. So we don't expect any major impact in terms of our volumes going to retail. As a matter of fact, we think there may be opportunities going forward as omni-channel plays begin to be more prevalent and e-commerce strategy involves pickup at the store level. So we think there's an opportunity there and quite comfortable with our position."

We know from research that the millennial generation, the largest generational cohort in American history, is not going to stop going to stores. In fact, we had a wonderful presentation about it just a couple of weeks ago at our board meeting. So e-commerce is fantastic, and it's going to continue to grow. And we intend to be a major player in that space.
But as Mike just said, it's not going to, in our opinion and in the research from very credible sources, going to eliminate retail. What it may do is change the character of retail. And one of the things that you see happening are very focused, integrated product and store networks. Two that come to mind that are just fantastically successful are Zara, which is a company that's located in Spain and well known for its fast cycle, small shipment replenishment of its stores. They're able to turn on a dime with what's selling and move it around the world. And in Japan, a great company called UNIQLO that does the same sort of thing. 
So as these types of retail operations continue to proliferate, there'll be a fair amount of B2B business. And as Mike said, remember, of all retail, e-commerce is now about 10%, growing fast, taking share. But it's going to be a long time before retail is threatened. And B2B, meaning the underpinnings of the business world, medical, production, automotive and things like that, that in the main is not going to be diverted to e-commerce anytime soon. And that is the backbone of the FedEx networks.
Let me take one more here while we're queuing up another call. Demand for final-mile service by the USPS is outgrowing demand for traditional package services, driven in part by the popularity of SmartPost. Does FedEx see any risk or opportunities associated with the UPS -- USPS's ability to invest and keep pace with that demand? Mike, Henry, you want to take that one?"

And we won't speculate on how they deal with that, but we see e-commerce as a tremendous opportunity. At some point, it may make more sense for us to deliver a lot of the SmartPost packages in our network. As Henry has talked about, we certainly have the technological capability to do that. And when we do that, our cost goes down. So we think we're pretty well prepared."

And we intend to work on improving those over the next 24 months. So I think I've been in the financial markets, from a debt standpoint, a lot in the last couple of years. And we'll probably take a little break on that because as I said, we think -- well, we know we have the cash flow coverage for what we're trying to do. 
So going forward, we've always said we're a capital-intensive, growing transportation company. We think the sweet spot for CapEx is 6% to 8% of revenue. Next couple of years, we're going to be above that basically because we're re-fleeting, we're expanding Ground as rapidly as we can, as efficiently as we can, and we've got the TNT integration to put together. But having said that, it's very manageable what's in front of us. As I said, we are going to continue to increase earnings, cash flows, returns and margins. And we have been improving our ROICs, and we've been definitely improving our return on equity. But at the end of the day, that's not the most important metric. The most important metric is shareholder return.
So over the last 5 years, we have had a share price return of 88%, which is a CAGR of a little bit over 14.1%. That compares to 53% for UPS, 63% for S&P 500 and 47.5% for the Dow Jones Transports. That's the number that's the most important for our shareholders, and the same goes for total return. And when I go back longer term, the last 15 years, our total return to shareholders had been 377.6%. UPS has been 170%. So while ROC and ROE -- ROIC and ROE are nice metrics, they don't win the ballgame."

And on an average daily volume basis, our volume has doubled over the last 10 years. So you have to expand CapEx to build the capacity you need just to run the business day to day here.
On the SmartPost side, we're well along. We haven't integrated all the facilities yet, and that's largely due to the fact that the growth in that service has been such that we've been a little bit constrained by Ground capacity and being able to move more volume into the network. But the 2 big IT events, the first occurred in January, which allows us to begin manually matching addresses on packages and moving them into the Ground network for final delivery. And then the next big event will come next summer, where virtually we can have the system match addresses and move them.
And as I've explained in the past, you move a SmartPost package into the Ground network, you can deliver that incremental package for roughly 25% of the postage as opposed to tendering it to the USPS. So we're pretty excited about that. We're looking forward to getting this thing behind us."

I would say we would have a hard time putting up a list of the things that don't concern us given the 2 candidates' position.

We have thousands and tens of thousands of highly compensated people working for FedEx in the United States that are involved in trade: pilots, mechanics, customs clearance people, pickup and delivery personnel. That's the story that never gets told when the tragedy of a local plant closing gets put on the TV.

It is. And I think it's important because there have been several things that have been printed about this, which indicate a lack of clarity out there about this. When Dave and his team did the deal with Boeing on the 767s, it called for 10 firm airplanes per year over a number of years to a total of 50. And then there were options with given dates. And these 6 aircraft were the first options that became due, and they are for delivery in fiscal year '19 and '20. The next options are not due until June of calendar year 2018, when Express will decide whether it wants to exercise a tranche of 6. And then the next one after that is June '19 with a tranche of 6. Basic deal is we have 10 firm airplanes per year and the ability to go up to 16 airplanes. Now it's a little more complicated than that in the outyears. But Dave, you want to add anything on this?"

Having said that, that business continues to be robust and a growing business and an important part of e-commerce growth going forward. There are plenty of stories of companies out there that are being successful in nontraditional e-commerce retail segments, which would be packages that are typically larger like mattresses and other things like that. And so we're happy to handle that, but we expect to be compensated for the service that we provide."

Long question, but to net it down, do you think it's feasible for someone to build an efficient national parcel network that combines in-house air and truck linehaul between regions, but outsources the costly last-mile delivery to either the U.S. Postal Service or the low-cost regional local couriers? Is that a competitive threat that concerns you?
The answer to that is no. And the reason for that is that the upstream infrastructure to do that is enormous. I wish I could have a film or something to show you these facilities. Henry has got -- how many hubs with the new opening this year, Henry? 30?"

I mean, the size of these things are 250 to 300 acres. They handle tens of thousands of packages. The miles driven by FedEx Ground per year is 1.2 billion miles, and Freight's in the same capacity level. So these upstream moats are very substantial. And actually, the last mile is the easiest thing to do if you don't have any upstream infrastructure. Problem there is that you cut yourself off from the tens of millions or billions of potential other shippers from every other part of the world that can be co-mingled to lower stop cost by having more stops per hour or more deliveries per stop.
And that's the thing that we've been consistently saying. I used the word fantastic, although if you'll recall, because all of these analyses are either unmindful of that or they make assumptions that are erroneous when you actually understand what the real world numbers are. Let me just give you one statistic. I don't mean to impeach any one entity, but there have been several analyst reports that have come out and said, ""Well, 767 airplanes can carry 120,000 pounds."" And so the calculations are done on that. The maximum cubic revenue payload of a 767, and we're pretty damn good at this, is far less than 120,000 pounds.
And if you load it up with just pallets, you're probably talking about 2/3 of that, if that. The airport locations to process these things and the containers, they're more difficult than the airplanes by far. So I use this opportunity -- thanks for the question, Bascome -- but again, to point out some of the analysis that's being done that's not in accordance with the facts on the ground, literally and figuratively."
