Our business is good, and we hope that yours is, too.

Our business is good, and we hope that yours is, too. Before discussing our results past and projected, I'd like to make sure that you know that yesterday we reported 2015 results, gave 2016 guidance and provided a financial model forecasting 2017. Paul made the decision to provide that forecast for the next 2 years to make clear to investors the impact of 4 factors. First, same-store NOI growth rates; second, the long expected decline in non-core earnings as we continue the simplification of our business, for example, the wind down of our low income housing tax credit activities and the reduction in the number of our partnerships; third, the dilution that comes from selling fully leased properties to acquire the Northern California lease-up property that has no current income; and fourth, the savings in G&A and other off-site costs as we scale our overhead to our more focused business.
So for 2016, the headline is that we continue to think long-term, accepting short-term pain for long-term gain. The short-term pain is a lower growth rate for AFFO this year, up only 4% compared to being up 12% last year. For 2017, the long-term gain is the reacceleration of the AFFO growth rate to 12% together with higher rent growth going forward, a better portfolio with higher average rents, a stronger balance sheet and improved quality of earnings. 
We will return to 2016 and 2017 later, especially in Paul's remarks, but now I'd like to direct your attention to a few highlights from last year. Last year, in property operations across our diversified portfolio, rent growth was higher than in 2014 by 50 basis points. In redevelopment, strong consumer demand for our redevelopment apartment homes drove the lease-up of Ocean House in La Jolla, absorption at above seasonal expectations at Park Towne and The Sterling in Philadelphia, second-generation rent increases averaging 13% for our occupancy stabilized redevelopments at Lincoln Place, Pacific Bay Vistas and Preserve at Marin. 
In portfolio management, fourth quarter average revenue per apartment home was up 10% year-over-year, reaching $1,840, a record high for Aimco. 
And on the balance sheet, at year end we had $675 million of cash on hand and credit available on our bank lines. And at year-end leverage, as [indiscernible] ratio of leverage to EBITDA was down year-over-year by 11%. 
So the bottom line, 2015 AFFO per share was up year-over-year by 12%, cash dividends per share were up year-over-year by 13% and consensus net asset value per share was up year-over-year by 11%. For these excellent results, I thank my teammates and say, well done.
Now let's look forward. When we look property by property at the Aimco business, we see on balance continuation of the solid consumer demand of the past few years. In fact, through January of this year, the rate of year-over-year rent growth has been higher for each of the past 12 consecutive months. That is January 2016 rent increased at a faster rate than the January 2015. December 2015 rent increased at a faster rate than the December 2014 and so on. So for the past 12 consecutive months, our rent growth has accelerated.
Now when you look outside our business, we are mindful of the potential for overbuilding in some markets, and we cannot help but notice the turbulence in financial markets and uncertainties about economic growth. These conflicting data points make us conservative. You can see that we project 2016 rent growth, which is the closest to hand and most visible to us, at roughly equal to, and in fact a little bit better than, the rent growth we've enjoyed for the past few years. 
You'll also see that in our 2017 forecast, we decided to assume lower rent growth. We are not making a call on the market. As mentioned earlier, in our portfolio, rents have accelerated for 12 consecutive months. And we have no visibility on a deceleration. We assumed lower rent growth for 2 reasons. First, we want you to know that our 2017 forecast is quite achievable even if there were to be a slowdown. And second, whether or not there is a slowdown in 2017, we all hope that market returns someday, and we want you to know what we are thinking and doing now to be prepared.
First, continue to emphasize our commitment to customer selection and customer satisfaction, and we are increasing our investment in our site teams. Second, we are increasing capital spending to put our properties in top condition. Third, we are glad of our limited exposure to development and redevelopment, and we are monitoring closely our exposure to lease-up of redevelopment and Acquisition Properties. Fourth, we appreciate our portfolio diversification across markets and price points, and we're cautious about possible acquisitions. And fifth, we're guarding financial liquidity and are building balance sheet capacity to reduce dependence on financial markets and to support opportunistic investment if such can be found.
Now I'd like to turn the call to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations, who will review our fourth quarter results and a first look at the new year. Keith?"

I'm pleased to report that we had a solid 2015 in operations, with full year revenues up 4.5%, expenses up 2.1% and net operating income up 5.6%. Annually, we achieved blended lease rate increases of 4.9% while maintaining an average daily occupancy of 95 9 with turnover at 48.6%. 
In Q4 of 2015, our residents gave us our ninth consecutive quarter of better than a 4-star rating in customer satisfaction. As a result, renewal rents increased 5.6% for the quarter, some 70 basis points higher than fourth quarter 2014. We saw particular strength in the Bay Area, Denver and Boston. Renewal rents in these markets increased 7% to 9% compared to the expiring leases. Where those leases expired and were not renewed, our new lease pricing outperformed the results from the fourth quarter of 2014 and for each month of the quarter individually. This resulted in a quarterly increase in new lease rates of 2.1%, 120 basis points better than prior year. New lease rates were particularly strong in the Bay Area, Atlanta, San Diego and New York City with increases between 6% and 12%. As a result of our team's hard work across the country, we achieved blended lease rate increases of 3.6% for the quarter, 70 basis points better than Q4 2014. 
Turnover for the quarter was 50.7%. And of the customers who decided to move out, 23% were for career moves, 20% did not renew due to price and 15% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these moveout reasons versus recent quarters or our long-term averages. 
Our resident quality continues to improve. The average incomes of those new customers who moved in during the fourth quarter was $128,000, with a median income of $90,000. Year-over-year, the median income of our new residents was up 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 due to an increase in household incomes and portfolio quality. 
Our 12-target markets, which represent 90% of same-store net operating income, had top line revenue growth up 4.6% in Q4. The top performers had revenue increases for more than 7% to nearly 11% for the quarter. This was led by Seattle followed by the Bay Area, New York, Denver and Boston. Our steady performers which had revenue growth of more than 5% to 7% were San Diego, Atlanta and Greater Los Angeles. And finally, with revenue growth of roughly 1% to nearly 3, we round out our target markets with Chicago, Washington, D.C,. Miami and Philadelphia.
As we look ahead to early first quarter 2016 results, January blended lease rates were up 4.2%, double our start to last year. New leases were up 2.9%, some 270 basis points better than prior year. And renewals were up 5.8%, 160 basis points better than January of 2015. 
January's average daily occupancy was on plan at 95 8, 30 basis points better than prior year, and February and March renewal offers went out with 5% to 7% increases. 
Our expectations for 2016 revenue growth in our 12 target markets can be broken into 3 tiers. At the top of the list, with forecasted growth between 6% and 9%, we have the Bay Area, Denver, Seattle and Atlanta. The midrange markets with forecasted growth of more than 4% to better than 5% are Boston, New York City, San Diego and Greater Los Angeles. And rounding out our 12-target markets with growth of nearly 3% to 4%, we have Miami, Chicago, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. 
And with great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco's success, I'll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?"

During 2015, we sold 11 properties, with about 3,900 apartment homes with gross proceeds to Aimco of $386 million. These sales represented roughly 4% of our beginning at year real estate assets. 
We sold 8 Conventional properties with average revenues per apartment home of $1,043 per month, 43% below the average of our retained [ph] portfolio. And among the properties we sold were the last 3 held in Phoenix. 
We also continued to sold out of our Affordable portfolio with the sale of 3 properties. On average, the property sold in 2015 had a free cash flow cap rate of 4.9%. Had we held these properties for the next 10 years, we would have expected them to generate a free cash flow internal rate of return of about 6%. 
Proceeds from these sales were reinvested in redevelopment and development projects, acquisitions and property upgrades at a weighted average free cash flow internal rate of return about 350 basis points higher than the property sold to fund them. In particular, we invested $118 million in redevelopment projects during the year, enhancing 7 communities with a total of more than 2,500 apartments. During 2015, we completed our multi-year redevelopment at Lincoln Place, Venice, California; and Preserve at Marin in Marin County, California. We also completed work at 2900 on First in Seattle and Ocean House on Prospect located in La Jolla, California. We continue the redevelopment of 2 Center City, Philadelphia properties, which many of you saw during our Investor Day back in October, Park Towne Place and The Sterling. At Park Towne Place, 2015 saw the near completion of the redevelopment of 1 of the 4 towers that comprise the community as well as the community center. At the end of January, we had leased 84% of the completed apartment homes in this tower with rents above underwriting, and we anticipate completing the remaining apartment homes in that first tower by the end of this month. 
Based on these successful results, Aimco approved a plan during 2015 to redevelop a second tower Park Towne Place with 245 apartment homes. We began deleasing this tower during the fourth quarter and construction is underway. 
At The Sterling, we continue to enjoy good product acceptance. At the end of January, we had leased 97% of the completed apartment homes, with rents above underwriting. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we approved the plan to continue the redevelopment of The Sterling with another 5 floors containing 130 apartment homes. 
And during 2015, we also invested a total of $160 million in development. About $100 million of this was in our One Canal property in Boston, which will be completed in April and which we are pre-leasing now. 
We also invested $16 million in the completion of Vivo, a property we acquired in Cambridge [indiscernible] under construction. We saw our first move in at Vivo in October and the property is 44% leased today at rents above underwriting. 
In addition to Vivo, during 2015, we purchased 2 other properties, an operating property in Atlanta; and Axiom, a lease-up property in Cambridge. Our total purchase price for these 3 properties was $129 million. 
Our leasing at Axiom has gone very well with the property currently 89% leased at rents above underwriting, and we expect to reach an occupancy stabilization on this property during the second quarter. 
And finally, as we discussed on our last call, during 2015 we entered into a contract to acquire an under construction apartment community in Northern California for $320 million. We have commenced pre leasing at this community and anticipate closing the acquisition upon the completion of construction this summer. A portion of the acquisition price will be funded through a property loan and the balance with proceeds from the sale of 2 properties, one in Phoenix and one in Alexandria, Virginia. 
And in the fourth quarter, as noted earlier, we closed on the sale of the Phoenix property, and we anticipate closing in the sale of the Alexandria property in the second quarter of this year.

Today, I'd like to spend a few moments on our 2015 results, after which I'll provide some details around our 2016 outlook and 2017 forecast that we published yesterday with our earnings release. 
First, 2015. 2015 AFFO of $1.88 per share was 12% higher than 2014 and $0.03 per share ahead of our beginning of the year guidance. 2015 same-store revenue growth of 4.5% is 40 basis points ahead of our beginning of year guidance, while expense growth of 2.1% was 70 basis points lower than guided. Combined, these results produced year-over-year net operating income growth of 5.6%, which is 90 basis points above our beginning-of-the-year guidance. 
As to the balance sheet. At 6.8x, year-end leverage was down 11% year-over-year. This reduction was accomplished in part by using proceeds from our January equity offering to reduce debt balances. Specifically, we raised $367 million by selling stock at $38.90 per share and used the proceeds to reduce property debt and to repay our outstanding line balance. Today, our unencumbered pool contains properties with a combined value of approximately $1.8 billion, nearly double that of year-end 2014.
Last week, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend from [indiscernible] per share. On an annualized basis, this represents an increase of 12% compared to dividends paid during 2015. 
In short, 2015 was a good year for Aimco with double-digit AFFO growth, solid same-store results, lower leverage and increased dividends. Looking ahead, we feel good about our prospects. Our 2016 outlook and 2017 forecast provides more visibility into the 4 key factors Terry mentioned that are expected to impact Aimco's projected earnings. They are same-store growth, property sales and reinvestment activities, non-core earnings and offsite cost. I'd like to take a minute to walk through each of these. 
First, same-store NOI growth. In 2016, we anticipate same-store revenue growth between 4.5% and 5%, an acceleration of 25 basis points at the midpoint over 2015. We anticipate expenses to increase 2.5% to 3%, up from 2.1% in 2015. This rate of expense growth is attributable to an increased investment in our on-site teams in 2016, which we expect will result in improved productivity and lower cost in the future. These increases in both revenues and expenses drive our expectations of 2016 NOI growth between 5.25% and 6.25%. 
We also provided a financial model of 2017. In that model, we assume revenue deceleration of 50 basis points from 2016 based on a 60 basis point deceleration in new leases and a 90 basis point deceleration in renewal leases. We have no evidence to the fact there is such a deceleration across our portfolio, far from it. As Terry said, we picked a conservative number to show that our 2017 forecast is achievable even if markets weaken and to show that we're looking ahead to the inevitability of slower growth. 
At the top line, we show revenue growth in 2017 of 3.75% to 4.75%. This growth rate is based on the earning at [ph] 2016 recent activity, renewal rates of 4.5% and new lease rates of 3.9% as estimated by third-party data providers. We assume operating expenses increase 2.5% to 3%, which is based on market level inflation adjustments, which are also projected by third parties. These assumptions yield 2017 NOI growth of 4% to 5.5%.
So if these assumptions prove true, we will see continued strength in same-store NOI growth albeit at a slower pace than in 2017 -- than in '16. 
The second key factor impacting Aimco's AFFO is the effect of a sale of stabilized properties to invest in nonstabilized properties, the most impactful of which are One Canal, our development property in Boston; Vivo, a property acquired under construction in June of last year; and our Bay Area acquisition expected to close this summer. 
For 2016, we expect the NOI contribution from these 3 properties to be less than $0.01 per share. This nominal contribution is more than offset by the $0.05 to $0.07 of dilution from properties sold to fund these investments. For 2017, we expect Vivo to achieve NOI stabilization by the end of the year. And for One Canal and our Bay Area acquisition to reach stabilized occupancy of 95% by third quarter. Together, we project these lease-up communities will contribute $0.12 per share to 2017 NOI. As One Canal and our Bay Area acquisition achieve NOI stabilization in 2018, we would expect an even greater contribution to 2018's results. 
In short, we are accepting short-term pain in the form of 2016 AFFO dilution with a long-term gain provided by higher quality communities with growth prospects superior than the property sold to fund their development or acquisition. 
The third factor affecting Aimco's AFFO growth is the long expected financial impact of the simplification of Aimco's business model. In 2016, the contribution to bottom line from non-core earnings is expected to decline by $0.08 to $0.12 per share compared to 2015 as a result of our gradual exit from the Affordable and Asset Management lines of business and the reduced income tax benefits related to historic tax credits and our taxable REIT subsidiaries. In 2017, we project a further decline in non-core earnings of an additional $0.09 to $0.10. 
The fourth factor affecting Aimco's AFFO growth is the positive impact of reduced offsite costs that come with our simpler business model. As the complexity and scale of our business change and we gain efficiency, we expect these costs, which include property management, Investment Management and G&A to decline by $0.02 in 2016 and an additional $0.01 to $0.03 in 2017. 
While we expect some variability in other components of AFFO, these 4 items are the primary drivers of our expectations for the change in 2016 and 2017. In 2016, we expect AFFO will be in the range of $1.91 to $2.01 per share, a growth rate of 4% compared to 2015 notwithstanding the $0.05 to $0.07 per share dilution related to properties sold to fund the purchase of lease-up properties. 
2017, based on a stated assumptions we calculate AFFO will increase 12% at the midpoint to $2.12 to $2.26 per share. Assuming these rates of earnings growth, we see year-end 2017 leverage of approximately 6.3x, a reduction of 7% compared to year-end 2015. 
So to summarize, we see over the next 2 years better operating results and improved portfolio, a simpler business with lower non-core earnings, safer leverage, reduced off-site costs and increased AFFO per share, all of this accomplished without the need to access equity capital markets.

The answer to that is very specific in details and not especially market-driven but more site-specific. And so at the top of my head, to think about it and walk down the seaboard with you can be responsive. In Boston, there is considerable supply coming in to the CBD and Cambridge and it's being absorbed at or above our expectations. In New York, we have limited exposure to the new supplier different price point. In Washington -- in Philadelphia, excuse me, we have competitive new supply, but our experience in The Sterling and Park Towne is that would be our product is being accepted at price points above our expectation in underwriting. In Washington, D.C., our revenues are growing, there is continuing new supply but again it's at price points above our portfolio there. In Atlanta, there's competitive new supply but our rents there have been growing. In Miami, we have a certain amount of disappointment, but it's not so much the overall levels of new supply specific location of them at 2 of our major towers have construction literally contiguously or across The Street 24/7 that make it a noisy place to live. And so you'll see that in our Miami results. In Chicago, in the suburban markets, that portfolio certain amount of new construction but not impactful today. In Denver, there's a significant amount of new construction. I think the -- this kind of illustrate the point that it's going to be location specific and not market specific. It would be my opinion that the Denver market will soften and perhaps will be difficult. But it's a market we've avoided. And so our properties that are grouped under Denver are in fact either on what we think of as an island at the end shoots medical campus at the University of Colorado Help Science Center and or in Boulder where there's no growth ordinances that provide some protection against oversupply. So Denver is likely to be soft, but not our asset as much. Moving west, in Seattle, we have a single asset in downtown Seattle and one in Renton. And so we can be affected too much at all. In the Bay Area, which is, of course, a matter of concern to all REIT investors, as I mentioned earlier, specific properties that we own and where we own them actually had a wonderful fourth quarter and a wonderful January. And so we do not now see supply in our markets, which remember we are not in the city of San Francisco, but we do not now see new supply impacting rent growth. Los Angeles, again, new supply continues, but it's more moderate than in other markets and rent growth for our portfolio, which is primarily West L.A  continues. And I would say the same would be true in San Diego. Now that's just top of mine. John, would you agree with that or in a different way?"

336458,321714085,928223,"Apartment Investment and Management Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2016",2016-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Apartment Income REIT Corp.","Executives","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to all of you, and thank you for your interest in Aimco. Our business is good, and we hope that yours is too. Before discussing our results, past and projected, I'd like to make sure that you know that yesterday we report",873,"Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to all of you, and thank you for your interest in Aimco. Our business is good, and we hope that yours is too. Before discussing our results, past and projected, I'd like to make sure that you know that yesterday we reported 2015 results, gave 2016 guidance and provided a financial model forecasting 2017. Paul made the decision to provide the forecast for the next 2 years to make clear to investors the impact of 4 factors: first, same-store NOI growth rates; second, the long expected decline in non-core earnings as we continue the simplification of our business, for example, the wind down of our low income housing tax credit activities and the reduction in the number of our partnerships; third, the dilution that comes from selling fully leased properties to acquire the Northern California lease-up property that has no current income; and fourth, the savings in G&A and other off-site costs as we scale our overhead to our more focused business.
So for 2016, the headline is that we continue to think long term, accepting short-term pain for long-term gain. The short-term pain is a lower growth rate for AFFO this year, up only 4% compared to being up 12% last year. For 2017, the long-term gain is the reacceleration of the AFFO growth rate to 12% together with higher rent growth going forward, a better portfolio with higher average rents, a stronger balance sheet and improved quality of earnings. 
We will return to 2016 and 2017 later, especially in Paul's remarks, but now I'd like to direct your attention to a few highlights from last year. 
Last year, in property operations across our diversified portfolio, rent growth was higher than in 2014 by 50 basis points. In redevelopment, strong consumer demand for our redeveloped apartment homes drove the lease-up of Ocean House in La Jolla, absorption at above seasonal expectations at Park Towne and The Sterling in Philadelphia, second-generation rent increases averaging 13% for our occupancy stabilized redevelopments at Lincoln Place, Pacific Bay Vistas and Preserve at Marin. 
In portfolio management, fourth quarter average revenue per apartment home was up 10% year-over-year, reaching $1,840, a record high for Aimco. 
And on the balance sheet, at year-end we had $675 million of cash on hand and credit available on our bank lines. And at year-end leverage, as [indiscernible] by the ratio of leverage to EBITDA was down year-over-year by 11%. 
So the bottom line, 2015 AFFO per share was up year-over-year by 12%, cash dividends per share were up year-over-year by 13% and consensus net asset value per share was up year-over-year by 11%. For these excellent results, I thank my teammates and say, well done.
Now let's look forward. When we look property by property at the Aimco business, we see on balance continuation of the solid consumer demand of the past few years. In fact, through January of this year, the rate of year-over-year rent growth has been higher for each of the past 12 consecutive months. That is, January 2016 rent increased at a faster rate than the January 2015. December 2015 rent increased at a faster rate than the December 2014 and so on. So for the past 12 consecutive months, our rent growth has accelerated.
Now when we look outside our business, we're mindful of the potential for overbuilding in some markets, and we cannot help but notice the turbulence in financial markets and uncertainties about economic growth. These conflicting data points make us conservative. You can see that we project 2016 rent growth, which is the closest to hand and most visible to us, at roughly equal to, and in fact a little bit better than, the rent growth we've enjoyed for the past few years. 
You'll also see that in our 2017 forecast, we decided to assume lower rent growth. We are not making a call on the market. As mentioned earlier, in our portfolio, rents have accelerated for 12 consecutive months, and we have no visibility on a deceleration. We assumed lower rent growth for 2 reasons: first, we want you to know that our 2017 forecast is quite achievable even if there were to be a slowdown; and second, whether or not there is a slowdown in 2017, we all hope that markets return someday, and we want you to know what we are thinking and doing now to be prepared.
First, continue to emphasize our commitment to customer selection and customer satisfaction, and we are increasing our investment in our site teams. Second, we are increasing capital spending to put our properties in top condition. Third, we are glad of our limited exposure to development and redevelopment, and we are monitoring closely our exposure to lease-up of redevelopment and acquisition properties. Fourth, we appreciate our portfolio diversification across markets and price points, and we're cautious about possible acquisitions. And fifth, we're guarding financial liquidity and are building balance sheet capacity to reduce dependence on financial markets and to support opportunistic investment, if such can be found.
Now I'd like to turn the call to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations, who will review our fourth quarter results and a first look at the New Year. Keith?"

I'm pleased to report that we had a solid 2015 in operations, with full year revenues up 4.5%, expenses up 2.1% and net operating income up 5.6%.

I'm pleased to report that we had a solid 2015 in operations, with full year revenues up 4.5%, expenses up 2.1% and net operating income up 5.6%. Annually, we achieved blended lease rate increases of 4.9% while maintaining an average daily occupancy of 95.9% with turnover at 48.6%. 
In Q4 of 2015, our residents gave us our ninth consecutive quarter of better than a 4-star rating in customer satisfaction. As a result, renewal rents increased 5.6% for the quarter, some 70 basis points higher than fourth quarter 2014. We saw particular strength in the Bay Area, Denver and Boston. Renewal rents in these markets increased 7% to 9% compared to the expiring leases. Where those leases expired and were not renewed, our new lease right pricing outperformed the results from the fourth quarter of 2014 and for each month of the quarter individually. This resulted in a quarterly increase in new lease rates of 2.1%, 120 basis points better than prior year. New lease rates were particularly strong in the Bay Area, Atlanta, San Diego and New York City, with increases between 6% and 12%. As a result of our team's hard work across the country, we achieved blended lease rate increases of 3.6% for the quarter, 70 basis points better than Q4 2014. 
Turnover for the quarter was 50.7%. And of the customers who decided to move out, 23% were for career moves, 20% did not renew due to price and 15% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these move-out reasons versus recent quarters or our long-term averages. 
Our resident quality continues to improve. The average incomes of those new customers who moved in during the fourth quarter was $128,000, with a median income of $90,000. Year-over-year, the median income of our new residents was up 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 due to an increase in household incomes and portfolio quality. 
Our 12 target markets, which represent 90% of same-store net operating income, had top line revenue growth up 4.6% in Q4. The top performers had revenue increases for more than 7% to nearly 11% for the quarter. This was led by Seattle followed by the Bay Area, New York, Denver and Boston. Our steady performers which had revenue growth of more than 5% to 7% were San Diego, Atlanta and Greater Los Angeles. And finally, with revenue growth of roughly 1% to nearly 3%, we round out our target markets with Chicago, Washington, D.C., Miami and Philadelphia.
As we look ahead to early first quarter 2016 results, January blended lease rates were up 4.2%, double our start to last year. New leases were up 2.9%, some 270 basis points better than prior year. And renewals were up 5.8%, 160 basis points better than January of 2015. January's average daily occupancy was on plan at 95.8%, 30 basis points better than prior year, and February and March renewal offers went out with 5% to 7% increases. 
Our expectations for 2016 revenue growth in our 12 target markets can be broken into 3 tiers. At the top of the list, with forecasted growth between 6% and 9%, we have the Bay Area, Denver, Seattle and Atlanta. The midrange markets with forecasted growth of more than 4% to better than 5% are Boston, New York City, San Diego and Greater Los Angeles. And rounding out our 12 target markets with growth of nearly 3% to 4%, we have Miami, Chicago, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. 
And with great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco's success, I'll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?"

During 2015, we sold 11 properties, with about 3,900 apartment homes with gross proceeds to Aimco of $386 million. These sales represented roughly 4% of our beginning-of-the-year real estate assets. 
We sold 8 Conventional properties, with average revenues per apartment home of $1,043 per month, 43% below the average of our retained portfolio. And among the properties we sold were the last 3 held in Phoenix. 
We also continued to sold out of our Affordable portfolio with the sale of 3 properties. On average, the property sold in 2015 had a free cash flow cap rate of 4.9%. Had we held these properties for the next 10 years, we would have expected them to generate a free cash flow internal rate of return of about 6%. 
Proceeds from these sales were reinvested in redevelopment and development projects, acquisitions and property upgrades at a weighted average free cash flow internal rate of return about 350 basis points higher than the property sold to fund them. 
In particular, we invested $118 million in redevelopment projects during the year, enhancing 7 communities with a total of more than 2,500 apartments. During 2015, we completed our multi-year redevelopments at Lincoln Place located in Venice, California; and Preserve at Marin in Marin County, California. We also completed work at 2900 on First in Seattle and Ocean House on Prospect located in La Jolla, California. 
We continued the redevelopment of 2 Center City, Philadelphia properties, which many of you saw during our Investor Day back in October Park Towne Place and The Sterling. At Park Towne Place, 2015 saw the near completion of the redevelopment of 1 of the 4 towers that comprise the community as well as the community center. At the end of January, we had leased 84% of the completed apartment homes in this tower with rents above underwriting, and we anticipate completing the remaining apartment homes in that first tower by the end of this month. 
Based on these successful results, Aimco approved a plan during 2015 to redevelop a second tower at Park Towne Place with 245 apartment homes. We began deleasing this tower during the fourth quarter and construction is underway. 
At The Sterling, we continue to enjoy good product acceptance. At the end of January, we had leased 97% of the completed apartment homes with rents above underwriting. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we approved the plan to continue the redevelopment of The Sterling with another 5 floors containing 130 apartment homes. 
And during 2015, we also invested a total of $160 million in development. About $100 million of this was in our One Canal property in Boston, which will be completed in April and which we are pre-leasing now. 
We also invested $16 million in the completion of Vivo, a property we acquired in Cambridge [indiscernible] under construction. We saw our first move-ins at Vivo in October, and the property is 44% leased today at rents above underwriting. In addition to Vivo, during 2015, we purchased 2 other properties, Mezzo, an operating property in Atlanta; and Axiom, a lease-up property in Cambridge. Our total purchase price for these 3 properties was $129 million. 
Our leasing at Axiom has gone very well, with the property currently 89% leased at rents above underwriting, and we expect to reach occupancy stabilization on this property during the second quarter. 
And finally, as we discussed on our last call, during 2015 we entered into a contract to acquire an under-construction apartment community in Northern California for $320 million. We have commenced pre-leasing of this community and anticipate closing the acquisition upon the completion of construction this summer. A portion of the acquisition price will be funded through a property loan and the balance with proceeds from the sale of 2 properties, one in Phoenix and one in Alexandria, Virginia. And in the fourth quarter, as noted earlier, we closed on the sale of the Phoenix property, and we anticipate closing on the sale of the Alexandria property in the second quarter of this year. 
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?"

Today, I'd like to spend a few moments on our 2015 results, after which I'll provide some details around our 2016 outlook and 2017 forecast that we published yesterday with our earnings release. 
First, 2015. 2015 AFFO of $1.88 per share was 12% higher than 2014 and $0.03 per share ahead of our beginning-of-the-year guidance. 2015 same-store revenue growth of 4.5% is 40 basis points ahead of our beginning-of-the-year guidance, while expense growth of 2.1% was 70 basis points lower than guided. Combined, these results produced year-over-year net operating income growth of 5.6%, which is 90 basis points above our beginning-of-the-year guidance. 
As to the balance sheet. At 6.8x, year-end leverage was down 11% year-over-year. This reduction was accomplished in part by using proceeds from our January equity offering to reduce debt balances. Specifically, we raised $367 million by selling stock at $38.90 per share and used the proceeds to reduce property debt and to repay our outstanding line balance. Today, our unencumbered pool contains properties with a combined value of approximately $1.8 billion, nearly double that of year-end 2014.
Last week, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.30 to $0.33 per share. On an annualized basis, this represents an increase of 12% compared to dividends paid during 2015. In short, 2015 was a good year for Aimco with double-digit AFFO growth, solid same-store results, lower leverage and increased dividends. 
Looking ahead, we feel good about our prospects. Our 2016 outlook and 2017 forecast provides more visibility into the 4 key factors Terry mentioned that are expected to impact Aimco's projected earnings. They are same-store growth, property sales and reinvestment activities, non-core earnings and offsite cost. I'd like to take a minute to walk through each of these. 
First, same-store NOI growth. In 2016, we anticipate same-store revenue growth between 4.5% and 5%, an acceleration of 25 basis points at the midpoint over 2015. We anticipate expenses to increased 2.5% to 3%, up from 2.1% in 2015. This rate of expense growth is attributable to an increased investment in our on-site teams in 2016, which we expect will result in improved productivity and lower cost in the future. These increases in both revenues and expenses drive our expectations of 2016 NOI growth between 5.25% and 6.25%. 
We also provided a financial model for 2017. In that model, we assume revenue deceleration of 50 basis points from 2016 based on a 60 basis point deceleration in new leases and a 90 basis point deceleration in renewal leases. We have no evidence to the fact there is such a deceleration across our portfolio, far from it. As Terry said, we picked a conservative number to show that our 2017 forecast is achievable even if markets weakened and to show that we're looking ahead to the inevitability of slower growth. 
At the top line, we show revenue growth in 2017 of 3.75% to 4.75%. This growth rate is based on the earning at 2016 recent activity, renewal rates of 4.5% and new lease rates of 3.9% as estimated by third-party data providers. We assume operating expenses increase 2.5% to 3%, which is based on market level inflation adjustments, which are also projected by third parties. These assumptions yield 2017 NOI growth of 4% to 5.5%. So if these assumptions prove true, we will see continued strength in same-store NOI growth albeit at a slower pace than in 2017 -- than in '16. 
The second key factor impacting Aimco's AFFO growth is the effect of a sale of stabilized properties to invest in non-stabilized properties, the most impactful of which are One Canal, our development property in Boston; Vivo, a property acquired under construction in June of last year; and our Bay Area acquisition expected to close this summer. 
For 2016, we expect the NOI contribution from these 3 properties to be less than $0.01 per share. This nominal contribution is more than offset by the $0.05 to $0.07 of dilution from properties sold to fund these investments. For 2017, we expect Vivo to achieve NOI stabilization by the end of the year. And for One Canal and our Bay Area acquisition to reach stabilized occupancy of 95% by third quarter. Together, we project these lease-up communities will contribute $0.12 per share to 2017 NOI. As One Canal and our Bay Area acquisition achieve NOI stabilization in 2018, we would expect an even greater contribution to 2018's results. In short, we are accepting short-term pain in the form of 2016 AFFO dilution with a long-term gain provided by higher quality communities with growth prospects superior than the property sold to fund their development or acquisition. 
The third factor affecting Aimco's AFFO growth is the long expected financial impact of the simplification of Aimco's business model. In 2016, the contribution to bottom line from non-core earnings is expected to decline by $0.08 to $0.12 per share compared to 2015 as a result of our gradual exit from the Affordable and asset management lines of business and the reduced income tax benefits related to historic tax credits and our taxable REIT subsidiaries. In 2017, we project a further decline in non-core earnings of an additional $0.09 to $0.10. 
The fourth factor affecting Aimco's AFFO growth is the positive impact of reduced offsite costs that come with a simpler business model. As the complexity and scale of our business change and we gain efficiency, we expect these costs, which include property management, investment management and G&A to decline by $0.02 in 2016 and an additional $0.01 to $0.03 in 2017. 
While we expect some variability in other components of AFFO, these 4 items are the primary drivers of our expectations for the change in 2016 and 2017. In 2016, we expect AFFO will be in the range of $1.91 to $2.01 per share, a growth rate of 4% compared to 2015 notwithstanding the $0.05 to $0.07 per share dilution related to the properties sold to fund the purchase of lease-up properties. 
2017, based on the stated assumptions, we calculate AFFO would increase 12% at the midpoint to $2.12 to $2.26 per share. Assuming these rates of earnings growth, we see year-end 2017 leverage of approximately 6.3x, a reduction of 7% compared to year-end 2015. 
So to summarize, we see over the next 2 years better operating results and improved portfolio, a simpler business with lower non-core earnings, safer leverage, reduced offsite costs and increased AFFO per share, all of this accomplished without the need to access equity capital markets.

The answer to that is very specific in details and not especially market-driven but more site-specific. And so just -- at the top of my head, to think about it and walk down the seaboard with you to be responsive. In Boston, there is considerable supply coming into the CBD and Cambridge, and it's being absorbed at or above our expectations. In New York, we have limited exposure to the new supply. We're at a different price point. In Washington --  Philadelphia, excuse me, we have competitive new supply, but our experience at The Sterling and Park Towne is that we're being -- our product is being accepted at price points above our expectation in underwriting. In Washington, D.C., where our revenues are growing. There is continuing new supply, but again it's at price points above our portfolio there. In Atlanta, there's competitive new supply, but our rents there have been growing. In Miami, we have a certain amount of disappointment, but it's not so much to the overall levels of new supplies, the specific location of them, at 2 of our major towers have construction literally contiguously or across The Street 24/7 that make it a noisy place to live. And so you'll see that in our Miami results. In Chicago, in the suburban markets, where that portfolio -- there is a certain amount of new construction but not impactful today. In Denver, there's a significant amount of new construction. I think the -- this kind of illustrates the point that it's going to be location specific and not market specific. It would be my opinion that the Denver market will soften and perhaps will be difficult, but it's a market we've avoided. And so our properties that are grouped under Denver are in fact either on what we think of as an island at the end Anschutz Medical Campus at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and or in Boulder where there's no growth ordinances that provide some protection against oversupply. So more probably Denver is likely to be soft, but not our asset as much. Moving west, in Seattle, we have a single asset in Downtown Seattle and one in Renton, and so we can't be affected too much at all in the Bay Area, which is, of course, a matter of concern to all REIT investors. As I mentioned earlier, specific properties that we own and where we own them actually had a wonderful fourth quarter and a wonderful January. And so we do not now see supply in our markets, which -- remember we are not in the city of San Francisco, but we do not now see new supply impacting rent growth. Los Angeles, again, the new supply continues, but it's more moderate than other markets and rent growth for our portfolio, which is primarily West L.A  continues. And I would say the same would be true in San Diego. Now that's just top of mind. John, would you agree with that or put it that in a different way?"

And so in that model, we are using third party's expectations for what will happen in our particular submarkets for new lease rents. We also have assumed what we feel as a conservative assumption regarding renewal rates where we are assuming in the '17 model a 4.5% renewal rate, which is 90 basis points below what we have experienced recently.

We do try and strike a balance. What we see in the redevelopment activities is, there's typically a year or 2 before the current period profitability of the redeveloped asset catches up to that of the property being sold. I've kind of forgotten right here, but I believe that in the 2015 property sales the free cash flow yield was just under 5%, something like that, 4% in change, 4% high. And that when we look forward, that might take -- and it depends on the redevelopment what the cycle time is. So at Park Towne, you can see the cycle time is probably 6 to 9 months. At another one -- Ocean House, it was over a year.

Our business is good, and we hope that yours is too. Before discussing our results, past and projected, I'd like to make sure that you know that yesterday we report",874,"Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to all of you, and thank you for your interest in Aimco. Our business is good, and we hope that yours is too. Before discussing our results, past and projected, I'd like to make sure that you know that yesterday we reported 2015 results, gave 2016 guidance and provided a financial model forecasting 2017. Paul made the decision to provide the forecast for the next 2 years to make clear to investors the impact of 4 factors: first, same-store NOI growth rates; second, the long expected decline in non-core earnings as we continue the simplification of our business, for example, the wind down of our low income housing tax credit activities and the reduction in the number of our partnerships; third, the dilution that comes from selling fully leased properties to acquire the Northern California lease-up property that has no current income; and fourth, the savings in G&A and other off-site costs as we scale our overhead to our more focused business.
So for 2016, the headline is that we continue to think long term, accepting short-term pain for long-term gain. The short-term pain is a lower growth rate for AFFO this year, up only 4% compared to being up 12% last year. For 2017, the long-term gain is the reacceleration of the AFFO growth rate to 12% together with higher rent growth going forward, a better portfolio with higher average rents, a stronger balance sheet and improved quality of earnings. 
We will return to 2016 and 2017 later, especially in Paul's remarks, but now I'd like to direct your attention to a few highlights from last year. 
Last year, in property operations across our diversified portfolio, rent growth was higher than in 2014 by 50 basis points. In redevelopment, strong consumer demand for our redeveloped apartment homes drove the lease-up of Ocean House in La Jolla, absorption at above seasonal expectations at Park Towne and The Sterling in Philadelphia, second-generation rent increases averaging 13% for our occupancy stabilized redevelopments at Lincoln Place, Pacific Bay Vistas and Preserve at Marin. 
In portfolio management, fourth quarter average revenue per apartment home was up 10% year-over-year, reaching $1,840, a record high for Aimco. 
And on the balance sheet, at year-end we had $675 million of cash on hand and credit available on our bank lines. And at year-end leverage, as [indiscernible] by the ratio of leverage to EBITDA was down year-over-year by 11%. 
So the bottom line, 2015 AFFO per share was up year-over-year by 12%, cash dividends per share were up year-over-year by 13% and consensus net asset value per share was up year-over-year by 11%. For these excellent results, I thank my teammates and say, well done.
Now let's look forward. When we look property by property at the Aimco business, we see on balance continuation of the solid consumer demand of the past few years. In fact, through January of this year, the rate of year-over-year rent growth has been higher for each of the past 12 consecutive months. That is, January 2016 rent increased at a faster rate than the January 2015. December 2015 rent increased at a faster rate than the December 2014 and so on. So for the past 12 consecutive months, our rent growth has accelerated.
Now when we look outside our business, we're mindful of the potential for overbuilding in some markets, and we cannot help but notice the turbulence in financial markets and uncertainties about economic growth. These conflicting data points make us conservative. You can see that we project 2016 rent growth, which is the closest to hand and most visible to us, at roughly equal to, and in fact a little bit better than, the rent growth we've enjoyed for the past few years. 
You'll also see that in our 2017 forecast, we decided to assume lower rent growth. We are not making a call on the market. As mentioned earlier, in our portfolio, rents have accelerated for 12 consecutive months, and we have no visibility on a deceleration. We assumed lower rent growth for 2 reasons: first, we want you to know that our 2017 forecast is quite achievable even if there were to be a slowdown; and second, whether or not there is a slowdown in 2017, we all hope that markets will turn someday, and we want you to know what we are thinking and doing now to be prepared.
First, continue to emphasize our commitment to customer selection and customer satisfaction, and we are increasing our investment in our site teams. Second, we are increasing capital spending to put our properties in top condition. Third, we are glad of our limited exposure to development and redevelopment, and we are monitoring closely our exposure to lease-up of redevelopment and acquisition properties. Fourth, we appreciate our portfolio diversification across markets and price points, and we're cautious about possible acquisitions. And fifth, we're guarding financial liquidity and are building balance sheet capacity to reduce dependence on financial markets and to support opportunistic investment, if such can be found.
Now I'd like to turn the call to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations, who will review our fourth quarter results and a first look at the New Year. Keith?"

I'm pleased to report that we had a solid 2015 in operations, with full year revenues up 4.5%, expenses up 2.1% and net operating income up 5.6%. Annually, we achieved blended lease rate increases of 4.9% while maintaining an average daily occupancy of 95.9% with turnover at 48.6%. 
In Q4 of 2015, our residents gave us our ninth consecutive quarter of better than a 4-star rating in customer satisfaction. As a result, renewal rents increased 5.6% for the quarter, some 70 basis points higher than fourth quarter 2014. We saw particular strength in the Bay Area, Denver and Boston. Renewal rents in these markets increased 7% to 9% compared to the expiring leases. Where those leases expired and were not renewed, our new lease right pricing outperformed the results from the fourth quarter of 2014 and for each month of the quarter individually. This resulted in a quarterly increase in new lease rates of 2.1%, 120 basis points better than prior year. New lease rates were particularly strong in the Bay Area, Atlanta, San Diego and New York City, with increases between 6% and 12%. As a result of our team's hard work across the country, we achieved blended lease rate increases of 3.6% for the quarter, 70 basis points better than Q4 2014. 
Turnover for the quarter was 50.7%. And of the customers who decided to move out, 23% were for career moves, 20% did not renew due to price and 15% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these move-out reasons versus recent quarters or our long-term averages. 
Our resident quality continues to improve. The average incomes of those new customers who moved in during the fourth quarter was $128,000, with a median income of $90,000. Year-over-year, the median income of our new residents was up 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 due to an increase in household incomes and portfolio quality. 
Our 12 target markets, which represent 90% of same-store net operating income, had top line revenue growth up 4.6% in Q4. The top performers had revenue increases for more than 7% to nearly 11% for the quarter. This was led by Seattle followed by the Bay Area, New York, Denver and Boston. Our steady performers which had revenue growth of more than 5% to 7% were San Diego, Atlanta and Greater Los Angeles. And finally, with revenue growth of roughly 1% to nearly 3%, we round out our target markets with Chicago, Washington, D.C., Miami and Philadelphia.
As we look ahead to early first quarter 2016 results, January blended lease rates were up 4.2%, double our start to last year. New leases were up 2.9%, some 270 basis points better than prior year. And renewals were up 5.8%, 160 basis points better than January of 2015. January's average daily occupancy was on plan at 95.8%, 30 basis points better than prior year, and February and March renewal offers went out with 5% to 7% increases. 
Our expectations for 2016 revenue growth in our 12 target markets can be broken into 3 tiers. At the top of the list, with forecasted growth between 6% and 9%, we have the Bay Area, Denver, Seattle and Atlanta. The midrange markets with forecasted growth of more than 4% to better than 5% are Boston, New York City, San Diego and Greater Los Angeles. And rounding out our 12 target markets with growth of nearly 3% to 4%, we have Miami, Chicago, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. 
And with great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco's success, I'll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?"

During 2015, we sold 11 properties, with about 3,900 apartment homes for gross proceeds to Aimco of $386 million. These sales represented roughly 4% of our beginning-of-the-year real estate assets. 
We sold 8 Conventional properties, with average revenues per apartment home of $1,043 per month, 43% below the average of our retained portfolio. And among the properties we sold were the last we held in Phoenix. 
We also continued to sold out of our Affordable portfolio with the sale of 3 properties. On average, the property sold in 2015 had a free cash flow cap rate of 4.9%. Had we held these properties for the next 10 years, we would have expected them to generate a free cash flow internal rate of return of about 6%. 
Proceeds from these sales were reinvested in redevelopment and development projects, acquisitions and property upgrades at a weighted average free cash flow internal rate of return about 350 basis points higher than the property sold to fund them. 
In particular, we invested $118 million in redevelopment projects during the year, enhancing 7 communities with a total of more than 2,500 apartments. During 2015, we completed our multi-year redevelopments at Lincoln Place located in Venice, California; and Preserve at Marin in Marin County, California. We also completed work at 2900 on First in Seattle and Ocean House on Prospect located in La Jolla, California. 
We continued the redevelopment of 2 Center City, Philadelphia properties, which many of you saw during our Investor Day back in October Park Towne Place and The Sterling. At Park Towne Place, 2015 saw the near completion of the redevelopment of 1 of the 4 towers that comprise the community as well as the community center. At the end of January, we had leased 84% of the completed apartment homes in this tower with rents above underwriting, and we anticipate completing the remaining apartment homes in that first tower by the end of this month. 
Based on these successful results, Aimco approved a plan during 2015 to redevelop a second tower at Park Towne Place with 245 apartment homes. We began deleasing this tower during the fourth quarter and construction is underway. 
At The Sterling, we continue to enjoy good product acceptance. At the end of January, we had leased 97% of the completed apartment homes with rents above underwriting. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we approved the plan to continue the redevelopment of The Sterling with another 5 floors containing 130 apartment homes. 
And during 2015, we also invested a total of $160 million in development. About $100 million of this was in our One Canal property in Boston, which will be completed in April and which we are pre-leasing now. 
We also invested $16 million in the completion of Vivo, a property we acquired in Cambridge [indiscernible] under construction. We saw our first move-ins at Vivo in October, and the property is 44% leased today at rents above underwriting. In addition to Vivo, during 2015, we purchased 2 other properties, Mezzo, an operating property in Atlanta; and Axiom, a lease-up property in Cambridge. Our total purchase price for these 3 properties was $129 million. 
Our leasing at Axiom has gone very well, with the property currently 89% leased at rents above underwriting, and we expect to reach occupancy stabilization on this property during the second quarter. 
And finally, as we discussed on our last call, during 2015 we entered into a contract to acquire an under-construction apartment community in Northern California for $320 million. We have commenced pre-leasing of this community and anticipate closing the acquisition upon the completion of construction this summer. A portion of the acquisition price will be funded through a property loan and the balance with proceeds from the sale of 2 properties, one in Phoenix and one in Alexandria, Virginia. And in the fourth quarter, as noted earlier, we closed on the sale of the Phoenix property, and we anticipate closing on the sale of the Alexandria property in the second quarter of this year.

First, 2015. 2015 AFFO of $1.88 per share wa",1103,"Thanks, John. Today, I'd like to spend a few moments on our 2015 results, after which I'll provide some details around our 2016 outlook and 2017 forecast that we published yesterday with our earnings release. 
First, 2015. 2015 AFFO of $1.88 per share was 12% higher than 2014 and $0.03 per share ahead of our beginning-of-the-year guidance. 2015 same-store revenue growth of 4.5% is 40 basis points ahead of our beginning-of-the-year guidance, while expense growth of 2.1% was 70 basis points lower than guided. Combined, these results produced year-over-year net operating income growth of 5.6%, which is 90 basis points above our beginning-of-the-year guidance. 
As to the balance sheet. At 6.8x, year-end leverage was down 11% year-over-year. This reduction was accomplished in part by using proceeds from our January equity offering to reduce debt balances. Specifically, we raised $367 million by selling stock at $38.90 per share and used the proceeds to reduce property debt and to repay our outstanding line balance. Today, our unencumbered pool contains properties with a combined value of approximately $1.8 billion, nearly double that of year-end 2014.
Last week, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.30 to $0.33 per share. On an annualized basis, this represents an increase of 12% compared to dividends paid during 2015. In short, 2015 was a good year for Aimco with double-digit AFFO growth, solid same-store results, lower leverage and increased dividends. 
Looking ahead, we feel good about our prospects. Our 2016 outlook and 2017 forecast provides more visibility into the 4 key factors Terry mentioned that are expected to impact Aimco's projected earnings. They are same-store growth, property sales and reinvestment activities, non-core earnings and offsite cost. I'd like to take a minute to walk through each of these. 
First, same-store NOI growth. In 2016, we anticipate same-store revenue growth between 4.5% and 5%, an acceleration of 25 basis points at the midpoint over 2015. We anticipate expenses to increase 2.5% to 3%, up from 2.1% in 2015. This rate of expense growth is attributable to an increased investment in our on-site teams in 2016, which we expect will result in improved productivity and lower cost in the future. These increases in both revenues and expenses drive our expectations of 2016 NOI growth between 5.25% and 6.25%. 
We also provided a financial model for 2017. In that model, we assume revenue deceleration of 50 basis points from 2016 based on a 60 basis point deceleration in new leases and a 90 basis point deceleration in renewal leases. We have no evidence to the fact there is such a deceleration across our portfolio, far from it. As Terry said, we picked a conservative number to show that our 2017 forecast is achievable even if markets weakened and to show that we're looking ahead to the inevitability of slower growth. 
At the top line, we show revenue growth in 2017 of 3.75% to 4.75%. This growth rate is based on the earning[ph] of 2016 leasing activity, renewal rates of 4.5% and new lease rates of 3.9% as estimated by third-party data providers. We assume operating expenses increase 2.5% to 3%, which is based on market level inflation adjustments, which are also projected by third parties. These assumptions yield 2017 NOI growth of 4% to 5.5%. So if these assumptions prove true, we will see continued strength in same-store NOI growth albeit at a slower pace than in 2017 -- than in '16. 
The second key factor impacting Aimco's AFFO growth is the effect of a sale of stabilized properties to invest in non-stabilized properties, the most impactful of which are One Canal, our development property in Boston; Vivo, a property acquired under construction in June of last year; and our Bay Area acquisition expected to close this summer. 
For 2016, we expect the NOI contribution from these 3 properties to be less than $0.01 per share. This nominal contribution is more than offset by the $0.05 to $0.07 of dilution from properties sold to fund these investments. For 2017, we expect Vivo to achieve NOI stabilization by the end of the year. And for One Canal and our Bay Area acquisition to reach stabilized occupancy of 95% by third quarter. Together, we project these lease-up communities will contribute $0.12 per share to 2017 NOI. As One Canal and our Bay Area acquisition achieve NOI stabilization in 2018, we would expect an even greater contribution to 2018's results. In short, we are accepting short-term pain in the form of 2016 AFFO dilution with a long-term gain provided by higher quality communities with growth prospects superior than the property sold to fund their development or acquisition. 
The third factor affecting Aimco's AFFO growth is the long expected financial impact of the simplification of Aimco's business model. In 2016, the contribution to bottom line from non-core earnings is expected to decline by $0.08 to $0.12 per share compared to 2015 as a result of our gradual exit from the Affordable and asset management lines of business and the reduced income tax benefits related to historic tax credits and our taxable REIT subsidiaries. In 2017, we project a further decline in non-core earnings of an additional $0.09 to $0.10. 
The fourth factor affecting Aimco's AFFO growth is the positive impact of reduced offsite costs that come with a simpler business model. As the complexity and scale of our business change and we gain efficiency, we expect these costs, which include property management, investment management and G&A to decline by $0.02 in 2016 and an additional $0.01 to $0.03 in 2017. 
While we expect some variability in other components of AFFO, these 4 items are the primary drivers of our expectations for the change in 2016 and 2017. In 2016, we expect AFFO will be in the range of $1.91 to $2.01 per share, a growth rate of 4% compared to 2015 notwithstanding the $0.05 to $0.07 per share dilution related to the properties sold to fund the purchase of lease-up properties. 
2017, based on the stated assumptions, we calculate AFFO would increase 12% at the midpoint to $2.12 to $2.26 per share. Assuming these rates of earnings growth, we see year-end 2017 leverage of approximately 6.3x, a reduction of 7% compared to year-end 2015. 
So to summarize, we see over the next 2 years better operating results and improved portfolio, a simpler business with lower non-core earnings, safer leverage, reduced offsite costs and increased AFFO per share, all of this accomplished without the need to access equity capital markets.

The answer to that is very specific in details and not especially market-driven but more site-specific. And so just -- at the top of my head, to think about it and walk down the seaboard with you to be responsive. In Boston, there is considerable supply coming into the CBD and Cambridge, and it's being absorbed at or above our expectations. In New York, we have limited exposure to the new supply. We're at a different price point. In Washington --  Philadelphia, excuse me, we have competitive new supply, but our experience at The Sterling and Park Towne is that we're being -- our product is being accepted at price points above our expectation in underwriting. In Washington, D.C., where our revenues are growing, there is continuing new supply, but again it's at price points above our portfolio there. In Atlanta, there's competitive new supply, but our rents there have been growing. In Miami, we have a certain amount of disappointment, but it's not so much the overall levels of new supplies, the specific location of them. At -- 2 of our major towers have construction literally contiguously or across the street 24/7 that make it a noisy place to live. And so you'll see that in our Miami results. In Chicago, in the suburban markets, where that portfolio is, there is a certain amount of new construction but not impactful today. In Denver, there's a significant amount of new construction. I think the -- this kind of illustrates the point that it's going to be location specific and not market specific. It would be my opinion that the Denver market will soften and perhaps will be difficult, but it's a market we've avoided. And so our properties that are grouped under Denver are in fact either on what we think of as an island at the Anschutz Medical Campus at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and or in Boulder where there's no growth ordinances that provide some protection against oversupply. So more probably Denver is likely to be soft, but not our asset as much. Moving west, in Seattle, we have a single asset in Downtown Seattle and one in Renton, and so we can't be affected too much at all in the Bay Area, which is, of course, a matter of concern to all REIT investors. As I mentioned earlier, specific properties that we own and where we own them actually had a wonderful fourth quarter and a wonderful January. And so we do not now see supply in our markets, which -- remember we are not in the city of San Francisco, but we do not now see new supply impacting rent growth. Los Angeles, again, the new supply continues, but it's more moderate than other markets and rent growth for our portfolio, which is primarily West L.A  continues. And I would say the same would be true in San Diego. Now that's just top of mind. John, would you agree with that or put it that in a different way?"

For 2017, because that is a period that is beyond the time horizon, which we have great visibility, we wanted to provide a model. And so in that model, we are using third party's expectations for what will happen in our particular submarkets for new lease rents. We also have assumed what we feel is a conservative assumption regarding renewal rates where we are assuming in the '17 model a 4.5% renewal rate, which is 90 basis points below what we have experienced recently.

We do try and strike a balance. What we see in the redevelopment activities is, there's typically a year or 2 before the current period profitability of the redeveloped asset catches up to that of the property being sold. I've kind of forgotten right here, but I believe that in the 2015 property sales the free cash flow yield was just under 5%, something like that, 4% and change, 4% high. And that when we look forward, that might take -- and it depends on the redevelopment what the cycle time is. So at Park Towne, you can see the cycle time is probably 6 to 9 months. At another one -- Ocean House, it was over a year.

Our business is good, and we hope that yours is too. Before discussing our results, past and projected, I'd like to make sure that you know that yesterday we report",874,"Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to all of you, and thank you for your interest in Aimco. Our business is good, and we hope that yours is too. Before discussing our results, past and projected, I'd like to make sure that you know that yesterday we reported 2015 results, gave 2016 guidance and provided a financial model forecasting 2017. Paul made the decision to provide the forecast for the next 2 years to make clear to investors the impact of 4 factors: first, same-store NOI growth rates; second, the long expected decline in non-core earnings as we continue the simplification of our business, for example, the wind down of our low income housing tax credit activities and the reduction in the number of our partnerships; third, the dilution that comes from selling fully leased properties to acquire the Northern California lease-up property that has no current income; and fourth, the savings in G&A and other off-site costs as we scale our overhead to our more focused business.
So for 2016, the headline is that we continue to think long term, accepting short-term pain for long-term gain. The short-term pain is a lower growth rate for AFFO this year, up only 4% compared to being up 12% last year. For 2017, the long-term gain is the reacceleration of the AFFO growth rate to 12% together with higher rent growth going forward, a better portfolio with higher average rents, a stronger balance sheet and improved quality of earnings. 
We will return to 2016 and 2017 later, especially in Paul's remarks, but now I'd like to direct your attention to a few highlights from last year. 
Last year, in property operations across our diversified portfolio, rent growth was higher than in 2014 by 50 basis points. In redevelopment, strong consumer demand for our redeveloped apartment homes drove the lease-up of Ocean House in La Jolla, absorption at above seasonal expectations at Park Towne and The Sterling in Philadelphia, second-generation rent increases averaging 13% for our occupancy stabilized redevelopments at Lincoln Place, Pacific Bay Vistas and Preserve at Marin. 
In portfolio management, fourth quarter average revenue per apartment home was up 10% year-over-year, reaching $1,840, a record high for Aimco. 
And on the balance sheet, at year-end we had $675 million of cash on hand and credit available on our bank lines. And at year-end leverage, as [indiscernible] by the ratio of leverage to EBITDA was down year-over-year by 11%. 
So the bottom line, 2015 AFFO per share was up year-over-year by 12%, cash dividends per share were up year-over-year by 13% and consensus net asset value per share was up year-over-year by 11%. For these excellent results, I thank my teammates and say, well done.
Now let's look forward. When we look property by property at the Aimco business, we see on balance continuation of the solid consumer demand of the past few years. In fact, through January of this year, the rate of year-over-year rent growth has been higher for each of the past 12 consecutive months. That is, January 2016 rent increased at a faster rate than the January 2015. December 2015 rent increased at a faster rate than the December 2014 and so on. So for the past 12 consecutive months, our rent growth has accelerated.
Now when we look outside our business, we're mindful of the potential for overbuilding in some markets, and we cannot help but notice the turbulence in financial markets and uncertainties about economic growth. These conflicting data points make us conservative. You can see that we project 2016 rent growth, which is the closest to hand and most visible to us, at roughly equal to, and in fact a little bit better than, the rent growth we've enjoyed for the past few years. 
You'll also see that in our 2017 forecast, we decided to assume lower rent growth. We are not making a call on the market. As mentioned earlier, in our portfolio, rents have accelerated for 12 consecutive months, and we have no visibility on a deceleration. We assumed lower rent growth for 2 reasons: first, we want you to know that our 2017 forecast is quite achievable even if there were to be a slowdown; and second, whether or not there is a slowdown in 2017, we all hope that markets will turn someday, and we want you to know what we are thinking and doing now to be prepared.
First, continue to emphasize our commitment to customer selection and customer satisfaction, and we are increasing our investment in our site teams. Second, we are increasing capital spending to put our properties in top condition. Third, we are glad of our limited exposure to development and redevelopment, and we are monitoring closely our exposure to lease-up of redevelopment and acquisition properties. Fourth, we appreciate our portfolio diversification across markets and price points, and we're cautious about possible acquisitions. And fifth, we're guarding financial liquidity and are building balance sheet capacity to reduce dependence on financial markets and to support opportunistic investment, if such can be found.
Now I'd like to turn the call to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations, who will review our fourth quarter results and a first look at the New Year. Keith?"

I'm pleased to report that we had a solid 2015 in operations, with full year revenues up 4.5%, expenses up 2.1% and net operating income up 5.6%. Annually, we achieved blended lease rate increases of 4.9% while maintaining an average daily occupancy of 95.9% with turnover at 48.6%. 
In Q4 of 2015, our residents gave us our ninth consecutive quarter of better than a 4-star rating in customer satisfaction. As a result, renewal rents increased 5.6% for the quarter, some 70 basis points higher than fourth quarter 2014. We saw particular strength in the Bay Area, Denver and Boston. Renewal rents in these markets increased 7% to 9% compared to the expiring leases. Where those leases expired and were not renewed, our new lease right pricing outperformed the results from the fourth quarter of 2014 and for each month of the quarter individually. This resulted in a quarterly increase in new lease rates of 2.1%, 120 basis points better than prior year. New lease rates were particularly strong in the Bay Area, Atlanta, San Diego and New York City, with increases between 6% and 12%. As a result of our team's hard work across the country, we achieved blended lease rate increases of 3.6% for the quarter, 70 basis points better than Q4 2014. 
Turnover for the quarter was 50.7%. And of the customers who decided to move out, 23% were for career moves, 20% did not renew due to price and 15% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these move-out reasons versus recent quarters or our long-term averages. 
Our resident quality continues to improve. The average incomes of those new customers who moved in during the fourth quarter was $128,000, with a median income of $90,000. Year-over-year, the median income of our new residents was up 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 due to an increase in household incomes and portfolio quality. 
Our 12 target markets, which represent 90% of same-store net operating income, had top line revenue growth up 4.6% in Q4. The top performers had revenue increases for more than 7% to nearly 11% for the quarter. This was led by Seattle followed by the Bay Area, New York, Denver and Boston. Our steady performers which had revenue growth of more than 5% to 7% were San Diego, Atlanta and Greater Los Angeles. And finally, with revenue growth of roughly 1% to nearly 3%, we round out our target markets with Chicago, Washington, D.C., Miami and Philadelphia.
As we look ahead to early first quarter 2016 results, January blended lease rates were up 4.2%, double our start to last year. New leases were up 2.9%, some 270 basis points better than prior year. And renewals were up 5.8%, 160 basis points better than January of 2015. January's average daily occupancy was on plan at 95.8%, 30 basis points better than prior year, and February and March renewal offers went out with 5% to 7% increases. 
Our expectations for 2016 revenue growth in our 12 target markets can be broken into 3 tiers. At the top of the list, with forecasted growth between 6% and 9%, we have the Bay Area, Denver, Seattle and Atlanta. The midrange markets with forecasted growth of more than 4% to better than 5% are Boston, New York City, San Diego and Greater Los Angeles. And rounding out our 12 target markets with growth of nearly 3% to 4%, we have Miami, Chicago, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.

During 2015, we sold 11 properties, with about 3,900 apartment homes for gross proceeds to Aimco of $386 million. These sales represented roughly 4% of our beginning-of-the-year real estate assets. 
We sold 8 Conventional properties, with average revenues per apartment home of $1,043 per month, 43% below the average of our retained portfolio. And among the properties we sold were the last we held in Phoenix. 
We also continued to sold out of our Affordable portfolio with the sale of 3 properties. On average, the property sold in 2015 had a free cash flow cap rate of 4.9%. Had we held these properties for the next 10 years, we would have expected them to generate a free cash flow internal rate of return of about 6%. 
Proceeds from these sales were reinvested in redevelopment and development projects, acquisitions and property upgrades at a weighted average free cash flow internal rate of return about 350 basis points higher than the property sold to fund them. 
In particular, we invested $118 million in redevelopment projects during the year, enhancing 7 communities with a total of more than 2,500 apartments. During 2015, we completed our multi-year redevelopments at Lincoln Place located in Venice, California; and Preserve at Marin in Marin County, California. We also completed work at 2900 on First in Seattle and Ocean House on Prospect located in La Jolla, California. 
We continued the redevelopment of 2 Center City, Philadelphia properties, which many of you saw during our Investor Day back in October Park Towne Place and The Sterling. At Park Towne Place, 2015 saw the near completion of the redevelopment of 1 of the 4 towers that comprise the community as well as the community center. At the end of January, we had leased 84% of the completed apartment homes in this tower with rents above underwriting, and we anticipate completing the remaining apartment homes in that first tower by the end of this month. 
Based on these successful results, Aimco approved a plan during 2015 to redevelop a second tower at Park Towne Place with 245 apartment homes. We began deleasing this tower during the fourth quarter and construction is underway. 
At The Sterling, we continue to enjoy good product acceptance. At the end of January, we had leased 97% of the completed apartment homes with rents above underwriting. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we approved the plan to continue the redevelopment of The Sterling with another 5 floors containing 130 apartment homes. 
And during 2015, we also invested a total of $160 million in development. About $100 million of this was in our One Canal property in Boston, which will be completed in April and which we are pre-leasing now. 
We also invested $16 million in the completion of Vivo, a property we acquired in Cambridge [indiscernible] under construction. We saw our first move-ins at Vivo in October, and the property is 44% leased today at rents above underwriting. In addition to Vivo, during 2015, we purchased 2 other properties, Mezzo, an operating property in Atlanta; and Axiom, a lease-up property in Cambridge. Our total purchase price for these 3 properties was $129 million. 
Our leasing at Axiom has gone very well, with the property currently 89% leased at rents above underwriting, and we expect to reach occupancy stabilization on this property during the second quarter. 
And finally, as we discussed on our last call, during 2015 we entered into a contract to acquire an under-construction apartment community in Northern California for $320 million. We have commenced pre-leasing of this community and anticipate closing the acquisition upon the completion of construction this summer. A portion of the acquisition price will be funded through a property loan and the balance with proceeds from the sale of 2 properties, one in Phoenix and one in Alexandria, Virginia. And in the fourth quarter, as noted earlier, we closed on the sale of the Phoenix property, and we anticipate closing on the sale of the Alexandria property in the second quarter of this year. 
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?"

Today, I'd like to spend a few moments on our 2015 results, after which I'll provide some details around our 2016 outlook and 2017 forecast that we published yesterday with our earnings release. First, 2015. 2015 AFFO of $1.88 per share wa",1104,"Thanks, John. Today, I'd like to spend a few moments on our 2015 results, after which I'll provide some details around our 2016 outlook and 2017 forecast that we published yesterday with our earnings release. 
First, 2015. 2015 AFFO of $1.88 per share was 12% higher than 2014 and $0.03 per share ahead of our beginning-of-the-year guidance. 2015 same-store revenue growth of 4.5% is 40 basis points ahead of our beginning-of-the-year guidance, while expense growth of 2.1% was 70 basis points lower than guided. Combined, these results produced year-over-year net operating income growth of 5.6%, which is 90 basis points above our beginning-of-the-year guidance. 
As to the balance sheet. At 6.8x, year-end leverage was down 11% year-over-year. This reduction was accomplished in part by using proceeds from our January equity offering to reduce debt balances. Specifically, we raised $367 million by selling stock at $38.90 per share and used the proceeds to reduce property debt and to repay our outstanding line balance. Today, our unencumbered pool contains properties with a combined value of approximately $1.8 billion, nearly double that of year-end 2014.
Last week, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.30 to $0.33 per share. On an annualized basis, this represents an increase of 12% compared to dividends paid during 2015. In short, 2015 was a good year for Aimco with double-digit AFFO growth, solid same-store results, lower leverage and increased dividends. 
Looking ahead, we feel good about our prospects. Our 2016 outlook and 2017 forecast provides more visibility into the 4 key factors Terry mentioned that are expected to impact Aimco's projected earnings. They are same-store growth, property sales and reinvestment activities, non-core earnings and offsite cost. I'd like to take a minute to walk through each of these. 
First, same-store NOI growth. In 2016, we anticipate same-store revenue growth between 4.5% and 5%, an acceleration of 25 basis points at the midpoint over 2015. We anticipate expenses to increase 2.5% to 3%, up from 2.1% in 2015. This rate of expense growth is attributable to an increased investment in our on-site teams in 2016, which we expect will result in improved productivity and lower cost in the future. These increases in both revenues and expenses drive our expectations of 2016 NOI growth between 5.25% and 6.25%. 
We also provided a financial model for 2017. In that model, we assume revenue deceleration of 50 basis points from 2016 based on a 60 basis point deceleration in new leases and a 90 basis point deceleration in renewal leases. We have no evidence to the fact there is such a deceleration across our portfolio, far from it. As Terry said, we picked a conservative number to show that our 2017 forecast is achievable even if markets weakened and to show that we're looking ahead to the inevitability of slower growth. 
At the top line, we show revenue growth in 2017 of 3.75% to 4.75%. This growth rate is based on the earning [ph] of 2016 leasing activity, renewal rates of 4.5% and new lease rates of 3.9% as estimated by third-party data providers. We assume operating expenses increase 2.5% to 3%, which is based on market level inflation adjustments, which are also projected by third parties. These assumptions yield 2017 NOI growth of 4% to 5.5%. So if these assumptions prove true, we will see continued strength in same-store NOI growth albeit at a slower pace than in 2017 -- than in '16. 
The second key factor impacting Aimco's AFFO growth is the effect of a sale of stabilized properties to invest in non-stabilized properties, the most impactful of which are One Canal, our development property in Boston; Vivo, a property acquired under construction in June of last year; and our Bay Area acquisition expected to close this summer. 
For 2016, we expect the NOI contribution from these 3 properties to be less than $0.01 per share. This nominal contribution is more than offset by the $0.05 to $0.07 of dilution from properties sold to fund these investments. For 2017, we expect Vivo to achieve NOI stabilization by the end of the year. And for One Canal and our Bay Area acquisition to reach stabilized occupancy of 95% by third quarter. Together, we project these lease-up communities will contribute $0.12 per share to 2017 NOI. As One Canal and our Bay Area acquisition achieve NOI stabilization in 2018, we would expect an even greater contribution to 2018's results. In short, we are accepting short-term pain in the form of 2016 AFFO dilution with a long-term gain provided by higher quality communities with growth prospects superior than the property sold to fund their development or acquisition. 
The third factor affecting Aimco's AFFO growth is the long expected financial impact of the simplification of Aimco's business model. In 2016, the contribution to bottom line from non-core earnings is expected to decline by $0.08 to $0.12 per share compared to 2015 as a result of our gradual exit from the Affordable and asset management lines of business and the reduced income tax benefits related to historic tax credits and our taxable REIT subsidiaries. In 2017, we project a further decline in non-core earnings of an additional $0.09 to $0.10. 
The fourth factor affecting Aimco's AFFO growth is the positive impact of reduced offsite costs that come with a simpler business model. As the complexity and scale of our business change and we gain efficiency, we expect these costs, which include property management, investment management and G&A to decline by $0.02 in 2016 and an additional $0.01 to $0.03 in 2017. 
While we expect some variability in other components of AFFO, these 4 items are the primary drivers of our expectations for the change in 2016 and 2017. In 2016, we expect AFFO will be in the range of $1.91 to $2.01 per share, a growth rate of 4% compared to 2015 notwithstanding the $0.05 to $0.07 per share dilution related to the properties sold to fund the purchase of lease-up properties. 
2017, based on the stated assumptions, we calculate AFFO would increase 12% at the midpoint to $2.12 to $2.26 per share. Assuming these rates of earnings growth, we see year-end 2017 leverage of approximately 6.3x, a reduction of 7% compared to year-end 2015. 
So to summarize, we see over the next 2 years better operating results and improved portfolio, a simpler business with lower non-core earnings, safer leverage, reduced offsite costs and increased AFFO per share, all of this accomplished without the need to access equity capital markets.

And it's a little bit like running a -- riding a bicycle, you can't lean too far one way or the other. Over the years, our primary metric for the business has been net asset value plus cash dividend, which is a balance, and increases in that are what we call economic income. And so, we focus on that first. And you can see, for example, in 2016 net asset value will be much more predictable than the current income that we just discussed, which is more volatile. But net asset value is -- over time is closely connected to cash flow. So again, it's a question of balance."

The answer to that is very specific in details and not especially market-driven but more site-specific. And so just -- at the top of my head, to think about it and walk down the seaboard with you to be responsive. In Boston, there is considerable supply coming into the CBD and Cambridge, and it's being absorbed at or above our expectations. In New York, we have limited exposure to the new supply. We're at a different price point. In Washington --  Philadelphia, excuse me, we have competitive new supply, but our experience at The Sterling and Park Towne is that we're being -- our product is being accepted at price points above our expectation in underwriting. In Washington, D.C., where our revenues are growing, there is continuing new supply, but again it's at price points above our portfolio there. In Atlanta, there's competitive new supply, but our rents there have been growing. In Miami, we have a certain amount of disappointment, but it's not so much the overall levels of new supplies, the specific location of them. At -- 2 of our major towers have construction literally contiguously or across the street 24/7 that make it a noisy place to live. And so you'll see that in our Miami results. In Chicago, in the suburban markets, where that portfolio is, there is a certain amount of new construction but not impactful today. In Denver, there's a significant amount of new construction. I think the -- this kind of illustrates the point that it's going to be location specific and not market specific. It would be my opinion that the Denver market will soften and perhaps will be difficult, but it's a market we've avoided. And so our properties that are grouped under Denver are in fact either on what we think of as an island at the Anschutz Medical Campus at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and or in Boulder where there's no growth ordinances that provide some protection against oversupply. So more probably Denver is likely to be soft, but not our asset as much. Moving west, in Seattle, we have a single asset in Downtown Seattle and one in Renton, and so we can't be affected too much at all in the Bay Area, which is, of course, a matter of concern to all REIT investors. As I mentioned earlier, specific properties that we own and where we own them actually had a wonderful fourth quarter and a wonderful January. And so we do not now see supply in our markets, which -- remember we are not in the city of San Francisco, but we do not now see new supply impacting rent growth. Los Angeles, again, the new supply continues, but it's more moderate than other markets and rent growth for our portfolio, which is primarily West L.A  continues. And I would say the same would be true in San Diego. Now that's just top of mind. John, would you agree with that or put it that in a different way?"

For 2017, because that is a period that is beyond the time horizon, which we have great visibility, we wanted to provide a model. And so in that model, we are using third party's expectations for what will happen in our particular submarkets for new lease rents. We also have assumed what we feel is a conservative assumption regarding renewal rates where we are assuming in the '17 model a 4.5% renewal rate, which is 90 basis points below what we have experienced recently.

And I'm wondering how committed you are to that? Because each time you start these redevelopments they're multi-years out, and you're selling assets at essentially the same cap rate where you're saying to get your redevelopment yield and yet you're getting the NOI from the redevelopment 2 years later. It just feels like a very dilutive process. I'm wondering how committed you are? And how we should think about modeling this over the next 3, 4 years?

We do try and strike a balance. What we see in the redevelopment activities is, there's typically a year or 2 before the current period profitability of the redeveloped asset catches up to that of the property being sold. I've kind of forgotten right here, but I believe that in the 2015 property sales the free cash flow yield was just under 5%, something like that, 4% and change, 4% high. And that when we look forward, that might take -- and it depends on the redevelopment what the cycle time is. So at Park Towne, you can see the cycle time is probably 6 to 9 months. At another one -- Ocean House, it was over a year. And so we try to do them in smaller bites where the cycle time is faster, trying to stay focused on long-term value creation and accept the turbulence[ph]."

Business is good. In property operations, same-store rent per apartment home was up 5.1%. The rate of increase 70 basis point better than the 4.4% growth rate of the first quarter last year. Operating expenses were essentially flat with higher rents and flat expenses, same-store net operating income was up by more than 7%, beating the high end of our guidance by 160 basis points making for a good quarter and a solid start to the year. 
In redevelopment, ongoing projects are on-time, on budget and are creating value equal to $0.25 to $0.35 for each dollar invested. Patty and her team are doing a great job, including construction on -- completing construction on the south tower and starting construction on the east tower at Park Towne Place in Center City, Philadelphia as well as adding to our active redevelopments by starting the final space that completes the redevelopment of The Sterling in Center City, Philadelphia and starting a second phase at Palazzo at Park La Brea in Los Angeles. 
In portfolio management, first quarter revenue per apartment home was up across the entire Aimco portfolio to more than $1,860, an Aimco record and up 9% year-over-year. 
For these good results, I offer sincere graduations and thanks to my Aimco teammates, both here in Denver and across the country. It's a privilege and a pleasure to work with you. I'm especially proud of your great Aimco a top workplace in Colorado for a fourth consecutive year.

We're pleased to report that we had solid quarter and operations with revenues up 4.8% year-over-year, expenses were up 10 basis points year-over-year with net operating income up 7.1% for the quarter. Each of this quarter metrics are better than the first quarter of last year. 
In Q1 of 2016, our residents gave us our 10th consecutive quarter better than a 4-star rating in customer satisfaction. This contributed to renewal rent increases of 6% for the quarter, some 120 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2015. 
Of note, renewal premiums increased in each successive month of the quarter. We saw particularly strength in the Bay Area, Denver and Atlanta. Renewal rents in these markets increased 8% to 9% compared to the expiring leases. 
Where those leases expired and were not renewed, our new lease pricing outperformed the results from the first quarter of 2015 and for each month of the quarter, individually. This resulted in a quarterly increase in new lease rates of 3.5%, 230 basis points better than last year. The year-over-year rate of growth for new leases was strongest in Boston and Los Angeles.
As a result of our team's hard work, our blended lease rate increases of 4.6% were 180 basis points higher than the first quarter of last year and by 100 basis points sequentially, all while increasing average daily occupancy for the quarter by 10 basis points year-over-year and 50 basis points from fourth quarter. 
We had another solid quarter on the expense front, growing by 10 basis points overall and 2% when excluding the year-over-year decline in utility expenses due to a milder winter.
Turnover for the quarter was 50.9%. Of the customers who decided to move-out, 23% were for career moves, 17% did not renew do price and 14% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these move-out reasons versus recent quarters or on our long-term averages.
Our resident quality continues to improve. The average income for those new customers who moved in during the first quarter was $136,000 with a median income of $95,000. Year-over-year, the median income of our new residents was up 19% compared to the first quarter of 2015, with half coming from a more discriminating application process and half from an improvement in our portfolio quality.
Our 12 target markets, which represents 90% of same-store net operating income had top line revenue growth up 5.2% in the quarter versus 4.8% for the entire portfolio. Our top performers all had revenue increases in double digits from more than 10% to better than 13%. This was led by the Bay Area followed by Seattle and Denver.
Our strong performers, which had revenue growth from nearly 6% to better than 7% were Boston, San Diego, Atlanta and Greater Los Angeles. Our steady target markets was about 2.5% to 3% revenue growth were Chicago, New York City and Washington D.C. And finally, with softer revenue growth of around 1%, we had Philadelphia and Miami.
As we look to our April month-to-date results, blended lease rates are up 5%, 10 basis points better than last year. New leases are up 3.6% and renewals are up 6.4%. April's average daily occupancy is at 95.9%, 30 basis points below last year by design. 
We've intentionally moved leases from our shoulder months into peak pleasing season with higher demand. This improvement in expiration management will pay dividends by repricing leases in periods of greater expected rent growth. 
And finally, May and June renewal offers went up 6% to 8% increases. And with great things to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco's success.

I'd like to take a few minutes to review our recent investment and portfolio activities. 
During the first quarter, we invested $31 million in redevelopment, $9 million of it on our redevelopment pipeline and $22 million at Park Towne Place and The Sterling both located in Center City, Philadelphia. 
At Park Towne Place, we completed redevelopment of the south tower and the town center, 91% of the 224 completed development homes in the south tower are leased and rents are ahead of underwriting. Construction is progressing as planned on the east tower with deliveries of first redeveloped apartment homes coming this summer. Early leasing results are encouraging as we continue to see strong demand. 
We also continued our phased redevelopment of The Sterling with 95% of the 283 completed apartment home leased or rented or underwriting. 
Patty and her team continue to plan her next round of development and as Terry mentions, we are continuing that redevelopment at The Sterling and Palazzo Park La Brea. 
At The Sterling, the final phase of redevelopment included 125 apartment homes on 7 floors and the build out of the retail space. The incremental cost of this work is approximately $22 million. 
We're also moving forward on the continued redevelopment of our Palazzo Park La Brea property in Los Angeles. This base will upgrade 389 apartment homes in accompanying common areas. The incremental investment there is approximately $24 million with Aimco share about $13 million.
During the first quarter, we also invested $15 million in the construction of our One Canal development project in Boston. We anticipate receiving our initial temporary certificate of occupancy for the building within the next few days and our first move-ins are scheduled for mid-May. To-tate, 12% of the 310 apartment homes have been leased and rents there also above underwriting. 
In addition to One Canal, we have 3 other properties [indiscernible] going lease-up Axiom, Vivo and Indigo and when we're on track at each. Our lease-up of Axiom and Vivo, the properties we acquired last year in Cambridge, is progressing well. Axiom, which we acquired in construction completion last April, is now 92% leased and Vivo, which we completed construction on in October is 75% leased. Rents and lease space at both properties are exceeding our underwriting. 
At Indigo, in Redwood City, California, construction continues on plan. We're under contract to purchase this property upon construction completion and anticipate closing the acquisition before our next call. We have commenced leasing in this property and at least 9% of the 463 apartment homes also at rent in excess of our underwriting. 
On the disposition side, we sold One Conventional property during the first quarter for $10 million in gross proceeds. We continue to expect to execute the bulk of our property sales in the second and fourth quarters as we match-fund our planned investment activities. 
And while we don't normally talk about our sales activities prior to closing, many of you are aware that our buyer on River side, Washington REIT, disclosed transaction details on their call yesterday. We can confirm that the details disclosed by them and anticipate closing this transaction during the second quarter. The proceeds from the sale of River die and will complete the funding of our Indigo acquisition.

I will start today with first quarter 2016 results. At $0.51 per share, AFFO was up 11% year-over-year and $0.05 per share ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range.

At $0.51 per share, AFFO was up 11% year-over-year and $0.05 per share ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range. Pro forma FFO of $0.57 per share was up 10% fuel year-over-year $0.03 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range. First quarter AFFO out-performance of $0.05 per share was driven by $0.02 from same-store net operating income out-performance 210 basis points, $0.01 from the timing of income tax-related items and $0.02 from the timing of capital replacement expenses. These positive first quarter results we are increasing full year AFFO and pro forma FFO guidance by $0.01 per share at their respective midpoints. This increase reflects, one, the turnaround of first quarter's $0.03 out-performance related to the timing items I just mentioned and two, the recognition of $0.01 of the first quarter's $0.02 of same-store NOI out-performance. I'd like to be clear here, we do not see slowdown in business compared to our beginning of the year expectations, however, we do prefer to take a conservative approach to raising guidance and until we have more visibility into peak leasing season.
On last night's release, we also established second quarter AFFO guidance of $0.45 to $0.49 per share and pro forma FFO guidance of $0.54 to $0.58 per share. 
Shifting gears to our operations for guidance. We're increasing our same-store NOI growth guidance to a range of 5.5% to 6.5%, an increase of 25 basis points at the midpoint. This increase reflects a 75 basis point decrease in projected operating expense growth. Our guidance for full year same-store revenue growth is unchanged at 4.75% at the midpoint.
With last night's release, we also established guidance for second quarter same-store NOI growth of 3.5% to 4.5%, which is consistent with the expectations we had for the quarter when we started the year. Now we expect to see continued solid rent growth with the year-over-year comparison for the quarter affected by 2 items. 
First, as Keith mentioned, we have undertaken to reduce the number of lease expirations occurring in off-peak months and to drive more leasing volume into peak season where we expect greater pricing power. The increased number of leased expirations will increase virtual vacancy during the second quarter, reducing average daily occupancy by 40 basis points compared to the second quarter 2015 and also increasing turnover expenses. While these costs are expected to be reversed and rewarded in other quarters, in the second quarter, they are expected to reduce year-over-year same-store NOI growth by approximately 100 basis points. 
Second, our second quarter expense growth last year was actually negative as a result of nonroutine items in 2015. So while we expect low expense growth in this year, we also expect faster expense growth in this quarter. 
With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, I'll turn it over to you for the first question."

Business is good. In property operations, same-store rent per apartment home was up 5.1%. The rate of increase is 70 basis points better than the 4.4% growth rate of the first quarter last year. Operating expenses were essentially flat. With higher rents and flat expenses, same-store net operating income was up by more than 7%, beating the high end of guidance by 160 basis points, making for a good quarter and a solid start to the year.
In redevelopment, ongoing projects are on time, on budget and are creating value equal to $0.25 to $0.35 for each dollar invested. Patti and her team are doing a great job, including construction on -- completing construction on the south tower and starting construction on the east tower at Park Towne Place in Center City, Philadelphia as well as adding to our active redevelopments by starting the final phase that completes redevelopment of The Sterling in Center City, Philadelphia and starting a second phase at Palazzo at Park La Brea in Los Angeles.
In portfolio management, first quarter revenue per apartment home was up across the entire Aimco portfolio to more than $1,860, an Aimco record and up 9% year-over-year.
For these good results, I offer sincere congratulations and thanks to my Aimco teammates, both here in Denver and across the country. It's a privilege and a pleasure to work with you. I'm especially proud of your grading Aimco a top workplace in Colorado for a fourth consecutive year.

Pleased to report that we had a solid quarter and operations, with revenues up 4.8% year-over-year, expenses were up 10 basis points year-over-year with net operating income up 7.1% for the quarter.

Pleased to report that we had a solid quarter and operations, with revenues up 4.8% year-over-year, expenses were up 10 basis points year-over-year with net operating income up 7.1% for the quarter. Each of this quarterly metrics are better than the first quarter of last year.
In Q1 of 2016, our residents gave us our 10th consecutive quarter better than a 4-star rating in customer satisfaction. This contributed to renewal rent increases of 6% for the quarter, some 120 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2015.
Of note, renewal premiums increased in each successive month of the quarter. We saw particular strength in the Bay Area, Denver and Atlanta. Renewal rents in these markets increased 8% to 9% compared to the expiring leases.
Whether those leases expired and were not renewed, our new lease pricing outperformed the results from the first quarter of 2015 and for each month of the quarter individually. This resulted in a quarterly increase in new lease rates of 3.5%, 230 basis points better than last year. The year-over-year rate of growth for new leases was strongest in Boston and Los Angeles.
As a result of our team's hard work, our blended lease rate increases of 4.6% were 180 basis points higher than the first quarter of last year and by 100 basis points sequentially, all while increasing average daily occupancy for the quarter by 10 basis points year-over-year and 50 basis points from fourth quarter.
We had another solid quarter on the expense front, growing by 10 basis points overall and 2% when excluding the year-over-year decline in utility expense due to a milder winter.
Turnover for the quarter was 50.9%. Of the customers who decided to move out, 23% were for career moves, 17% did not renew do to price and 14% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these move-out reasons versus recent quarters or on long-term averages.
Our resident quality continues to improve. The average income for those new customers who moved in during the first quarter was $136,000 with a median income of $95,000. Year-over-year, the median income of our new residents was up 19% compared to the first quarter of 2015, with half coming from a more discriminating application process and half from an improvement on our portfolio quality.
Our 12 target markets, which represent 90% of same-store net operating income, had top line revenue growth up 5.2% in the quarter versus 4.8% for the entire portfolio. Our top performers all had revenue increases in double digits from more than 10% to better than 13%. This was led by the Bay Area followed by Seattle and Denver.
Our strong performers, which had revenue growth from nearly 6% to better than 7%, were Boston, San Diego, Atlanta and Greater Los Angeles. Our steady target markets with about 2.5% to 3% revenue growth were Chicago, New York City and Washington, D.C. And finally, with softer revenue growth of around 1%, we had Philadelphia and Miami.
As we look to our April month-to-date results, blended lease rates are up 5%, 10 basis points better than last year. New leases are up 3.6% and renewals are up 6.4%. April's average daily occupancy is at 95.9%, 30 basis points below last year by design.
We've intentionally moved leases from our shoulder months into peak leasing season with higher demand. This improvement in expiration management will pay dividends by repricing leases in periods of greater expected rent growth.
And finally, May and June renewal offers went up with 6% to 8% increases, and with great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco's success.

Today, I'd like to take a few minutes to review our recent investment and portfolio activities.
During the first quarter, we invested $31 million in redevelopment, $9 million of it on our redevelopment pipeline and $22 million at Park Towne Place and The Sterling both located in Center City, Philadelphia.
At Park Towne Place, we completed redevelopment of the south tower and the town center, 91% of the 224 completed apartment homes in the south tower are leased and rents are ahead of underwriting.
Construction is progressing as planned on the east tower with delivery of the first redeveloped apartment homes coming this summer. Early leasing results are encouraging as we continue to see strong demand.
We also continued our phased redevelopment of The Sterling with 95% of the 283 completed apartment homes leased at rents above underwriting.
Patti and her team continue to plan her next round of redevelopments. And as Terry mentioned, we are continuing that redevelopment at The Sterling and Palazzo, Park La Brea.
At The Sterling, the final phase of redevelopment includes 125 apartment homes on 7 floors and the build-out of the retail space. The incremental cost of this work is approximately $22 million.
We're also moving forward on the continued redevelopment of our Palazzo, Park La Brea property in Los Angeles. This space will upgrade 389 apartment homes and the accompanying common areas. The incremental investment there is approximately $24 million, with Aimco share about $13 million.
During the first quarter, we also invested $15 million in the construction of our One Canal development project in Boston. We anticipate receiving our initial temporary certificate of occupancy for the building within the next few days, and our first move-ins are scheduled for mid-May. To date, 12% of the 310 apartment homes have been leased and rents there are also above underwriting.
In addition to One Canal, we have 3 other properties that are going lease-up, Axiom, Vivo and Indigo, and we are on track at each. Our lease-up of Axiom and Vivo, the properties that we acquired last year in Cambridge, is progressing well. Axiom, which we acquired in construction completion last April, is now 92% leased; and Vivo, which we completed construction on in October, is 75% leased. Rents and lease space at both properties are exceeding our underwriting.
At Indigo in Redwood City, California, construction continues on plan. We're under contract to purchase this property upon construction completion and anticipate closing the acquisition before our next call. We had commenced leasing at this property and have leased 9% of the 463 apartment homes also at rents in excess of our underwriting.
On the disposition side, we sold 1 Conventional property during the first quarter for $10 million in gross proceeds. We continue to expect to execute the bulk of our property sales in the second and fourth quarters as we match-fund our planned investment activities.
And while we don't normally talk about our sales activity prior to closing, many of you are aware that our buyer on Riverside, Washington REIT, disclosed transaction details on their call yesterday. We can confirm the details disclosed by them and anticipate closing this transaction during the second quarter. The proceeds from the sale of Riverside will complete the funding of our Indigo acquisition.
And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?"

I will start today with first quarter 2016 results. At $0.51 per share, AFFO was up 11% year-over-year and $0.05 per share ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range. Pro forma FFO of $0.57 per share was up 10% year-over-year and $0.03 ahea",495,"Thanks, John. I will start today with first quarter 2016 results. At $0.51 per share, AFFO was up 11% year-over-year and $0.05 per share ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range. Pro forma FFO of $0.57 per share was up 10% year-over-year and $0.03 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range. First quarter AFFO outperformance of $0.05 per share was driven by $0.02 from same-store net operating income outperformance, 210 basis points; $0.01 from the timing of income tax-related items; and $0.02 from the timing of capital replacements spending expenditures. With these positive first quarter results, we are increasing full year AFFO and pro forma FFO guidance by $0.01 per share at their respective midpoints. This increase reflects, one, the turnaround of first quarter's $0.03 outperformance related to the timing items I just mentioned; and two, the recognition of $0.01 of the first quarter's $0.02 of same-store NOI outperformance.
I'd like to be clear here, we do not see a slowdown in business compared to our beginning of year expectations. However, we do prefer to take a conservative approach to raising guidance and until we have more visibility into peak leasing season.
On last night's release, we also established second quarter AFFO guidance of $0.45 to $0.49 per share and pro forma FFO guidance of $0.54 to $0.58 per share.
Shifting gears to our operations-related guidance. We're increasing our same-store NOI growth guidance to a range of 5.5% to 6.5%, an increase of 25 basis points at the midpoint. This increase reflects a 75 basis point decrease in projected operating expense growth. Our guidance for full year same-store revenue growth is unchanged at 4.75% at the midpoint.
With last night's release, we also established guidance for second quarter same-store NOI growth of 3.5% to 4.5%, which is consistent with the expectations we had for the quarter when we started the year. Now as then, we expect to see continued solid rent growth with the year-over-year comparison for the quarter affected by 2 items. 
First, as Keith mentioned, we have undertaken to reduce the number of lease expirations occurring in off-peak months and to drive more leasing volume into peak season where we expect greater pricing power. The increased number of lease expirations will increase frictional vacancy during the second quarter, reducing average daily occupancy by 40 basis points compared to the second quarter 2015 and also increasing turnover expenses. While these costs are expected to be reversed and rewarded in other quarters, in the second quarter, they are expected to reduce year-over-year same-store NOI growth by approximately 100 basis points.
Second, our second quarter expense growth last year was actually negative as a result of nonroutine items in 2015. So while we expect a low expense growth in this year, we also expect faster expense growth in this quarter.
With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, I'll turn it over to you for the first question."

Business is good. In property operations, same-store rent per apartment home was up 5.1%, the rate of increase 70 basis points better than the 4.4% growth rate of the first quarter last year. Operating expenses were essentially flat. With higher rents and flat expenses, same-store net operating income was up by more than 7%, beating the high end of guidance by 160 basis points, making for a good quarter and a solid start to the year.
In redevelopment, ongoing projects are on time, on budget and are creating value equal to $0.25 to $0.35 for each dollar invested. Patti and her team are doing a great job, including construction on -- completing construction on the south tower and starting construction on the east tower at Park Towne Place in Center City, Philadelphia as well as adding to our active redevelopments by starting the final phase that completes redevelopment of The Sterling in Center City, Philadelphia and starting a second phase at Palazzo at Park La Brea in Los Angeles.
In portfolio management, first quarter revenue per apartment home was up across the entire Aimco portfolio to more than $1,860, an Aimco record and up 9% year-over-year.
For these good results, I offer sincere congratulations and thanks to my Aimco teammates, both here in Denver and across the country. It's a privilege and a pleasure to work with you. I'm especially proud of your grading Aimco a top workplace in Colorado for a fourth consecutive year.

Expenses were up 10 basis points year-over-year with net operating income up 7.1% for the quarter. Each of these quarterly metrics are better than the first quarter of last year.
In Q1 of 2016, our residents gave us our 10th consecutive quarter better than a 4-star rating in customer satisfaction. This contributed to renewal rent increases of 6% for the quarter, some 120 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2015.
Of note, renewal premiums increased in each successive month of the quarter. We saw particular strength in the Bay Area, Denver and Atlanta. Renewal rents in these markets increased 8% to 9% compared to the expiring leases.
Where those leases expired and were not renewed, our new lease pricing outperformed the results from the first quarter of 2015 and for each month of the quarter individually. This resulted in a quarterly increase in new lease rates of 3.5%, 230 basis points better than last year. The year-over-year rate of growth for new leases was strongest in Boston and Los Angeles.
As a result of our team's hard work, our blended lease rate increases of 4.6% were 180 basis points higher than the first quarter of last year and by 100 basis points sequentially, all while increasing average daily occupancy for the quarter by 10 basis points year-over-year and 50 basis points from fourth quarter.
We had another solid quarter on the expense front, growing by 10 basis points overall and 2% when excluding the year-over-year decline in utility expense due to a milder winter.
Turnover for the quarter was 50.9%. Of the customers who decided to move out, 23% were for career moves, 17% did not renew due to price and 14% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these move-out reasons versus recent quarters or our long-term averages.
Our resident quality continues to improve. The average income for those new customers who moved in during the first quarter was $136,000 with a median income of $95,000. Year-over-year, the median income of our new residents was up 19% compared to the first quarter of 2015, with half coming from a more discriminating application process and half from an improvement on our portfolio quality.
Our 12 target markets, which represent 90% of same-store net operating income, had top line revenue growth up 5.2% in the quarter versus 4.8% for the entire portfolio. Our top performers all had revenue increases in double digits from more than 10% to better than 13%. This was led by the Bay Area followed by Seattle and Denver.
Our strong performers, which had revenue growth from nearly 6% to better than 7%, were Boston, San Diego, Atlanta and Greater Los Angeles. Our steady target markets with about 2.5% to 3% revenue growth were Chicago, New York City and Washington, D.C. And finally, with softer revenue growth of around 1%, we had Philadelphia and Miami.
As we look to our April month-to-date results, blended lease rates are up 5%, 10 basis points better than last year. New leases are up 3.6% and renewals are up 6.4%. April's average daily occupancy is at 95.9%, 30 basis points below last year by design.
We've intentionally moved leases from our shoulder months into peak leasing season with higher demand. This improvement in expiration management will pay dividends by repricing leases in periods of greater expected rent growth. And finally, May and June renewal offers went out with 6% to 8% increases.
And with great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco's success, I'll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?"

Today, I'd like to take a few minutes to review our recent investment and portfolio activities.
During the first quarter, we invested $31 million in redevelopment, $9 million of it on our redevelopment pipeline and $22 million at Park Towne Place and The Sterling, both located in Center City, Philadelphia.
At Park Towne Place, we completed redevelopment of the south tower and the town center. 91% of the 224 completed apartment homes in the south tower are leased and rents are ahead of underwriting.
Construction is progressing as planned on the east tower with delivery of the first redeveloped apartment homes coming this summer. Early leasing results are encouraging as we continue to see strong demand.
We also continued our phased redevelopment of The Sterling with 95% of the 283 completed apartment homes leased at rents above underwriting.
Patti and her team continue to plan our next round of redevelopments. And as Terry mentioned, we are continuing that redevelopment at The Sterling and Palazzo, Park La Brea.
At The Sterling, the final phase of redevelopment includes 125 apartment homes on 7 floors and the build-out of the retail space. The incremental cost of this work is approximately $22 million.
We're also moving forward on the continued redevelopment of our Palazzo, Park La Brea property in Los Angeles. This phase will upgrade 389 apartment homes and the accompanying common areas. The incremental investment there is approximately $24 million, with Aimco’s share about $13 million.
During the first quarter, we also invested $16 million in the construction of our One Canal development project in Boston. We anticipate receiving our initial temporary certificate of occupancy for the building within the next few days, and our first move-ins are scheduled for mid-May. To date, 12% of the 310 apartment homes have been leased, and rents there are also above underwriting.
In addition to One Canal, we have 3 other properties that are going lease-up, Axiom, Vivo and Indigo, and we are on track at each. Our lease-up of Axiom and Vivo, the properties that we acquired last year in Cambridge, is progressing well. Axiom, which we acquired in construction completion last April, is now 92% leased; and Vivo, which we completed construction on in October, is 75% leased. Rents and leased space at both properties are exceeding our underwriting.
At Indigo in Redwood City, California, construction continues on plan. We're under contract to purchase this property upon construction completion and anticipate closing the acquisition before our next call. We have commenced leasing at this property and have leased 9% of the 463 apartment homes also at rents in excess of our underwriting.
On the disposition side, we sold 1 Conventional property during the first quarter for $10 million in gross proceeds. We continue to expect to execute the bulk of our property sales in the second and fourth quarters as we match-fund our planned investment activities.
And while we don't normally talk about our sales activity prior to closing, many of you are aware that our buyer on Riverside, Washington REIT, disclosed transaction details on their call yesterday. We can confirm the details as disclosed by them and anticipate closing this transaction during the second quarter. The proceeds from the sale of Riverside will complete the funding of our Indigo acquisition.
And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?"

At $0.51 per share, AFFO was up 11% year-over-year and $0.05 per share ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range. Pro forma FFO of $0.57 per share was up 10% year-over-year and $0.03 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range. First quarter AFFO outperformance of $0.05 per share was driven by $0.02 from same-store net operating income outperformance, 210 basis points; $0.01 from the timing of income tax-related items; and $0.02 from the timing of capital replacements spending expenditures. With these positive first quarter results, we are increasing full year AFFO and pro forma FFO guidance by $0.01 per share at their respective midpoints. This increase reflects, one, the turnaround of first quarter's $0.03 outperformance related to the timing items I just mentioned; and two, the recognition of $0.01 of the first quarter's $0.02 of same-store NOI outperformance.
I'd like to be clear here, we do not see a slowdown in business compared to our beginning of year expectations. However, we do prefer to take a conservative approach to raising guidance and until we have more visibility into peak leasing season.
On last night's release, we also established second quarter AFFO guidance of $0.45 to $0.49 per share and pro forma FFO guidance of $0.54 to $0.58 per share.
Shifting gears to our operations-related guidance. We're increasing our same-store NOI growth guidance to a range of 5.5% to 6.5%, an increase of 25 basis points at the midpoint. This increase reflects a 75 basis point decrease in projected operating expense growth. Our guidance for full year same-store revenue growth is unchanged at 4.75% at the midpoint.
With last night's release, we also established guidance for second quarter same-store NOI growth of 3.5% to 4.5%, which is consistent with the expectations we had for the quarter when we started the year. Now as then, we expect to see continued solid rent growth with the year-over-year comparison for the quarter affected by 2 items. 
First, as Keith mentioned, we have undertaken to reduce the number of lease expirations occurring in off-peak months and to drive more leasing volume into peak season where we expect greater pricing power. The increased number of lease expirations will increase frictional vacancy during the second quarter, reducing average daily occupancy by 40 basis points compared to the second quarter 2015 and also increasing turnover expenses. While these costs are expected to be reversed and rewarded in other quarters, in the second quarter, they are expected to reduce year-over-year same-store NOI growth by approximately 100 basis points.
Second, our second quarter expense growth last year was actually negative as a result of nonroutine items in 2015. So while we expect a low expense growth in this year, we also expect faster expense growth in this quarter.
With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, I'll turn it over to you for the first question."

And so what I'd tell you is in January of this year and at the end of last year, when I was getting the team together, we had a very focused effort on -- that the peak season is going to come earlier, how are we going to staff up. And it's not just our own staffing, it's vendors, it's a variety of other folks in which we get well prepared so that we could really take advantage of it and not be in a position that it seems like you're caught off guard but, in fact, it's all by plan and by design."

We appreciate your interest in Aimco. Aimco portfolio diversification across markets and price points is serving us well.

Aimco portfolio diversification across markets and price points is serving us well. Business remains good and on plan, notwithstanding the predictable ebb and flow of various local markets. We hear a lot of questions about the direction of apartment markets. Are markets accelerating based on demographic demand? Or are they decelerating under the pressure of new supply? We believe that both questions can be answered with a yes. On the one hand, demographic demand is historically strong, predictably so and will be strengthened for many years to come by baby boomers increasing their preference for rental housing. On the other hand, all markets will be overbuilt at some point, meaning that competitive new supply will limit or even reverse rent growth, but not all markets will be overbuilt at the same time, and where there is oversupply, it will have its greatest impact on properties with the highest rents. And that's why we emphasize diversification by market and by price point as the foundation of Aimco portfolio strategy. The nature of a diversified portfolio is that there are generally some markets accelerating and some decelerating, that's true for Aimco today, as Keith will discussed further in his remarks. We expect that portfolio diversification will make Aimco revenue more predictable and less volatile. 
Here are 4 headlines for the Aimco's second quarter:
First, Property Operations are on track. Same-store rent per apartment home was up 5.3%, a rate of increase 100 basis points greater than in the same quarter 1 year ago. After increased frictional vacancy due to transferring lease expirations from our shoulder quarters to our leasing season, that contributed about a 20% increase in lease expirations in the second quarter. And after reduced utility reimbursements due to milder weather and lower energy costs, same-store revenue was up 4.2% year-over-year. These results are consistent with our plan, and given outperformance in the first quarter, make us confident that we will meet our same-store guidance for the full year, which you will recall, we increased at the end of the first quarter. I'm also delighted to report that Keith and his team are on track with lease up efforts at One Canal in Boston and Indigo in Redwood City. 
Second headline. Redevelopment value creation continues. Current redevelopment projects are on track to create value comfortably in excess of our benchmark expectation, that each $1 redevelopment spending will become worth $1.30 or more. Work continues on 2 multiyear projects in Center City, Philadelphia and construction started on the next phase of redevelopment of The Palazzo in Los Angeles. In Boston, we have substantially completed construction of One Canal. 
Our third headline. Aimco portfolio quality reaches a new high. In portfolio management, we continue to sell our lowest rated properties and reinvest the proceeds and properties with higher rents and better prospects. Second quarter revenue per apartment home across the entire Aimco portfolio increased by 8% year-over-year to a new record $1,900 a month. 
And fourth headline. Aimco beat guidance for the second quarter and raised its guidance for the full year, just as we did following the first quarter. 
For these good results, I offer sincere thanks to my Aimco teammates, here in Denver as well as across the country. It's a privilege and a pleasure to work with you. 
And now, for a more detailed report on second quarter operations, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?"
336458,369074243,1017583,"Apartment Investment and Management Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Apartment Income REIT Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Terry. As previously discussed, we succeeded in moving 1,200 of our lease expirations out of the softer shoulder months and into the stronger second quarter.

As previously discussed, we succeeded in moving 1,200 of our lease expirations out of the softer shoulder months and into the stronger second quarter. Our strategy increased our total second quarter expirations by design by roughly 20%. This was executed so that we have greater revenue growth opportunity in the long term and seasonably higher demand periods at significantly improved rates, understanding the frictional vacancy would increase in the short term. 
Operationally, we navigated through those additional expiring leases while staying on plan. We delivered rent growth of 5.3% and revenue growth of 4.2% year-over-year. Expenses, less taxes and insurance, were up 2.3%. We feel good about our strategy and the ability to deliver our revenue commitment for the balance of the year. 
While we've seen supply pressure in places like Miami, Los Angeles, and to a lesser extent, the Bay Area, we enjoy the benefit of a diversified portfolio from both the geographic perspective and at varying price points. The benefit of this, while some markets moderated, our second quarter results were aided by accelerating markets, including Washington DC, Boston and Chicago. Our 12 markets comprised about 90% of our same-store revenues. Using blended lease rate growth for the quarter, roughly 45% of our target markets accelerated, 45% decelerated, with the remainder about flat on a weighted basis. 
In the second quarter of 2016, our residents gave us our 11th consecutive quarter of better than a 4-star rating in customer satisfaction. This contributed to our renewal rent increases of 6.2% for the quarter, some 110 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2015. We saw particular strength in Seattle, the Bay Area and Denver. Renewal rents in these markets increased between 9% and 14% compared to the expiring leases. While those leases expired and were not renewed, our new lease pricing accelerated in each successive month of the quarter. This resulted in a quarterly increase in new lease rates of 4.4%. The year-over-year rate of growth for new leases was strongest in Seattle, Boston, San Diego and the Bay Area, ranging between 8% and 19%. 
As a result of our team's hard work, our blended lease rate increases of 5.3% were 70 basis points higher than the first quarter of this year, all while maintaining a relatively flat average daily occupancy. Turnover for the quarter was better year-over-year at 49.3%, despite the significant increase in expiring leases. Of the customers who decided to move out, 26% were for career moves, 19% did not renew due to price and 15% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these moveout reasons versus recent quarters or our long-term averages. 
Our resident quality continues to improve. The average incomes of those new customers who moved in during the second quarter was $140,000 with a median income of $95,000. Year-over-year, the median income of our new residents was up 6% compared to the second quarter of 2015. 
Our 12 target markets had revenue growth up 4.5% in the second quarter versus 4.2% for the entire portfolio. Our top performers had revenue increases from more than 8% to better than 11%. This was led by the Bay Area, followed by Seattle, Denver and Atlanta. Our strong performance, which had revenue growth from almost 5% to better than 6% were San Diego, Boston, New York and greater Los Angeles. Our steady target markets with about 2% to 3% revenue growth were Chicago, Washington DC and Philadelphia. And, finally, pushing out about flat year-over-year, we had Miami. 
While not yet complete, our July month to date results have blended lease rates up 4.9%. New leases up 4% and renewals up 5.8%. July's average daily occupancy is at 95.4%, roughly equal to that of July of 2015, despite having 300 more expiring leases year-over-year, we're intentionally moved leases from our shoulder months into peak leasing season. And finally, August and September renewal offers went out with 6% to 8% increases. 
And with great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco's success, I'll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?"

During the second quarter, we continued to focus our investment activities on upgrading our portfolio through redevelopment development and other capital investments. We invested $43 million in redevelopment, $31 million in Park Towne Place in Sterling and Philadelphia and an additional $12 million in several smaller projects and our redevelopment pipeline. 
At Park Towne Place, we achieved stabilized occupancy at the recently completed South Tower. We are making good progress in construction on the East Tower, which is now 70 47% leased. And with these successes, we approved spending another $41 million to redevelop the North Tower. 
We also continued our phased redevelopment in The Sterling. Of the 409 completed apartment homes, 81% are leased, and rents are above underwriting. During the second quarter, Aimco approved the final phase of redevelopment of The Sterling, which includes the remaining 125 apartment homes, commercial and retail buildout and completion of the streetscape. The estimated investment for this final phase is $22 million. 
Also during the second quarter, Aimco approved the next phase of redevelopment of The Palazzo, a 521 home community located in the mid-Wilshire district of Los Angeles. This next phase includes the renovation of 389 apartment homes on the first 3 floors of the community. Construction started in June and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2018. The Palazzo is owned through a joint venture in which Aimco has an approximate 53% interest. The total estimated investment in this phase is $25 million, of which Aimco shares $13 million. 
During the second quarter, we also invested $13 million in the construction of our One Canal development project in Boston. As Terry mentioned, construction is largely complete, with just a few finishing touches in progress. Our first residents moved in mid-May and 41% of the apartment homes are currently leased at rents above underwriting. 100% of the commercial space at One Canal is leased by a single retail tenant within the process of obtaining the required permits. 
In addition to One Canal, we have 3 other properties at varying stages of lease up, Indigo, Axiom and Vivo. At Indigo, in Redwood City California, the developers secured the TCO for the property in late June and the first residents moved in July 1. The property is 21% leased today and went ahead of our underwriting. We will purchase the property upon construction completion which we anticipate will occur by the end of the third quarter. 
Our lease up of Axiom and Vivo, the properties we acquired last year in Kendall Square in Cambridge are now complete. Those properties reached 95% occupancy earlier this month, with rents and leased space both better than our initial underwriting. 
On the disposition side of the business, the market remains robust. In accordance with plan, we sold 2 Conventional properties during the second quarter for $292 million in gross proceeds, and we expect to meet our disposition guidance for the year. Revenues per apartment home for the property sold in the second quarter averaged just over $1,500, about 20% below the average of our retained portfolio. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?"

Starting with second quarter 2016 results, at $0.50 per share, AFFO was up 9% year-over-year and $0.03 per share ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range. Pro forma FFO at $0.59 per share was up 5% year-over-year and was also $0.03 per sh",528,"Thanks, John. Starting with second quarter 2016 results, at $0.50 per share, AFFO was up 9% year-over-year and $0.03 per share ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range. Pro forma FFO at $0.59 per share was up 5% year-over-year and was also $0.03 per share above the midpoint of guidance. Second quarter AFFO outperformance was driven by a greater than planned noncore earnings, including $0.01 related to a transaction that was originally expected to occur in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to the balance sheet. The property debt market remains deep and liquid. During the quarter, we took advantage of declining treasury rates and compressing spreads, pricing 2 fixed rate amortizing, nonrecourse property loans with 10 year terms. The first for $145 million, priced at a spread to treasuries of approximately 150 basis points with an all in interest rate of 3.34%. 
The second were $21.5 million, priced at a spread of 129 basis points for an all in rate of 2.77%. 
Additionally, we reduced our overall cost of leverage by redeeming today our 7% series Z issue of preferred stock. We are well positioned to take advantage of today's uncertain interest rate environment. If interest rates remain low, earnings will benefit as we refinance maturities with weighted average interest rates of approximately 5% at expected lower rates. If rates increase, our long-duration fixed-rate debt, with a 7.8-year weighted average maturity, will mitigate the financial impact and provide a hedge should cap rates rise. 
Now, looking forward to the remainder of the year. We're increasing full year pro forma FFO and AFFO guidance for the $0.02 of non-timing related second quarter outperformance, offset by $0.01 reduction due to the decision to vacate the North Tower at Park Towne Place as we accelerate its redevelopment time line. 
After our second guidance raise this year, full year AFFO and pro forma FFO guidance is now $0.02 per share higher than our expectation at the beginning of the year. 
In yesterday's release, we also established third quarter AFFO guidance of $0.43 to $0.47 per share and pro forma FFO guidance of $0.52 to $0.56 per share. 
Shifting gears to operational guidance. With second quarter results meeting our expectations and a consistent outlook for the remainder of the year, our expectation of same-store revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% remains unchanged. Underpinning our guidance at the midpoint is an expectation of 5% revenue growth in the second half of 2016. With strong rate growth already embedded in our in place leases and expectations for continued above trend demand, 5% revenue growth appears to be achievable. 
We also confirmed our expectation of 1.75% to 2.25% expense growth and NOI growth of 5.5% to 6.5% for the full year. With this release, we also established guidance for the third quarter same-store NOI growth of 5.5% to 6.5% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. This is in line with the expectations we have for the quarter at the start of the year. 
With that, we will now open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to 2 per time the queue. Laura, turn it over to you for the first question."

As we noted in my comments, they got TCO on the units of the building or partial TCO for the finished units at the building at the end of June. First occupancies first move-ins were literally July 1. We have, today, accepted about 1/3 of the units in the building. So it's still an active construction. So the amenities were mostly completed about a week ago, but they're not all done. We're not in the leasing office yet. And so this is still a building very much under construction. And so between leasing pace and tightening of closing, really, this is driven by the completion of the building, which we anticipate will occur again some time before the end of the quarter, this third quarter."

As you all know, our ability to grow revenue is dependent upon 3, 3 factors. First, as you're asking your question, Nick, is occupancy. The second impact relates to the revenue growth that's already embedded in our rent roll today. And the third is the impact of new and renewable leases that are transacted during the second half of the year. And so as we think about occupancy growth, in the third quarter, we expect that occupancy will be fairly similar to 2015, but because of the positive impact that we expect to see from our lease expiration management, we expect a bump-up in occupancy in the fourth quarter. Then the second factor I mentioned is the growth embedded in our rent roll. Within our rent roll today, we probably have about 75% to 80% of our revenue baked in for the second half of the year. And those -- that amount that's baked in is at a rate that's right around 5%. And so then the last major component relates to the transacted rate that we expect to see for the second half of the year. And so in order to hit the midpoint of our guidance, we'd have to see transacted rates probably in the mid-to upper 4 ranges. And so based upon a 5% transacted rate growth year-to-date, that seems to be quite achievable."

We continue to see occupancy north of 95% at Lincoln Place, and we really attribute it to the fact that it is such a unique product, where you have open space between units, setbacks for a couple of hundred feet from the sidewalk with open grass spaces and, of course, the unique architecture and styling of the buildings. And so we have weathered that a little bit differently than we have seen within the marketplace. In addition to that, we continue to see that rents continue to push higher than what we're seeing in the overall LA market."

Aimco portfolio diversification across markets and price points is serving us well. Business remains good and on plan, notwithstanding the predictable ebb and flow of various local markets. We hear a lot of questions about the direction of apartment markets. Are markets accelerating based on demographic demand? Or are they decelerating under the pressure of new supply? We believe that both questions can be answered with a yes. On the one hand, demographic demand is historically strong, predictably so, and will be strengthened for many years to come by baby boomers increasing their preference for rental housing. On the other hand, all markets will be overbuilt at some point, meaning that competitive new supply will limit or even reverse rent growth, but not all markets will be overbuilt at the same time, and where there is oversupply, it will have its greatest impact on properties with the highest rents. And that's why we emphasize diversification by market and by price point as the foundation of the Aimco portfolio strategy. The nature of a diversified portfolio is that there are generally some markets accelerating and some decelerating. That's true for Aimco today, as Keith will discuss further in his remarks. We expect that portfolio diversification will make Aimco revenue more predictable and less volatile.
Here are 4 headlines for the Aimco's second quarter:
first, property operations are on track. Same-store rent per apartment home was up 5.3%, a rate of increase 100 basis points greater than in the same quarter 1 year ago. After increased frictional vacancy due to transferring lease expirations from our shoulder quarters to our leasing season, that contributed about a 20% increase in lease expirations in the second quarter. And after reduced utility reimbursements due to milder weather and lower energy costs, same-store revenue was up 4.2% year-over-year. These results are consistent with our plan, and given outperformance in the first quarter, make us confident that we will meet our same-store guidance for the full year, which, you will recall, we increased at the end of the first quarter. I'm also delighted to report that Keith and his team are on track with lease-up efforts at One Canal in Boston and Indigo in Redwood City.
Second headline. Redevelopment and value creation continues. Current redevelopment projects are on track to create value comfortably in excess of our benchmark expectation that each $1 redevelopment spending will become worth $1.30 or more. Work continues on 2 multiyear projects in Center City, Philadelphia and construction started on the next phase of redevelopment at the Palazzo in Los Angeles. In Boston, we have substantially completed construction of One Canal.
Our third headline. Aimco portfolio quality reaches a new high. In portfolio management, we continue to sell our lowest rated properties and reinvest the proceeds and properties with higher rents and better prospects. Second quarter revenue per apartment home across the entire Aimco portfolio increased by 8% year-over-year to a new record $1,900 a month.
And the fourth headline. Aimco beat guidance for the second quarter and raised its guidance for the full year, just as we did following the first quarter.
For these good results, I offer sincere thanks to my Aimco teammates, both here in Denver as well as across the country. It's a privilege and a pleasure to work with you.
And now for a more detailed report on second quarter operations, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?"

As previously discussed, we succeeded in moving 1,200 of our lease expirations out of the softer shoulder months and into the stronger second quarter. Our strategy increased our total second quarter expirations by design by roughly 20%. This was executed so that we have greater revenue growth opportunity in the long term and seasonably higher demand periods at significantly improved rates, understanding the frictional vacancy would increase in the short term.
Operationally, we navigated through those additional expiring leases while staying on plan. We delivered rent growth of 5.3% and revenue growth of 4.2% year-over-year. Expenses, less taxes and insurance, were up 2.3%. We feel good about our strategy and the ability to deliver our revenue commitment for the balance of the year.
While we've seen supply pressure in places like Miami, Los Angeles and to a lesser extent, the Bay Area, we enjoy the benefit of a diversified portfolio from both a geographic perspective and at varying price points. The benefit of this, while some markets moderated, our second quarter results were aided by accelerating markets, including Washington DC, Boston and Chicago. Our 12 target markets comprise about 90% of our same-store revenues. Using blended lease rate growth for the quarter, roughly 45% of our target markets accelerated, 45% decelerated, with the remainder about flat on a weighted basis.
In the second quarter of 2016, our residents gave us our 11th consecutive quarter of better than a 4-star rating in customer satisfaction. This contributed to our renewal rent increases of 6.2% for the quarter, some 110 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2015. We saw particular strength in Seattle, the Bay Area and Denver. Renewal rents in these markets increased between 9% and 14% compared to the expiring leases. While those leases expired and were not renewed, our new lease pricing accelerated in each successive month of the quarter. This resulted in quarterly increase in new lease rates of 4.4%. The year-over-year rate of growth for new leases was strongest in Seattle, Boston, San Diego and the Bay Area, ranging between 8% and 19%.
As a result of our team's hard work, our blended lease rate increases of 5.3% were 70 basis points higher than the first quarter of this year, all while maintaining a relatively flat average daily occupancy. Turnover for the quarter was better year-over-year at 49.3%, despite the significant increase in expiring leases. Of the customers who decided to move out, 26% were for career moves, 19% did not renew due to price and 15% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these moveout reasons versus recent quarters or our long-term averages.
Our resident quality continues to improve. The average incomes of those new customers who moved in during the second quarter was $140,000 with a median income of $95,000. Year-over-year, the median income of our new residents was up 6% compared to the second quarter of 2015.
Our 12 target markets had revenue growth up 4.5% in the second quarter versus 4.2% for the entire portfolio. Our top performers had revenue increases from more than 8% to better than 11%. This was led by the Bay Area, followed by Seattle, Denver and Atlanta. Our strong performers, which had revenue growth from almost 5% to better than 6%, were San Diego, Boston, New York and Greater Los Angeles. Our steady target markets with about 2% to 3% revenue growth were Chicago, Washington DC and Philadelphia. And finally, pushing out about flat year-over-year, we had Miami.
While not yet complete, our July month-to-date results had blended lease rates up 4.9%, new leases up 4% and renewals up 5.8%. July's average daily occupancy is at 95.4%, roughly equal to that of July of 2015, despite having 300 more expiring leases year-over-year where we intentionally move leases from our shoulder months and into peak leasing season. And finally, August and September renewal offers went out with 6% to 8% increases.
And with great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco's success, I'll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?"

During the second quarter, we continued to focus our investment activities on upgrading our portfolio through redevelopment, development and other capital investments. We invested $43 million in redevelopment, $31 million in added Park Towne Place and The Sterling in Philadelphia and an additional $12 million in several smaller projects and/or redevelopment pipeline.
At Park Towne Place, we achieved stabilized occupancy at the recently completed South Tower. We're making good progress in construction on the East Tower, which is now 70 -- 47% leased. And with these successes, we approved spending another $41 million to redevelop the North Tower.
We also continued our phased redevelopment of The Sterling. Of the 409 completed apartment homes, 81% are leased and rents are above underwriting. During the second quarter, Aimco approved the final phase of redevelopment of The Sterling, which includes the remaining 125 apartment homes, commercial and retail buildout and completion of the streetscape. The estimated investment for this final phase is $22 million.
Also during the second quarter, Aimco approved the next phase of redevelopment of The Palazzo, a 521 home community located in the Mid-Wilshire district of Los Angeles. This next phase includes the renovation of 389 apartment homes on the first 3 floors of the community. Construction started in June and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2018. The Palazzo is owned through a joint venture in which Aimco has an approximate 53% interest. The total estimated investment in this phase is $25 million, of which Aimco shares $13 million.
During the second quarter, we also invested $13 million in the construction of our One Canal development project in Boston. As Terry mentioned, construction is largely complete with just a few finishing touches in progress. Our first residents moved in mid-May, and 41% of the apartment homes are currently leased at rents above underwriting. And 100% of the commercial space at One Canal is leased by a single retail tenant who is in the process of obtaining the required permits.
In addition to One Canal, we have 3 other properties at varying stages of lease-up, Indigo, Axiom and Vivo. At Indigo, in Redwood City California, the developers secured the TCO for the property in late June and the first residents moved in July 1. The property is 21% leased today at rents ahead of our underwriting. We will purchase the property upon construction completion, which we anticipate will occur by the end of the third quarter.
Our lease-ups of Axiom and Vivo, the properties we acquired last year in Kendall Square in Cambridge, are now complete. Both properties reached 95% occupancy earlier this month with rents and leased space both better than our initial underwriting.
On the disposition side of the business, the market remains robust. In accordance with plan, we sold 2 Conventional properties during the second quarter for $292 million in gross proceeds, and we expect to meet our dispositions guidance for the year. Revenues per apartment home for the property sold in the second quarter averaged just over $1,500, about 20% below the average of our retained portfolio.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?"

At $0.50 per share, AFFO was up 9% year-over-year and $0.03 per share ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range. Pro forma FFO of $0.59 per share was up 5% year-over-year and was also $0.03 per share above the midpoint of guidance. Second quarter AFFO outperformance was driven by a greater than planned noncore earnings, including $0.01 related to a transaction that was originally expected to occur in the fourth quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. The property debt market remains deep and liquid. During the quarter, we took advantage of declining treasury rates and compressing spreads, pricing 2 fixed rate amortizing, nonrecourse property loans with 10-year terms. The first for $145 million, priced at a spread to treasuries of approximately 150 basis points with an all in interest rate of 3.34%. The second for $21.5 million, priced at a spread of 129 basis points for an all in rate of 2.77%.
Additionally, we reduced our overall cost of leverage by redeeming today our 7% series Z issue of preferred stock. We are well positioned to take advantage of today's uncertain interest rate environment. If interest rates remain low, earnings will benefit as we refinance maturities with weighted average interest rates of approximately 5% at expected lower rates. If rates increase, our long-duration fixed-rate debt with a 7.8-year weighted average maturity will mitigate the financial impact and provide a hedge should cap rates rise.
Now looking forward to the remainder of the year. We're increasing full year pro forma FFO and AFFO guidance for the $0.02 of non-timing related second quarter outperformance, offset by $0.01 reduction due to the decision to vacate the North Tower at Park Towne Place as we accelerate its redevelopment time line.
After our second guidance raise this year, full year AFFO and pro forma FFO guidance is now $0.02 per share higher than our expectation at the beginning of the year.
In yesterday's release, we also established third quarter AFFO guidance of $0.43 to $0.47 per share and pro forma FFO guidance of $0.52 to $0.56 per share.
Shifting gears to operational guidance. With second quarter results meeting our expectations and a consistent outlook for the remainder of the year, our expectation of same-store revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% remains unchanged. Underpinning our guidance at the midpoint is an expectation of 5% revenue growth in the second half of 2016. With strong rent growth already embedded in our in-place leases and expectations for continued above trend demand, 5% revenue growth appears to be achievable.
We also confirmed our expectation of 1.75% to 2.25% expense growth and NOI growth of 5.5% to 6.5% for the full year. With yesterday's release, we also established guidance for third quarter same-store NOI growth of 5.5% to 6.5% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. This is in line with the expectations we had for the quarter at the start of the year.
With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Laura, I'll turn it over to you for the first question."

The developer and the contractor just ran a little slower than what they initially thought they were going to for delivery. As we noted in my comments, they got TCO on the units of the building -- or partial TCO for the finished units of the building at the end of June. First occupancies -- first move-ins were literally July 1. We have, today, accepted about 1/3 of the units in the building. So it's still an active construction zone. The amenities were mostly completed about a week ago, but they're not all done. We're not in the leasing office yet. And so this is still a building very much under construction. And so between leasing pace and timing of closing, really, this is driven by the completion of the building, which we anticipate will occur again some time before the end of the quarter -- this third quarter."

As you all know, our ability to grow revenue is dependent upon 3 factors. First, as you asked in your question, Nick, is occupancy. The second impact relates to the revenue growth that's already embedded in our rent roll today. And the third is the impact of new and renewable leases that are transacted during the second half of the year. And so as we think about occupancy growth, in the third quarter, we expect that occupancy will be fairly similar to 2015, but because of the positive impact that we expect to see from our lease expiration management, we expect a bump-up in occupancy in the fourth quarter. Then -- the second factor I mentioned is the growth embedded in our rent roll. Within our rent roll today, we probably have about 75% to 80% of our revenue baked in for the second half of the year. And those -- that amount that's baked in is at a rate that's right around 5%. And so then the last major component relates to the transacted rates that we expect to see for the second half of the year. And so in order to hit the midpoint of our guidance, we'd have to see transacted rates probably in the mid- to upper 4 ranges. And so based upon a 5% transacted rate growth year-to-date, that seems to be quite achievable."

Aimco portfolio diversification across markets and price points is serving us well. Business remains good and on plan, notwithstanding the predictable ebb and flow of various local markets. We hear a lot of questions about the direction of apartment markets. Are markets accelerating based on demographic demand? Or are they decelerating under the pressure of new supply? We believe that both questions can be answered with a yes. On the one hand, demographic demand is historically strong, predictably so, and will be strengthened for many years to come by baby boomers increasing their preference for rental housing. On the other hand, all markets will be overbuilt at some point, meaning that competitive new supply will limit or even reverse rent growth. But not all markets will be overbuilt at the same time, and where there is oversupply, it will have its greatest impact on properties with the highest rents. And that's why we emphasize diversification by market and by price point as the foundation of the Aimco portfolio strategy. The nature of a diversified portfolio is that there are generally some markets accelerating and some decelerating. That's true for Aimco today, as Keith will discuss further in his remarks. We expect that portfolio diversification will make Aimco revenue more predictable and less volatile.
Here are 4 headlines for the Aimco second quarter: First, property operations are on track. Same-store rent per apartment home was up 5.3%, a rate of increase 100 basis points greater than in the same quarter 1 year ago. After increased frictional vacancy due to transferring lease expirations from our shoulder quarters to our leasing season, that contributed about a 20% increase in lease expirations in the second quarter. And after reduced utility reimbursements due to milder weather and lower energy costs, same-store revenue was up 4.2% year-over-year. These results are consistent with our plan, and given outperformance in the first quarter, make us confident that we will meet our same-store guidance for the full year, which, you will recall, we increased at the end of the first quarter. I'm also delighted to report that Keith and his team are on track with lease-up efforts at One Canal in Boston and Indigo in Redwood City.
Second headline. Redevelopment and value creation continues. Current redevelopment projects are on track to create value comfortably in excess of our benchmark expectation that each $1 redevelopment spending will become worth $1.30 or more. Work continues on 2 multiyear projects in Center City, Philadelphia and construction started on the next phase of redevelopment at the Palazzo in Los Angeles. In Boston, we have substantially completed construction of One Canal.
Our third headline. Aimco portfolio quality reaches a new high. In portfolio management, we continue to sell our lowest rated properties and reinvest the proceeds in properties with higher rents and better prospects. Second quarter revenue per apartment home across the entire Aimco portfolio increased by 8% year-over-year to a new record $1,900 a month. And the fourth headline. Aimco beat guidance for the second quarter and raised its guidance for the full year, just as we did following the first quarter. For these good results, I offer sincere thanks to my Aimco teammates, both here in Denver as well as across the country. It's a privilege and a pleasure to work with you.
And now for a more detailed report on second quarter operations, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?"
336458,369074243,1018139,"Apartment Investment and Management Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Apartment Income REIT Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Terry.

As previously discussed, we succeeded in moving 1,200 of our lease expirations out of the softer shoulder months and into the stronger second quarter. Our strategy increased our total second quarter expirations by design by roughly 20%. This was executed so that we have greater revenue growth opportunity in the long term and seasonably higher demand periods at significantly improved rates, understanding the frictional vacancy would increase in the short term. Operationally, we navigated through those additional expiring leases while staying on plan. We delivered rent growth of 5.3% and revenue growth of 4.2% year-over-year. Expenses, less taxes and insurance, were up 2.3%. We feel good about our strategy and the ability to deliver our revenue commitment for the balance of the year.
While we've seen supply pressure in places like Miami, Los Angeles and to a lesser extent, the Bay Area, we enjoy the benefit of a diversified portfolio from both a geographic perspective and at varying price points. The benefit of this, while some markets moderated, our second quarter results were aided by accelerating markets, including Washington DC, Boston and Chicago. Our 12 target markets comprise about 90% of our same-store revenues. Using blended lease rate growth for the quarter, roughly 45% of our target markets accelerated, 45% decelerated, with the remainder about flat on a weighted basis.
In the second quarter of 2016, our residents gave us our 11th consecutive quarter of better than a 4-star rating in customer satisfaction. This contributed to our renewal rent increases of 6.2% for the quarter, some 110 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2015. We saw particular strength in Seattle, the Bay Area and Denver. Renewal rents in these markets increased between 9% and 14% compared to the expiring leases. Where those leases expired and were not renewed, our new lease pricing accelerated in each successive month of the quarter. This resulted in quarterly increase in new lease rates of 4.4%. The year-over-year rate of growth for new leases was strongest in Seattle, Boston, San Diego and the Bay Area, ranging between 8% and 19%.
As a result of our team's hard work, our blended lease rate increases of 5.3% were 70 basis points higher than the first quarter of this year, all while maintaining a relatively flat average daily occupancy. Turnover for the quarter was better year-over-year at 49.3%, despite the significant increase in expiring leases. Of the customers who decided to move out, 26% were for career moves, 19% did not renew due to price and 15% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these move out reasons versus recent quarters or our long-term averages. Our resident quality continues to improve. The average incomes of those new customers who moved in during the second quarter was $140,000 with a median income of $95,000. Year-over-year, the median income of our new residents was up 6% compared to the second quarter of 2015.
Our 12 target markets had revenue growth up 4.5% in the second quarter versus 4.2% for the entire portfolio. Our top performers had revenue increases from more than 8% to better than 11%. This was led by the Bay Area, followed by Seattle, Denver and Atlanta. Our strong performers, which had revenue growth from almost 5% to better than 6%, were San Diego, Boston, New York and Greater Los Angeles. Our steady target markets with about 2% to 3% revenue growth were Chicago, Washington DC and Philadelphia. And finally, pushing out about flat year-over-year, we had Miami.
While not yet complete, our July month-to-date results have blended lease rates up 4.9%, new leases up 4% and renewals up 5.8%. July's average daily occupancy is at 95.4%, roughly equal to that of July of 2015, despite having 300 more expiring leases year-over-year where we intentionally move leases from our shoulder months and into peak leasing season. And finally, August and September renewal offers went out with 6% to 8% increases.
And with great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco's success, I'll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?"

During the second quarter, we continued to focus our investment activities on upgrading our portfolio through redevelopment, development and other capital investments. We invested $43 million in redevelopment, $31 million in added Park Towne Place and The Sterling in Philadelphia and an additional $12 million in several smaller projects and/or redevelopment pipeline.
At Park Towne Place, we achieved stabilized occupancy at the recently completed South Tower. We're making good progress in construction on the East Tower, which is now 70 -- 47% leased. And with these successes, we approved spending another $41 million to redevelop the North Tower. We also continued our phased redevelopment of The Sterling. Of the 409 completed apartment homes, 81% are leased and rents are above underwriting. During the second quarter, Aimco approved the final phase of redevelopment of The Sterling, which includes the remaining 125 apartment homes, commercial and retail buildouts and completion of the streetscape. The estimated investment for this final phase is $22 million.
Also during the second quarter, Aimco approved the next phase of redevelopment of The Palazzo, a 521 home community located in the Mid-Wilshire district of Los Angeles. This next phase includes the renovation of 389 apartment homes on the first 3 floors of the community. Construction started in June and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2018. The Palazzo is owned through a joint venture in which Aimco has an approximate 53% interest. The total estimated investment in this phase is $25 million, of which Aimco's share is $13 million.
During the second quarter, we also invested $13 million in the construction of our One Canal development project in Boston. As Terry mentioned, construction is largely complete with just a few finishing touches in progress. Our first residents moved in mid-May, and 41% of the apartment homes are currently leased at rents above underwriting. And 100% of the commercial space at One Canal is leased by a single retail tenant who is in the process of obtaining the required permits.
In addition to One Canal, we have 3 other properties at varying stages of lease-up, Indigo, Axiom and Vivo. At Indigo, in Redwood City California, the developers secured the TCO for the property in late June and the first residents moved in July 1. The property is 21% leased today at rents ahead of our underwriting. We will purchase the property upon construction completion, which we anticipate will occur by the end of the third quarter. Our lease-ups of Axiom and Vivo, the properties we acquired last year in Kendall Square in Cambridge, are now complete. Both properties reached 95% occupancy earlier this month with rents and leased space both better than our initial underwriting.
On the disposition side of the business, the market remains robust. In accordance with plan, we sold 2 Conventional properties during the second quarter for $292 million in gross proceeds, and we expect to meet our dispositions guidance for the year. Revenues per apartment home for the properties sold in the second quarter averaged just over $1,500, about 20% below the average of our retained portfolio.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?"

At $0.50 per share, AFFO was up 9% year-over-year and $0.03 per share ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range. Pro forma FFO of $0.59 per share was up 5% year-over-year and was also $0.03 per share above the midpoint of guidance. Second quarter AFFO outperformance was driven by greater than planned noncore earnings, including $0.01 related to a transaction that was originally expected to occur in the fourth quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. The property debt market remains deep and liquid. During the quarter, we took advantage of declining treasury rates and compressing spreads, pricing 2 fixed rate amortizing, nonrecourse property loans with 10-year terms. The first for $145 million, priced at a spread to treasuries of approximately 150 basis points with an all-in interest rate of 3.34%. The second for $21.5 million, priced at a spread of 129 basis points for an all-in rate of 2.77%.
Additionally, we reduced our overall cost of leverage by redeeming today our 7% series Z issue of preferred stock. We are well positioned to take advantage of today's uncertain interest rate environment. If interest rates remain low, earnings will benefit as we refinance maturities with weighted average interest rates of approximately 5% at expected lower rates. If rates increase, our long-duration fixed-rate debt with a 7.8-year weighted average maturity will mitigate the financial impact and provide a hedge should cap rates rise.
Now looking forward to the remainder of the year. We are increasing full year pro forma FFO and AFFO guidance for the $0.02 of non-timing related second quarter outperformance, offset by $0.01 reduction due to the decision to vacate the North Tower at Park Towne Place as we accelerate its redevelopment time line. After our second guidance raise this year, full year AFFO and pro forma FFO guidance is now $0.02 per share higher than our expectation at the beginning of the year. In yesterday's release, we also established third quarter AFFO guidance of $0.43 to $0.47 per share and pro forma FFO guidance of $0.52 to $0.56 per share.
Shifting gears to operational guidance. With second quarter results meeting our expectations and a consistent outlook for the remainder of the year, our expectation of same-store revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% remains unchanged. Underpinning our guidance at the midpoint is an expectation of 5% revenue growth in the second half of 2016. With strong rent growth already embedded in our in-place leases and expectations for continued above trend demand, 5% revenue growth appears to be achievable. We also confirmed our expectation of 1.75% to 2.25% expense growth and NOI growth of 5.5% to 6.5% for the full year. With yesterday's release, we also established guidance for third quarter same-store NOI growth of 5.5% to 6.5% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. This is in line with the expectations we had for the quarter at the start of the year.

The developer and the contractor just ran a little slower than what they initially thought they were going to for delivery. As we noted in my comments, they got TCO on the units of the building -- or partial TCO for the finished units of the building at the end of June. First occupancies -- first move-ins were literally July 1. We have, today, accepted about 1/3 of the units in the building. So it's still an active construction zone. The amenities were mostly completed about a week ago, but they're not all done. We're not in the leasing office yet. And so this is still a building very much under construction. And so between leasing pace and timing of closing, really, this is driven by the completion of the building, which we anticipate will occur again some time before the end of the quarter -- this third quarter."

As you all know, our ability to grow revenue is dependent upon 3 factors. First, as you asked in your question, Nick, is occupancy. The second impact relates to the revenue growth that's already embedded in our rent roll today. And the third is the impact of new and renewable leases that are transacted during the second half of the year. And so as we think about occupancy growth, in the third quarter, we expect that occupancy will be fairly similar to 2015, but because of the positive impact that we expect to see from our lease expiration management, we expect a bump-up in occupancy in the fourth quarter. Then the second factor I mentioned is the growth embedded in our rent roll. Within our rent roll today, we probably have about 75% to 80% of our revenue baked in for the second half of the year. And those -- that amount that's baked in is at a rate that's right around 5%. And so then the last major component relates to the transacted rates that we expect to see for the second half of the year. And so in order to hit the midpoint of our guidance, we'd have to see transacted rates probably in the mid- to upper 4% ranges. And so based upon a 5% transacted rate growth year-to-date, that seems to be quite achievable."

Aimco portfolio diversification across markets and price points is serving us well. Business remains good and on plan, notwithstanding the predictable ebb and flow of various local markets. We hear a lot of questions about the direction of apartment markets. Are markets accelerating based on demographic demand? Or are they decelerating under the pressure of new supply? We believe that both questions can be answered with a yes. On the one hand, demographic demand is historically strong, predictably so, and will be strengthened for many years to come by baby boomers increasing their preference for rental housing. On the other hand, all markets will be overbuilt at some point, meaning that competitive new supply will limit or even reverse rent growth. But not all markets will be overbuilt at the same time, and where there is oversupply, it will have its greatest impact on properties with the highest rents. And that's why we emphasize diversification by market and by price point as the foundation of the Aimco portfolio strategy. The nature of a diversified portfolio is that there are generally some markets accelerating and some decelerating. That's true for Aimco today, as Keith will discuss further in his remarks. We expect that portfolio diversification will make Aimco revenue more predictable and less volatile.
Here are 4 headlines for the Aimco second quarter: First, property operations are on track. Same-store rent per apartment home was up 5.3%, a rate of increase 100 basis points greater than in the same quarter 1 year ago. After increased frictional vacancy due to transferring lease expirations from our shoulder quarters to our leasing season, that contributed about a 20% increase in lease expirations in the second quarter. And after reduced utility reimbursements due to milder weather and lower energy costs, same-store revenue was up 4.2% year-over-year. These results are consistent with our plan, and given outperformance in the first quarter, make us confident that we will meet our same-store guidance for the full year, which, you will recall, we increased at the end of the first quarter. I'm also delighted to report that Keith and his team are on track with lease-up efforts at One Canal in Boston and Indigo in Redwood City.
Second headline. Redevelopment and value creation continues. Current redevelopment projects are on track to create value comfortably in excess of our benchmark expectation that each $1 redevelopment spending will become worth $1.30 or more. Work continues on 2 multiyear projects in Center City, Philadelphia and construction started on the next phase of redevelopment at the Palazzo in Los Angeles. In Boston, we have substantially completed construction of One Canal.
Our third headline. Aimco portfolio quality reaches a new high. In portfolio management, we continue to sell our lowest rated properties and reinvest the proceeds in properties with higher rents and better prospects. Second quarter revenue per apartment home across the entire Aimco portfolio increased by 8% year-over-year to a new record $1,900 a month. And the fourth headline. Aimco beat guidance for the second quarter and raised its guidance for the full year, just as we did following the first quarter. For these good results, I offer sincere thanks to my Aimco teammates, both here in Denver as well as across the country. It's a privilege and a pleasure to work with you.
And now for a more detailed report on second quarter operations, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?"
336458,369074243,1019674,"Apartment Investment and Management Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Apartment Income REIT Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Terry.

As previously discussed, we succeeded in moving 1,200 of our lease expirations out of the softer shoulder months and into the stronger second quarter. Our strategy increased our total second quarter expirations by design by roughly 20%. This was executed so that we have greater revenue growth opportunity in the long term and seasonably higher demand periods at significantly improved rates, understanding the frictional vacancy would increase in the short term. Operationally, we navigated through those additional expiring leases while staying on plan. We delivered rent growth of 5.3% and revenue growth of 4.2% year-over-year. Expenses, less taxes and insurance, were up 2.3%. We feel good about our strategy and the ability to deliver our revenue commitment for the balance of the year.
While we've seen supply pressure in places like Miami, Los Angeles and to a lesser extent, the Bay Area, we enjoy the benefit of a diversified portfolio from both a geographic perspective and at varying price points. The benefit of this, while some markets moderated, our second quarter results were aided by accelerating markets, including Washington DC, Boston and Chicago. Our 12 target markets comprise about 90% of our same-store revenues. Using blended lease rate growth for the quarter, roughly 45% of our target markets accelerated, 45% decelerated, with the remainder about flat on a weighted basis.
In the second quarter of 2016, our residents gave us our 11th consecutive quarter of better than a 4-star rating in customer satisfaction. This contributed to our renewal rent increases of 6.2% for the quarter, some 110 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2015. We saw particular strength in Seattle, the Bay Area and Denver. Renewal rents in these markets increased between 9% and 14% compared to the expiring leases. Where those leases expired and were not renewed, our new lease pricing accelerated in each successive month of the quarter. This resulted in quarterly increase in new lease rates of 4.4%. The year-over-year rate of growth for new leases was strongest in Seattle, Boston, San Diego and the Bay Area, ranging between 8% and 19%.
As a result of our team's hard work, our blended lease rate increases of 5.3% were 70 basis points higher than the first quarter of this year, all while maintaining a relatively flat average daily occupancy. Turnover for the quarter was better year-over-year at 49.3%, despite the significant increase in expiring leases. Of the customers who decided to move out, 26% were for career moves, 19% did not renew due to price and 15% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these move out reasons versus recent quarters or our long-term averages. Our resident quality continues to improve. The average incomes of those new customers who moved in during the second quarter was $140,000 with a median income of $95,000. Year-over-year, the median income of our new residents was up 6% compared to the second quarter of 2015.
Our 12 target markets had revenue growth up 4.5% in the second quarter versus 4.2% for the entire portfolio. Our top performers had revenue increases from more than 8% to better than 11%. This was led by the Bay Area, followed by Seattle, Denver and Atlanta. Our strong performers, which had revenue growth from almost 5% to better than 6%, were San Diego, Boston, New York and Greater Los Angeles. Our steady target markets with about 2% to 3% revenue growth were Chicago, Washington DC and Philadelphia. And finally, pushing out about flat year-over-year, we had Miami.
While not yet complete, our July month-to-date results have blended lease rates up 4.9%, new leases up 4% and renewals up 5.8%. July's average daily occupancy is at 95.4%, roughly equal to that of July of 2015, despite having 300 more expiring leases year-over-year where we intentionally move leases from our shoulder months and into peak leasing season. And finally, August and September renewal offers went out with 6% to 8% increases.
And with great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco's success, I'll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?"

During the second quarter, we continued to focus our investment activities on upgrading our portfolio through redevelopment, development and other capital investments. We invested $43 million in redevelopment, $31 million in added Park Towne Place and The Sterling in Philadelphia and an additional $12 million in several smaller projects and/or redevelopment pipeline.
At Park Towne Place, we achieved stabilized occupancy at the recently completed South Tower. We're making good progress in construction on the East Tower, which is now 70 -- 47% leased. And with these successes, we approved spending another $41 million to redevelop the North Tower. We also continued our phased redevelopment of The Sterling. Of the 409 completed apartment homes, 81% are leased and rents are above underwriting. During the second quarter, Aimco approved the final phase of redevelopment of The Sterling, which includes the remaining 125 apartment homes, commercial and retail buildouts and completion of the streetscape. The estimated investment for this final phase is $22 million.
Also during the second quarter, Aimco approved the next phase of redevelopment of The Palazzo, a 521 home community located in the Mid-Wilshire district of Los Angeles. This next phase includes the renovation of 389 apartment homes on the first 3 floors of the community. Construction started in June and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2018. The Palazzo is owned through a joint venture in which Aimco has an approximate 53% interest. The total estimated investment in this phase is $25 million, of which Aimco's share is $13 million.
During the second quarter, we also invested $13 million in the construction of our One Canal development project in Boston. As Terry mentioned, construction is largely complete with just a few finishing touches in progress. Our first residents moved in mid-May, and 41% of the apartment homes are currently leased at rents above underwriting. And 100% of the commercial space at One Canal is leased by a single retail tenant who is in the process of obtaining the required permits.
In addition to One Canal, we have 3 other properties at varying stages of lease-up, Indigo, Axiom and Vivo. At Indigo, in Redwood City California, the developers secured the TCO for the property in late June and the first residents moved in July 1. The property is 21% leased today at rents ahead of our underwriting. We will purchase the property upon construction completion, which we anticipate will occur by the end of the third quarter. Our lease-ups of Axiom and Vivo, the properties we acquired last year in Kendall Square in Cambridge, are now complete. Both properties reached 95% occupancy earlier this month with rents and leased space both better than our initial underwriting.
On the disposition side of the business, the market remains robust. In accordance with plan, we sold 2 Conventional properties during the second quarter for $292 million in gross proceeds, and we expect to meet our dispositions guidance for the year. Revenues per apartment home for the properties sold in the second quarter averaged just over $1,500, about 20% below the average of our retained portfolio.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?"

At $0.50 per share, AFFO was up 9% year-over-year and $0.03 per share ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range. Pro forma FFO of $0.59 per share was up 5% year-over-year and was also $0.03 per share above the midpoint of guidance. Second quarter AFFO outperformance was driven by greater than planned noncore earnings, including $0.01 related to a transaction that was originally expected to occur in the fourth quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. The property debt market remains deep and liquid. During the quarter, we took advantage of declining treasury rates and compressing spreads, pricing 2 fixed rate amortizing, nonrecourse property loans with 10-year terms. The first for $145 million, priced at a spread to treasuries of approximately 150 basis points with an all-in interest rate of 3.34%. The second for $21.5 million, priced at a spread of 129 basis points for an all-in rate of 2.77%.
Additionally, we reduced our overall cost of leverage by redeeming today our 7% series Z issue of preferred stock. We are well positioned to take advantage of today's uncertain interest rate environment. If interest rates remain low, earnings will benefit as we refinance maturities with weighted average interest rates of approximately 5% at expected lower rates. If rates increase, our long-duration fixed-rate debt with a 7.8-year weighted average maturity will mitigate the financial impact and provide a hedge should cap rates rise.
Now looking forward to the remainder of the year. We are increasing full year pro forma FFO and AFFO guidance for the $0.02 of non-timing related second quarter outperformance, offset by $0.01 reduction due to the decision to vacate the North Tower at Park Towne Place as we accelerate its redevelopment time line. After our second guidance raise this year, full year AFFO and pro forma FFO guidance is now $0.02 per share higher than our expectation at the beginning of the year. In yesterday's release, we also established third quarter AFFO guidance of $0.43 to $0.47 per share and pro forma FFO guidance of $0.52 to $0.56 per share.
Shifting gears to operational guidance. With second quarter results meeting our expectations and a consistent outlook for the remainder of the year, our expectation of same-store revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% remains unchanged. Underpinning our guidance at the midpoint is an expectation of 5% revenue growth in the second half of 2016. With strong rent growth already embedded in our in-place leases and expectations for continued above trend demand, 5% revenue growth appears to be achievable. We also confirmed our expectation of 1.75% to 2.25% expense growth and NOI growth of 5.5% to 6.5% for the full year. With yesterday's release, we also established guidance for third quarter same-store NOI growth of 5.5% to 6.5% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. This is in line with the expectations we had for the quarter at the start of the year.

As you all know, our ability to grow revenue is dependent upon 3 factors. First, as you asked in your question, Nick, is occupancy. The second impact relates to the revenue growth that's already embedded in our rent roll today. And the third is the impact of new and renewable leases that are transacted during the second half of the year. And so as we think about occupancy growth, in the third quarter, we expect that occupancy will be fairly similar to 2015, but because of the positive impact that we expect to see from our lease expiration management, we expect a bump-up in occupancy in the fourth quarter. Then the second factor I mentioned is the growth embedded in our rent roll. Within our rent roll today, we probably have about 75% to 80% of our revenue baked in for the second half of the year. And those -- that amount that's baked in is at a rate that's right around 5%. And so then the last major component relates to the transacted rates that we expect to see for the second half of the year. And so in order to hit the midpoint of our guidance, we'd have to see transacted rates probably in the mid- to upper 4% ranges. And so based upon a 5% transacted rate growth year-to-date, that seems to be quite achievable."

The Aimco headline is this. Business remains good and on track. We expect to meet or beat our guidance for the full year, guidance which Paul has already raised twice.
Before turning to the details of the third quarter, I'd like to take a minute to discuss the bigger picture. Of course, there's always turbulence in markets, and there's certainly some today. In some submarkets, there's so much new supply at A price points that it cannot be easily absorbed, needing property owners to discount rents to gain occupancy. This is painful for those property owners and their neighbors if they are A price point competitors. It is also predictable. Aimco portfolio strategy is designed for just such times. We emphasize price point and geographic diversification. We allocate half of our capital to B and C price points, which are less affected by new supply. We emphasize lower turnover and higher renewal rates, reducing the need to discount rents to attract new customers. And we invest across many submarkets, each with a somewhat different building cycle.
The best strategy is no better than its execution. As Keith will report in a few minutes, the Aimco team continues to do a good job in executing its plan. Here's one example. Paul told you at the start of this year that we are focused on the lease-up of vacant properties, some then still under construction. Paul also told you that we would be very transparent to investors as to our progress.
Here's the update. We began the year with about 1,300 units of lease-up exposure. We sit today with fewer than 500 of these units remaining, and we expect to finish the year with about 150 of such units, an almost 90% reduction, before adding about 300 units this year in additional phases at The Sterling and Park Towne Place [ph] based on the continuing success of those redevelopments.
At Indigo in One Canal, [ph] the pace of leasing is ahead of our underwriting by 6 to 9 months. The successful lease-ups across the country are due to disciplined capital allocation by John and his team as well as excellent work by Keith and his leasing teams in Boston, Cambridge, Philadelphia and Redwood City. [ph] 
We're now busy with plans and budgets for next year. Paul will provide detailed guidance for 2017 and the forecast for 2018 on our fourth quarter earnings call. Until then, here's what I see.
We plan to stick to our same strategy, emphasizing customer satisfaction and cost control in operation, lower risk in accretive redevelopments, disciplined capital allocation based on paired trades, a safe balance sheet with nonrecourse, long-dated property debt and limited exposure to capital markets, plus an intentional team culture emphasizing collaboration and performance.
The 2017 forecast that Paul made earlier this year seems likely to be roughly right. Property Operations [ph] will generally be similar to that forecast. Contributions from lease-ups [ph] will be greater based on the good work done this year that I just mentioned. And interest expense savings from refinancing will also be greater as rates are lower than was forecasted. Broadly, I expect 2017 results to be in the same range as they have been for the last 4 or 5 years.
For these good results and for the optimism and confidence that I feel about next year and beyond, I offer sincere thanks to my Aimco teammates here in Denver and across the country. It's a privilege and a pleasure to work with you. And now for a more detailed report on third quarter operations, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?"

[ph] I'm pleased to report that we had a solid quarter in operations. Revenues were up 5% year-over-year. Expenses were up 2.4%, with net operating income up 6.3% for the quarter. The rate of growth in both revenue and net operating income",537,"Thanks, Terry. [ph] I'm pleased to report that we had a solid quarter in operations. Revenues were up 5% year-over-year. Expenses were up 2.4%, with net operating income up 6.3% for the quarter. The rate of growth in both revenue and net operating income accelerated versus the third quarter of 2015.
As a result of our team's hard work across the country, we achieved blended lease rate increases of 4.1% in the third quarter. Our residents gave us our 12th consecutive quarter of better than a 4-star rating in customer satisfaction. This contributed to renewal rent increases of 5.3%, our sixth consecutive quarter of 5% renewal growth or better.
There were no significant differences in renewal rents between our A and B communities in similar markets. We saw particular strength in Seattle, Boston, Atlanta and Denver. Renewal rents in these markets increased between 7% and better than 8% compared to the expiring leases.
Our same-store portfolio saw new lease rates increased by 3%, led by our B communities with rate increases north of 4%, outperforming our As by 270 basis points. We saw particular new lease strength in Seattle, Boston, San Diego and Denver, with increases between 6% and 16%.
Shifting to resident turnover and quality. Turnover for the quarter was 47.2%, in line with our third quarter of 2015. Of the customers who decided to move out, 27% were for career moves, 18% did not renew due to price and 14% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these move-out reasons versus recent quarters or our long-term averages.
Our resident quality continues to improve. The average incomes of those new customers who moved in during the third quarter was $156,000, with a median income of $100,000. Year-over-year, the median income of our new residents was up 5% compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to revenue growth. Our 12 target markets were up 5.3% for the quarter versus 5% for the entire portfolio. Our top performers had revenue increases from about 8% to better than 15%. This was led by Seattle, followed by Boston, San Diego and Denver. Our strong performers, which had revenue growth from almost 5% to 7%, were the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Our steady markets with more than 3% to 4% revenue growth were Chicago, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia. Of note, our Washington, D.C. portfolio neared [ph] 4% in revenue growth for the quarter, signaling its recovery from a lengthy period of operating and an oversupplied market.
And finally, finishing up by more than 2%, we had New York City and Miami.
As we enter our off peak leasing season, we've made a strategic decision to build our occupancy heading into 2017. This decision resulted increasing October's average daily occupancy by 50 basis points to 95.9%. While not yet complete, preliminary October lease rates have blended lease rates up about 2%, renewals up 5% and new leases roughly flat. And November and December renewal offers went out with 4% to 7% increases. With [ph] great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment and [ph] success, I'll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?"

During the third quarter, our investment activities were focused on continued upgrades to our portfolio through redevelopment. We also closed on the previously announced acquisition of Indigo [ph] in Redwood City, California. And I'm pleased to report that we've made significant progress on our lease ups [ph] at both Indigo and One Canal [ph] in Boston.
We invested $44 million in our redevelopment activity: $16 million in the continuation of projects we are executing in phases; $10 million in new starts; and the balance in several smaller projects in planning within our redevelopment pipeline.
Our phase redevelopment projects include Park Towne Place and The Sterling, both located in Center City, Philadelphia, and the Palazzo in Los Angeles.
At Park Towne Place, we are working our way through the 4 residential towers, with construction completed in the South Tower and nearly completed in the East Tower. Earlier this month, we began construction on the North Tower. [ph] As of September 30, we completed approximately 60% of the total apartment homes approved for redevelopment. And of those completed homes, 76% were leased. Rental achievement [ph] across the redeveloped buildings is in line with underwriting.
We also continue the final phase of our redevelopment of The Sterling, where 91% of the completed apartment homes are leased and rents are consistent with underwriting.
During the quarter, we started new projects in Saybrook Pointe in San Jose, California and Yorktown in suburban Chicago. Detail on these projects is included in Schedule 10.
As I mentioned earlier, during the third quarter, we closed the acquisition of Indigo. Our lease up of this community began earlier this year while it was still under construction, with the first occupancies on July 1. At acquisition in August, the community was 27% leased. As of today, Indigo is over 63% leased. The lease pace [ph] is well ahead of our underwriting, and rents are in line with underwriting.
At One Canal, where we received the final certificate of occupancy this month, we have seen an outstanding lease up as well. Currently, over 81% of the apartment homes are leased at rents above underwriting.
I'd like to take a moment to thank our teams at both One Canal and Indigo for their stellar efforts and success during the third quarter. As a result of their good work, we find ourselves well ahead of plan and well positioned for the fourth quarter and a successful 2017 in both properties.
As to sales, we sold one Affordable community during the third quarter and anticipate the closing of over $200 million of additional sales in the fourth quarter to complete the year on plan.
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?"

Beginning with third quarter 2016 results. At $0.45 per share, AFFO was at the midpoint of our guidance range, and pro forma FFO of $0.55 per share was $0.01 above the midpoint of our range.

At $0.45 per share, AFFO was at the midpoint of our guidance range, and pro forma FFO of $0.55 per share was $0.01 above the midpoint of our range. The drivers of pro forma FFO outperformance was better than expected property operations and lower interest expense as we take advantage of the low interest rate environment.
Now turning to the balance sheet. As previously announced, in July, we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of our 7% Class Z preferred stock at a redemption value of approximately $35 million. In doing so, we incurred $1.9 million redemption-related charges. These charges were excluded from the calculation of pro forma FFO.
We also prepaid at par $168 million of property debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.67%.
And in September, we closed on $145 million 10-year fixed rate nonrecourse loan at a 3.34% interest rate, which represented a spread of 152 basis points above the 10-year treasury rates. At the end of the third quarter, we had outstanding borrowings on our credit facility of $295 million. We expect to repay all [indiscernible] borrowings with proceeds from fourth quarter property sales and a new 10-year fixed-rate nonrecourse loan of approximately $150 million. The spread on this loan has been locked at 140 basis points above the 10-year treasury. At year-end, we expect no significant line borrowings and that our trailing 12-month leverage to EBITDA ratio be 6.7x, consistent with our beginning of the year guidance.
We expect a further decline in leverage in 2017. On a run rate basis, we are forecasting fourth quarter 2017 leverage to EBITDA of approximately 6.0x, driven by the completion of Indigo and One Canal lease ups as well as earnings from our redevelopment activities.
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we are increasing the midpoint of our full year 2016 pro forma FFO guidance by $0.01 to reflect the third quarter outperformance and are maintaining the midpoint of our AFFO guidance to reflect additional capital spending to maintain our properties.
In yesterday's release, we also established fourth quarter pro forma FFO guidance of $0.58 to $0.62 per share and AFFO guidance of $0.50 to $0.54 per share. 
In same-store operations, with overall third quarter results in line with our expectations, we narrowed our full year guidance for same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth. The midpoints of each range remain unchanged.
For the year, we expect revenue growth of 4.7% to 4.8%, expense growth of 1.8% to 2.2%, resulting in an NOI growth of 5.75% to 6.25%.
For the fourth quarter, we project same-store NOI growth of 5.75% to 6.75% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.
We will provide full 2017 guidance as part of our fourth quarter earnings call once we've completed our budget process. However, as a preview, we expect 2017 property operations to look a lot like the forecast that we published at the beginning of this year. While some markets have softened, potentially reducing rent growth, we see opportunities to outperform by improving occupancy and controlling costs. And we currently expect that our 2017 NOI growth will fall within the forecast range of 4% to 5.5% [ph]. I look forward to sharing the details of the guidance with you in February.
Before we take questions, I'd like to point out a change that we made to our supplemental schedules. As many of you know, the Securities and Exchange Commission recently publicly clarified their position regarding the presentation of a portion of the financial information.

And we looked at it [ph] at the submarket level because it's important to note that sometimes supply in a couple of submarkets down the road will have little to no impact on a community where there's no direct competition. It's also important to remember the impact of the price points. And so as we looked at this, the potential impact to supply, we bifurcated it in a number of ways. We looked at our GAV that was not exposed to any new supply. That's about 13%. Then we -- the next cutoff was a 1% from new supply, with [ph] about another 19% of our GAV that falls into that bucket. We have about 23% of our GAV that has new supply of more than 1 but less than 2%. And the reason that 2% threshold is important is because we typically see markets operating fairly efficiently at sub 2% supply levels. And that would then leave about 38% of our GAV where you have supply greater than 2%. And to bifurcate that down then to the price point diversification point, we have about 16% of our total GAV, that's a B or C+ price points, so a lesser effect on the new supply there. And that leaves about 22% of A price point communities that will incur new supply greater than 2%. And I would note that of that 22%, roughly 1% of that is expected to be sold in the fourth quarter. So the inverse of that math is that we have about 79% of our GAV that we don't expect to be meaningfully impacted by the new supply  That's actually answering the question you asked. I wouldn't say that for Aimco's portfolio where we see exposure at A price point, we see it most notably in the downtown South Beach area of Miami, at flamingo Bay Parc, communities. And then also at in Center City, Philadelphia, although I would note that a portion of that new supply is supply that we will be delivering over the course of the next 9 months or so."

Now we continually focus on ways to be more effective on-site, just so spend more efficiently and we have a couple of ideas that are keyed up that we're discussing as we go through the budget process. We also think revenue growth for 2016 has reformed largely in line with our expectations. So we think that our jump off point for next year will be fairly similar to what we expected at the beginning of the year. And we also think that new -- excuse me, the renewal lease rates will be largely consistent with our model that we modeled at 4.5%, which leaves the variable annuity lease rates. And as we look at the third-party projections for new lease rates for next year at the submarket level, we are seeing a decline, but it's been a very slight decline. And so -- and based on all the data we have now, we think that the range that we provided is likely to be achieved."

We're always interested in trying to make it better. And in looking at our portfolio, the first thing that we think about probably would not be price points, but would be the quality of locations. And so the opportunity to buy particularly in locations, for example, such as La Jolla and Marine County will always be of interest to us. In terms of price points, we like the mix between A and B, and our interest in acquisition would most likely be at a B price point. But again, opportunities emerge unexpectedly, and Indigo was an example of that, where we bought an A asset at an opportunistic basis, that I think would be highly accretive. So we have that philosophies. We look at the market. We are not deal junkies. We haven't made a new commitment to acquire property in 18 months. And we've typically averaged 3 or 4 a year over the last 5 or so years. So it's something that we look at quite actively, but I don't expect to see tons of activity."

These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.
We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as AFFO and FFO. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco's website.
Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President in Charge of Property Operations; John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer; and Paul Beldin, our CFO. A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?"

The Aimco headline is this. Business remains good and on track. We expect to meet or beat our guidance for the full year, guidance which Paul has already raised twice.
Before turning to the details of the third quarter, I'd like to take a minute to discuss the bigger picture. Of course, there's always turbulence in markets, and there's certainly some today. In some submarkets, there's so much new supply at A price points that it cannot be easily absorbed, needing property owners to discount rents to gain occupancy. This is painful for those property owners and their neighbors if they are A price point competitors. It is also predictable. Aimco portfolio strategy is designed for just such times. We emphasize price point and geographic diversification. We allocate half of our capital to B and C price points, which are less affected by new supply. We emphasize lower turnover and higher renewal rates, reducing the need to discount rents to attract new customers. And we invest across many submarkets, each with a somewhat different building cycle.
The best strategy is no better than its execution. As Keith will report in a few minutes, the Aimco team continues to do a good job in executing its plan. Here's one example. Paul told you at the start of this year that we are focused on the lease-up of vacant properties, some then still under construction. Paul also told you that we would be very transparent to investors as to our progress.
Here's the update. We began the year with about 1,300 units of lease-up exposure. We sit today with fewer than 500 of these units remaining, and we expect to finish the year with about 150 of such units, an almost 90% reduction, before adding about 300 units this year in additional phases at The Sterling and Park Towne Place based on the continuing success of those redevelopments.
At Indigo and One Canal, the pace of leasing is ahead of our underwriting by 6 to 9 months. The successful lease-ups across the country are due to disciplined capital allocation by John and his team as well as excellent work by Keith and his leasing teams in Boston, Cambridge, Philadelphia and Redwood City.
We're now busy with plans and budgets for next year. Paul will provide detailed guidance for 2017 and the forecast for 2018 on our fourth quarter earnings call. Until then, here's what I see.
We plan to stick to our same strategy, emphasizing customer satisfaction and cost control in operation, lower risk in accretive redevelopments, disciplined capital allocation based on paired trades, a safe balance sheet with nonrecourse, long-dated property debt and limited exposure to capital markets, plus an intentional team culture emphasizing collaboration and performance.
The 2017 forecast that Paul made earlier this year seems likely to be roughly right. Property operations will generally be similar to that forecast. Contributions from lease-ups will be greater based on the good work done this year that I just mentioned. And interest expense savings from refinancing will also be greater as rates are lower than was forecasted. Broadly, I expect 2017 results to be in the same range as they have been for the last 4 or 5 years.
For these good results and for the optimism and confidence that I feel about next year and beyond, I offer sincere thanks to my Aimco teammates here in Denver and across the country. It's a privilege and a pleasure to work with you. And now for a more detailed report on third quarter operations, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?"

Expenses were up 2.4%, with net operating income up 6.3% for the quarter. The rate of growth in both revenue and net operating income accelerated versus the third quarter of 2015.
As a result of our team's hard work across the country, we achieved blended lease rate increases of 4.1% in the third quarter. Our residents gave us our 12th consecutive quarter of better than a 4-star rating in customer satisfaction. This contributed to renewal rent increases of 5.3%, our sixth consecutive quarter of 5% renewal growth or better.
There were no significant differences in renewal rents between our A and B communities in similar markets. We saw particular strength in Seattle, Boston, Atlanta and Denver. Renewal rents in these markets increased between 7% and better than 8% compared to the expiring leases.
Our same-store portfolio saw new lease rates increased by 3%, led by our B communities with rate increases north of 4%, outperforming our As by 270 basis points. We saw particular new lease strength in Seattle, Boston, San Diego and Denver, with increases between 6% and 16%.
Shifting to resident turnover and quality. Turnover for the quarter was 47.2%, in line with our third quarter of 2015. Of the customers who decided to move out, 27% were for career moves, 18% did not renew due to price and 14% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these move-out reasons versus recent quarters or our long-term averages.
Our resident quality continues to improve. The average incomes of those new customers who moved in during the third quarter was $156,000, with a median income of $100,000. Year-over-year, the median income of our new residents was up 5% compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to revenue growth. Our 12 target markets were up 5.3% for the quarter versus 5% for the entire portfolio. Our top performers had revenue increases from about 8% to better than 15%. This was led by Seattle, followed by Boston, San Diego and Denver. Our strong performers, which had revenue growth from almost 5% to 7%, were the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Our steady markets with more than 3% to 4% revenue growth were Chicago, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia. Of note, our Washington, D.C. portfolio neared 4% in revenue growth for the quarter, signaling its recovery from a lengthy period of operating and an oversupplied market.
And finally, finishing up by more than 2%, we had New York City and Miami.
As we enter our off peak leasing season, we've made a strategic decision to build our occupancy heading into 2017. This decision resulted increasing October's average daily occupancy by 50 basis points to 95.9%. While not yet complete, preliminary October lease rates have blended lease rates up about 2%, renewals up 5% and new leases roughly flat. And November and December renewal offers went out with 4% to 7% increases. With great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment and to success, I'll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?"

During the third quarter, our investment activities were focused on continued upgrades to our portfolio through redevelopment. We also closed on the previously announced acquisition of Indigo in Redwood City, California. And I'm pleased to report that we've made significant progress on our lease-ups at both Indigo and One Canal in Boston.
We invested $44 million in our redevelopment activity: $16 million in the continuation of projects we are executing in phases; $10 million in new starts; and the balance in several smaller projects in planning within our redevelopment pipeline.
Our phase redevelopment projects include Park Towne Place and The Sterling, both located in Center City, Philadelphia, and the Palazzo in Los Angeles.
At Park Towne Place, we are working our way through the 4 residential towers, with construction completed in the South Tower and nearly completed in the East Tower. Earlier this month, we began construction on the North Tower. As of September 30, we completed approximately 60% of the total apartment homes approved for redevelopment. And of those completed homes, 76% were leased. Rental rate achievement across the redeveloped buildings is in line with underwriting.
We also continue the final phase of our redevelopment of The Sterling, where 91% of the completed apartment homes are leased and rents are consistent with underwriting.
During the quarter, we started new projects in Saybrook Pointe in San Jose, California and Yorktown in suburban Chicago. Detail on these projects is included in Schedule 10.
As I mentioned earlier, during the third quarter, we closed the acquisition of Indigo. Our lease-up of this community began earlier this year while it was still under construction, with the first occupancies on July 1. At acquisition in August, the community was 27% leased. As of today, Indigo is over 63% leased. The lease pace is well ahead of our underwriting, and rents are in line with underwriting.
At One Canal, where we received the final certificate of occupancy this month, we have seen an outstanding lease-up as well. Currently, over 81% of the apartment homes are leased at rents above underwriting.
I'd like to take a moment to thank our teams at both One Canal and Indigo for their stellar efforts and success during the third quarter. As a result of their good work, we find ourselves well ahead of plan and well positioned for the fourth quarter and a successful 2017 in both properties.
As to sales, we sold one Affordable community during the third quarter and anticipate the closing of over $200 million of additional sales in the fourth quarter to complete the year on plan.
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?"

Beginning with third quarter 2016 results. At $0.45 per share, AFFO was at the midpoint of our guidance range, and pro forma FFO of $0.55 per share was $0.01 above the midpoint of our range.

At $0.45 per share, AFFO was at the midpoint of our guidance range, and pro forma FFO of $0.55 per share was $0.01 above the midpoint of our range. The drivers of pro forma FFO outperformance was better than expected property operations and lower interest expense as we take advantage of the low interest rate environment.
Now turning to the balance sheet. As previously announced, in July, we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of our 7% Class Z preferred stock at a redemption value of approximately $35 million. In doing so, we incurred $1.9 million redemption-related charges. These charges were excluded from the calculation of pro forma FFO.
We also prepaid at par $168 million of property debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.67%.
And in September, we closed on $145 million 10-year fixed rate nonrecourse loan at a 3.34% interest rate, which represented a spread of 152 basis points above the 10-year treasury rates. At the end of the third quarter, we had outstanding borrowings on our credit facility of $295 million. We expect to repay the line borrowings with proceeds from fourth quarter property sales and a new 10-year fixed-rate nonrecourse loan of approximately $150 million. The spread on this loan has been locked at 140 basis points above the 10-year treasury. At year-end, we expect no significant line borrowings and that our trailing 12-month leverage to EBITDA ratio be 6.7x, consistent with our beginning of the year guidance.
We expect a further decline in leverage in 2017. On a run rate basis, we are forecasting fourth quarter 2017 leverage to EBITDA of approximately 6.0x, driven by the completion of Indigo and One Canal lease-ups as well as earnings from our redevelopment activities.
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we are increasing the midpoint of our full year 2016 pro forma FFO guidance by $0.01 to reflect the third quarter outperformance and are maintaining the midpoint of our AFFO guidance to reflect additional capital spending to maintain our properties.
In yesterday's release, we also established fourth quarter pro forma FFO guidance of $0.58 to $0.62 per share and AFFO guidance of $0.50 to $0.54 per share. 
In same-store operations, with overall third quarter results in line with our expectations, we narrowed our full year guidance for same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth. The midpoints of each range remain unchanged.
For the year, we expect revenue growth of 4.7% to 4.8%, expense growth of 1.8% to 2.2%, resulting in an NOI growth of 5.75% to 6.25%.
For the fourth quarter, we project same-store NOI growth of 5.75% to 6.75% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.
We will provide full 2017 guidance as part of our fourth quarter earnings call once we've completed our budget process. However, as a preview, we expect 2017 property operations to look a lot like the forecast that we published at the beginning of this year. While some markets have softened, potentially reducing rent growth, we see opportunities to outperform by improving occupancy and controlling costs. And we currently expect that our 2017 NOI growth will fall within the forecast range of 4% to 5.5%. I look forward to sharing the details of the guidance with you in February.
Before we take questions, I'd like to point out a change that we made to our supplemental schedules. As many of you know, the Securities and Exchange Commission recently publicly clarified their position regarding the presentation of a portion of the financial information.

And we looked at it at the submarket level because it's important to note that sometimes supply in a couple of submarkets down the road will have little to no impact on a community where there's no direct competition. It's also important to remember the impact of the price points. And so as we looked at this, the potential impact to supply, we bifurcated it in a number of ways. We looked at our GAV that was not exposed to any new supply. That's about 13%. Then we -- the next cutoff was a 1% from new supply. We have about another 19% of our GAV that falls into that bucket. We have about 23% of our GAV that has new supply of more than 1 but less than 2%. And the reason that 2% threshold is important is because we typically see markets operating fairly efficiently at sub 2% supply levels. And that would then leave about 38% of our GAV where you have supply greater than 2%. And to bifurcate that down then to the price point diversification point, we have about 16% of our total GAV is at the B or C plus price points, so a lesser effect on the new supply there. And that leaves about 22% of A price point communities that will incur new supply greater than 2%. And I would note that of that 22%, roughly 1% of that is expected to be sold in the fourth quarter. So the inverse of that math is that we have about 79% of our GAV that we don't expect to be meaningfully impacted by the new supply. Now to actually answer the question you asked, I wouldn't say that for Aimco's portfolio where we see exposure at an A price point, we see it most notably in the downtown South Beach area of Miami, at our Flamingo, Bay Parc and Yacht Club communities and then also at -- in Center City, Philadelphia, although I would note that a portion of that new supply is supply that we will be delivering over the course of the next 9 months or so."

We continually focus on ways to be more effective on-site, to spend more efficiently, and we have a couple of ideas that are teed up that we're discussing as we go through the budget process. We also think revenue growth for 2016 has performed largely in line with our expectations. So we think that our jump off point for next year will be fairly similar to what we expected at the beginning of the year. And we also think that new -- excuse me, that renewal lease rates will be largely consistent with our model that we modeled at 4.5%, which leaves the variable annuity lease rates. And as we look at the third-party projections for new lease rates for next year at the submarket level, we're seeing a decline, but it's been a very slight decline. And so -- and based upon all of the data we have now, we think that the range that we provided is still likely to be achieved."

In terms of price points, we like the mix between A and B, and our interest in an acquisition would most likely be at a B price point. But again, opportunities emerge unexpectedly, and Indigo was an example of that, where we bought an A asset at an opportunistic basis, that I think will be highly accretive. So we have that philosophy as we look at the market, we're not deal junkies. We haven't made a new commitment to acquire a property in 18 months.

The Aimco headline is this: Business remains good and on track. We expect to meet or beat our guidance for the full year, guidance which Paul has already raised twice.
Before turning to the details of the third quarter, I'd like to take a minute to discuss the bigger picture. Of course, there's always turbulence in markets, and there's certainly some today. In some submarkets, there's so much new supply at A price points that it cannot be easily absorbed, leading property owners to discount rents to gain occupancy. This is painful for those property owners and their neighbors if they are A price point competitors. It is also predictable. Aimco portfolio strategy is designed for just such times. We emphasize price point and geographic diversification. We allocate half of our capital to B and C price points, which are less affected by new supply. We emphasize lower turnover and higher renewal rates, reducing the need to discount rents to attract new customers. And we invest across many submarkets, each with a somewhat different building cycle.
The best strategy is no better than its execution. As Keith will report in a few minutes, the Aimco team continues to do a good job in executing its plan. Here's one example. Paul told you at the start of this year that we are focused on the lease-up of vacant properties, some then still under construction. Paul also told you that we would be very transparent to investors as to our progress.
Here's the update: We began the year with about 1,300 units of lease-up exposure. We sit today with fewer than 500 of these units remaining, and we expect to finish the year with about 150 of such units, an almost 90% reduction, before adding about 300 units this year in additional phases at The Sterling and Park Towne Place based on the continuing success of those redevelopments.
At Indigo and One Canal, the pace of leasing is ahead of our underwriting by 6 to 9 months. The successful lease-ups across the country are due to disciplined capital allocation by John and his team as well as excellent work by Keith and his leasing teams in Boston, Cambridge, Philadelphia and Redwood City.
We're now busy with plans and budgets for next year. Paul will provide detailed guidance for 2017 and the forecast for 2018 on our fourth quarter earnings call. Until then, here's what I see.
We plan to stick to our same strategy, emphasizing customer satisfaction and cost control in operations; lower risk in accretive redevelopments; disciplined capital allocation based on paired trades; a safe balance sheet with nonrecourse, long-dated property debt and limited exposure to capital markets; plus an intentional team culture emphasizing collaboration and performance.
The 2017 forecast that Paul made earlier this year seems likely to be roughly right. Property operations will generally be similar to that forecast. Contributions from lease-ups will be greater based on the good work done this year that I just mentioned. And interest expense savings from refinancing will also be greater as rates are lower than was forecasted. Broadly, I expect 2017 results to be in the same range as they have been for the last 4 or 5 years.
For these good results and for the optimism and confidence that I feel about next year and beyond, I offer sincere thanks to my Aimco teammates here in Denver and across the country. It's a privilege and a pleasure to work with you. And now for a more detailed report on third quarter operations, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?"

Our residents gave us our 12th consecutive quarter of better than a 4-star rating in customer satisfaction. This contributed to renewal rent increases of 5.3%, our sixth consecutive quarter of 5% renewal growth or better.
There were no significant differences in renewal rents between our A and B communities in similar markets. We saw particular strength in Seattle, Boston, Atlanta and Denver. Renewal rents in these markets increased between 7% and better than 8% compared to the expiring leases.
Our same-store portfolio saw new lease rates increase by 3%, led by our B communities with rate increases north of 4%, outperforming our As by 270 basis points. We saw particular new lease strength in Seattle, Boston, San Diego and Denver, with increases between 6% and 16%.
Shifting to resident turnover and quality. Turnover for the quarter was 47.2%, in line with our third quarter of 2015. Of the customers who decided to move out, 27% were for career moves, 18% did not renew due to price and 14% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these move-out reasons versus recent quarters or our long-term averages. 
Our resident quality continues to improve. The average incomes of those new customers who moved in during the third quarter was $156,000, with a median income of $100,000. Year-over-year, the median income of our new residents was up 5% compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to revenue growth. Our 12 target markets were up 5.3% for the quarter versus 5% for the entire portfolio. Our top performers had revenue increases from about 8% to better than 15%. This was led by Seattle, followed by Boston, San Diego and Denver. Our strong performers, which had revenue growth from almost 5% to 7%, were the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Our steady markets, with more than 3% to 4% revenue growth, were Chicago, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia. Of note, our Washington, D.C. portfolio neared 4% in revenue growth for the quarter, signaling its recovery from a lengthy period of operating in an oversupplied market.
And finally, finishing up by more than 2%, we had New York City and Miami.
As we enter our off peak leasing season, we've made a strategic decision to build our occupancy heading into 2017. This decision resulted increasing October's average daily occupancy by 50 basis points to 95.9%. While not yet complete, preliminary October lease rates have blended lease rates up about 2%, renewals up 5% and new leases roughly flat. And November and December renewal offers went out with 4% to 7% increases. With great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco's success, I'll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?"

During the third quarter, our investment activities were focused on continued upgrades to our portfolio through redevelopment. We also closed on the previously announced acquisition of Indigo in Redwood City, California. And I'm pleased to report that we made significant progress on our lease-ups at both Indigo and One Canal in Boston.
We invested $44 million in our redevelopment activity: $16 million in the continuation of projects we are executing in phases, $10 million in new starts and the balance in several smaller projects in planning within our redevelopment pipeline. Our phase redevelopment projects include Park Towne Place and The Sterling, both located in Center City, Philadelphia, and the Palazzo in Los Angeles.
At Park Towne Place, we are working our way through the 4 residential towers, with construction completed in the South Tower and nearly completed in the East Tower. Earlier this month, we began construction on the North Tower. As of September 30, we had completed approximately 60% of the total apartment homes approved for redevelopment. And of those completed homes, 76% were leased. Rental rate achievement across the redeveloped buildings is in line with underwriting.
We also continued the final phase of our redevelopment of The Sterling, where 91% of the completed apartment homes are leased and rents are consistent with underwriting.
During the quarter, we started new projects at Saybrook Pointe in San Jose, California and Yorktown in suburban Chicago. Detail on these projects is included in Schedule 10.
As I mentioned earlier, during the third quarter, we closed the acquisition of Indigo. Our lease-up of this community began earlier this year while it was still under construction, with the first occupancies on July 1. At acquisition in August, the community was 27% leased. As of today, Indigo is over 63% leased. The lease pace is well ahead of our underwriting, and rents are in line with underwriting.
At One Canal, where we received our final certificate of occupancy this month, we have seen an outstanding lease-up as well. Currently, over 81% of the apartment homes are leased at rents above underwriting.
I'd like to take a moment to thank our teams at both One Canal and Indigo for their stellar efforts and success during the third quarter. As a result of their good work, we find ourselves well ahead of plan and well positioned for the fourth quarter and a successful 2017 in both properties.
As to sales, we sold one Affordable community during the third quarter and anticipate the closing of over $200 million of additional sales in the fourth quarter to complete the year on plan.
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?"

Beginning with third quarter 2016 results. At $0.45 per share, AFFO was at the midpoint of our guidance range, and pro forma FFO of $0.55 per share was $0.01 above the midpoint of our range.

At $0.45 per share, AFFO was at the midpoint of our guidance range, and pro forma FFO of $0.55 per share was $0.01 above the midpoint of our range. The drivers of pro forma FFO outperformance were better than expected property operations and lower interest expense as we take advantage of the low interest rate environment.
Now turning to the balance sheet. As previously announced, in July, we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of our 7% Class Z preferred stock at a redemption value of approximately $35 million. In doing so, we incurred $1.9 million of redemption-related charges. These charges were excluded from the calculation of pro forma FFO.
We also prepaid at par $168 million of property debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.67%.
And in September, we closed on $145 million 10-year fixed rate nonrecourse loan at a 3.34% interest rate, which represented a spread of 152 basis points above the 10-year Treasury rates. At the end of the third quarter, we had outstanding borrowings on our credit facility of $295 million. We expect to repay the line borrowings with proceeds from fourth quarter property sales and a new 10-year fixed-rate nonrecourse loan of approximately $150 million. The spread on this loan has been locked at 140 basis points above the 10-year Treasury. At year-end, we expect no significant line borrowings and that our trailing 12-month leverage-to-EBITDA ratio will be 6.7x, consistent with our beginning of year guidance.
We expect a further decline in leverage in 2017. On a run rate basis, we are forecasting fourth quarter 2017 leverage to EBITDA of approximately 6.0x, driven by the completion of Indigo and One Canal lease-ups as well as earnings from our redevelopment activities.
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we are increasing the midpoint of our full year 2016 pro forma FFO guidance by $0.01 to reflect the third quarter outperformance and are maintaining the midpoint of our AFFO guidance to reflect additional capital spending to maintain our properties.
In yesterday's release, we also established fourth quarter pro forma FFO guidance of $0.58 to $0.62 per share and AFFO guidance of $0.50 to $0.54 per share. 
In same-store operations, with overall third quarter results in line with our expectations, we narrowed our full year guidance for same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth. The midpoints of each range remain unchanged.
For the year, we expect revenue growth of 4.7% to 4.8%, expense growth of 1.8% to 2.2%, resulting in an NOI growth of 5.75% to 6.25%.
For the fourth quarter, we project same-store NOI growth of 5.75% to 6.75% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.
We will provide full 2017 guidance as part of our fourth quarter earnings call once we've completed our budget process. However, as a preview, we expect 2017 property operations to look a lot like the forecast that we published at the beginning of this year. While some markets have softened, potentially reducing rent growth, we see opportunities to outperform by improving occupancy and controlling costs. And we currently expect that our 2017 NOI growth will fall within the forecast range of 4% to 5.5%. I look forward to sharing the details of the guidance with you in February.
Before we take questions, I'd like to point out a change that we made to our supplemental schedules. As many of you know, the Securities and Exchange Commission recently publicly clarified their position regarding the presentation of proportionate financial information. In response, we revised the presentation of supplemental schedules 2, 3 and 4, and we provided a detailed explanation of the revisions on Page 10 of our earnings release package.

And we looked at it at the submarket level because it's important to note that sometimes supply in a couple of submarkets down the road will have little to no impact on a community where there's no direct competition. It's also important to remember the impact of the price points. And so as we looked at this, the potential impact of supply, we bifurcated it in a number of ways. We looked at our GAV that was not exposed to any new supply. That's about 13%. Then we -- the next cutoff was a 1% from new supply. We have about another 19% of our GAV that falls into that bucket. We have about 23% of our GAV that has new supply of more than 1% but less than 2%. And the reason that 2% threshold is important is because we typically see markets operating fairly efficiently at sub 2% supply levels. And that would then leave about 38% of our GAV where you have supply greater than 2%. And to bifurcate that down then to the price point diversification point, we have about 16% of our total GAV is at the B or C plus price points, so a lesser effect on the new supply there. And that leaves about 22% of A price point communities that will incur new supply greater than 2%. And I would note that of that 22%, roughly 1% of that is expected to be sold in the fourth quarter. So the inverse of that math is that we have about 79% of our GAV that we don't expect to be meaningfully impacted by the new supply. Now to actually answer the question you asked, I would say that for Aimco's portfolio, where we see exposure at the A price point, we see it most notably in the downtown South Beach area of Miami, at our Flamingo, Bay Parc and Yacht Club communities, and then also at -- in Center City, Philadelphia, although I would note that a portion of that new supply is supply that we will be delivering over the course of the next 9 months or so."

We also think revenue growth for 2016 has performed largely in line with our expectations. So we think that our jump-off point for next year will be fairly similar to what we expected at the beginning of the year. And we also think that new -- excuse me, that renewal lease rates will be largely consistent with our model that we modeled at 4.5%, which leaves the variable the new lease rates.

And so the opportunity to buy, particularly, locations, for example, such as La Jolla and Marin County, would always be of interest to us. In terms of price point, we like the mix between A and B, and our interest in an acquisition would most likely be at a B price point. But again, opportunities emerge unexpectedly, and Indigo was an example of that, where we bought an A asset on an opportunistic basis that I think will be highly accretive. So we have that philosophy as we look at the market. We're not deal junkies. We haven't made a new commitment to acquire a property in 18 months. And we've typically averaged 3 or 4 a year over the last 5 or so years. So it's something that we look at quite actively, but I don't expect to see tons of activity."

What does that sort of do to you guys in terms of the replacement, capital replacements, or the AFFO nonrevenue maintenance adjustment going forward? I mean, are you looking at '17 and beyond with a newer portfolio than you've had in the past at a significantly lower annual per unit cost on that? How should we be thinking about that?"

The Aimco headline is this: Business remains good and on track. We expect to meet or beat our guidance for the full year, guidance which Paul has already raised twice.
Before turning to the details of the third quarter, I'd like to take a minute to discuss the bigger picture. Of course, there's always turbulence in markets, and there's certainly some today. In some submarkets, there's so much new supply at A price points that it cannot be easily absorbed, leading property owners to discount rents to gain occupancy. This is painful for those property owners and their neighbors if they are A price point competitors. It is also predictable. Aimco portfolio strategy is designed for just such times. We emphasize price point and geographic diversification. We allocate half of our capital to B and C price points, which are less affected by new supply. We emphasize lower turnover and higher renewal rates, reducing the need to discount rents to attract new customers. And we invest across many submarkets, each with a somewhat different building cycle.
The best strategy is no better than its execution. As Keith will report in a few minutes, the Aimco team continues to do a good job in executing its plan. Here's one example. Paul told you at the start of this year that we are focused on the lease-up of vacant properties, some then still under construction. Paul also told you that we would be very transparent to investors as to our progress.
Here's the update: We began the year with about 1,300 units of lease-up exposure. We sit today with fewer than 500 of these units remaining, and we expect to finish the year with about 150 of such units, an almost 90% reduction, before adding about 300 units this year in additional phases at The Sterling and Park Towne Place based on the continuing success of those redevelopments.
At Indigo and One Canal, the pace of leasing is ahead of our underwriting by 6 to 9 months. The successful lease-ups across the country are due to disciplined capital allocation by John and his team as well as excellent work by Keith and his leasing teams in Boston, Cambridge, Philadelphia and Redwood City.
We're now busy with plans and budgets for next year. Paul will provide detailed guidance for 2017 and the forecast for 2018 on our fourth quarter earnings call. Until then, here's what I see.
We plan to stick to our same strategy, emphasizing customer satisfaction and cost control in operations; lower risk in accretive redevelopments; disciplined capital allocation based on paired trades; a safe balance sheet with nonrecourse, long-dated property debt and limited exposure to capital markets; plus an intentional team culture emphasizing collaboration and performance.
The 2017 forecast that Paul made earlier this year seems likely to be roughly right. Property operations will generally be similar to that forecast. Contributions from lease-ups will be greater based on the good work done this year that I just mentioned. And interest expense savings from refinancing will also be greater as rates are lower than was forecasted. Broadly, I expect 2017 results to be in the same range as they have been for the last 4 or 5 years.
For these good results and for the optimism and confidence that I feel about next year and beyond, I offer sincere thanks to my Aimco teammates here in Denver and across the country. It's a privilege and a pleasure to work with you. And now for a more detailed report on third quarter operations, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?"

Expenses were up 2.4%, with net operating income up 6.3% for the quarter. The rate of growth in both revenue and net operating income accelerated versus the third quarter of 2015.
As a result of our team's hard work across the country, we achieved blended lease rate increases of 4.1% in the third quarter. Our residents gave us our 12th consecutive quarter of better than a 4-star rating in customer satisfaction. This contributed to renewal rent increases of 5.3%, our sixth consecutive quarter of 5% renewal growth or better.
There were no significant differences in renewal rents between our A and B communities in similar markets. We saw particular strength in Seattle, Boston, Atlanta and Denver. Renewal rents in these markets increased between 7% and better than 8% compared to the expiring leases.
Our same-store portfolio saw new lease rates increase by 3%, led by our B communities with rate increases north of 4%, outperforming our As by 270 basis points. We saw particular new lease strength in Seattle, Boston, San Diego and Denver, with increases between 6% and 16%.
Shifting to resident turnover and quality. Turnover for the quarter was 47.2%, in line with our third quarter of 2015. Of the customers who decided to move out, 27% were for career moves, 18% did not renew due to price and 14% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these move-out reasons versus recent quarters or our long-term averages. 
Our resident quality continues to improve. The average incomes of those new customers who moved in during the third quarter was $156,000, with a median income of $100,000. Year-over-year, the median income of our new residents was up 5% compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to revenue growth. Our 12 target markets were up 5.3% for the quarter versus 5% for the entire portfolio. Our top performers had revenue increases from about 8% to better than 15%. This was led by Seattle, followed by Boston, San Diego and Denver. Our strong performers, which had revenue growth from almost 5% to 7%, were the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Our steady markets, with more than 3% to 4% revenue growth, were Chicago, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia. Of note, our Washington, D.C. portfolio neared 4% in revenue growth for the quarter, signaling its recovery from a lengthy period of operating in an oversupplied market.
And finally, finishing up by more than 2%, we had New York City and Miami.
As we enter our off peak leasing season, we've made a strategic decision to build our occupancy heading into 2017. This decision resulted increasing October's average daily occupancy by 50 basis points to 95.9%. While not yet complete, preliminary October lease rates have blended lease rates up about 2%, renewals up 5% and new leases roughly flat. And November and December renewal offers went out with 4% to 7% increases. With great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco's success, I'll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?"

During the third quarter, our investment activities were focused on continued upgrades to our portfolio through redevelopment. We also closed on the previously announced acquisition of Indigo in Redwood City, California. And I'm pleased to report that we made significant progress on our lease-ups at both Indigo and One Canal in Boston.
We invested $44 million in our redevelopment activity: $16 million in the continuation of projects we are executing in phases, $10 million in new starts and the balance in several smaller projects in planning within our redevelopment pipeline. Our phase redevelopment projects include Park Towne Place and The Sterling, both located in Center City, Philadelphia, and the Palazzo in Los Angeles.
At Park Towne Place, we are working our way through the 4 residential towers, with construction completed in the South Tower and nearly completed in the East Tower. Earlier this month, we began construction on the North Tower. As of September 30, we had completed approximately 60% of the total apartment homes approved for redevelopment. And of those completed homes, 76% were leased. Rental rate achievement across the redeveloped buildings is in line with underwriting.
We also continued the final phase of our redevelopment of The Sterling, where 91% of the completed apartment homes are leased and rents are consistent with underwriting.
During the quarter, we started new projects at Saybrook Pointe in San Jose, California and Yorktown in suburban Chicago. Detail on these projects is included in Schedule 10.
As I mentioned earlier, during the third quarter, we closed the acquisition of Indigo. Our lease-up of this community began earlier this year while it was still under construction, with the first occupancies on July 1. At acquisition in August, the community was 27% leased. As of today, Indigo is over 63% leased. The lease pace is well ahead of our underwriting, and rents are in line with underwriting.
At One Canal, where we received our final certificate of occupancy this month, we have seen an outstanding lease-up as well. Currently, over 81% of the apartment homes are leased at rents above underwriting.
I'd like to take a moment to thank our teams at both One Canal and Indigo for their stellar efforts and success during the third quarter. As a result of their good work, we find ourselves well ahead of plan and well positioned for the fourth quarter and a successful 2017 in both properties.
As to sales, we sold one Affordable community during the third quarter and anticipate the closing of over $200 million of additional sales in the fourth quarter to complete the year on plan.

Now turning to the balance sheet. As previously announced, in July, we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of our 7% Class Z preferred stock at a redemption value of approximately $35 million. In doing so, we incurred $1.9 million of redemption-related charges. These charges were excluded from the calculation of pro forma FFO.
We also prepaid at par $168 million of property debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.67%.
And in September, we closed on $145 million 10-year fixed rate nonrecourse loan at a 3.34% interest rate, which represented a spread of 152 basis points above the 10-year Treasury rates. At the end of the third quarter, we had outstanding borrowings on our credit facility of $295 million. We expect to repay the line borrowings with proceeds from fourth quarter property sales and a new 10-year fixed-rate nonrecourse loan of approximately $150 million. The spread on this loan has been locked at 140 basis points above the 10-year Treasury. At year-end, we expect no significant line borrowings and that our trailing 12-month leverage-to-EBITDA ratio will be 6.7x, consistent with our beginning of year guidance.
We expect a further decline in leverage in 2017. On a run rate basis, we are forecasting fourth quarter 2017 leverage to EBITDA of approximately 6.0x, driven by the completion of Indigo and One Canal lease-ups as well as earnings from our redevelopment activities.
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we are increasing the midpoint of our full year 2016 pro forma FFO guidance by $0.01 to reflect the third quarter outperformance and are maintaining the midpoint of our AFFO guidance to reflect additional capital spending to maintain our properties.
In yesterday's release, we also established fourth quarter pro forma FFO guidance of $0.58 to $0.62 per share and AFFO guidance of $0.50 to $0.54 per share. 
In same-store operations, with overall third quarter results in line with our expectations, we narrowed our full year guidance for same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth. The midpoints of each range remain unchanged.
For the year, we expect revenue growth of 4.7% to 4.8%, expense growth of 1.8% to 2.2%, resulting in an NOI growth of 5.75% to 6.25%.
For the fourth quarter, we project same-store NOI growth of 5.75% to 6.75% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.
We will provide full 2017 guidance as part of our fourth quarter earnings call once we've completed our budget process. However, as a preview, we expect 2017 property operations to look a lot like the forecast that we published at the beginning of this year. While some markets have softened, potentially reducing rent growth, we see opportunities to outperform by improving occupancy and controlling costs. And we currently expect that our 2017 NOI growth will fall within the forecast range of 4% to 5.5%. I look forward to sharing the details of the guidance with you in February.
Before we take questions, I'd like to point out a change that we made to our supplemental schedules. As many of you know, the Securities and Exchange Commission recently publicly clarified their position regarding the presentation of proportionate financial information. In response, we revised the presentation of supplemental schedules 2, 3 and 4, and we provided a detailed explanation of the revisions on Page 10 of our earnings release package.
With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]

And we looked at it at the submarket level because it's important to note that sometimes supply in a couple of submarkets down the road will have little to no impact on a community where there's no direct competition. It's also important to remember the impact of the price points. And so as we looked at this, the potential impact of supply, we bifurcated it in a number of ways. We looked at our GAV that was not exposed to any new supply. That's about 13%. Then we -- the next cutoff was a 1% from new supply. We have about another 19% of our GAV that falls into that bucket. We have about 23% of our GAV that has new supply of more than 1% but less than 2%. And the reason that 2% threshold is important is because we typically see markets operating fairly efficiently at sub 2% supply levels. And that would then leave about 38% of our GAV where you have supply greater than 2%. And to bifurcate that down then to the price point diversification point, we have about 16% of our total GAV is at the B or C plus price points, so a lesser effect on the new supply there. And that leaves about 22% of A price point communities that will incur new supply greater than 2%. And I would note that of that 22%, roughly 1% of that is expected to be sold in the fourth quarter. So the inverse of that math is that we have about 79% of our GAV that we don't expect to be meaningfully impacted by the new supply. Now to actually answer the question you asked, I would say that for Aimco's portfolio, where we see exposure at the A price point, we see it most notably in the downtown South Beach area of Miami, at our Flamingo, Bay Parc and Yacht Club communities, and then also at -- in Center City, Philadelphia, although I would note that a portion of that new supply is supply that we will be delivering over the course of the next 9 months or so."

We continually focus on ways to be more effective on-site, to spend more efficiently, and we have a couple of ideas that are teed up that we're discussing as we go through the budget process. We also think revenue growth for 2016 has performed largely in line with our expectations. So we think that our jump-off point for next year will be fairly similar to what we expected at the beginning of the year. And we also think that new -- excuse me, that renewal lease rates will be largely consistent with our model that we modeled at 4.5%, which leaves the variable the new lease rates.

We're always interested in trying to make it better. And in looking at our portfolio, the first thing that we think about probably would not be price points but would be the quality of locations. And so the opportunity to buy, particularly, locations, for example, such as La Jolla and Marin County, would always be of interest to us. In terms of price point, we like the mix between A and B, and our interest in an acquisition would most likely be at a B price point. But again, opportunities emerge unexpectedly, and Indigo was an example of that, where we bought an A asset on an opportunistic basis that I think will be highly accretive. So we have that philosophy as we look at the market. We're not deal junkies. We haven't made a new commitment to acquire a property in 18 months. And we've typically averaged 3 or 4 a year over the last 5 or so years. So it's something that we look at quite actively, but I don't expect to see tons of activity."

Really, the secret at this point in the year to achieving revenue growth guidance for us or just revenue growth, period, comes down to occupancy levels. And so at this point, on a real rough, rough math, if we enter into a lease that's up or down by 100 basis points, the impact on the remainder of the year is maybe $100,000 or so. So where we see the real benefit is growing occupancy. And where we are planning currently, we see the opportunity to grow occupancy by, say, 30 to 40 basis points. Keith noted in his remarks that we're up 50 basis points in October, and we actually have fewer lease expirations year-over-year in November and December than what we had year-over-year in October. So we feel like we're well set up to achieve that occupancy gain."
